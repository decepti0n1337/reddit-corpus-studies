Dunno about the names, I had that happen last night.

---
The sky walking is bc of mutations--it is a known issue.  I dont think there is a reliable way to activate the sky walk, just a happy accident when it happens.

Looks like a photon torpedo.

I edited my post after another redditor told me where to find a jar of royal jelly that DOES work.  The ones from the bees are categorized differently for some reason.
---
Just gotta find the right spot. I found a nice spot near the outer wall south if the nuked area. Has a nice stream and loads of robot bodyguards.
---
The reason you don't enjoy the game is because your grammar and spelling are so poor.  
---
No, really.  Write better, you'll enjoy the game.

Foresee and patch any future dupe glitch? Why not foresee and patch everything? Have a down vote :)
---
There are a few games out there that did do that before Minecraft gained traction. The Red Faction series did that as well as a few voxel based games. It would be nice for the concept to return.
---
Guess you missed the /s. Have a down vote :)

I played for 80ish hours and had at most 13 of one kind of map. You're absolutely correct.

[how come when I introduce the idea it gets 70 upvotes but when you steal that idea without credit you get 400 upvotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ae0wj8/the_main_issue_with_scorchbeasts_is_their_op/)
---
Pretty confident that melee builds can't clear an entire group in one swing. If an item becomes too OP for a game it needs to be checked and balanced. The nature of the TSE was a great idea to apply in the game and i'm not saying get rid of it permanently but just to target the code for TSE and choose to either delete the items with the code or to modify it in a manner that isn't unbalanced. When everyone is capable of running around one shooting groups with minimal effort the game becomes less enjoyable for the masses that want to play the game as intended. 
---
I couldn't protect the robots at the prep stage, then something happened and I was outside and had to fight all the way back down there cause everything respawned so I just quit.
---
This guy's post history screams '27-year-old incel' more than it does 'mature people'.
---
2/3 of the legendary affixes don't affect damage and it's not clear if "mutant's" affects the tooltip (assuming you are mutated).  
---
91 shots per minute.  
---
Standard everything mods.  
---
I assume no relevant perks.
---
Hey thanks for letting me know. I honestly thought it was just a flagrant display of hacking the game client. That's definitely one weird perk interaction, and one i'm sure not to forget. Any ideas on the nameless players? It was my first time seeing that as well.

Patch your face shut and you’ll enjoy it more

No to auction houses. I don’t think they fit with the idea of how the game is about interacting with other players.

if theres a way itd be swell
---
I run with two ranks of White Knight (Ag perk) and repair with rank 3 Fix It Good (Int).  My stuff never seems to break anymore.
---
With the mutation marsupial and bird bones I believe you can achieve that , they appear like they are walking in air but they are just sloooowwwlly falling down. The effect is even greater if you have the perk strange in numbers I believe for charisma. Which will multiply the effect of it the more people have a mutation in your team . You do take fall damage tho so be careful lol
---
&gt; Pffftttttttt, I guess if you want to keep shooting and missing for an hour and constantly run out of action points for vats and get like one or two shots off at the wings every minute lol
---
&gt;A lot more perks are needed to effectively cripple a scorchbeasts wings. Not to mention melee builds running mutations that lower gun accuracy and damage.
---
All my ranged toons run Twisted Muscles. Because melee is ridiculously efficient even if all you have is 2-3 points in Incisor. Damage does not matter with Enforcer.
---
None of my current toons use VATS. They all aim the old fashioned way and it works just fine.
---
Seriously it's clear you've never tried this. Try it.
---
Hopefully one of the ps4 lads can lend ya a hand with it.
---
Really dont care, go see yourself outta my post
---
Do you know where the workshops that have them are?
---
Who mentioned melee? A bloodied explosive rifle will out perform a tse rifle in a heartbeat, especially paired with the proper perks. I'm not debating anymore because its moot. All I'm saying is they should not just straight up remove items that they chose to have in the game. As I said earlier, nerfing is one thing, but not removing. 
---
Start losing? I gave up within a week. Lol.
---
I feel like this game could be great. They just need to fix a few bugs here and there.
---
Well sure, it sounds stupid if you say it like that.
---
Great Job!
---
I’m joining u
---
What plan/set holds the glowing letter?
---
Server hop until you find one where you see the "server not responding" messages. Open your map and look for 2 players in the same place somewhere away from normal congregation areas. Travel over there and steal whatever they're dropping on the ground.
---
You'll either get a bunch of 2SE weapons or enough stuff to sell.
---
ALL HAIL TEH MUTANTS!
---
GLORY TO THE MOTHMAN
---
Probably just because they were too high or something. The walking on air is kind of annoying honestly. There is no way to purposely activate the bugged card. Some times ots bugged and some times it isn't. There are times when I can't get my character back on the ground and have to log out. 
---
&gt;Patch your face shut and you’ll enjoy it more
---
Sorry, don't understand your banter, old boy.
---
If you're on PS4 we'd be happy to play hide and seek with you.
---
Bloody grammar Nazi assholes all over the thread. Ignore them bud, wankers have nothing better to do and don't care to actually help or say anything useful.
---
Ive never found a bloodied mod yet and don't look up everything online. I do like to be surprised by the creators.  I just assumed it was melee. 
---
Also, the bird bones mutation vastly reduces fall damage.
---
Let me log my mule on.  He is stuck at Whitesprings Station.
---
Yes and I hear for a camp move, but I haven't tested the latter.
---
Some.  I'm not buying either of those, so, yeah, they have me.
---
yup, only one i do is watogas because its 3 minutes of running for 40 free caps
---
they are letters and signs, from watoga, harpers ferry vendor, some other vendors to but they are over 10k caps from the vendors
---
Well shame on you for not creating your own game that is completely bug free and totally the shit to play. one that everyone can play and enjoy even uptight pansy asses and there grandmothers. and i rock in the FREE santa suit even in january.
---
Sorry to spoil the weapon for you then. This is just why I hate everyone attacking tse. Tse isn't nearly the best dps in the game, it's just seen the most frequently because of the rampant duping
---
K
---
If you haven't found a fix yet try going through your weapon wheel or swapping weapons, downing stimpacks over and over. Those buttons should still function and might trigger the game to reload your stuff. I would say try a vendor or something. I've had it happen a couple times but it eventually fixed, not for the same reason but I was nude and pipboy less. 
---
Have you tinkered with the creation kit ever? I know it's not the full system, but they have nothing like that prepared, so you can't assume they made one for this game when they neglected so many other things. 
---
I'm not saying there isn't, cuz I have no proof, I'm saying there's a good chance there isn't. 
---
Not my experience.  The Division was seamless for me, and I never once experienced a server disconnect.  
---
But I did lose interest in the game because of the extremely slow incremental increase in weapon power.  Thus my lack of interest in Destiny.
---
Where did you even receive the code?  Haven't seen anything via email.
---
"A note somewhere" is code for lazy game design
---
Give it time, the definitely not ridiculously weight efficient melee players are gonna complain about having to spend 1 agility card slot and carry a shotgun.
---
My issue is that this game follows fortnite market trends and pricing but is not in a situation where it's appropriate. We paid for a full game, it should not charge us prices like this for cosmetics. They should either make good, thought out DLC and earn their money back from that, or clean up the game and release free DLC to draw in more players. From a company this big, releasing a $60 game and then needing such ridiculous cosmetic prices to "fund" future content is unacceptable. With fortnite you can understand it because it's a proper game that people easily spend hundreds of hours on and it's absolutely free
---
Isn’t there a fissure on the north side of the lake?

i really think this should be a thing, i think you should be able to allow some people to build close enough to you can almost overlap .... sadly i feel it would be a nightmare for bugs and exploiters.

That just happened to me with some legendaries and some other crap too. I avoided the trade window until like a day ago, and now i dont feel safe doing anything
---
couuuuuuuuunnnnnnntryyyyyyyyy rroooooooooooaaaaaaaaddddddddddddsssss
---
Could you give me a vauge direction of where that is on the map? 
---
That would nullify the legendaries though
---
Daaang! What kind of character did you build? I’m 45 now, making an explosive/melee build with a penchant for heavies. 
---
Holey shnit.
---
Heart of the swamp
---
No doubt. I just meant a major TSE nerf would drive 99% of players to melee. 
---
Half this thread are folks who are triggered by a Bethesda announcement of patches to come and are already harping on details they don't have. 
---
I mean come on, can you at least wait until the patch to start bitching about it?
---
On another note ive hoarded the prewar money in case they do this. Have 36k on a mule lol.
---
They said in an interview they they “weren’t going to do that... ever.”
---
Definitely not necessary, but would be cool if they looked just a little different to match the area/blast zone.
---
I hope by next Christmas, this would be normal. I really want a giant SantaClaws spawn when you nuke a ski resort, with Radstag hoards as a nice touch.
---
Sorry don’t understand why you have nothing better to do bub. Go somewhere and fall in a hole. Just because I didnt bother putting commas or apostrophes doesn’t mean I can’t type, probably have a higher education level than you, have fun with your job at mcdonalds, and I made this all one sentence just for you ;)
---
Never gonna let you nuke the Forest.  Noobs, and all.
---
Doesn’t bother me I think it’s quite priceless they have nothing better to do lmao
---
it wont even let you sit in it right now, I tried but didn't think it warranted its own thread
---
What about when you have a ‘defend from scorchbeasts’ event or something similar where 1-3 will spawn and no ground enemies will spawn? I’m not sure about this theory from my own experiences.
---
But it would be fun if we could switch from explosive to regular. And it would make it more realistic. 
---
But it would make it so you don’t have to buy weapons from duper’s just sayin
---
True but that's fine because I won't go melee personally. However I thought about a ninja build. That could be interesting.

You should lead people to a group of enemy's then when you get shot at be a useless piece of shit, and runaway yelling save me.

I dropped it to see if it helps with no luck.  I keep some monitors running while playing and never see about 50-60% usage.  While the chip is also OC'd it is perfectly stable (Been Overclocking computers for like 15 years.)
---
Thanks for giving me hope! Will try tomorrow but so far I couldn't talk to vendors and only those item I have equipped show up on hit + items that stack. Things is I have no idea how I could stack those plans, weapons and armors to scrap the stacks. More treasure maps? :/ Oh god please no...
---
Perks don't apply to your stash box is my understanding.
---
Should have given two special nades and other stuff, maybe via mission reward...
---
It's especially tiresome when I've ***just*** finished securing a workshop, dropped like 30 caps, built all my defenses, placed a resource excavator, spent through some of my own inventory to build additional turrets-
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
... and then I get booted off before the first defense event even happens.  Now I have to get back on, piss away more ammo I'm running short of to clear all the enemies again, spend more money to claim, and then hope it doesn't happen again.  AND THEN IT DOES!  When you're trying to stockpile stuff you need to craft weapons or power armor and you get dropped 2-3 times a night, it's beyond frustrating.  It's maddening.  
---
Any mine site Ash heap, the Dyer chem, that rose raider quest has you go that miner location 
---
the name thing happened to me, found two players at a workshop, but on the map their names did not show up

I had no bounty and the other players in the server showed on map, but not these two, nothing came of it, I passed them up but I did find it odd

I ran out of stimpaks exloring the Watoga / Cranberry Bog area and then ran into multiple Scorchbeasts. My issue, at the time, was that I had the medic pump torso mod on my power armor which can chew through stimpaks like I chew through Tapatio flavored Doritos. Now, I can take them out with my various weapons but not without stimpaks. So I tried to hide but they kept coming for me and the scorched kept following me into structures. I tried quitting and re-loading in but I ran into the same problem. I was overencumbered so I coudn't fast travel either. I ended up getting out of my power armor, and stripped down so that my chameleon mutation would activate. I used a stealth boy for good measure and then just walked out of the area until I was far enough away to get back into my power armor and made my way to the train station.
---
I can sit in it 
---
Xbox?
---
There is nothing in game that is pay to win its outside of the game... big difference 
---
AFAIK, weight reducing perks do not count for items in your stash. Some junk items weigh more when bulked as well, apparently. I would suggest you cut down on the junk you have stored in general. Many things you won't need over 50 of at all times. Don't stash a bunch of aid items either, aince they are easy to find. Only keep weapons you will use, and offload ammo that you don't plan to use either.
---
Just part of the daily end game unfortunately to clear the stations caps for each day. You don't have to but with our stash limits and the need to stock caps its pretty good to do.
---
Yeah I realized that its a little older then their Minimum however their "Recommended Specs" list a Haswell 4790 Released just over a year after mine.  
---
"controls have been temporarily disabled"
---
Have you tried it wearing PA?  I could not get it to work.
---
If people didn't call it a rust clone they would call it a wow clone.
---
lol so dramatic. 
---
This can happen, it's due to weird interactions with Bird Bones and other things, although I don't equipe Strange in Numbers any more due to the glitch with it, which strips the positive effects of all your mutations away fairly often
---
That’ll be 10000 atoms.

Are you very proud?

---
Well, don't forget, I work at McDonald's.
---
I'm going to buy $50 in atoms in your honor.
---
They are just bullet sponges that provide very little reward for killing them. I don't bother fighting them, it's a waste of bullets imho.
---
Bird Bones + PA + Strange in Numbers (if it's working) reliably causes it also due to how power armor falling works
---
Maybe it has the same technology as a stealth bomber, they can avoid radar too.
---
It’s not just shotguns, and it’s not just New Vegas. This how I feel for a lot of the guns in fallout 3. The police pistol, Chinese pistol, Chinese assault rifle, the drone canon, the assault rifle, the infiltrator, the steel saws, heavy incinerators, all kinds of cool stuff that’s kind of been forgotten about. 
---
And then there’s the weapons that were fused into one less cool but mod-able mess like the laser weapons and plasma weapons. (Holding the laser pistol with the sniper barrel the way we do in game should only be possible for Popeye the fucking sailer man, it looks stupid for anyone else)
---
And then there’s all the armor from simple hockey masks to the hellfire armor.  
---
Yeah i server hopped a few times, but id much rather play the game and take my chances tbh
---
I assume you can provide some proof of this
---
Anecdotal evidence is not enough to validate that kind of Nerf claim
---
How 75% of the community deals with end-game: Ebay .... buy TSE.
---
Says the guy who hand built a rifle out of pipe and glue
---
Yeah but you can exploit this to get those little bastards on the lower shelves. Just try to place it on the floor under the shelf, or on the shelf under the one you're aiming for. It'll pop right up to where you want it. 
---
They literally said it in a patch notes update
---
Agreed. Even if the storage was only temporary. I also made plans for my turret towers so I can quickly set up a workshop. I now only spend the free green resources and minimum of my own. 
---
Have you seen squirrels? Those things are scary looking!
---
Was excited to see that black fatman paint in the atom store...
---
...then I realised it was 1000 atoms for a paintjob for a **singular weapon** I don't use. Why couldn't it be a generic skin/recolour for all weapons/guns?
---
It is such a silly mechanic.  What genius came up with that?
---
60 you say. I raise you another 20 and give you the Tricentennial pre order. 
---
What’s your GT? I’ll join your server?
---
Many vendors sell the plans. I've seen pianos and acoustic in Flatwoods pretty regularly, and the other vendors I have seen them all in at one point or other.
---
They can drop randomly as rewards as well. I got all mine from workshops or events.
---
Chad at Camden park sells them
---
Same exact thing happened to me
---
No, you get the vault upgrades from the main questline. That's probably why you think they came from scrapping.
---
The tuba chose you. It is fate. Embrace it.
---
By releasing a better game. And that's not to say fo76 is bad, I'm having a lot of fun playing it, but the numbers speak for themselves as does the media attention this game has received. Granted a lot of it is unfair and hyperbolic, but if BGS had actually released a stable less-buggy fallout multiplayer game with even have the features only communities were asking for such as reddit, this game would be GOTY contender, at least for the online market. Instead they release a buggy mess and on top of that all the other shit (bags, doxxing, etc). And on top of THAT, microtransations.
---
They'd have been 'okay' if the game had a good launch. It didn't, so now they're gratiuitous. Also just because YOU don't care about them doesn't make them okay.
---
Build the chair in your camp and require 100 electricity to power it... I would definitely do this. Maybe set it on a pressure switch to automatically turn it on... it's like a bug zapper. Now where is my 6 pack of beer. 
---
Unfortunately this would jlnot only be super inefficient, but also pointless since you’re very rarely in the same server as someone unless it’s a friend. Camps would end up overlapping, making buildings possibly unusable.
---
I saw one in the garage! He was using the belt sander...
---
Build on cliff. Build staircase down. Profit?
---
I have a ~~kill room~~ basement on my cliffside ~~murder shack~~ suburban bungalow. 
---
Perks don't apply to stash: mini nukes/missles are only worth holding onto if your going to use them at some point.  Fusion Cores also eat weight alot.  And make sure your scrapping your junk (outside hardened masses) before storing.
---
Something to keep in mind is that Deathclaw Hands, Molerat Teeth, Asaultron Circuit boards, and Beer Bottles don't auto scrap, so they may be adding alot of weight to your stash also
---
Then there are plans/recipees.  Each of these weighs .25, so 4/wg, meaning if your holding onto say 8-10 plans for vending it's a good 2-2.5 wg
---
When are you dropping? I have 3 players level 100+ to help take down.
---
Dunno, mostly PS myself these days.  Just don't feel like fighting a PC these days when I want play.
---

Will do.

Ooh, interesting way of using the rugs as a path around the water purifiers. Neat!

It would change to buying piles of duped ammo!
---
Idk if this is how OP did it but I have found the easiest way to do this would be to put more stairs on the opposite (left side in the photo) and work up and around like you trying to connect them to the bridge. Once you get the last foundation next to your original floor you delete the stairs and wrap around you made.
---
This uses the preexisting structures to get the correct spacing even though they technically don't connect. 
---
Just getting ready to go to a bunker now just had to rearm after the last fight

Actually, all of the Atom shop stuff is marked with ATX in the ESM, whereas this is just marked POST. If they were going to sell it, it'd be marked differently (It's worth noting there are outfits from 4 you can only get in the Atom Shop, and those *are* marked with ATX in the ESM)
---
This and scrapping mods needs to be a top priority.

If you don’t support something with potential, then it’ll never grow.
---
The moment a dev starts nerfing or buffing weapons the amount of other problems that arise is far worse than what we're dealing with now. Example is for honor the game became nearly unplayable for months until they reversed the nerfs and buffs and decided to change the combo moves instead.
---
I guess but if it was craftable would you really want to buy a weapon? Think about it people only buy weapons because they are too rare for them to get.
---
&gt;If you want to be taken seriously
---
I don’t think that’s possible
---
cigs should be an Aid item, and when consumed lower AP regen for a duration (hard to breathe, and smokers aren't good sprinters generally) but, for that duration you are marked as 'neutral' to insects (cause smoke is a good deterent for most every bug) and just strait imune to damage from bee swarms!

Were you inside your camp when you exited your power armor? Specifically, was there a roof over you? I lost my power armor twice (once on each of my two characters) seemingly due to exiting my power armor while there was a roof over me. However, in those cases the Power Armor pieces did end up back in my inventory, however when I went to use a different Power Armor frame, I quickly found out that it was glitched and I was no longer getting ANY of the benefits of using Power Armor and it looked liked I was running around naked with freakishly long arms and legs.

Scout armor doesn't ever drop as legendary

Syringer, flare gun, and drills all drop from legendary enemies but are never legendary. Also the pipe revolver rifle can not be legendary. Also the unique little meme things like protest signs, obviously

Let us use it to get rid of our wanted level and give the caps to the person we shot

Not sure in that case, I have it on 24/7 and it only affects me when I'm the leader of an empty group. Next time you notice it, I'd check your name in the social and make sure you don't have the "Leave team" option along with "Leave world". Every member of a team leaving doesn't break the group 100% of the time, leading to this bug

Thanks for the notice OP appreciate it.

Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
It's bullshit that Bethesda doesn't have the tools to delete or add items to inventory.
---
Complete and utter horse shit.  Inventories for games are handled via databases.  In a single player game, this can be done efficiently on the clients machine.  On online games, in order to maintain level playing grounds, databases are stored on servers.  When a player logs in, the database is queried and the users inventory is populated.

We know this to be true at least in a basic form because of duping.  Why would anyone bother dulicating things in game if they could just alter some files themselves and spawn in with everything they need?  They wouldn't.
---
The real answer is Bethesda can delete items from their database; however, telling consumers that they can but won't even in the case where a consumer is not at fault will just piss off consumers.  Thus, CSR says, "Sorry we don't have that ability," and it sounds truthful because CSR does not actually have that ability, but only because Bethesda doesn't want to open that can of worms.
---
It's not that they can't, it's that they won't.  They could delete everyone's inventory easy peasy.  Don't buy the bullshit line that somehow a multi-million dollar company with programmers can't figure out how to delete a database entry.

Can trapper armor drop legendary?
---
I put tons of stuff in the suitcase or lunch pail there when the plans get bulky. Side note I throw collected legendaries from whitespring runs in the golf bag on the golf cart by the golf club. Golf. 
---
WoW's in-game GM assistance is peerless imo
---
Yes. It 100% can 
---
Does anyone know where this is? All I’m doing currently in game is finding cool/secret locations! 
---
Hi pls can you help me to solve it too? Im ps4 player and i cant find .50 ultracite plan to learn ammo and i cant remove it
---
So everyrhing I've earned honestly cant be sold.
---
Your solution seems to be the least effective method I've seen to date.
---
Thank you for putting it out there, but I just don't think it is even feasible, let alone practical.
---
Ok thanks for the response
---
O shit bring it one.
---
Thanks for the info! I had a bunch of U.N. broken down junk in there. Will bulking up all my material help?
---
They should raise charisma since you'd be *camel coooooool*  🚬🐫
---
I cant argue with that, it is better but still awful
---
Maybe it’s not a big, but designed that way since the Queen hardly ever lands.
---
Detailed patch notes are kinda a thing that needs to be a thing with Bethesda (and any other publisher's, really) games. 
---
But we ain't really quiant, so please don't poi t and stare.
---
We're just technologically impaired.
---
I have a TSE weapon. I also have a TS weapon.
---
But I typically use my standard weapons when playing in a group so folks can get their hits.
---
Or I chuck molotovs. 
---
Considering its currently possible to glitch your camp under the map or through a rock face I highly doubt this. All they would need to do is allow the new objects to break through the meshes and to hide the mesh in the appropriate places.
---
Hey, I have played fallout for a week now and seen 1 nuke being dropped? Is it possible for me to come by and watch it fall? I'm only level 15 so will die instantly anyway but would be great to watch it :) 
---
Thanks mate I appreciate it, Ill give this a try if it keeps on! Appreciate the friendlyness
---
Thumbs up good sir!!
---
Sure
---
I gave you silver for constructively helping the community.
---
Not seen*
---
Pretty sure it's an environmental billboard behind his camp.
---
Just get a hazmat suit 
---
Eh. Possible but the strange in numbers card is always bugged out. Some times if you have it on equip but are not in a team, your mutations don't even work 
---
Yea I was thinking they could maybe abut like:
---
OO (the two camp radiuses)
---
But it’d be nice to have shared “guild” buildings.
---
I did read the post. You used a explosive shotgun. You are trash, so you get treated like trash. Makes sense to me.
---
No problem my man most of the time everyone is very helpful here. Only a few keep spoiling it and some i don't even think play the dang game.
---
I wish they would add npcs to towns like flatwoods as time goes on so it actually feels like we are rebuilding society to an extent.maybe even community events based on factions (raiders, responders, enclave) that would help build up allied cities/towns or destroy rival ones. 
---
I think I’ve gotten all of my instrument plans just through claiming and defending public workshops.
---
Nah they can just use a conditional mask for both the physics mesh and what is visible(allow us to go through the solid floor in a space where our camp is IF conditions are met)
---
Make sure your junk is scrapped when you stash it, scrapped junk weighs less. Also, if your keeping weapons that you cannot use yet it is better to scrap  them as you will most likely find another one .
---
That sounds awesome man, I’m on Xbox unfortunately but continue to do your thing! This community is so kind to one another for the most part its great 
---
It can still be sold. Just for caps and not the new currency.
---
Everything you’ve earned honestly has no value in the current market anyways lol. Old items are unchanged. They stay in the current market. It just makes a new market for new content actually have value.
---
Sorry this may be hard to grasp for some people.
---
I think it's from people duplicating 
---
So even if you’re both on the edge of the CAMP radius they are still pretty far?
---
No new content?  Just bug fixes and balance stuff?
---
Arg.
---
This is the first fallout game I've put down after less than a month. Such a bummer
---
Camel got sued hard for Joe actually, and lost, that's why they had to change the slogan and the mascot went back to being a normal camel
---
lmao no potential at all. take all the scandal away. take all the bugs away. still a shitty game. shit graphics. repetitive fetch quests. PvP is a waste of time. all of it
---
I'm on XB1, otherwise I'd join you.
---
How much RAM?  I don’t see why your CPU should be an issue - the queen loot missing is more like their servers running on an 8086 CPU.  Endless lag last night after the group killed the Queen everything became that constant spinning circle thing.
---
Even that's too close. There has to be a decent size gap between the two edges 
---

---
Can we please have logic gates so we can get the garage doors working properly? It’s a bit silly you gave us the doors and no proper way to use them from both sides with switches. 
---
Yep :-(
---
It happened to me two days ago.
---
I have no idea how the numbers or coding works, but if they adjusted explosive affix and made two-shot use more ammo it would help. They can always add ammo or mods with updates to scale for new content.
---
I also assume there will be higher level items at some point. I'm curious how they'll do it with PA. The leveling in general feels a bit quick. Balance across all stages of a game is always tough.
---
Lewisburg station and Welch 
---
indie games with 10x less the budget have less bugs then 76. even if it was flawless as far as bugs its still shit
---
Ok I see. Thanks
---
to the best of my knowledge it only helps very slightly with aluminium, and a decent amount with lead.  It will always result in a net weight decrease for the stash, but that's mainly due to the 2 plastic used to bulk being 'destroyed'
---
"  Update: We are planning to release the PC version of next week's [~~#~~**Fallout76**](https://twitter.com/hashtag/Fallout76?src=hash) patch tomorrow at 9am ET with consoles to follow early next week. "
---
it 100% applies to the level 58 bloated in whitespring, i've tested it throughly.
---
Harpers Ferry.
---
not true. I did buy the game and played it the first 2 weeks idiot
---
I have a feeling two shot will only double the bullet damage and not double the explosives.
---
Thank you so much ill have to start lookin
---
See, I get it at times if I just put it on while completely alone
---
Ok I will check there
---
NP
---
I know, a tear ran down my face when I first heard of the bounty system. Oh well
---
Vendors in ash heap are your best bet, I’ve found almost every excavator mod on the vendor in Camden Park. If you’re lucky you will sometimes find plans 
---
Here's how I take on scorchbeasts with my rifleman, stealth, no power armor build.  Level 114.  My "everyday carry" perks are marked in parenthesis.  My defensive swap-ins are marked with brackets
---
S- 5 - \[Barbarian 2, Blocker 3\] (Sturdy Frame 2, Traveling Pharmacy 3)
---
P- 15 - Rifleman 3/Expert 3/Master 3, Tank Killer 3, Glow Sight 3
---
E- 2 - \[Ironclad 2\] (All Night Long 2)
---
C- 4 - Lone Wanderer 3
---
I- 8 - Demolition Expert 5, Gunsmith 3
---
A- 15 - Sneak 3, Mister Sandman 2, Adrenaline 5, Covert Operative 3, White Knight 2 
---
L- 7 - Class Freak 2, \[Junk Shield 2\], Bloody Mess 3 (Starched Genes 2)
---
I will usually turn on a couple stealth boys to get some 2.5x or 3.5x sneak attack shots on it to start the fight, then take out all the scorched that come in to help for the +60% Adrenaline damage that lasts 30 seconds.  It makes a big difference.  Even if I'm in a forested area and it never lands, having good hipfire accuracy means probably 80% of my shots land.
---
I use a mutant slayer explosive combat rifle for long range modded with a long barrel, a medium scope and aligned mods, and an armor piercing, +33% vats handmade rifle with hip fire mods.  They both have hardened receivers.  My armor is all shadowed, with padded mods on the chest, stabilized mods on the arms and muffled mods on the legs.
---
I have Healing Factor (doesn't help during the fight), Grounded, Scaly Skin, Herbivore and Adrenal Reaction mutations.
---
If I'm doing Scorched Earth, I might pop a psychotats when the queen lands or flies in place if the fight doesn't seem to be moving along very quickly.
---
Oh wow, nice.
---
That kind of thing would be cool, but there’s have to be a staggering amount of changes to the game to let that happen.
---
I thought I liked this game but after reading this I'm devistated! You've convinced me it's trash, what glaring oversites! It's like Bethesda decided to stick up the middle finger and tell us fans to go fuck ourselves. Death to Todd Howard!!!
---
Go to both put on travel agent its 9 caps or something like that 
---
I think it's very important to define "cheating", but I guess downloading the ultra HD texture for fallout 4 is cheating compared to the console experience, even though it's Beth certified too  
---
This reply convinced me there's less nuance to your argument than I initially thought  
---
I hear ya
---
They'll do something for it. They have to. It's just not smart for a business to allow something like this to continue. How long it'll take them is anyone's guess but I'm sure it'll eventually be fixable. 
---
I think the dupers and exploiters have had their fill by now.
---
You can block folks per session or for life on pc.
---
I block PvP pukes all the time
---
there is a new scummy scandal everyday. but take out all the scandals of them trying to treat the players like shit. the bags, the rum, the essays, releasing all their players private info, the 20$ santa suits etc etc etc, take away all the bugs. its still trash repetitive quests. worthless pvp. awful graphics. audio logs nobody cares to stop by and listen to etc. thank god very few are still playing this and its selling for 20$ and they learned their lesson. but would learn it even more if nobody played it
---
Please no. I just came across my first wendigo the other day, and I hate them with a burning passion. They are the most cursed things to come out of this nuclear hell
---
Okay awesome thanks!
---
😤💢👊
---
wow you like dog shit who scams fans? there is a new scummy scandal everyday. but take out all the scandals of them trying to treat the players like shit. the bags, the rum, the essays, releasing all their players private info, the 20$ santa suits etc etc etc, take away all the bugs. its still trash repetitive quests. worthless pvp. awful graphics. audio logs nobody cares to stop by and listen to etc. thank god very few are still playing this and its selling for 20$ and they learned their lesson. but would learn it even more if nobody played it
---
As a melee build, it works really well for melee too. When it lands get power swings from my lvl 60 "All Rise" and add max strength, power armor, and Buffout, I get about halfof a lvl 50 scorchbeast's health in one crit
---
Plans would be great
---
Between welch and lewisburg?
---
I have experienced just about everything on this list. Nice to see some people in the community put this together. Kudos! 
---
Your best bet is probably figuring out which resource you want to extract and then scouting the locations on this map to see if you can find a spot that meets the rest of your criteria.
---
https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png
---
Sorry but build somewhere else.  9 times out of 10 a base there is to tag ghouls.  There are lots of better locations around the golf course itself.
---
PA Does not auto repair. 
---
are still playing a shitty game. and are adding to the player base. there is a new scummy scandal everyday. but take out all the scandals of them trying to treat the players like shit. the bags, the rum, the essays, releasing all their players private info, the 20$ santa suits etc etc etc, take away all the bugs. its still trash repetitive quests. worthless pvp. awful graphics. audio logs nobody cares to stop by and listen to etc. thank god very few are still playing this and its selling for 20$ and they learned their lesson. but would learn it even more if nobody played it
---
Name calling... Nice. 
---
Nuke in 5min. On prep bots
---
You claimed a workshop. In fact, you \*have\* to say "Okay" to this message that pops up to claim the workshop. This message says it will initiate PvP...
---
Yeah it was in the 90s (I think), but still a cool slogan, haha. I took a psychology class where they talked about subliminal messaging.  My yext said joe was suppose to resemble an errect penis to attract more men, haha. 
---
yikes
---
And as the single most secure location in Appalachia, the Whitespring was probably a major trade hub in the early days after the war. Nowhere else would have infrastructure, manpower, or excess supplies to trade. I doubt anybody valued cash in the immediate aftermath, so most survivors probably had to make do with bartering until they discovered that bottle caps were the only currency backed by anything worthwhile in the post-apocalypse. So it wouldn't take long for caps to become the de facto currency even between humans, which is probably why the Responders set up vending machines that accepted caps.
---
I’ve seen motion assist servos, rusty knuckles and reactive plates plan on that bot. So with luck I’d assume the rest are possible also 
---
I use a two shot Fatman for scorch beasts, along with the demo perk. Kills them in around 2-3 shots 
---
I played this game for 2 weeks....and no I never trashed gow4. all i said was I wished I got in on game fly and didnt spend 60$ because I was done with it in 25 hours
---
Well I see Inside the Vault mostly as a small term Roadmap with general information regarding updates in upcoming week/s
---
See here's the thing, my lid sarcasm matters little when compared to posting about a possible "stealth Nerf" that you thought might have happened from a data pool of one time....
---
In a community of fake/real ban controversies, previous stealth changes priro to full patch notes, wild speculation by content creators, fake trade exploits.....
---
My mild sarcasm is inconsequential. 
---
Your post will now have 11 headline skimmers replying in other threads about the new "stealth legendary Nerf"
---
Thanks Kanye very cool
---
RIP Server performance
---
link?
---
That is an epic gamer win
---
&gt;Can't go polluting my house with fumes
---
&gt;proceeds to put the Chemistry station directly under the floorboards of the house
---
All jokes aside, I have a similar style CAMP, but nowhere near as good as yours is. Nice work
---
It's weird. I repacked a soundmod for ambient and the main menu music - the main menu plays correctly but only after I return to it, on original boot I get the original song.
---
Actually they cant avoid radar. In the Event Collision Course they literally say radar picked up on a horde of scorched and a Scorchbeast
---
Do you know which patch? 
---
I'm not asking to be a prick. I just prefer sources. 
---
oh so your still ok with all the players private info being released? the scam bag that still is 6 months away? the nuka cola rum? players needing to write essays like 4th graders even if the mods were graphics only? the 20$ santa suits? the 500 atoms as an apology? need me to keep going?
---
There was a thread on here detailing ash heap water sources. Imo that would be too deep as inevitably you'll move east too.
---
I'm solo but i find the area east/south east of whitesprings is nice but popular. Twin lakes and solomon pond area.
---
I'm setup SE of the top of the world at the lower lake with an acid node. That lets me farm just lead (guns for steel) and crap out ammo non stop.
---
I stick to that quadrant so to speak as most of my time is spent in that region. 
---
Travel to whitespring, watoga, harpers ferry are about the same cost. 
---
Why am I continuously seeing this at the top? Are you constantly reposting it? I mean if you got downvoted one, your gonna keep getting downvoted by reposting over and over again.
---
never have played fortnite
---
I support this solution 100%.
---
They're not going to add characters. The premise of the game is that everyone one dead and you only have your fellow vault dwellers @.@
---
Yes! I agree 100%
---
Falls apart at step 2.
---
No online looty game has ever fixed duping. It always comes back. 20 years and D2 still couldn't fix it.
---
Agree.  I get that they won't assign thousands of customer support requests to their direct coding staff/dbase/server team, but it's super hard to understand why they won't develop the proper tools to let customer facing non-IT people make safe database requests.
---
LOOOOOL look how mad you are
---
There is no evidence to back up the claims that those are the reasons for the bugs.
---
But the stuff about the engine originally not being designed for multiplayer and bethesda not fixing many bugs for their past single player games are historically accurate. However, I would say that pattern hasn't been accurate for fallout76 as we have seen them fixing bugs, even if it is alot slower than other games would fix them.
---
It’s not about pleasing everyone, it is about consumers not rewarding companies for engaging in anti-consumer practices like releasing too early for more profit, micro transactions on a premium game that are just copied from freebies in a previous game, live services on shaky infrastructure, the list goes on. Video games is one market where a provider can make a huge mistake, apologise for it and then somehow end up as a net positive with the fans because ‘communication shows they care’. They don’t end up back neutral, they actually get more props for telling people they fucked up than the flak they get for fucking up.
---
I’ve made attempts to get addicted to stuff just to benefit from a junkies weapon and no matter how much I try it won’t happen. 
---
It’s only been out for less than 2 months. They can’t add much with the list of bug fixes and practically demanded changes. The game is just fallout 4 with multiplayer as better lighting, so you’ll have to get over the graphics. And Personally looking at this game, I don’t even think PvP belongs in this game unless there’s a higher risk vs. rewards system.
---
This is why I log in and out with my rad suit on when farming for the jetpack....
---
The watoga bos vendor does, yes.
---
Legal fees would cost more than what they made. Not saying it's right but they think about those kind of things. It doesn't make any sense to do that if it will cost more.
---
Estremamente good! I feel like no one plays the game when I look through trophies.
---
Trying to get rid of my stalkers :D
---
I don't know if it's actually slow or if the bugs are so ridiculously bad that it feels like an eternity. I had the power armor bug and it felt like they took months to fix it when in actuality it was like a week. Man that bug was bad though. 
---
I can confirm that you can continually farm Harper's Ferry just by server hopping for more chances of someone not yet grabbing the plans there.  I would server hop for around an hour or two while watching a movie or tv show, ended up grabbing several plans during that time from the same display stands just scattered across different servers.
---
My method for verifying which servers I had already been in was to always grab one of the vases in the display with 4 vases.  If it was the same one I grabbed missing I would then know that this was a server I had already been to.
---
If you don’t want dog food I’ll take it off your hands
---
Yeah I got most of them there, but I also checked Camden Park and Welch Station a lot. The runs were getting pretty expensive so I just did Harpers Ferry. Got my last Calibrated Shocks from there. I did server hop alot though so be prepared for it to take a while, maybe hours, maybe days. Maybe you will give up and one day when you check it will be there. Maybe you will get it first try. RNG is RNG.
---
Hey , actually i am looking for the CHEAT marker , seen photos for the ones I encountered , Where is CHEAT  in fallout ? 
---
I wouldn't put it past someone who picks up a lot or Nuka Cola. But bobbleheads are rare enough where that doesn't make sense 
---
I'm pretty sure I got it from a Raiders vendor.
---
That’s expensive. Their version was free _AND_ they got to sell it on iTunes for charity. 
---
Half the time I put down stairs I get stuck with them, because the game won't let me have any inaccessible areas
---
Like others said, random vendors in the south and east side of the map should have them. You can also very rarely find them in a couple locations in the map that spawn random power armor mods, or in treasure maps. I'm at almost 200 hours in game and only have a few plans for rusty knuckles. I've found a couple of the rarer mods at vendors, but only a few of them
---
Agreed. My pistol vats build quickly turned rifle vats upon realizing there are no anti armor perks.
---
We're on the server now
---
/s means sarcasm FYI
---
It's because people are dumb. 
---
Patch gets released.... Patch notes come at that point.
---
I found an electrofusion hatchet mod from that station vendor yesterday. He also was loaded up with halfway decent leveling legendaries.
---
im confused what do you mean by floors attached to foundations , arnt foundations the floor ?
---
Sure, but the game wasn't built to support dynamically cutting holes into the landscape like that and it's anyone's guess how hard that would be to implement. 
---
Yeah... Any game that allows trading can be pay to win. Look at the industry that was WoW Gold farming. 
---
Did you just ask why a glitch is inconsistent?
---
what is the floor made out of , its just floating there and its super thing
---
 Yes, through the door over there. Bye
---
South east, just west of the cranberry bog.  There's a cabin or house down there... Can't remember the name.  There are stairs/ramps leading up a tall but fairly small rock spire that this sits on.
---
So the serum shop is out of business? 
---
yep
---
Keep your shotgun. Shotguns are amazing with anti armor or armor penetration. Read on down in the comments. We have a shotgun discussion that you would love.
---
A real bridge over troubled waters
---
&gt; If I logged in to find all characters reset to level 1, me and many others, would never play again. A wipe would be detrimental to the playerbase.
---
Speak for yourself.  If I got the option (following a fix of course) to restart characters in a dupe free utopia, I'd depart instantly and leave you nuts to rot in hell.
---
Ps4?
---
Completely remake the item system? I doubt that will happen. The game is not doing well as it it, we will be lucky to get bug fixes and balancing done at this point. If the game was thriving I could see a revamp possible, I'm just not seeing it though. 
---
It only works sometimes because the game doesn't like glitchy lil mouth breathers.
---
I think it must be a glitch. ;)
---
Probably disease cure always, and stimpacs, or Nuka colas 
---
16GB.
---
Yeah their servers are really slow.  I have Gigabit Fiber and have loot spinning constantly
---
I can confirm this still works in some places.
---
I did speak for myself. Are you seriously debating a large amount of people wouldn’t quit if their shit was wiped?
---
Seems like the point of the game is to get as op as possible.  I dont see anything else.  End game is one boss that's killed in 5 mins.
---
Yeah, SKiller is any forms of scorched. Such as all those affected by the virus in the Glassed Caverns and all the SVQ minions she spawns as well!
---
we need gifs
---
MREs are awful. Even the consumer marketed ones.
---
Smart of WV for getting rid of em all. Your taste buds thank you. 
---
Oh hell yea, but if I’m correct it’s set about 800 yrs before Oblivion so some big cities are small towns, Like in Cyrodill you can visit Bruma and a few other towns but they are still new towns with fewer houses and without Giant stone walls. But say for instance if you have ESO Plus ( because it gives access to all the dlc) or pay for the dlc. The Gold Coast has Anvil a nice sized city and Fucking Kvatch in all of its pre-oblivion glory where you can finally fight in its arena. With the introduction of One Tamreil a couple years back your not locked into alliance areas until you beat the main story. But if you play TES franchise for story, you will NOT be disappointed. It’s not polished off like a single player game but after 3 years of on and off play I’ve only completed half of all quests and dungeons, and like 1 trail. There’s so much content it’s crazy sometimes.
---
What system do you play on?
---
there is a hunters lodge in the game that has, what looks like every animals head in the game mounted in a great room.
---
Wow, i like it!
---
If bethesda made things right it wouldn't be a glitch, i use the resources the game gave me: 2 mutations and a perk card, not my fault it doesn't work correctly.
---
100% i was there for Beta onwards it took them abit but my god you can't argue with the final product that keeps getting better.
---
True that, still a way to turn a profit, plus all the juicy xp is great. 
---
Why not just add legendary effects like incendiary and plasma infused back into the game? We’ve already got 1 incendiary legendary in the game and more random legendary effects seems pretty likely anyway. Also adding more types of ammo will massively add to the clutter and problems we already have with the majority of the ammo anyone finds is useless to them. 
---
Tbh, justbgo with an explosove gun, still op without being god mode. Plus you can get one for like 1.5k. I picked up an explosive combat shotgun and it feels just as op as any tse, and can take anything down but the SBQ. 
---
Where does it say to remake the item system? Change the IDs of dropped items after patch. Keep old items with old IDs. Presto.
---
It’s only open pvp WHILE claiming a workshop, not once it is claimed. There is a difference. After a workshop it claimed there is no pvp unless someone attempts to claim it from you and puts the caps in the workshop. For someone who started off with “so much misinformation here in this thread” you don’t seem to know what you’re talking about. 
---
Not sure, can it be done? I never tried that’s why I asked lol
---
I would also readily accept a full player base wipe. 
---
This. Im all for unique nuke areas with special bosses and loot. But what I really want is the ratling of heavy guns like there is no tomorrow. People with cripple cards or enforcer can sort of cc while the rest lays down damage aswell. Meanwhile the charisma users will be using their res and rad sponge etc more. Because the hordes will consume us if we don't work together. 
---
Yes. We will be lucky to get bug fixes at this point.
---
Like the 150+ bug fixes coming tomorrow. 
---
This is inspiring. I am loving the creativeness of people with such limited options. 
---
The other day I saw a tiny village with brick buildings that looked really well kept. I was like really curious how it remained so well kept through the bombs. Turns out it was someone's camp. I was about to unlock the door to one of the buildings before I realized it. Amazing! But what a contrast to the random hobo player I found sleeping on a sleeping bag on the highway
---
2 months ago was the B.E.T.A, so if you really mean since then, they have actually fixed a massive number of game breaking bugs and features including ones that have been around for 10+ years like the physics being based on the framerate. Other gamebreaking stuff they fixed was damage scaling over level 50, camp items dissapearing, camp items duping (automatically), some,but not all, duping exploits, fixed daily quests, fixed some regular quests, etc 
---
Yes but as new exploits, glitches and cheats become available they have different windows of time.
---
So Bethesda hasn’t taken the steps to eliminate the problems but once they become known they do take steps to minimize them.
---
A grade of D is better than a grade of F (or E), even if it’s not yet sufficient.
---
Yep they just announced the patch is comming tomorrow for pc with over 150 fixes. So really over the moon and this is what i am talking about. 76 will be ESO level with enough feedback and time.
---
I need to look into that. I do have a Rad Scorpion barrel and a Bloatfly barrel I've been waiting to try out. Might as well throw one of those on tonight. Thanks for posting that Clash.
---
I'm saying you posited a false dichotomy.  You don't have to wipe everyone's characters, just those who care about this problem.  Much simpler, no 7 step program required (though it does require your first two steps).
---
I feel that if the duppers never had the chance to do the damage, a 5 minute SBQ wouldn't be common and would be difficult to set up in the communities. The duppers just made it possible way faster than Beth anticipated. 
---
I'm sure the brotherhood did a solid job clearing them out in a couple decades time. 
---
Along side bug fixes some gunplay tweaks could do good this game. Gunplay damn horrible. And that fucking hunting rifle that stays scoped after you shot it. Its simply slugish as hell
---
It does not apply to assigning perk cards. Just like you can't increase a special stat with armor etc to assign more.
---
okay, I'm glad I can type this out on reddit rather than throwing this around various discords for a while
---
Do you play any other game that features wipes? There's a common feature between all of them that Fallout: 76 **does not have** - progression to the *absolute best items*
---
The number of perk points you can equip is not changed by mutation side effects.
---
Must be a US thing only? Don't have it.
---
Never seen either affix on a shotgun at 172. So whoops. Lol
---
Your strength in terms of perks will still 15. You'll lose 4 str worth of melee dmg and carry weight. You can not put more points into str after 50 since it still maxed at 15.
---
This is a great idea. I will be on the lookout for a good tree to place my next camp in (don't worry ill be sure to not set up in the mire, wouldn't want to intrude on your home :) )
---
Thanks. I’ll give it a try. 
---
For real? Damnit, I’ve been meaning to test crit mods, thanks for doing this. Very disappointing results :-/
---
I have to agree.  Overall they can taste pretty terrible.  But in trying times they make do.
---
Even better, i and the other players I know, would like to have a display option to display our power armors in our base like we could in FO4. Then being stuck in our inventory all the time is disappointing. 
---
Xbox One, gamertag: Pitchlink
---
Yes. If given resources you must exploit them if possible, it's the only course of action. 
---
I hope someone is given a knife and spare time and uses the resources given to him to slash your tires. 
---
Sorry there’s nothing false about saying a large portion of the player base would quit if their game was wiped.
---
That would be a solution for those who don’t care about making a new character.
---
I can  BoS your combat armout for the mats, amd can deep pocked everything except the chest rn
---
That's true but knowing that the reality  of Fallout's timeline diverges from ours....we would have cram. Lots of cram.
---
I don't know but I like BoS Combat Armor. I just need to find some exceptional legendary effects on them and then I can mod it up and it will be perfect.
---
Where is that saying from lol i feel like i should know that one.
---
Haha!  Right?
---
Literally tried that over 10 times. It didn't fucking work. You should work for Bethesda's support department, you'd fit right in.
---
Yea
---
If you're normally in PA, then weightless whatever. Heavy combat has a good balance. Metal has best DR that I've noticed. 
---
I'll take cram!  It comes in a can!  It's probably pressed ham, but it's definitely cram!
---
Trying to get this set up to claim my “I’m sorry” gift love how this is gonna be just another issue 
---
Seems like the same story as 76 something went wrong please try again 
---
As an artist, I personally liked the Pack color scheme for the Fo4 handmade rifle.  It kinda reminded me of the movie Chappie, where the Die Antwoord duo had bright pink and yellow guns.
---
I would personally love an "extra beat up" skin for my weapons and armor.  The basic skin looks good, but it would be cool to have say, a combat chest piece with big scratches through the paint, like a deathclaw or yao guai slashed it.  Maybe some rust and pitting, or a paint job that looks like it's been re-sprayed with various colors multiple times through the armor's life.  A khaki or coyote brown resprayed skin with scratches and wear would be awesome for guns.
---
I don't use power armor much, but a basic RGB palette would be nice.  I'd probably do something like the Volkswagen harlequin color schemed cars.
---
I'm torn, I love the Bethesda version, but it's way too overproduced-sounding on the in-game radio.
---
Ah buying from other players is the way to go for legendaries, ive only lucked out once in my entire time playing up to level 120 and that was my ap/explosive/vats pump action haha.
---
I wouldnt be at all upset if duped items just straight up disappeared, we all knew what we were trading for when we traded for a tse handmade. Nerfing and adding a substitute just seems like a round about way of dealing with it. 
---
We need to reset all characters after they fix the duping, thats if they do of course. But then some people would cry oh nooo my 250lv character so saaad im pissed. Damage is already done, people playing without cheating are already at big disadvantage from dupers, even if Bethy fixes it.
---
Great info!
---
Sometimes killing someone turns into a thing. 
---
I could always use neighbors. Lotta trees in the mire
---
Does using orbital strikes on a camp not make you become wanted? Or is it just the best way to destroy camps at whitesprings? Just curious as everyone was using them and thought I’d be missing something.
---
It's supposed to be something you save up for. 10k doesn't take long to earn
---
Added you, I'm Source\_Gamer and I'll be on in about 20 min.
---
There's a myth out there that there's a way of forcing people to trade weapons that they did not authorize 
---
im online now.. got a 2 handed instigating pitchfork which i added barbed flaming too.. targets bleed.. it is a level 25. It fires off fast for a 2 handed weapon, due to +40% swing speed. 
---
How many times are you going to repost this? 3 times in the past hour and at least the 5th time. 
---
Yeah but we know that’s not possible without full wipe because they can’t track it.
---
That is mostly at Fort Defiance. That event is weird. I had replied about this earlier. However, the SB in my experience is always targeting the Surface to Air Missile Launcher. Those are also force spawned Scorchbeasts and those waves of minions are not linked to the Scorchbeast that is there. I just ran that mission a few hours ago about 4 times back to back and that's what I think. The dragon comes out of the ground in front of the Fort and it shows a green ultracite animation but there is no ultracite vent there (weird). 
---
Once you kill the SB there will be another one that flies in at a higher level, and then a 3rd one will spawn in if you are not killing the scorched minions. The minions are the actual objectives to kill there to end the waves and start new ones. You can completely ignore the SB if you want to just fight one and you have the materials to repair the turret. It's up to you.
---
Wouldn't it also suffice to be able to play "ground level" floors that don't have to be rooted to the ground. 
---
Like, image upper floor. But instead it's lower floor.
---
Bethesda has stated they don't have the tools to track items individually, so I'd like to hear how we wipe only people who care about it. You want an optional wipe? To just delete your shit? You can already do that
---
I think the fear comes from the splash effect from the explosion, and not knowing if the person that is firing is a "duper" or someone who is just trying to PVP with a "god roll" weapon.
---
At least that's what I think. I also got an explosive weapon from actually grinding and game play, I just always try and not use it when others are around to be caught in the splash, as I don't want to PVP and even have Pacifist Mode on.
---
Just my two cents
---
Yep, I was trying giving away 800 something rounds of .38 . Dropped them in front of a couple of people before someone actually picked them up. Maybe if the Mr. h5andy out front of the vault dropped his stuff in a bag more beginners would understand? 
---
The first time I saw one it was for someone else and I was right next to it when it landed. I was like WTF? I tried to open it but it was clear I would not be able to. Shortly thereafter, someone ran over and opened. It was pretty cool. Now I've had two of them get launched to me and both times it was still neat.
---
Not sure if I'm happy about them fixing 150 issues, or dissapointed that there were 150 issues that needed to be fixed.... 
---
Please don’t start the trade stealing falsehood. It was never proven.  You probably just sold them by mistake. It is easy to do. 
---
Eh. That's flimsy at best. Killing someone requires no interaction or menu opening, etc. So I am unsure how shooting someone in the face could force this sort of trade. 
---
I think if you can’t figure out a concept as basic as fast travel you should probably stop playing video games
---
Only bulk aluminum and lead. 
---
Sigh.  A "false dichotomy" is where you argue that we need to choose option A because the alternative is B and that's worse, but in reality there are other options like C and D which need to be considered too.
---
It's a kind of logical fallacy.  I'm not calling you a liar.
---
Kill mole miners and scrap their weapons. And getting 4x yield from mining with excavator armor. Then smelting that with super duper equipped. Finding a decent spot for iron ore is still proving hard. Have to travel or hop for ore. Or build your camp on an iron ore deposit.
---
These people are wrong. I've done extensive testing on this issue and generate 5k+ caps per hour farming.  I also know a workaround that generates the plans at the default rate (from my experience about 20-50% chance for most spots, average around 1 in 3 per spot).  
---
They are just getting lucky because someone else loaded the cell before they got there. Once you grab a spot, there is a 24+ hr cooldown before it will spawn for you again. This is especially common in farming spots: Harper's Ferry being a good example. People reload the vendor all the time and don't necessarily check the plan spawns, so there are leftovers for you to find.
---
Does reposting to get traction offend you or something?
---
While I have you here. Anything meaningful to add?
---
Craigslist vibes I like it. This whole community is beautiful ♥️
---
If someone shoots me and has a bounty and obviously wants me to fight back I have to go into my perks and move cards around. By the time I've got everything sorted they are on the other side of the map and I'm overencumbered.
---
I looked at your past posts.. selling TSEs and server hopping for items to sell. Quit ruining the game for us legitimate players. 
---
That's speculation though, I would bet there is a id for a item
---
I'll add that spam is against the sub rules 
---
Did they not come up and attempt to claim it from you?
---
I see lots of posts on the subreddit complaining about 'getting OHKOd' randomly, but I've yet to see any proof about this sort of stuff happening short of someone using the bobblehead glitch.
---
Each item shares the same ID per item. There’s no difference.
---
 You become wanted very quickly. But these camps need to stop. 
---
We nuked Wavy Willard’s lastnight for something different... sadly it was disappointing. But we did get a few legendary’s to spawn at the Willard Corp housing. I think the nuking dynamic could easily summon a few waves of ghouls to any site that gets nuked. I understand that WW is more of low level area but the nuking of said area should automatically increase the amount of enemies and level of enemies ... seems like an easy fix to keep people interested in “end game” content.
---
I'm outside the US also, were you able to install the games individually from the menu? I redeemed the free individual games but it wasn't bundled.
---
You are right, shotguns are only one aspect, i just chose my perspective here. Fo76 has toned down a lot of weapons. In theory, the legendary effects allow for far more weapons, like the otherwise weak police and chinese pistol you mentioned, to become viable weapons and therefore justifies their existence: the weaker pistols might be irrelevant as soon you find a 10mm pistol, but a two shot police pistol you get from a random drop could easily outperform a 10mm even mid - late game.
---
PSA: Vending machine prices are affected by charisma, hard bargain and grape mentats.
---
Oh yeah that’s why I said it was a double standard I was applying about vendors.  I know they will occasionally probably haves duped stuff but it’d still be pretty damn lucky to see one on an in game vendor
---
Proof? or is that what you heard on youtube?
---
Yes, someone please. I've had this quest forever and can't clear it.
---
Maybe they can make it so you and your wife can smoke in bed , fall asleep and burn down your camp. 
---
There is a list in the challenges menu that tells you the locations. But there arent map markers or anything with the quest. You kinda just find them while doing other quests.
---
He's duping his own post. 
---
Camden vendor has them too. 
---
Duper activates 200 damage boating bobbleheads and magazines. 
---
Downs SBQ.
---
Has nothing better to do while being buffed than troll other players with 5000 points of "slap damage".
---
It just works, right.  Todd?
---
I was using Marine for a while, with deeps pockets, for when I was not in PA. Lately I've spent most of my time in PA. and have begun collecting the correct Legendary BOS Combat Armor with Deep Pockets. I try and keep my carry weight under 320 so I can either be in PA or out of it without being over encumbered. Guess it comes down to your play style and build
---
It’s in the game files. Each item has an ID, there’s no difference between two items with the same ID.
---
Not enough acid? How? Bulk it, scrap it, you'll see.
---
Welp RIP fallout 76 because it's not gonna last.
---
I may be incorrect, but it's my understanding that the mobs don't scale with your character level in FO76. Supposedly they're static level for the areas they're in - similar to how World of Warcraft mobs were based on location and not character level because it'd be too complicated to code the game so the mobs all scaled to every player in real time. 
---
You know that Marxist communism is an idea where all members of a society share and distribute wealth equally?  Sounds to me like that base is designed for capitalism.
---
Hmmm...it doesn't sound like him to me although I love Stephen Russell's work in Fallout 76.
---
If you are talking about the vanilla FO76 game, then yes. All the skins can be earned through challenges for atoms to be bought in the atom store.
---
Honestly, at this point I avoid PvP unless people attack me because the system isn't well designed. I'm not going to attack someone unless I *will* do damage to them, so I'm not initiating, otherwise I attack them, they turn around and blast me away with whatever.
---
I’d love to smoke in game. I’m not a smoker in life, never.
---
But You all know that they seriously can’t let people smoke in games? 
---
Which I agree since we can drink. But eating and drinking don’t have animations to them. Still its silky one is ok the other isn’t.
---
But we all get that it would be s terrible PR nightmare. Right?
---
Have you tried trading with other people?
---
&gt;  I'd like to hear how we wipe only people who care about it
---
Uh... by starting all new characters in the dupe-free new universe and leaving all the existing ones in the old one, maybe with a option where you can start a new character in the old universe if you really want to.
---
Doesn't seem like rocket surgery here.
---
Oh shit a duper in our midst trying to blend in!
---
Nah. It stays with you
---
https://youtu.be/UPp320ENrQY
---
The drop lists for these care packages are terrible. 
---
I did have a cement barrier completely destroyed.  It was not there.  But it did have the ghosted green color and the option to repair it.  That was not the same case for the missile turrets.  My generators and the wires were there though.  The wires were just connected to air.
---
robobrain so far
---
Awesome thank you!
---
No, people underestimate the damage possible in this game.  You don't need explosive to oneshot most things.  Explosive is just the most build-free way to do it.
---
It’s not spam though if it’s a different title with different context each time. You can report me if you like and let a mod handle it.
---
I am also looking for the big green pew-pew, no luck so far though . . .
---
Its when trading with people it's myth so it's not real
---
Scout armor has a nice combination of accessibility, low weight, and good protection, with the emphasis on DR.   
---
Its downsides are cost since it never drops apart from enclave events and the mods cannot be learned, they must be bought from the enclave. And to make it slightly more infuriating the polymer mods (which offer the best resistance for Scout Armor) dont specify which pieces they can be attached to, so you can buy a polymer mod but it might not be for the armor piece you need. 
---
Is it unable to fly if you cripple the wing?
---
Everyone is just afraid you have a duped TSE explosive weapon and a crap load of bobbleheads stacked, just looking for someone to hit you so you can strike back.
---
Now your just making stuff up, you cant access those files, cause they are on bethesda servers. Data mining maybe but ive yet to here anything about it.
---
I had claimed the workshop already and had just did the “Defend” event against mole rats. They did not use the workshop or initiate pvp through the workshop and I never attacked them. Attacking someone who has a workshop is not the condition to challenge someone to get a workshop and does not set that person to pvp. 
---
One of my favorite things of FO76 is when someone has a C.A.M.P. an you are walking nearby and stop to use their benches, they either welcome you with a wave or a thumbs up. I've even had people offer Purified Water and scrap. I don't think yet I've encountered someone who was mean or attacked just cause I stopped to use a bench or repair some PA
---
From what a lot of snipers including myself have experienced, is that the minions will die but if the SB doesnt have a target to dash attack at then it may not land if you are not in range. I was explaining this effect as the orbital strike effect. It's like those grenades that scan the area from the satellite and mark all living creatures. If the SB cant detect you, it may not land. However, if it has any aggro to your and its blasting waves or strafing gas at you, then it will more likely land with this method. 
---
When I was sniping, I noticed that with the Long range perks and all the long barrels and sights that sometimes even when they were in perfect line of sight that the range of the weapon wouldn't be close enough. I would love to figure out exact ranges for sniper setups and what 100 range is versus 500 range. There is no bullet drop, but there is server lag so when they are off in the distance I've aimed ahead of them like in real life and it does work.
---
Yeah but my luck is that whenever I have to defend against scorchbeasts at the munitions factory, it's not one, not two, but three of them. It's nearly impossible. 
---
If you struggle to find anyone giving one for free on your platform. There's a guaranteed handmade rifle spawn that scales to your level in Berkeley Springs, north of the town on a rooftop with a fire escape style stairway leading up to it. It's inside a little wooden shack on a shelf next to an ammo container, you can't miss it!
---
Rabbit for sure.  It's unarmored with probably 0 DR.  You could probably kill it with one punch as an unarmed lvl 1 fresh out of the vault.  At least the eyebot probably has some DR and energy resist.
---
Thanks
---
I did that already lol
---
Either you drop it or place it. If you place it, it will recall. If you drop it, anyone can take it and it will be gone if you leave the server. 
---
Short answer, don't leave it at a station. 
---
It will recall.
---
I just want to see video of this. I never see anyone using that :)
---
The guy got killed the by robots xD
---
I do the mole miner scrap, but finding ore deposits is hard, I’m heavy gunner so it’s annoying
---
It will recall. No PA camp decorations unfortunately.
---
one occasionally spawns on top of the spa at the end of town in Berkley Springs.
---
With their current server stability and how messy the friends system already is, this sounds like a disaster for something that can be addressed by balance changes &amp; bugfixing.
---
Plus, this splits your player base from people who don't feel like losing hundreds of hours of progress from the other half of people who will actually play. Dangerous idea for the game's already seemingly small community.
---
Plus, without any changes on how currency works in-game you will have the exact same problem of hyperinflation, duping or not, in enough time. 
---
Why bye bye marsupial :(
---
It scraps hardened masses, it’s moronic.  Why aren’t they in AID like the rest of the flux mats and unstable flux.
---
What happens if you Nuke a Place with a Running Event?
---
If someone asked me to kill them to clear their bounty then I would do it but I would ensist on beating you to death with my bare hands. So I don't see what the deal was with you asking. But if there wasnt a mic I would assume the bounty was accidental. I'd ignore it, like I usually do, or think you were trying to pull me into a PvP kill off or something if you were jumping around trying to instigate.
---
Did it have big fangs?
---
The only way I can think of then is he's got to be using the bobblehead glitch, which I would hope is patched tomorrow.
---
Who cares? Those games are freeware anyway. They gave you free fucking games. Just download it elsewhere.
---
Man...F, we should probably all delete the game then
---

1) Controls: I mapped VATS on "X". Now, if i select something in the quick menu (inventory and emotes) with "X", it selects correct, but also opens VATS.
---
2) Perks: Pharmacist Lvl 3 does not let you craft antibiotics. and if equipped, Home Defense is not  registered: i can't build advanced turrents, till i unequip Pharmacist.
---
Will make sure to check
---
I've had someone do what you said and then they were able to seek revenge and kill me for more caps than I got from them.....
---
I don't think that's a "normal* thing, though. I think 76ers just don't give a damn about other players.
---
Mutations are buffs, much like chems essentially but a perpetual status. 
---
Sounds like you just have to hit things quicker. 
---
I had the same problem. Though i purposely did a orbital strike on someones base behind whitprings with turrents. 4hrs of asking someone to kill me someone did. 
---
Now this is an improvement!  Thank you for the update Bethesda.  To see they edited it after the mediocre response shows that they care enough to improve it.
---
&lt;3
---
I think maybe you are missing the fact that I am already a wanted player at this point. So there shouldn't be any mutual combat restrictions. Someone should just be able to take out whatever favorite weapon they have and unload. Am I mistaken there? The mutually agreed combat thing is only if both players are neutral.
---
I am saying that stealth boys must use same tech as stealth bomber silly.
---
Drop any dogwood you have in a bag. Try to craft a filter, there should be a menu selection that allows you to mark the missing items. Mark dogwood for search. Pick up one of the dogwoods from the bag it should be marked with a magnifying glass in the junk tab. Scrap all junk ”should” ignore the dogwood, you can scrap it by hand. I'm not online and can't test it. Good luck, let me know if it works.
---
I’m referencing IDs from FO4. I doubt they reworked the whole item system to not have a single ID. Proof is pretty much that they haven’t done anything about duped items and are unable to replace items.
---
Only thing I think that has been changed now is that it’s serverside.
---
Gorge Workshop? It's in the Forest directly South of a Garage on the road to Morgantown/Grafton.
---
X2 lol
---
Yes. Mods aren't removed like in Fallout 4. They are just over written and vanish.
---
Do yourself a favor and buy serums for what you want.
---
1) it isn't a huge time sync farming mutations
---
2) you get no negative effects for one hour with the ability to reset the timer at any time
---
Double shock Excavator bro.  I hope you have speed demon at least, that helps it feel tolerable when walking
---
I would literally kill for a Blue Star bottlecap.
---
But you often still spend some of your own. I usually spend 12 nuclear to get the power I need. Its not a big deal, but when your low it can be. Its worse if the DC happens right after you set up the work shop. 
---
By "left of entrance" do you mean east or west of the entrance?
---
Thanks!
---
+Karma
---
Unfortunately this is a multiplayer gameservice they can't just build for the easily amused and expect the rest of us to mod it to our tastes they actually have to try to appease more discerning customers.
---
 trying to farm that sweet karma... gonna get burned instead. 
---
Well some might be minor.  To be honest the number isnt really what matters.  Either way an improvement of bug fixes is always welcome. 😊
---
Then you are a hero, not a terrorist. I am so tired of the crap camps at White Springs with all of their turrets.
---
quit spamming this drivel
---
That's communists for us*, comrade.
---
How many times did you do them? To get it you need to do Poseidon three times.. First you'll get the large generator, second the wind Mill and third is the fusion generator.
---
Personally, red dress, fashionable glasses, sun hat.
---
Strange In Numbers is a buggy card, sometimes taking away your positive effects entirely. It'll be fixed on the 14th likely
---
Its on them - total BS what they're telling you but those guys are just mindless support people running off scripts, they don't know any better.
---
Options C and D include balancing the game's weapons rather than just saying "Let's start fresh with no dupers but still the same broken explosive guns"
---
If the duped guns aren't as crazy OP, what's the point? There already isn't a limit or any form of scarcity in the game's economy, literally, everything is in infinite supply
---
Had anyone found a fix to this yet? I have the same problem. I'd love to talk to other people in the game and not just my friends on PS4 party chat.
---
they don't stop sound so I don't see why Scorchbeasts can't pick up
---
Will start loosing players.... That was a good one 
---
Bro your camp is your baby! Low level I move minearoundalot because I power through and don’t like to stop, always having worbenches close by. my main has the junk and lead node in toxic valley and it stays there, need those bullets for my heavy gun build.
---
If that is the case, that is really bad online game development. There still isnt any proof of that. Ill stop posting under this reply
---
I have 100s of maps on me without duping, I came by them too often...and because the rewards in my opinion are not worth it, every couple of weeks I just purge the maps from my inventory.
---
Dying is no great loss. I have performed several mercy killings, not all had speakers but request was made clear. The annoying part is forgetting pacifist mode is on. Fortunately have not had anyone use it to attack me yet. If you aren't  sure ask them to fast travel with you to nearest train station or red rocket, deposit junk then put them out of their misery.
---
There is a map in a watchtower with the nukable zones and safe zones marked.  I found it early game and only build my C.A.M.P. in the safe zone.
---
Over 10 times each and no Gen 
---
And this is why you don't rush a buggy gaas out before the holidays
---
I think you're better off avoiding it on consoles.
---
I like the game, but my performance issues even on a beefed up PC have me worried combined with the posts I read about the console issues.
---
A METRIC CRAPTON OF OTHER POSTS DIDN'T ALREADY TELL ME THIS, SO THANKS SO MUCH CAPTAIN OBVIOUS
---
Accurate. Once you're Wanted someone can fire at will and one-shot you even without legendaries.
---
Sentinel and Assassin's can set up a pretty good player trap, though.
---
Foundations are the large, blocky first 'floor' you have to put down. After that you use thinner floors for second+ stories. However, the floors (IE: non-foundation floors) don't snap to foundation edges or walls. So usually you have to use stairs to create an area to snap them to, then snap more floors to other floors.
---
Ask again on the 15th after the latest patch. Right now the game is unstable thanks to dupers. Fucking cheaters need a swift kick to the nuts. 
---
Oh damn. 
---
^ Legend 
---
Do I have to pick one of your daughters for a "red wedding" if I need to use your camp to cross the irradiate waters? 
---
I hope so... Ive been servee hopping for hours and still cant find these damn barn plans...
---
Yeh I have a simple camp set up just above morgantown airport with my stash and some workbenches which I haven’t came to use yet 
---
Glad you're enjoying yourself! Just a heads up the 20s can be a struggle and frustrating. Just push through and the 30s on will be fun again.
---
Yeah looks like I can do it individually... its not a single collection.
---
Why are there pre war vending machines full of rad-away? Who was selling bullets like they were cigarettes in the 1980s?
---
Or, he was powerful enough to ignore my virtually non existent armor and my already lowered health and killed me because he was a vastly higher level with superior weapons. Which is hardly a stretch. Assuming it must be a glitch is rediculous. I get it, you think you know everything even when all your “arguments” are invalid. But you’re clutching at straws. Especially when you’re even accepting the notion of a one hit kill glitch while trying to state that nobody should die from being attacked by another player. Particularly when the op already said it was multiple swings that killed her. Unsure if you’re ignorant or just arrogant at this point. However I’ll let you get on with your day as your words have been continually shown to hold no weight. Enjoy the rest of your day
---
If I cared about karma I’d have more than 5k in 3 years.
---
I really want a Mr freeze PA paint so I can channel my inner Schwarzenegger.
---
Yeah why I’m honestly asking for any help lol I’ll even pay caps for the plan lol just can’t get it
---
Nope this game taught them to bitch early and bitch often cause they can't trust bethesda not to make the cartoonishly worst decisions any more.
---
I’ve seen a few sets of just power armour frames and was wondering if I should take one and leave it in my camp to add to over time?
---
&gt;Wtf i love bethesda now
---
You're part of the problem. Wait and see if this actually does fix things, or things that matter. 
---
They don't really take up any budget. Basic enough items. I too use 5 poles to "hold up" a balcony
---
It will show up in the ULTRACITE WEAPONS section at the bottom
---
Well as long as I'm not intruding id be happy to be your neighbour! :)
---
I'm saying this because I've tried for hours to PvP and I haven't killed anyone who didn't attack back, and I've got a build capable of throwing out *more* than enough damage to one shot players
---
All I'm asking is for fucking proof of people actually getting ganked because like the trade steal glitch, there isn't any of it here either
---
Every game has this point
---
How many hours did you get?
---
Why do Stealth Bombers avoid radar?  Some say alien tech.
---
\#5 "There goes the neighborhood!"
---
Can you elaborate why it’s drivel? :D
---
Use your workbenches for mainly scrapping, and scrap a lot. You get weapon mods by scrapping weapons so pick up all those shitty guns you don’t want and scrap em for mods to use later. Early on pick up a lot of junk! Pencils typewriters pens plastic plates everything man, and don’t hold back on the steel, you have no idea how much steel you use lol.
---
I leave stuff in the big blue suitcase, because it seems more obvious.  Usually just scrap and food I don't need, or heavy legendary stuff like guns and two handed weapons.  I do pick up high end sledge and super sledge mods and leave them, too.  I use rifles, but I imagine a melee somewhere will make good use of it.  
---
I was vendoring at Harper's Ferry with a lvl 40-ish running around slaying mobs and exploring.  He asked if there was a crafting station nearby, so I showed him the chem bench right near the vendor and mentioned that I'd be leaving all my extra stuff in the cash register after I finished selling.  I left piano plans in there and he was really psyched on that.
---
I always hang on to every plan or recipe I find and deposit them in a cash register or blue suitcase at a common vending spot, because you never know what people will need with the RNG system.
---
Uh ew no those are the most common in the game 
---
Ah I see it now. Had me so excited for a second. :C
---
The bots did the work lol. Scorchbeasts are easy though if your perks arnt a mess
---
Now everyone can fly!
---
people buy them, no one asked ur opinion? 
---
Are you sure? My brother and I tried using it (on low level enemies) and it did seem to work
---
This is a problem. Wanted players should not be allowed to seek revenge. As I rarely become wanted, I didn't even know that was a thing. This could also be the explanation for why nobody wants to engage.
---
got 7 bulk steel and 4 bulk wood :)
---
it's seven incredibly stupid ideas.  each, individually, is capitally stupid.  the 7 together are a giant monument to stupidity.
---
Honestly, I think the kind of people who enjoy crunching numbers and datamining are also the most likely people to rapidly get fed up with the game, so the progress on third-party documentation has been unusually slow and sparse for a Fallout game.
---
The game is great and terrible at the same time. If you can overlook some things and just enjoy it it's awesome.
---
and?
---
Pretty sure they can. Or at least log into your account and use some sort of console/developer things. 
---
BUT if they say that they can do it there will be 48583637584 questions for something ingame related and Beth just don't have the manpower for this. 
---
not at all. the end game content is nuke Whitesprings &gt; farm for TSEs
---
How so?
---
Only if the land and stop spamming that damn green circle bs excuse of an attack 
---
Yes that's a great idea but make sure to deploy from inventory and not drop. Drop will give away the frame and it will not be recalled to your inventory. Also if the frame has high level pieces and won't let you climb in, take out all the high level pieces; climb in the empty frame then exit it. After that you can transfer the high level pieces into the frame and after 90 seconds the frame will be automatically recalled to your inventory. Much cheaper to store a 10 lbs frame then all the pieces individually. 
---
You mean tomorrow, when the next patch drops, right?
---
You may be right, but I do think for stuff like constant server disconnects and duping, some other games may have considered them worthy of hotpatches and some kind of emergency development. 
---
Depends. Watch a stream of the game if you cant make up your mind.
---
Can get someone in the mean time to build the generator at your camp for you. I'd roll an alt to help if I had time.
---
But what happen? The game is GREAT. I thou all the problems didnt matter cause people are having fun ? Im oh so confused 
---
Man, I've already specced into strength because I planned on taking this perk and using the flamer. I wanted to pair it with the cryolator so I could fill support. But I made the cryolator and it burns through ammunition so quickly. And cryo cells aren't cheap. Flamer fuel isn't either, and similar amounts of ammo.
---
It seems to be a very common complaint about the weapons though, so hopefully they patch it.
---
Depends. Leather armor is superior in terms of energy defense. Metal/trapper/marine are superior in damage defense (ballistic and melee). Combat armor is best of both worlds as it has equal damage and energy resistance. Each set can be upgraded and carries additional considerations such as resource repair cost and weight. My recommendation is the BoS combat armor. You can find the plans for the BoS upgrades at the Grafton vendor. Not the grafton station one, but the one inside town. I think other vendors carry it too but I see them at the grafton one often. 
---
Only if you yell Leroy Jenkins in a mic while doing it. 
---
It just works .. smh great game tho I’ll be one in an hour 
---
Is it a conflicting mutation? 
---
It's fine like that, the only problem I see with this is that you are not going to follow the journey in order, which can be kinda sitty. But thanks for the info!! Will take a look on challenges 
---
Side not, can we possible get double sided walls for use inside?
---
Like, for room dividers?
---
I should have never even popped down to store what little junk I had... I assume he'd log off as soon as he saw the orbital beacon
---
Nice. Well done.  A walkway on the outside would be an extra nice touch. Once vending machines are in people can avoid the rads and purchase your wares.
---
A country that was afraid of a communist invasion
---
And yet dupers can collect thousands at a time and be just fine...🤔
---
i only see 14 january patch date. can you give us link instead of screenshot?
---
Leeeeeroooooyyyyyy Jereeeeeeennnnkins!
---
Yeah I have been getting people to build and I appreciate that just really want the freedom to move when I want to and that is what is holding me back not having that plan sadly..if you want to roll another next time your free I would gladly pay for it 
---
Patch notes should have been a part of that announcement with their claim of "more than 150 fixes". Not to see what they say is fixed, but to see what will potential break.
---
That said, my ass will be on after maintenance anyways for the daily ammo grind.
---
u DV me but u know i’m right
---
I think a lot of the time people bring up scorchbeasts they complain about them being frustrating due to having difficulty aiming through the visual effects rather than the difficulty itself; that and the poor loot. These threads usually get detailed by less experienced players jumping in and complaining about the difficulty which muddies the issue.
---
Grab your self a shotgun and put on enforcer card. Once they are crippled they will land.
---
Wait...aren't we still in B.E.T.A.?
---
Totally agree with you man. So much about this situation is off. 
---
Never knew that the frames went into your inventory 
---
Sounds like you had dupers
---
I’ve been trying to stockpile some of the common materials such as wood and steel but they drain so fast 
---
Bad. New patch coming though. Fingers crossed
---
I was a little worried for a minute that you would have no idea what I was talking about. We are getting to that point where youngsters have no idea who Leroy Jenkins is.
---
My point is no reasonable person who goes to white springs (as everyone does) would need it. Offering something anyone can get is just .. nah dude. Sell violet or cobalt sure but anyone who needs flux is high level enough to just get it at will with minimal effort
---
Gonna do another 
---
How??? My (lvl 54) Character is also 15 agi/per. What perks?
---
DEATH TO THE DMV
---
Exactly dude they go very quickly, it’s the constant grind of resources though that I actually enjoy lol. Gear, ducking gears...
---
This is correct
---
Ive been looking for this for a while and cant find it. Is there an image available somewhere?
---
Seriously, how is the Grafton monster not a nuke boss? He's already a unique area creature, it makes sense he would turn into a boss.
---
I want a legendary flare gun
---
Are resources expensive to buy from vendors?
---
It is different in Fo76 than Fo4. A power armor frame you own will recall to your inventory after you logout, leave the area or after 90 seconds. If you drop it, it will persist in the world but anyone will he free to take it.
---
You kick up a fuss about misinformation yet don’t know the basics of how workshop pvp works and you “forgot” that non accepted pvp can kill a player while trying to tell someone it must me YOUR way. If you can’t stop spreading misinformation than you have no right to criticise. 
---
The assets have to be in the game. We have houses with basements. So it must be doable. The question is would allowing players to do it stress the server.
---
I'd guess this is one of those things that won't happen due to game economy balance rather than "realism".  
---
Pay not needed, just clear the enemies at the cooling towers at the least while I or another that chooses to help repairs that section to get credit for the reward. 
---
Did you submit a ticket to Bethesda? 
---
Good to know 
---
but there is a link on the post, anyway, here's the link

---
&gt;!( the bots doing the work was the joke )!&lt;
---
How about a non explosive two-shot lever action
---
Not in that order btw its random
---
I got the windmill last
---
^usually the case
---
I use that cloth for posters
---
The plus: The one and only time I ever teamed up with a group of people that wasn't a complete waste of time we randomly took on a scorchbeast along with a small horde of charred ghouls. It was cool as hell to take it down with a group like that, and after months of playing I finally experienced a moment like the game was actually intended for.    
---
    
---
The Minus: Inclined to agree with OP that scorchbeasts as a whole are fucking nonsense. Just yesterday I crept up on one on a cliff next to the forest fissure site. Had a decently close range shot where I was practically level with the SB, and hit it with a sneak critical from a missile launcher for practically no damage. Hit it with another shot before it really turned hostile as well and that one did nothing as well. Two close range (as close as you're going to get while it's in the air) shots with a heavy gun and it barely puts a dent in it before it swoops in and vaporizes me in a few seconds. It's just stupid.
---
ur getting real mad over flux 😂 like dude i sold some yesterday. i’m not talking about selling it to high levels who can get it with minimal effort, im talkin about everyone else who would rather NOT have to launch a whole ass nuke just to make some. i happen to not have violet or cobalt rn cause i sold it earlier. i don’t want the other shit. am i not allowed to put it out there to see “oh yeah maybe someone does want it?” 
---
sooo uhhh i’m selling not here to argue with someone for no reason about flux bc they feel the need to give their stupid ass opinion. 
---
I saved up my atoms and got the fish light, my fish’s name is James Pond. 😎
---
its a guaranteed spawn, only not there if taken recently by someone in server
---
The last time I farmed it for mods it was only NOT there once, out of a good 7-8 tries
---
Ha missed that
---
Evasive and a fist. I’ve thought about it. Some of the vids have ridiculous damage. 
---
Yeah, let me just carry some 20 pound weapon just to pull it out if I see some dude sky jumping. Great idea but maybe they should focus on something else really? Seeing how much time it takes for then to do anything
---
I would've loved to kill you..
---
Sure let me know I am on for longer on Friday and Saturday I’ll gladly kill the things..but I don’t have a mic atm sadly..my PSN is Walking_Contra
---
Yeah never heard anything back
---
I only do enclave events because I have good luck with getting plenty of legendary enemies. The loot from the box is always terrible though 
---
Looooook!
---
Not everyone is on twitter either
---
its great dude dont believe the haters. they all listen to the same youtubers. 
---
I just assumed real world West Virginia did have bullet vending machines. Is that not a thing in the US?
---
I don’t have level 3 of the hard bargain perk but to me yes, everything but plans are useless to buy personally. Save your caps for plans and something another player has that you want when you get high level.
---
real mad? You just wrote 2 paragraphs
---
Whelps!
---
Really annoying I cannot get the older games for console, even though the game was purchased on console.
---
Well I for one, enjoy them. 
---
"The Holy Hand Grenade?"   
---
"'Tis an artifact Brother Maynard carries. Brother Maynard, bring out the Holy Hand Grenade!"
---
Second floors need to be tied to stairs that are tied to foundation. The hang up is usually either a floor off the stairs that is only connected by a corner (which doesn't count) or that there isnt a foundation connected.
---
Plus some of them probably meet them for the first time in a random encounter at a way lower level, I met my first scorchbeast when I was like level 15 and mind you with teamwork with the person I was with (also level 15) we got it down to about a third of its health before we ran out of stimpacks 
---
You're probably wondering around the wrong parts of the map or at the wrong time. the map is scaled not the enemies (for the most part). There are areas where you will only see 1-15, or 15-23, etc. basically the mass center of the map is easy depending on level, the bottom center gets a little more difficult and can be a fun challenge in your 20-30s as you can take on your own risk, but as you get to the right side past the crest/ridge it becomes a different story. and as others mention if you are in certain places especially WS it scales depending on who else might be there. I'm 43 now and i want back to WS yesterday everybody was in their 20s it seemed, I had never seen enemies that low before there. I left and came back:60s
---
At your level it's an exercise protecting yourself and watching where you are on the map, my statement above holds true but there are places that will scale very quickly and I've walked away from exploring of completing a quest because of it. 
---
I've said this in other threads, but yes. If you enter the multiplayer market it's critical you create support tools to deal with in-game issues. It astounds me how many companies just don't do this. 
---
 Friday works. 
---
You missing just the fusion generator? 
---
If you bought a duped set then expect this to happen.
---
There still should be some way to get rid of that bounty somehow. I think waiting it out makes the most sense. I actually thought that's how it worked the first time I had a bounty.
---
And I actually managed a 100 cap bounty on accident, or at least I had no intent towards other players. I got a 10 cap bounty during my first SB fight when a Lv 15 tried to help out by placing his CAMP and some turrets. But that escalated when later I went into another player's CAMP and reactively defended myself against his turrets (they didn't initially fire, so I thought they remained friendly).
---
I kept that 100 cap bounty for a week until a group of three finally took me out while I had my guard down building a CAMP. During that week around three other players tried to claim the bounty, some pretty persistently, but I fought them off, thinking that it would go away after a day or so.
---
Making an alt and leveling it up to 15 is a lot harder than earning the 500 cap premium you paid...
---
All software has bugs.  There was a certain blizzcon where Blizzard announced WoW had 180,000 bugs.
---
Ok will do 
---
We're rooting for you, mate. Can't let 400 hours of gameplay go to waste. I'm sure this will get resolved somehow, someday.
---
Did you find one?  I know a spot where there are always 2.
---
No, Americans grow bullet trees irl.
---
PSA this works for just about everything in life. If you don't mind embarrassing yourself and complaining enough you get shit for free. Everyone who has worked in retail knows this. Most people (myself included) just don't want to be that guy
---
Well, technically it's not over. So the order isnt super important. Once you collect all of her tapes you can listen to them in order if you like, but without giving anything away, the order wasnt particularly important imo.
---
Yes, that’s why there is a throat stitch. 
---
I had the exact same thing happen to me today on Xbox.
---
to give my rebuttal, because ur opinion is unnecessary. please by all means, mistake clarity &amp; refute for anger. 
---
I cant believe I read all that.
---
Nice, hopeful for those 150 bug fixes they are saying
---
Shit just got real
---
I've said it before and I will say it again; let us can stuff. There are empty mason jars and moonshine jugs all over. Let me can my veg and make booze. Hell there are non functioning still assets in the game. Let us use the chemistry station ala M.A.S.H..
---
If the nuke is placed properly, Whitespring is a great place to get cobalt flux; it is non-existent at Fissure Site Prime.
---
As a PC gamer,I definitely agree.This game has terrible controls...the whole mousewheel menu thing....just really sucks IMHO. Console game and subpar PC port.
---
So you have to have pc to receive their gift. Wow. Thanks for nothing.
---
You should record for YouTube. I would definitely watch these all day! There's a huge lack of good quality 76 content so you would easily gain a large crowd! 
---
The Emperor protects.
---
I’m assuming he didn’t have them and they were hydraulic bracers
---
I'm almost 30, the joke was well received kek
---
There reliving because if they were added right now they would be 2 of the 3 weapons to take the games most common ammo type with out using a rare modification. Damage per shot doesn’t matter as much when the ammunition supply is damn near infinite, even without legendary effects. My issue isn’t even about power it’s about the lack of options and choices for base weapons we have even though in previous games we had a lot that could easily work in 76. 
---
Mexico?
---
i only have items that I found or my son found. I never traded because of that glitch that people were stealing your stuff through the trade window. I have found lots of weapons with good effects but never anything that has them combined like 2shot+expl+something cool......actually i have 1 item that Does have 3 super awesome stats though i dont use it.
---
I found a 2shot+Explosive+increased vats buildup......sadly though to troll me its on an Assaultron head gun ffs
---
 Cost 400 caps on pc.
---
Just remember their fixes typically break things too
---
I found mine at Top of the World station
---
Instead of TSE they should be called OMGWTFBBQKYSTSE.
---
I got killed last night by random mystery damage while in an otherwise-utterly-safe location, then got disconnected before I could get back to my paper bag to retrieve my rather significant pile of junk.
---
And then I got disconnected again, just to make sure I got the point.
---
Game is garbage.
---
I found this only mildly difficult to masturbate to.
---
I got robbed today I was at the ghoul factory and a higher level waited until I cleared the place and killed me then robbed my junk lol 
---
I’m level 90 he was level 157 
---
The large Gen and the Fusion Gen 
---
Dudes kinda right though, Sorarozu. 
---
Ill buy them cause I really need them. my IGN is WolveSaber I’ll be online in an hour. 
---
I suppose it must be. I farmed it on Sunday night at Poseidon, got all three in that order. I guess the RNG gods smiled on me.
---
I always leave a ton of loot after the Uranium Fever event in the toolbox next to the weapons station. 
---
I nuke my friends camps after telling them I'm nuking the golf course to see their camp get destroyed. They keep getting ready to farm and then get so mad. Completely worth it.
---
YUP YUP YUP
---
That’s just sleazy. What a douche waffle.
---
(I think we all do)
---
let's be optimistic my nigga 
---
It's a mess.  You're on PC I assume.
---
Ive got a 3 star cultist dagger that has made my curiosity to a stealth build
---
So you want someone that will die for you? Wow..not even buying them dinner or taking them out on a date first... how shallow. Put in the effort! Romance is not dead!
---
alright i should be online, shoot me a message and i’ll add u
---
Ps4 actually 
---
I just want things to apply to everything, not just singular things. Either a simple color pallet to use on whatever, and individual schemes and themes but that you can use on whatever you choose to use it on. 
---
I should be buying those "colors", not skins locked to a specific weapon/armor set.
---
Would love a harlequin PA haha
---
To be honest I'm not normally a fan of doing it but, seeing as the only reason I got the PA edition was for the helmet I feel justified in what has happened, and before you ask I haven't moaned about the bag....was more concerned with the helmet.
---
Which is more upvoted than your original comment. Spelling matters.
---
And you killed it's family? The right thing to do is adopt them and send them to your camp. Let them thrive in a warming environment
---
grats man, as an aside 2 shot is vastly overrated for shotguns.  You get an extra pellet, and that's all.  
---
There's better effects and only suckers value a two shot explosive shotgun over something better like AP.  Every other type of gun sure 2 shot is a solid effect just not SG's.
---
You mean you don't want to spend 400 atoms on a chrome skin for just the minigun, that is basically indistinguishable from the standard skin?
---
You can’t get clean versions from the station, only dirty, but you can get clean from the traveling responder bot or the helmet can be found in the Berkeley Springs Church at one of the front pews
---
Also got my explosive shot gun. Have to admit the effort it took grinding to get this is whoa! But yeah I use my 2 shot LAR. But true, if no ones around on a nuked area - explosives do save a lot of bullets. I guess it’s balancing the effort of acquiring the legendary effect vs hogging all the fun on nuked events, cheers fellow wastelanders 
---
i think a lot of the time in reality someone would be shooting and passing the empty rifle to someone to reload while he was passed a already loaded one. So it kinda fits in a way that you could shoot a few in a row.
---
If you're a high level people might assume you're just trying to instigate and grief them. I accidentally got a bounty the other day but was only level 25 so I was killed pretty much immediately. 
---
Had a surprising number of disconnects today.  Normally the game is pretty stable but had 3 bluescreens within 5 minutes or so.  One of my team mates had the exact issue.  I'm wondering if something shady was going on with the server.
---
If you haven't gotten there by Saturday PM and I'll do it for. Unfortunately won't be on until then.
---
I have all the junk I need so far. I do enough nukes. I treasure hunt it's just not enough I want more quest more story
---
Yeah why not, if you’re ever selling any flux in the future let me know I will buy any and all flux. 
---
Do you have gatling?
---
I'd rather have a retro 4 wheeler than an animal mount.  Actually, to be really retro it would need to be a 3 wheeler instead.
---
I didnt say anything about trade stealing, i said something about dropping things and it not being there. 
---
The way DR works in this game, Armor Piercing is more important on weaker per shot guns.
---
Eh. I’m 107 or somewhere near that. A couple of the players that would not engage were over 200. None of the people I asked were below 80.
---
Me and you both. It’s like now what do we do? Fallout 5 is like a decade away..... just depressing to think about
---
Yea understandable. I would've been really disappointed if I had ordered the helmet also. It looks really cool in the pictures and to have it broken after waiting for it would've sucked
---
Why would you want to keep ones you aren't going to use or sell
---
Not to mention he was tea bagging the second time killed me , he had a miners guantlet.
---
I’m extra careful now , specially around raiders and explosive cars 
---
sure thing :) 
---
Find the dupers on the map and drop a nuke on their head. Some will log out, others will check the map, and others will not check. Once they die they then have to retrieve that bag of junk full of all those ill gotten gains. I have a friend that does this and steals all of their junk, so if you see a totally random nuke drop that may be him. 
---
Weapon/armor mods can be attached to any weapon/armor regardless of level or what plans you know. If it’s a particularly good plan that you cannot craft yourself and would be useful on a high level legendary weapon that you want, then keep it. Though most mods are fairly useless or are easy to build/acquire so sell them off unless it’s something special
---
I'm not the person you're speaking to, but I *have* developed games a lot, over two decades, and the person you're speaking to is saying exactly what I would.
---
They've clearly lost a lot of what's called "tribal knowledge" over the years, which is to say the people who could actually modify or even fix the engine are probably not there anymore and probably did not document their knowledge well enough before they left. I suspect almost everyone involved in 76 was scared to mess with the engine beyond what they were forced to do for MP, and on top of that they had very little idea what impact a lot of their MP changes would have in the long run.
---
If I were in the credits for this game, I would feel rather ashamed. I've never asked that my name be removed from a game's credits before, but if I saw that this game was going out the door in the state it did, I would have.
---
Unless you are going to sell them or install them, there really isn't a need to keep them. I only keep the ones I know I will use 
---
He’s gonna delete it because no one agrees with him then remake it to “gain traction “; more like getting rid of the bad replies.
---
I love these ideas...mostly i love the idea of these ideas lol..great thinking
---
You can mine up some crystal and lead ore to craft cryolator ammo in decent amounts. My issue with it is that it is low dps. Fun for utility in a team though. Focus fire to chill a dangerous enemy and slow them down. 
---
Flamer Fuel, is just nuts. I could spend a weak farming that crap and shoot it all in under 30 seconds. Maybe a minute.
---
Anyway, strength is good though! Lots of good things it won’t take too long to switch to. Melee, shotguns, heavy gunner.
---
I want there to be a rare vendor, millions of server hops rare to stop exploits that has all the super rare plans and only takes money
---
I dunno about consistently getting scorchbeasts down in two shells with R3 Enforcer (I don't really use VATS) but [I made a short video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h1KnxE1YLD8) of me using a level 5 pump shotgun with standard mods and R1 Enforcer (I also ran Twisted Muscles but forgot to show my effects screen; R3 Class Freak is in the video).
---
You clearly stated you avoided the trade window.  The word “drop” is not in the comment I responded to. 
---
You are not alone. 
---
Ya I went to report the other 10 reposts today and noticed he deleted them all lol
---
They stack 
---
I have auto assault, auto handmade, handmade, hunting rifle, and crossbow
---
WHAT. Going back to read.
---
Looks like dessert is back on the menu, boys!
---
Only store the good stuff.   Most mods are...disposable...but there are a few rare ones like jetpacks, stealth, and tesla that you don't want to scrap.
---
Armor and weapons?  Toss the vast majority unless they are genuinely good 3 stars or top tier perks (which may be getting nerfed this month).
---
Best scenario is to make a mule and work with a buddy to transfer unused stuff over.
---
That’s just dirty. It ruins the experience for you somewhat. Because now you are looking over your shoulder everywhere you go. “Pick the lock? I dunno, let me see if there are any dickbags around first...”
---
 check your challenges list. It lists what locations you're missing. 
---
I haven't nuked but here are a few things to consider; 
---
Whitesprings has an enormous amount of flux, especially fluorescent and yellowcake. 
---
Whitesprings has a tonne more enemies meaning more people get more rewards. 
---
Whitesprings is more accessible to lower level players wanting to explore a nuke without already having to be a in a high level area (in the CB)  or participate/leach off the SBQ. 
---
At the end of the day, its their fun. Who are we to say they're wrong? 
---
Excavator only goes to 45 as well. Before crafting it tho I would suggest stacking as much INT as you can (chems, etc) so the crafted durability will be high as you can get it 
---
No
---
You screwing with us?
---
Amen, the fight is way too annoying and the loot is garbage!
---
As a melee artist myself, wait until you get a furious / 40% bonus heavy attk bonus / add 1 STR or weightless here and go to town. Anti armor / 1 Str / *** also work very well. 
---
I have a secondary I also love. The 4 pronged fishing spear. 40% atk speed, and 25% armor penatration and an armor penetration mod for an additional 25% really works well. Melees are so fun. I'd love to see what you end up with in a few more weeks!
---
Why bother with a new currency?
---
If you patch the exploit, the dupe'd items will still be out there, yes.  However, you can expect a percentage of those dupes to "fall" off the market with player churn that will happen regardless of what they do.  People get bored, a new game comes out, others take a break to come back later, etc.
---
Then, online games like this have a tendency for power creep.  As expansions come out and new content is added, new and more powerful items tend to come with them.  To the min-maxers, that will make today's super dupe'd items "worthless garbage".
---
Fix the hole, and the problem will eventually work itself out.
---
Let me guess, another settlement needs our help.
---
Can't get far into it, people suspect it and the locked vaults are for future expansions.
---
Just commenting on how it could be abused to get into locked areas
---
Was more embarrassing trying to show it off to a mate and it didn't work, his laugh was priceless.
---
Well, it really depends on the caliber.  My .22 caliber hedges really came in well this year.
---
Maybe ot was just me but I was using a TSE prime handmade and it seemed like it was doing a lot more damage on her butthole than her head.
---
It would help, but even people without are one shotting most enemies with TSE shotguns. They need to fix more than that.
---
There is already tons of informations on future content. Camp vendor bots, pvp modes, private servers, vault raids. You should just go read info directly from the source instead of checking this reddit. This is not an official page. 
---
The next patch is tomorrow on PC and next Monday on consoles with over 150 fixes
---
I'm a fallout and TES fan in general, but just didn't buy Fallout 76. I browse this subreddit just in case goods updates come to make the game excellent (Rainbow six, No Man's Sky)
---
So T-45 and Excavator is Level 45 Max, do you also know about Raider?
---
Most likely.  I've had server controls disabled 3 times in the last hour which has disconnected me.  If Bethesda patching it tomorrow then latest Monday for console we can see better performance.
---
Damn, I have a no buttstuff build.
---
Those you encountered probably had the voice chat option to off.
---
Aaaaand he just deleted it again, what would you know.
---
I would love that as well but rather all the focus remains on fixing the game and stabilizing the servers before piling more on it. So i am hoping the reason why we have not is because they are hard at work prepping them for after the fixes.
---
Nice! Bonus points if this is near Philippi cemetery. There is a famous historical covered bridge central to the real town. 
---

If I pop a .50 into that bitches b-hole and she lands, imma uninstall 76.
---
The tse's need to be nerfed and other weapons buffed. Its boring having every dude running power armor and exploding weapons. Maybe they need to have more viable end game builds.
---
Thank you for this comprehensive tip. I can confirm that it worked for me tonight at level 99.
---
Her butthole can take a lot of rounds but you'll prevail in the end.
---
They still fly. Not sure why, but it increases their down time at least. 
---
Given their age you don't need much of a pc
---
Ohh that is Awesome
---
🔥🚬🚭
---
Yes absolutely. Best interaction is unyielding armor imo
---
Rusty knuckles does provide the bleed damage but not enough to make any differance at all by the time you can get x-01. Unarmed is not a viable weapon choice for power armour users.
---
Yessir!  Note that there are caps to how high effects will go.  I'm pretty sure weight reduction caps out at 90% or so.
---
16 players, 1 .50 cal
---
Make sure you are picking up extra weapons and armor to scrap. So you can learn the different modifications for them. I did not noticed it until I was around level 30ish.
---
😂👊🚬
---
I've had people be cautious when I approach their property but once they see a greeting emote, they're usually pretty friendly. Some occasionally speak too :)
---
The main story will take you all over, and let you decide when to get sidetracked.  
---
Use Workshops to get the resources you need.
---
Isn't that called a Blue Angel?
---
Good to know. Thanks bud :)
---
Hopefully not for much longer...I know, overly hopeful...
---
You’re getting ripped off, man; people pay at least 1k for each of them.
---
I only keep it activated so i can use dating apps
---
I just want to give some positive feedback. I know the game has gotten a load of hate online and on YouTube. (However, I've also seen a lot of positive videos on YouTube too.) I just wanted to let you devs know a lot of us love the game and appreciate your work. 
---
I'm loving the game. My friends are loving the game. 
---
We like the "lonely feel" of the game that's created by the exclusion of human NPCs. The "Lone Wanderer" perk is a crowd favorite for a reason - we quest and adventure alone and without NPC followers.
---
We love the ability to craft our CAMPs and even moreso to MOVE them. They could be a little less finicky and glitchy, but we love them still.
---
We're loving the workshops dynamic. I love being able to collect resources that way, and the rewards for doing so are great. We're getting lots of plans and appreciate them.
---
We absolutely LOVE the PvP system. I know this has been criticized a lot. We say "screw that" to that criticism. We have quit multiple online games due to the annoying, asshole griefers, and we'd be quitting this one too if you hadn't prevented it. We love the ability to basically opt out of PvP, but enjoy the fact that it's still a small threat. We know we CAN be killed and our junk looted, so we don't just ignore players attacking us, but we don't have to play in constant fear of the game breaking mechanic of involuntary PvP keeping us from just enjoying the game without it if we want to. Not EVERY person out there wants yet another fps PvP game. Some of us Elder Scrolls and Fallout rpg players enjoy doing something besides shooting other players ad nauseum. So thank you for giving us a semi-voluntary PvP system.
---
And we love that the Atomic Shop is NOT a pay to win micro transaction scam. The stuff in there is flavor only. Please, for the love of The Nine, do NOT add in pay to win loot boxes. Anyone who would criticize their absence is one of those people who won't be happy no matter what your do anyway, so screw 'em. 
---
I/we acknowledge that the game has some bugs and glitches, but generally they haven't been game breaking (for us, but I didn't start playing until Christmas). Yeah, there is room for improvement, and I'm really glad to see that you're paying attention to this thread and responding. It's really encouraging to see that as a player I have a way of actually getting a suggestion or comment to you. That's really cool. 
---
Thank you for a fun game. The fact that there's a community devoted to it, and that I've often had to hunt for servers to let my whole party log in to because other servers were too full for the four of us, proves that there are a lot of people who enjoy and are playing it. Great work, and thanks again.
---
Playing on Xbox One; gamer tag: Pitchlink  
---
I usually leave good stuff in luggage bags at the stations as well. Excess "junk" in a drop bag in front of the vendor. 
---
That's some Grade A griefing and I laughed my ass off. Please stay away from children and small animals.
---
Nerd Rage perk??
---
I found the duping ebay reseller
---
Ahh youre right, dropping was implied because of what i replied to. My apologies. And yea, i did say avoid, i should have worded it differently i guess, as i did not mean it in that way. I was previously unaware that you could give things for free in the trade window (thought there had to be a cap exchange), and i was just giving things away for free, hence my "avoidance". Wasnt trying to arouse any rumors.
---
Or like that locked up warehouse in the mire ?
---
I have no idea.  The furthest I got on urban dictionary was alabama hot pocket.
---
Psn Kiliox 
---
I'll help out rn
---
I only had to server hop about 9 times to get 3 handmade plans on my 15 alt back in December. Is duping so unchecked now that just everything is duped no questions asked?
---
Still better loot than a scorchbeast 😂
---
If you guys are gonna fuck after this, post pics
---
I totally think it’s doable as a premade thing. 
---
I do the same. I stand in a spot where I can tag all enemies then I'll run up to the legendary and do the follow me emote and make sure everyone is here to get a hit in. If someone uses a tse I'll just stand in front of where they shoot so they die. 
---
the sexual tension over common flux 😩👉👌
---
Yesterday I would have said good-great but things were very unstable for me today.  I might have gotten a stinker of a server (Read:  Dupers).   It straightened itself out but there's been a notable increase in blue screens the last few days for my group on the PS4.
---
Patches are dropping soon to fix bugs.  Looks like new content may be a bit off yet.
---
Nope. Too early for me atm. Have some deep pocketed legs on the armor so it's fractionally ok when outside of PA but still have a ways to go before either of your suggestions. Will eventually get there :)
---
Not sure about raider, never had an interest in it 
---
They stack, but whether it's additive or multiplicative stack is uncertain
---
Here’s to me hoping armor works under hazmat suits so I can ditch power armor once and for all.
---
That bell looks so tiny!
---
Why?
---
I can confirm that this worked for me tonight, at level 99: I scored the handmade rifle plans on my fourth try; the event is trivially easy at my level.
---
I found it either from a BoS quest or queen, can’t remember tho, is it that good? I’m already spaced in to heavy weapons so....
---
Alright, thanks.
---
I haven't tested it, but I doubt you have to actually change servers.  I suspect the issue is rapidly mashing "Use" on a treasure mound, resulting in overloading the/a database server and a crash leaving the character in an inconsistent and possibly unrecoverable state.
---
My guess is that waiting for the reward from each treasure map to finish loading would avoid the problem.
---
The real trick is to park that camp away from a random encounter spawn. Helps avoid scorchbeasts attacking. 
---
I totally agree. I'm just asking for more information on the big things to keep up hooked, even though they should definitely smooth out the original game beforehand.
---
Why? Are you one of those players that like to run around naked for some reasons?
---
Like head sculptures. The ones u probably see around whitesprings. 
---
I have all the Holotapes and the quest is still in my quest log. Maybe they are expanding the story more in the near future. 
---
That sounds like a badass superhero to me. Maybe better than.. **THE SILVER SHROUD!**
---
It's not illegal to sell these items for real money. It is against the terms of use. 
---
Ive got a bad ass chemistry workbench plan I can trade. 
---
I read all that, but what I'm asking for is more information on it. I know about the patches and the future updates for the month.
---
Bitcoin can be used at certain ATMs and in many stores , right here right now.  And not illegal.  Why? because you can exchange it for US dollars.
---
Great advice. Didn't realize the unstable flux didn't spoil. Pretty sure I did scrap all before trying to craft.  Thanks a ton!!
---
And in the same breath poor decisions and negative action from games companies don't be deserved to be met like the next crusade has started, it's on for young and old, and the apocalypse is upon us. Like I said, if every industry could to what the games industry could in terms of releasing early and fixing issues post-release they would. No doubt. And I'm not sure it's something that can be changed and I think when games get released too early (ie feels like an alpha/lots of missing components/core issues) then I think the least a company could do is apologise and explain. BUT a company should chin up and soldier on with improving the game quality.
---
  
---
They do get praised because they stuck it out, and especially when you're a consumer and you go through 6 months, a year, 2 years, of patches there will be some patriotism. Yes they fucked up but more importantly they fixed their mistake, it's not praise worthy but it is redemption. And redemption is far better than what some companies do which is to ditch a project all-together which negatively impacts the fans it did attract.  
---
Micro-transactions are a grey zone for debate, I think lazy micro-transaction (for example look at the flat colour weapon skins for Rainbow Six Siege) is sketch af but some micro-transactions are pretty good. I think though that alternative ways for obtaining some of them are also nice but micro-transactions themselves aren't inherently a bad thing.   
---
Server instability is a big issue, but when you live in a place like Australia the ISP is far more of an issue than a game server; that doesn't excuse it but perhaps give context as to why it doesn't bother me as much as an individual. That said  I think a lot of games have server issues and this needs to be broadly addressed not specifically targeted as of now. 
---
I found hitting her under her wing is a really sweet spot for damage as well , I got my scorched earth for the first time last night. Good stuff. 
---
Yeah. Place a CAMP nearby, put a basement in that intersects the locked area, go down into the basement while still in building mode, delete the basement. Instant access to anywhere you can place a camp near.
---
Depends what level you are.  At 70, no it’s strange cause that person is god-like.  At 200 though he/she is just playing the game.
---
They really are. The Enclave should have access to some of the best armor and weapons in the game, but their bunker’s inventory is barren and quest rewards are no better, and in some cases worse, than just doing some random event. 
---
I’m not saying doing an Enclave quest should *always* get you dope shit, but there should at least be a chance of it! 
---
Such a shame. A switchblade yes, but a Tambo no. Not too much thought given there. 
---
nah i’d rather trade it for some bulk wood fam, plus someone’s already buying so no need to be sarcastic. 
---
You seem knowledgeable. Got a court case with this ruling or can you reference a law specifically pertaining to digital goods? Google has failed me.
---
I acquire most things myself, launching and fighting queen isn't much of a hassle so I'll call it an even 500 haha
---
PC? could have been under the terrain, there is a way of hacking a way collision allowing access to inaccessible areas
---
They main thing that bothers me about endgame us that in nuke zones nothing is destroyed by a nuclear bomb exploding. Particularly jarring in whitespring. All pristine lawns, undisturbed trees and shiney robots everywhere.
---
 you remind me of those don't preorder guys 
---
I see each step on the map.  Small quest markers.
---
Aye they are , I use the 10mm smg with commando and it works quite nicely. 
---
SMG's are not rifles because they are SMG's. 
---
E.i. two weight reduction may be
---
 Weight=oldWeight x (1- (reductionA + reductionB)
---
Or
---
Weight=oldWeight x (1-reductionA) x (1-reductionB)
---
With scenario 1, two 20% reductions would be 40% reduction total. With scenario 2, it would only be 36% reduction total.
---
i'm just exited for the patch that's all 
---
There is always a need for sarcasm.   
---
Thanks for the extra information guys, very informative, so derives from coding. Fascinating.
---
You can upgrade, but you will have to submit a ticket to Bethesda.net.
---
Your computer? I never had crash problems with any of those games on my pc.
---
Okay, thank you all for the info I wasn't sure, bcuz I had to pieces with 20% red of ammo when I equipped it I did not see a reduction in my weight. But then I was thinking I have Bandolier at 3 so 90% reduced weight ballistic ammo, so the only items it would effect are the 20 fusion cores and 200 40mm grenades, unless it doesn't effect the grenades. If that is the case is there armor with 20% weight reduction of explosives
---
Honestly most ppl don't think killing you is worth the ten caps. If you really want to get killed rack up a bounty of 100+ and see how quickly you'll get hunted down. 
---
I'm not sure what more information you'd be looking for so I guess I can't help you. They have already described tons of future dlc even stuff coming towards the end of the year. Naturally they don't want to reveal every detail and spoil the surprises. 
---
I do all the drugs and give all the food to my friend
---
Sorry forgot to put xbox. It was on the edge of the map though. I inched down and eventually started glitching through the rocks. Just wanted to see what was going on. 
---
Technically you only need one code piece. Because you can google the code online. Just dont make the mistake i made and go to silo Charlie when i had a Alpha code piece lol. Imo anyone can solo it if you have enough stimpacks/boosters/ammo. You have to move slowly and crouched and vats every part of the ceiling to make sure you shoot those turrets. They will drain you down. And the Assaultrons  as well. If they come at you id bail and shoot. Theres a perk that auto heals you at a certain low health mark. That becomes very useful. Just hotkey your stimpacks and go for it. Or if you are on xbox hit me up and ill run through it with you. 
---
or just stop being babies and leave their base alone
---
Add the perk cards to your test?
---
Raiding camps is a good way to boost your wanted level. Someone with a high wanted level is a tempting target for some people. This helps to instigate pvp, which can be fun if you stash your junk and don't mind losing some caps. 
---
As for the building side, I think there is potential for some fun builds. My buddy has a boxing ring and I have a cage for more intense fights. The cage comes equipped with audience controlled flame throwers and punji traps to trip up combatants. 
---
Surprisingly this is true noticed this myself lol
---
How many times are people going to repost this before they stop.
---
100% agreed; we're both thinking about similar stuff so thanks for posting! Hopefully it gets on their radar.
---
Well how much is the bounty?   Would help buy at work..  
---
I know there are automatic receiver variants in the primes. Like there is a regular and automatic rec for the pip gun and handmade. I would assume the same applies to the combat rifle. 
---
yeah i dunno then, probably just found some way to glitch thru the surface or something
---
I think this is the longest run on sentence I’ve ever seen or read.
---
Just stash your junk. Dropping it is the penalty of dying 
---
Watoga BOS bot named Phoenix in the super Duper mart. The other one doesn’t have much.
---
Sell it. I get plenty of water from my camp, I've never felt like I've needed the benefit from drugs (besides the occasional Buffout fast travel), and I eat who I kill.
---
 lol, thanks
---
Sell that shit
---
Yeah that sucks. I dont think I even know where that workshop is ha 
---
There's literally no evidence it's due to any of that. It could just as easily be they were rushed by x, knew it was crap, but had no choice.
---
Pointless deciding one opinion is correct.
---
Just vendor the drugs or give them away... When I get too much food and water I either give it away as well, or just go on a long walk somewhere and explore some obscure part of the map that I've never been to before. 
---
you can eat them when they're "downed" i'm pretty sure
---
Then we need a run faster with perk for every other weapon. Everything has pro/con
---
God no.  Clowns and wendigo are scary enough on their own.  I don't think I've ever seen a legendary wendigo, or any other strong enemy legendary like deathclaws, mirelurk queens, or behemoths.
---
Somewhat related, I love that gun. I didn’t even build for it and yet it’s still pretty nice.
---
Sums up this game pretty well.
---
I think the best way would be a separate cell then you need to load into. That way it wouldn't conflict with the "overworld" so to speak. Im sure it would be too hard to implement, just have 24 "basement cells" to the map(one reserved for each player), and load in your build stuff like a camp when you join the server.
---
No, I’m talking about when you capture a settlement workbench and the event is ‘kill incoming scorchbeasts’ or something like that. I forget the exact wording.
---
Would be great especially when you die and got disconnect/srv crash before getting your junk loot back.
---
1000/1000 physical/energy resistances, stupid number of HP, massive damage output, and hyperaggressive to everything.
---
"Run away!  Run away!"
---
I never use the drugs, I just end up selling them. I look to keep some some non perishables in stash, but I generally cook meat for my food.
---
All the prime receivers are one or the other. I think the combat rifle might be semi but I’m not totally sure. I can check for you tomorrow if no one else posts
---
The defeated player resurrects, so thier body is reborn when they respawn. If you ate it, they couldnt respawn.
---
ColecoVision?
---
Unstable does spoil but is sellable.
---
Masses and fluid do not.
---
The one I have just empties all of the fusion cells in my inventory with one shot. It doesn't even do more damage, it does the same as a single-charge blast.
---
Probably what Bethesda actually meant when they said they wanted Fallout 76 to last for years. 
---
Need third party to carry transfer
---
Lol. I could get behind that.
---
I don't have any friends at 76 :(
---
Yup. A lot of people do this. It's a normal thing in any online game that has inventory caps
---
Yeah, pistols in an odd spot right now.  I tried very hard to like a decent VATS pistol but it just didn't put out the damage like my rifles.  Add in the lousy reload for a .44 and "meh".  
---
I dunno what it needs - lots higher crit bonus maybe.  Make it hit like a hammer when you throw the crit out.
---
Xbox 1X.  I also have the game loaded on a super fast external SSD that greatly speeds up the loading times. 
---
I originally bought the SSD for PUBG to help speed up the loading of buildings when first starting.  It makes a huge difference with FO76 too
---
if you actually wanna use it drop your FCs before equipping it.
---
Because it's not working as intended.
---
If a mutated player suppresses via radx does that negate the extra damage?
---
Dropping a nuke there is really weird.  Unless they were doing nuked fauna run.  
---
I would be good with an abbreviated patch notes preview, excluding specific discussions of bugs and exploits and believe that would be a good compromise 
---
Restart? Did you crash? Ps4?
---
This is exactly what they do haha
---
Best brunch is free brunch 
---
 near Morgantown.
---
Exactly what OP said...
---
Never turn a hoe into a house
---
The trick is to bring some friends. Have one friend get the high bounty and the other players act as bodyguards. Once a couple lone riders get taken down they'll be back with friends. This is where the pvp fun begins. 
---
Directly from Bethesda Customer Support:
---
" At the current moment there is not any other course of action to avoid these situations besides to either block them or switch to a new server. Which could also still have the issue reappear as you have stated earlier. I understand how frustrating this can be as when I first started playing Fallout 76 I had similar instances of issues with people. "
---
Hardcore mode?
---
but where is it in-game and how to get there? xD  
---
I thought in FO4 etc it was only accessible via console commands and in FO76 we only knew about unreleased stuff from people that looked into the files  
---
Never a problem on FO4!
---
That whole place is laggy to begin with, then you access a laggy container. Yeah...
---
Thru hiker is something i have equipped considering i carry so much damn food. 
---
Best brunch is free brunch
---
Love it , it chews through ammo though I am built for it with commando and expert commando. Going to get master commando once i get the levels. 
---
They don't drop max level items, but most of the time the supervisor that come are 2 or 3 stars, giving you a good chance at getting a really good weapons or armor. 
---
Yeah. People do this with vendor characters. They also call it a mule character. You could do this but the alt wont be able to fast travel and you will always need a middle man to move stuff back and forth. If you don't have a friend, then you have a higher risk of someone running off with your stuff.
---
I do miss the DJ. Repetitive, but it still made the experience more immersive. 
---
They'll come. They'll repackage the Vault building DLC for us somehow. 
---
My guess is that they'll be instanced for ease of use. They could make it void terrain, I just feel that setting below ground "boundaries to account for edges of elevation would be tough.
---
Could make it a sort of mini vault door slab you could place on the map. Smaller version if you're going for a hidey hole, fat concrete slab if you want to be a beacon. Create its own separate cell that you can then build out with the vault segments.
---
Could have a decent amount of budget to make it clearly smaller than a normal vault but plenty to get creative with. 
---
One can hope! 
---
You don’t need mats to put PA mods on, if you have  you can just put em on no mats required.
---
this one gets me the most. Trying to get everything I need to build a great CAMP in a location I found. Those DC while I am gathering really annoy me. I die because I am still low-ish and running around near naked and lightly armed to carry as much as I can.
---
It's a bit east of Vault 76, so super low level and normally pointless to nuke. Great for getting resources for the Excavator Armor though. 
---
🤔 sell the drugs on the market?
---
I mean, it's entirely logical that he had his own gatling gun. 
---
I think I found one Overseers Journey out of order and it completely broke the quest.  Now I find them sometimes and it's meh. 
---
You should try to invite players that are at the event to your team, that way if they do one shot the legendaries you still get the loot, obviously they aren't guaranteed to join but just a heads up.
---
This is fake 
---
Inventory herpes. Stay the fuck back. 
---
I almost exclusively eat processed food, don’t pick up alcohol, and sell drugs. 
---
That's my only issue with the Appalachia radio is that there is no DJ. At least add a Mr. Handy to be a DJ... Mr. DJ they could even add a broadcast tower with him in it.
---
I fight bosses, gather loot, farm, sell, do quests, explore, repeat. That's it.
---
Nuka world dj all over again , love it
---
Could work. That perk where you drop a luvebgrenade on death could be upgraded to booby trap your corpse.
---
Yeah man I'll help 
---
That’s awesome 
---
No. Hell no in fact. I'll actually go one further, tear down the whole ski resort and leave not even a scrap of her to be found.
---
It said it also included fixes to "how many plans are available at the vendors". 
---
I am cautiously optimistic about that one, hopefully we will be able to buy what we want soon. 
---
I understand that, but like I said, it would be more accessible and have more players wanting to play. as it stands, I see complaints/concerns a lot about how its hard to get players into the "hunter vs hunted" event, or the event up at the colonial fort or whatever up north. 
---
I just think if theres is extra benefits to winning in these events, there should also be extra concessions to losing for voluntary events like this, to make it more fun and not feel punished for trying to play. I think the events should be almost like separate instances from the base games rules, and have their own rewards and rules separate from the normal pvp for the sole purpose of getting more players interested in participating.
---
overseers cache, but since they announced vending i started saving mine to sell
---
I like to drop extra ammo and recipes off by vault 76, in the overseers stash. Usually when I see a new player in the area of the vault.
---
I’m one hundred percent sure it’s mine because the gun had the exact same mods and it was a TSE, he later dropped it after I threatened to report him and it had the same condition. he also admitted to having it in our brief chat over xbox messages.
---
Now if only there was a way to tell if an item is duped or not. Or you might as well just say. “DONT BUY ANYTHING FROM PLAYERS”
---
&gt; Shouldn't quests be giving out way more?
---
Quests are mostly useless for levelling. Be a murder hobo to gain levels.
---
Can you eat animals too or only cannibalism?
---
Smoking thins your blood stream and the harder breathing makes more co2 which attracts more bugs. It's been proven
---
It was also missing from my inventory from the clip
---
shhh, let it be
---
I'm usually okay at the station, though I don't risk using the workbenches or stashes near or in the resort. I've been kicked enough times to make me weary.
---
Source? Not blindly believing OP here, but can either of you offer any evidence?
---
I am always running out of lead, even with an extractor in my camp. Where are you getting all your lead from?
---
Good doggy perk and I get water from my camp. I only snack on boxed food as I find it, but don't hoard it. 
---
I could see a nuke there for fauna and also Scorched at the airport. Nuked Scorched will drop hardened mass and other nuke materials needed to make stable flux.
---
I always tried to invite anyone I see there so we can all get loots, but sometimes they won't take the invite. 
---
Have her take over all of the radio stations for a while 
---
Considering bethesda admitted they have no way to track items, I'd be more interested in OPs source 
---
They're doing a fine job at Whitespring
---
Where on the map are you?
---
It could be an all inventory list or simply “more plans per trip” 
---
&gt; but, you shouldn't be there at that level.
---
That goes both ways. Farming low areas makes playing them by the lowbies impossible.  
---
Playing the storyline, I have to go do the mine for the fireman test. I enter the mine, start to creep, and get destroyed by level 45-60 ghouls. I am trying to figure out why a level 14 quest sent me to fight level 50 mobs when I see a level 100+ running around in there already, gathering whatever it was he was after.
---
it took me several days to find an empty mine, so it spawned mobs the right level for me to finish that quest. I was around level 25 by then, and WAY behind on the story line.
---
Don't goto whitespring
---
&gt;Given that Fallout 76 is built on a heavily converted single player engine and not a purpose built multiplayer engine
---
NetImmerse was built for multiplayer though. Un-optimized early 2k netcode but it's still there as a framework.
---
Ha nice! Told you!
---
And isn’t it nice that there are no hostile robots or turrets? 
---
You can also pick up some sweet ballistic fiber there too.
---
Was this a defend a workshop event? I occasionally encounter lvl 60+ glowing alpha mongrels when I’m told to defend my camp. Not sure why, but a shotgun with explosives do the business with a death or two haha. Or is it out in the world? If it’s out in the world then it’s because there is a high level players somewhere around you that’s spawning high level mobs
---
Where are you running into them? What quest are you currently on?
---
Biggest problem is bad attitudes
---
I stopped playing because I got sick of getting killed by packs of ghouls over level 60...where there shouldn't be such high level enemies in the first fucking place. BETHESDA, fix this shit.  
---
If it’s level 50 I’ll buy it. 
---
I have had this happen a few times , depends on who was in an area last. If a level 100+ is in your area the enemies pop in ALOT stronger. 
---
Ice to see you again.
---
You're right. It counts as the execution and it's hilarious.
---
yes it is :) 
---
my IGN is luficr i am online rn
---
I'd be interested in your source that Beth can't  track duped items.
---
No he didn’t. Please stop. 
---
Bottle Cap glasses?  Yeah, they're pretty uncommon.  I found a set early but don't remember where.  Only the one though.
---
I think in the future we'll get a lot more of that stuff once the dev team can stabilize all the more pressing issues regarding gameplay and quality of life.  I imagine only a very small portion of the team is tasked with refreshing the atomic shop.  Let's say they wanted to offer a "chrome" skin to all weapons and armor in the game.  That would require a reskin of every weapon in the game, including all variants of mods for each, because it would be silly if a long barrel got the chrome treatment but a short barrel didn't, plus reskins of chest, leg and arms for basic armor which comprises at least 5 different sets that have three different variants (assuming leather is excluded) and head, chest, legs and arms of like 6 different suits of power armor.  There's got to be over 50 different weapons ranging from the lead pipe to the plasma gatling, and all of them have at least one mod.  That's a lot of work.
---
I'm sure more cosmetic content will come in the future, but I'm personally happy that the team is focusing efforts on QoL, exploits and turning the game into a more polished overall piece.
---
I got a recipe from the Trapper's Camp just a bit ago.
---
oh, i see now. Article isn't updated for my region, so i have to change it for English language
---
Vendor. I started today with over 100 stims, now down to about 15 or so
---
Has anyone noticed that when you’re in a nuke zone with ghoulish AND the healing factor mutation, the ghoulish perk seems to quit healing in combat?  I was nigh invincible in the blast zone with ghoulish.  But, since getting the healing factor mutation, the healing just stops when in battle. . even though I’m still taking radiation and SHOULD still be healing. ... grrrr.
---
Give me a half hour, I’m eating dinner rn
---
No way its taking till March. They're holding their tongue on details and theyll drop them when release is basically on the door step. They have one of the most volatile social media spheres ever around this game. They're being transparent, they're just being careful.
---
That's my reasoning for their stated holding of the tongue at least. Seems very logical considering the hive mind is in attack dog mode.
---
So can people raid your camp in this game?
---
To re-install the game...obviously 
---
If you are wanted, anyone that attacks you attacks at full force - but you are still hitting at slap until they do. once they attack you, then your hits are full force.
---
So maybe they are afraid you are sitting on some one-shot weapon and just trying to trick them into allowing full force
---
or maybe they are just passive players that don't attack people
---
I would settle for being able to place a cellar/blast door/stairway entrance that when clicked on loads a "underground cell" with a load screen ect to access it that is obviously underground. Maybe like some preset underground looks to choose from, that take up varying budget space. Oh, and in the future sell themed ones for atoms, like a mothman underground lair, Norse themed, vault themed,  cult themed, ect.
---
Your characters suit is fancy, where did you get it?
---
I friended you on Xbox GT: TaxmanMSU 
---
I borrowed your spot and moved my camp. It seems like a mighty popular spot due to the junk extraction point and natural building space. 
---
I do like it though, can’t wait to design and decorate more! 
---
I just wanted to know if this is a known bug or anything, it just had me scared shitless. Not trying to start anything 
---
Not doing any specific quest, but they’re coming from around the R &amp; G Processing Services
---
Not saying this true but given the amount of corrupted accounts I wouldn’t be surprised 
---
😂 yeah obviously but i’d like to think it’s cause i dipped out on buying skyrim 7 different times
---
I can't believe people never noticed the scorched beast queen landing mechanic... Like she literally poops them out for you to kill. So many people just ignore the adds.
---
I  "pepper" it all over the wastes always in containers, anything that I accidentally pick up and don't need this suitcase some .308 and a hunting rifle and some yum-yum eggs, in the next town in the foot locker some stims and some .38, and so on and so forth. But I try to make sure if I'm dropping a weapon I try to put some of the ammo it needs, unless of course I don't have any
---
Yeah some were at whitespring.
---
Also ran into more going south.
---
alrighty
---
The trade bug rumor has never been proven.  So no. 
---
Basically been going from white springs to the R &amp; G processing plant.
---
I carry a strength one around with me incase I need the extra carry weight to fast travel. Other than that, I don’t. Though I imagine late game for things like the scorched queen you might want the ones that increase the damage you’re spec’d to. 
---
It might be easier to find some low level players near the fire department and see if you can buy it or trade for it. Much easier than starting a new character or trying to farm it.
---
Nah, afaik no one has found a way to clear it from their side quest log regardless of order.
---
Yes brother, we all want to have the blessing of the wise mothman.
---
I have seen this mission active all the time and any time I did the event it was in the daytime. To be honest I think like most things in this game it is all random so I guess it is just luck of the draw.
---
The one thing I did notice everytime I had done this event though the time limit is always really short so i assume that if anyone happens to be in the area (even if they dont do the event) it would make the timer run out and end the event anway.
---
Sometimes it would be nice to get a brief notification of when a new event have been added (like a workshop defense events etc) rather the checking the map.
---
I do wish they had more Cult of the Mothman events and even actual quests. We want to be recognized as a proper organization dammit.
---
That is my exact same situation. Thanks for sharing.
---
Just because it hasn’t been proven still means this may be an issue. And I NEVER traded them
---
And it jumps at you the same way a mole rat burrows at you.
---
Boom, we all just helped Bethesda make a new event.
---
It probably depends on what kind of ammo you use; I make 5.56 which doesn't use much lead compared to steel/gunpowder. Other ammo types will make you need way more. I just loot everything I find though; paint cans, combination wrenches, weights. Running nuke silos is a great way to get it, there are tons of combination wrenches lying around and the very first section has a weight room
---
Just got healing factor mutation yesterday and then went into a blast zone.  Originally, with ghoulish, I felt nigh god-like as the rads kept me alive during battle.  But, now, since getting healing factor, the healing just stops during battle. . Even though I’m still taking radiation damage. . I don’t think they’re working as they’re supposed to.   ~crossing fingers for patch~
---
I’ve purchased High Tec Lights and Lounge Chairs from the Watoga Shopping Centre trader.
---
Lol it happened to me, so yeah probably not true. Im pretty sure your comment isnt true.
---
I mean we can't take your word for it man. We need proof and so does Bethesda. After the last claims of inventory stealing and many of testing the theory it turned out to be false.
---
Gotta give us something to work with show us a video of it. Xbox records all gameplay or something from a session?. Just leave the persons name out of it by blacking it and using the video as proof.
---
Watoga, Ho!
---
I got the plans at level 40+ from patrol duty second try
---
yeah I'd love to see like pipe heavy weapons and such or at least let the pipe guns have a ton of ammo conversion mods so we can use any ammo with them 
---
It hasn’t been proven because it was a false rumor. People can’t steal your stuff.  
---
The Mire has a bunch of violet flux too, from strangler pods. 
---
Total FUD.  This isn't how item ID tags work.
---
Except they're not running "promotions" to get commercial business partners to accept only Bitcoin as accepted currency.

 just to let you know who you stickied/supporting etc. I&amp;others was  raped etc at ladydevann s requests for a year and it was broadcasted on  twitch etc, she continued hate crimes an hate speech etc for 5 years.  she encourages cyber attacks rapes and murders etc even last year.  She has slandered  extorted and exploited me&amp;etc for her whole streaming career and she  admits it. she promotes &amp;profits off rapes an rape culture victim blaming and hate speech and hate crimes.  she only talks with people to  gain clout off them as if she helps the communities etc and she wants to  be verified on twitter etc as if she should be important even though she is a rapist and a pedophile and police in my area have seen her do  it (plotting murder etc and asking people to do it for her and she pays  etc them to do it) i have a police report and a case against her which  proves my sides of things. i am a verified credible witness to rapes  etc, she and her community are trying to coerce etc death threat me&amp;my friend an  coworkers etc into giving false police reports and false witness reports she  has openly discussed premeditated murder on twitter and how she can do  it or have done any way wants any time" and its ok for her " . my little brother was killed because of her. she only uses/;does things to try to get away with and justify rapes etc

Those are higher level areas.  Enemy levels can go up to 99 based on the highest level in the area.  Even if the player isn’t still in the area
---
where did he find it?
---
What console? I might have some of those on xbox.
---
Didn't  say they were wrong. Just don't understand it.   Like you said, it's great for low-level, even mid-range players.  My post is aimed at more high level players who have had plenty of time to collect a formidable arsenal of weapons and armor and should be ready for something more challenging. 
---
I'm level 169, and I'm bored as hell with White Springs.  But I see people at my level routinely still launching nukes at it. 
---
You can. Don’t judge me. 
---
You rock. Thanks!
---
I just hoard it in my stash playing for the day I can hopefully swap it for a bunch of 5.56
---
So .. go anywhere else?
---
Lots of high levels hang out at whitesprings. That's why.
---
Found a couple dozen, haven't used a single one.  Sold em all off.
---
I'm at work and can't go searching old posts right now but here is the first thread I got off google. The first comment states they said in support tickets they can't. At the time, people were posting screens of the support responses so we knew it was real.

Why does Trump hate Fallout 76?
---
I did clip it but i left my clips at 30seconds but i do have a clip of me hitting one of the guys and then seconds later hearing a gatling after my friend mentions it looks like mine. Is their a way to extend the clip because if so I could definitely show it. I’m trying my best to cooperate I mean no harm in spreading rumors. I’ll post a separate post and link it with the clip I have even though its not much to work with.
---
You cant handle post apocalyptic wasteland, stay the F outta our Whitesprings or I'll get my thicc glowing bois to run a train on your crybaby ass.

Hope that disrupts your flow snowflake.

theres also a higher risk way of doing it...

they are pretty solid with the right builds and sneak abilities BUT they work a lot better against super mutants and ghouls then against larger beasts 
---
what we really need is a semi automatic receiver for the hunting rifle so we could lay down fire with it rather then fire wait fire wait 
---
I'm definitely grabbing sneak on my next level up!
---
Me when most of my games crash: "argh. Well guess I should restart it"

Me when FO76 crashes: "argh Im not doing all of that again. *Turns off console*"

I long for the days when you see the Enclave symbol and automatically think "I'm gonna get some cool ass shit if I go there.".

To be fair the X-01 is cool and all, but that really is the extent of it isn't it?

I'm curious how you know which you're missing. I've been trying to hunt plans for my end game fuel but I've no idea what I'm missing or where there might be a checklist

"Eat this dog chow and calm down."- MODUS

just all the relevant ones. I sneak attack it in the face for about a 10-15% then just vats it to death

On the ground, let it be consumed by the ether.
---
FAKE NEWS
---
I don't know maybe some xbox users can chime in on that one. Because what your saying is very serious if true. So do what you can to prove it and send it along to Bethesda.
---
I will keep that in mind! Thanks for the tip! 
---
Security office in Posieden has like 5.
---
I've sold them all except str and explosive dmg. Use them if I need them. Str for carry weight and dmg for queens 
---
Yes exactly, which makes it a great target. It doesn't have to be fissure site prime, but I'm really puzzled as to why whenever there's an alert for a nuke it always seems to be headed for white springs.  Was understandable early on, but at this stage of the game I really don't get it. 
---
What are you talking about?  
---
Just farm them at Whitesprings and the like, pretty soon you wont know what to do with them all
---
I just sell them to Vendors no matter the legendary affix
---
I’m hoping to do such, I’m trying to be cooperative and understanding so the process goes smoothly
---
Get in the excavator suit and start mining lead ore in lucky hole mine ! Over 500 lead in one run.
---
Yeah? There's been a few that were ok. Not far from single serving frozen pasta stuff. I had a taco one that wasn't terrible. 
---
The desserts are all aweful tho. Or anything featuring "cheese spread"
---
The trick is to get to about level 40-something and then say “I should have invested more in these types of perks, and I missed out on these plans by outleveling them when I didn’t realise I could. Re-specing now would take ages, I might as well start a different character and try something new”. That’s why I do, and why my saves will never get that far xD
---
What a nightmare! Ifl would have quit the game for good 
---
This really doesn't seem legit. This guy is still marketing across the board everyday and this happened weeks ago? Where's your ticket screenshot.
---
I don't want to spoil any plot point for you, but that's an endgame area. Stay away lol! At your level stick to the forest and toxic valley. When in the Savage Divide don't just be rushing in everywhere. Sneak around and don't pick fights you won't win... And don't just close the application every time you get in over your head. Just respawn in a safe area. You can't just freely explore the map at low levels. 
---
The biggest gripe about it is that for some reasons it doesn't work like wasteland whisp or animal friend. You just simply make a robot docile to you. You can't command it and it only attacks other creatures if provoked. 
---
The only benefit is when you are in situation where you're being swarmed by mr gutties and you render a few of them dormant, giving you easier time to take them out. That's it.
---
I actually got into a 35min discussion on login with someone earlier - logged in and he was at my camps spot and saw me and was like hey buddy what you think of my base and was like its a good base location why I use it myself then we got into a discussion over some items he had quests game mechanics and is now on my friends list - pretty much ate up my play time but I enjoyed it loved how random it is when I run into someone and find someone with similar interest in the game 
---
but I mean seriously look at any mmo style game unless we are forced to play in a team for something do we really ever just talk to people in games? We normally join guilds and just talk to people in it and even then most people still don't talk so its not like its a new concept to gaming 
---
what commercial video games have you developed over the past 2 decades? This isn't a challenge to your insight, but a request to validate it.
---
So 250 bugs that should have been fixed before this game ever got released. When are we going to get the finished game? 
---
Stop going to whitesprings....
---
Every previous Bethesda game suffers from an issue where old saves become unstable. It's due to how the engine saves data to the save. The only way to fix it is to make new characters and delete the old, bloated, saves.
---
Since this is an online game, I'm curious about how this issue will affect the multi-player environment 
---
You work for Warner Bros or Behaviour Interactive?  I have never starting enjoying a game more just because of what will come in the future.  You either enjoy playing it, or not.  If not, take a break, play another, and come back to it.  I love this game, but over the holidays I took a break and played another game; now I am back into it and enjoying it more.
---
Never
---
I dont even pick them up anymore
---
one time my wow account got hacked to be used as a mining bot the guy got rid of all the junk in my bank and on my character and yes it was junk random things from old quests or other grey items of interest that i could of easily picked back up and the gms gave me all that junk back lol
---
yeah I really think explosive and two shot should be the same slot as 1 is nice but both is op and basically so op its a must have because of how disadvantage you feel without it 
---
Thank you so much for the trade!
---
I think he was asking if they benefit from the auto rifle perks which they do
---
I chomp em down when I find em
---
I see plenty of evidence for that stuff. I know how game development works, and I know how it doesn't work, which is to say I know how to recognize signs of certain things going wrong or being done improperly.
---
But you're right about one thing, which is that the game was rushed out the door. That, along with staffing it with CK newbies, is entirely on the heads of management, not the team. None of what I said is meant to reflect on the team, really.
---
Here’s [the shortest video on it](https://youtu.be/s526NW_jayU)  from YouTube. If you were on PC I’d make you one. Maybe someone from Xbox who has the plans can help you out. 
---
I use the aids and I'm level 130. Helps my stealth build one shutting everything including scorch beasts. 
---
Definitely, haha. It's the best way on our end to never see the instability. I'm just curious if Bethesda has done anything since FO4 to prepare for it
---
Your in the wrong zone buddy.

Almost every piece of technology was powered by a miniature nuclear reactor. I always assumed Rad-Away was some sort of emergency first-aid item in the event that something fouled up and you needed a quick anti-radiation dose. Maybe not something that *everyone* would need, but useful to keep stocked up if you're a Corvega mechanic or have a Mr. Handy in your house that you were refilling when you accidentally spilled nuclear fuel on yourself (the Mr. Handy thing is kinda confusing, I'm assuming they're nuclear because we see them being active years later, but they also require fuel, but that fuel gives oil when scrapped; I'm guessing the fuel is a sort of "spare battery" or "starter" nuclear fuel, because that's the only way I can consolidate it). 
---
Plus, bullet vending machines [exist IRL](https://i.imgur.com/h8ynWML.jpg) (I'm not American so IDK how popular/widespread they are, I'm Irish and gun-ownership is a rare thing here). 
---
Pre-War America was a paranoid place. Pipe-guns, for example, are a Pre-War invention that were popular in Detroit; to commit the sin of "guesswork", it wouldn't surprise me if so much effort went into supplying the military that civilian guns were hard enough to come by, or expensive enough, that people made pipe-guns. That might sound counter intuitive ("bullets are popular because guns were rare") but I mean it in the "so many people wanted a gun to 'protect' themselves in case of invasion that they even made makeshift guns" way. Add in the need for practice, stockpiling ammunition, less than legal activities like crimes or violent protests, and things like hunting or self-defense and you've got a fairly big population going through a reasonable amount of ammunition in a short period of time. Bullets are a lot easier to make than guns, so you'd have a potentially huge pool of bullet manufacturers (even if the pool of gun manufacturers is a lot smaller). 
---
Not to mention that, as the guy above said, Nuka Cola was doing a deal where you could trade bottlecaps for things. Given that parts of America were running low on cash, knowing that you'd be able to get a box of .45 ACP for your M1911 just by trading in a few of your Nuka Cola bottlecaps after you're finished with them would give a lot of peace of mind.
---
Of course, that's all just my guesswork but it makes sense to me; if there's any harder evidence about it I'd be interested.
---
They are all free to repair, simply store and replace. I would imagine the metal is more durable but a TSE gun will blow up any wall with ease and so can a ScorchBeast.
---
If you play on PS4 and have met me at one of the events, I'm always running around smashing the adds and trying to keep them off everyone else. The only issue is everyone spraying her with TSE weapons and even in area chat I tell them that she is resistant to explosive weapons. You get a lot of thumbs down and all that so, I'm just doing my own thing and usually end up tanking it when it's on the ground. I just wish that they would include a "great katana" that in fact would be 2 handed. Or, set up dual wielding so I can really be a Ninja berserker. :)
---
This is an online game. It is constantly saving. There are no old saves. 
---
I like both, they both make me feel different things.
---
Denver's version gives me goosebumps and I'm immediately in the roaring hills of WV. Bethesda's version gets me in an adventuring mood and, I guess "hype" is too strong of a word, but yeah, gets me in that mood. Which is perfect for the game.
---
Me either
---
I didnt, but I cant believe you did!
---
Also, robots have much more obvious weakness mechanic. If you blow gutty's weapon off, which you only take a few seconds, it will self destruct, saving you tons of bullets. 
---
I have two if you'll pay 400
---
True enough, outside of raid coordinating most of my old guilds tended to be silent most of the time.  Everyone's always busy doing their own thing.
---
Because scorchbeasts reminds him he can't just build walls to keep bad things out. ;)
---
You just gotta respond back to the ticket again and again, until it's fixed. Even if CS wont solve your issue, there will be a patch fixing your char 100%. No way ur char is just corrupted forever
---
The character saves are on the servers. Unless Bethesda basically built an entire new engine, they're likely using the same save structure as before. Just with them in the servers
---
I rather secluded, only high level ghouls spawn near me so I wouldn’t worry about that. And thanks to the repair tip, had no idea. 
---
This happened to me today. Cleared the clubhouse out and a lvl 34 had heavy machine gun turrets setup. He also had his stairs blocked with a concrete barrier which was easily jumped around. I just said I was going to destroy the base on my mic and he left the server lol
---
Happened to me on X Box three times in ten minutes. Dupes will be Dupes.
---
Perhaps the intent was to make scorchbeasts a team effort, seeing as they wouldn't be able to spam multiple players at once.   In other game it's common to find an enemy that can lock you down and prevent you returning fire significantly, so you try to get a team 'tank' to take that damage while others take it down.  Maybe that's what they were going for?   If so, execution of it sucked, sure, but it's a theory at least :)
---
Just shut down. Be glad 2 do it after night though

That post is... something. But I could see why that type of an encounter would discourage people. I said it in another reply, and I am sure that it’s all over this sub, but wanted players should not even have the option to seek revenge after they are killed. That’s a very bizarre mechanic in itself.
---
I love how he goes Red. So many times I’ll be venturing somewhere new and beyond my level and all of a sudden it goes red-detected and I start spamming vats and spinning around like a vinyl on steroids trying to see what it is. Then 5 minutes later he appears behind you and scares you half to death. 
---
Umm ok.  I am sure you are right. 🙄
---
I thought I was going to find Spock in there.
---
Or, y’know, the Lone Wanderer motorcycles that already exist in the game could become driveable... always wondered why if horses exist in Skyrim and don’t break the creation engine, why they can’t give us those in Fallout. 
---
Neutron bombs, lower explosive yield while delivering high amounts of radiation over a smaller area than Hydrogen bombs.
---
Dunno, but a mole rat can chew ur concrete foundation. Go figure
---
I'm just asking if Bethesda has done anything to prevent it. Because it can easily become a big issue later on. It's happened with every game so far. People forget about it until it becomes an issue 
---
Works for everything, not just walls. Crops, decorations, etc
---
Thankyou!
---
Nice, I will keep that in mind when my purifiers break. 
---
and a piss poor one everywhere else
---
I’m back on the I’m not playing list till it’s “fixed” averaging 5 a day and always when I’m farming off Grafton steel to make my ammo

Consume them like any other consumable item as that's what I view them as  a temporary bonus item
---
I have never completed fallout 4 because of me having ideas halfway through playing and thinking “I should have got these perks” or “I should specialise in this type of weapon, this would be fun”. I must have made something like 30-40 different characters and still never stepped foot inside of the institute because I keep changing my mind. XD
---
Every single Bethesda game?  Not seeing it in ESO.  
---
&gt; People seem to forget that there was a fully functioning post-war society BEFORE we left Vault 76
---
Hell, we know Maxon's BoS was in contact with the group that became the Applachian BoS. Among everything they told them they could've just said "Hey, look, communities are eventually going to need a currency that survives the wasteland, it sounds odd but Bottlecaps work for X/Y/Z reason, try to encourage the folks you meet to use 'em so that it spreads".
---
Not to rub it in, but a lot of people would have been better off if they didn't pre-order...no? 76 is *the* game to show how bad pre-ordering can be. 
---
So yeah, don't pre-order unless it's a *limited* item. You haven't really had to pre-order since games were being shipped in from Japan. 
---
I do the same thing, haha.

All watoga except domestic tables. They are from grahm, at least. Harpers ferry and watoga Locker are different.

So glad I found y...oh my, you seemed to have soiled yourself sir...Well heres a certificate for a life time supply of cram!
---
not harder, just longer
---
ESO's engine feels as if it was better optimized than the one in 76 currently is. It's smoother with other players. 
---
Not to sound snarky, but that's not a source. It some anonymous person on Reddit saying something without evidence. No screenshot of the support ticket, and this person didn't even claim to have seen the tickets, and they are also inferring things that the supposed tickets had said even though it's about a different topic completely. I'm not saying you or anyone else is wrong here. I just haven't seen Bethesda admitting they cannot track duped items, or if they actually effect game stability or not.
---
At level 17 stay west of top of the world.  It’s meant for levels less than 35
---
That's one mighty fine bridge you got there, my dude.
---
Sounds good!
---
Brick walls blow up better
---
Yeh -&gt; lobby -&gt; Go back into game fixes it for me on the odd chance it occurs.
---
Throw an invite 2 Vextroa and ill be sure 2 add you. 
---
But it’s 2:30 in the morning! Please don’t nuke the queen. I’m not a royalist and may think the royal family is a waste of time...but she’s an old lady now. And we British seem to need the queen for tourism reasons. 
---
Add a disease or something I to have been wondering y you can drink but not smoke Jericho could in three
---
The BoS vender in Watoga and Harpers Ferry often have the building plans. There's brick, metal, barn, and factory. Also Grahm also carrier them, as I'm sure other vendors do as well. They are supposed to be "fixing" plans that vendors carry so maybe you will see them more often next week if you are having trouble finding them.
---
The only reason I pvp or do this event is to gamble for junk. It adds risk/reward and makes it more fun. If you have junk thats super important to you, especially for monster mash, there is  a stash box less than 60 seconds away walking time. I do not get what you could possibly be complaining about here.
---
Not with them but other items i have as well as the issue of storing items with wires attached before scrapping them. Hopefully some of the bug fixes for the patch comming up will fix alot of it. Something crazy like over 150 bug fixes in the single patch.
---
Gonna be good fun after.
---
well niw op is a one punch server crashing machine it seems
---
I don’t care either way, but I miss reverse-pickpocketing cigarettes onto Jericho to make him smoke.
---
Better how?
---
Blast them in the face with a shotgun. Problem solved.
---
I'll have to double check when I next log on if the budget comes back. Hopefully it does!
---
Dunno. You arent being very descriptive of what actaully occured.
---
I find it truly amazing that there is nothing anybody can do about this.  If I knew how their database was set up, I could likely create a SQL script for them to run that would solve the issue, which is the truly frustrating part.
---
MODUS out here flexing. "Lookit me, I have so many resources that I can shoot a fucking bullet-container from orbit to give people 15 5.56 rounds and some metal you can duct tape to your leg." Thanks, MODUS.
---
I just experienced that with 2 of them at once.. They broke all my better durability metal armor and proceeded to spawn camp me for a bit until I got my TSE weapon from storage and a buddy to help me kill them quickly to get my loot bag.. Pretty freaking stupid the rate at which they can fire that at you and how much dmg it does.
---
In nexusmods.com, theres a mod for naming same kind of plans. Should be a checklist in the comments too
---
lol had to google that.
---
Yeah, that's plan b for me
---
Well, aside from the violet flux there wasn't much in the Mire to be honest. Not very many enemies (a few glowing anglers and a fog crawler). Nuked pumpkin house was similar, some flux and a few ghouls. 
---
Morgantown apparently has good spawns when nuked, haven't seen that though. 
---
I check it out thanks 
---
Yea, I'm working my way through the main story at the moment. I was in The Mire fixing the Scorched detection units or whatever. Had just had a surprise visit from a rather grumpy Grafton Monster. I was actually stopped, well off the road, popping food etc and catching my breath. Suddenly flashed to "detected" and all I could think was "here we go again"
---
Yeh its shitty to go through all the holo tapes as an example, but like keys they dont weigh anything afaik.
---
or I doubt anyone uses those. If you don't have mutations, you're sleeping. 
---
Nice thanks for doing this. I’ve been a firm believer that the armor ignore perks are generally better than the damage increase perks and this seems to confirm it. 
---
Quick question any chance you could do the same thing with unarmed attacks and the brawling arm mods vs the weighted arm mods? One increases unarmed damage while the other allows unarmed and melee attacks ignore some armor but they don’t give numbers on how much of either. 
---
true but its literally inventory clutter 
---
Beautiful
---
Steel. Theres a really good vid on utube that tests all of them.
---
Ohh. I disagree. The amount of times F4 and Skyrim crashed on my PS4 is uncountable
---
Mine cost me $30 and everyone can hear me very very clearly. 
---
Angry ~~dragon~~ bat.
---
Any news for console?
---
I did this with the abandoned waste dump 4 times. Kept getting disconnected right after finishing the mission. Got a ton of loot from killing the deathclaws each time though.
---
The harsh cold of outer space followed by the intense heat upon reentry is costly yet highly desireable, for it brings about a most sublime flavor from the dog food that is fit for royalty as well as the highest ranking officers in the Enclave.
---
And the eagle! 
---
Yep glitch with chameleon effect
---
GIB PATCHNOTES ༼ つ ◕\_◕ ༽つ
---
I don't have a legendary armor piercing melee weapon or I would. Seems kind of incomplete to do it otherwise. I can do the weighted mods for amor though maybe I'll see what my friend is doing tomorrow.
---
No shit. You missed the point or ignored it. 
---
It's how they're described in game via one of the quests. /shrug
---
Have to get those dumb ass royals off of yahoo news somehow
---
The Savage Divide is like that. I moved my camp a lot while traveling, full of turrets and elevated above ground attacks.
---
If you're near the Whitespring you could always run to the robots for help.
---
lmao
---
One of the major issues with Fallout 3 &amp; New Vegas was every single detail/item was persistently saved. Dead bodies never went away, junk you stored in a trash can 50 levels ago would stay there and you even had unlimited storage capacity in your house which eventually would reach 1,000's of different items. 
---
All of that is what bloated the save files. Just like with ESO all that data is no longer saved, which in turn keeps save files at a stable size. I could be wrong, but that's what I'd bet on.
---
Equip thru hiker lvl 3 always with traveling pharmacy lvl 3. I pick up all Chems I can and sell them on my caps run at the start of each day. Only chems I keep are 
---
-stimpaks 
---
-Radaway (not diluted) 
---
-grape mentats
---
-whatever psycho drug if that’s your thing. 
---
I sell everything else. 
---
As for food to keep I’d recommend eating ionized meat. It doesn’t spoil and replenishes a lot of your food bar. 
---
Haha soooo many times Im stalking something and this D!ck comes up behind me and goes "congratulations!!" so if I ever see him now I whip out a mallet and smash him to bits.
---
Are you talking about the bug or the actual game mechanic? Because those are two very different things.
---
There’s a bug that actually causes the player model to just not be there, which isn’t cool at all.
---
There are also stealth boys and pieces of armor that generate a stealth field, but that doesn’t really do much to hide them from actual players if said players are using their eyes.
---
&gt; It’s kinda whack that there are item-specific paints only to begin with.
---
The paints are actually item-specific for a technical reason: each item's UV map is different, and even on a relatively simple paint like chrome each *part* of the weapon refers to its own texture set--there isn't one "chrome.bgsm" material file that could be applied to every single item in the game, the chrome minigun paint uses six material files, each of which paints a different part of the gun with a set of four .dds texture files (diffuse, normal, reflection, and lightmap).
---
The Creation Club counterparts packaged the paints together into sets, but they use the same data structure.
---
Try using a gun.
---
You know you want a piece of that sexy robot action. I mean that voice, her punk appearance... and I know you’ve been eyeing up her thruster. It’s okay, you don’t need to be scared. It’s perfectly normal. 
---
No, that was a mistake. 
---
It should be a piece of wooden leg armor and a tato. 
---
Going to whitesprings and anywhere further south is generally where higher level people go/farm mobs. I would generally go north/ northeast unless following a quest of some sort.
---
I went to whitesprings at lvl 25 (partly because I knew those mobs there would be super high) and found those lvl 40-60 ghouls commonly there, but took care of them with stealth and liberal application of explosives. If you know how to handle them, they are stupid easy.
---
Found that out the other day, was rather pissed when I went to remove a mod I wanted on another gun and found out it didnt end up in my inventory...
---
I was watching i love lucy on my imaginary tv in my camp, mic was simulating the tv sound.
---
I hate you.... now I have “EAAAGGGLLLLLEEE!” In my head from Turk and JD from Scrubs. You’re a monster!
---
You can. It's epic, my first pvp kill was followed up by cannibalizing them. You just have to get there before they admit defeat. 
---
Yahoo still exists? 
---
How about fix how TSE work?  We wouldn’t need 16 steps to fix.  Just one. 
---
I just want one of those lures for my camp that grounds scorchbeasts.
---
Mods that get unlocked from scrapping are random, and you don't get one everytime. You need to grind to get the best ones.
---
Sell the drugs to brobots. 
---
The way I've built my camp has a couple big branches that conveniently fit through windows, and a little bit of stone clipping through one floor.  Adds character and the reminder that its a Bethesda game. 
---
Probably on 1/14
---
There's alot of things you can eat. 
---
You cant even see anything if ur screen is full of green waves. It's ironic how the tactic should be to utilize cave-ins and walls, when they can dmg thru them
---
What does that have to do with the market? Did you mistake this for a game balance post?
---
The 7 steps are to fix the market by devaluing duped items.
---

---
Just had to crossreference with my game open on another screen
---
This game forced me to stop hoarding. Just use them straight up or save em for 5mins while you goto your next boss/farm/etc.
---
You seem concerned.  You the one selling them?
---
It still negates VATS, and sadly I don't have one of those explosives with wich you don't even need to aim.
---
Wow man I can't speak for everyone else but thank you. This has been a great read with real problems and real solutions. I've been having these thoughts lately in the future of this game And the ideas you put forth gave me a sense of calm. May not be the perfect fix but it's by far the best one I've seen. Keep up the good work! 
---
  -You're friendly neighborhood vault dweller
---
Neat.
---
so.... a patch tomorrow but no patch notes yet? ha!
---
Oh no, two whole days?! How can Bethesda ignore this injustice?!
---
But seriously, I haven't played in almost a week, because there are other games I've been playing. You don't *have to* play this game all day, every day. They are under no obligation to keep you interested. 
---
There are so many great games out there to play! Experience as many as you like, Fallout 76 will still be here when you want to come back.
---
Oh my goodness. This guy is a saint and so are you for sharing. This should be posted everywhere 
---
Super duper is your friend. 
---
Kinda?  https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/203
---
Never happened to me so I cant comment.
---
I do find them from time to time at various vendors of all differing levels though. Same goes for the rest of the legendary quest items.
---
Thanks bro! Been experiencing a lot of hate and backlash over this idea.
---
Refreshing to receive a little praise.
---
Next time you do event, kill the battle bot and then go straight to keypads the key cards you have work without having to pick up new ones.
---
Then kill the two robots inside the small building and don't loot them , press the red button in wall and event is complete.
---
I have now literally 15 of each key card really annoying for my OCD lol
---
Bethesda has been in holiday for a few weeks, and they should take their time with patches to make sure they won't break the game more than they fix it. 
---
Getting on now
---
I just completed this for the first time the other day. I was running the event solo, and got up to 30 of the bio fluids (be careful, they weigh 1 pound apiece) when the dreaded server disconnect happened. I was beyond pissed. So when I got logged back in, I noticed I still had all 30 of the fluids on me. So I thought I'd try to get the event triggered again and have a leg up on it when it started.
---
My C.A.M.P. is pretty close to the lighthouse so I just did a lot of FTing between there, CAMP, Vault 76 and the Overseer's CAMP. Did some sleeping too to pass time. Eventually after about 15 RL minutes, the event started again. I made my way back to the lighthouse--the bastards zeroed out my Bio fluids! But they're pretty easy to get and two others showed up, and we completed it. I was in awe in the Mothman's presence. I really like this event and will probably do it again.
---
Adding you - PSN TheGrandDuke
---
I have and used those perk cards before. They are useless if you have speed demon. So we need new cards. My point. 
---
Ive been eatin before so its possible. They have to be knocked but not dead.  You eat them alive. Its pretty brutal
---
want to join in on me or me on you?
---
Intresting read and a good idea, i fucking depise exploiters. They ruined our player market. This would be a good correction course. Assuming they can nail the bloody lid shut on exploiters and deter future ones with harsh punishments.
---
Mutation, disease or other random debuff? Or have you recently adjusted your perk load out?
---
Thank you for posting your idea before someone stole it from you.
---
It’s not a guaranteed chance to get a mod. Because at the start you have no mods, it means that there are lots of chances to get a mod from scrapping. But as the number of mods still needed decrease, the percentage lowers. It’s kind of like rolling a dice and needing a 6 to win a mod. You start of with 30 dice so you’ll get a fair few 6’s early on. But as the number of dice decrease, so do your chances of getting a 6. It’s just luck really. 
---
I got it but thank you for offering the help!!
---
I have the chameleon mutation. Every now and again I can move and stay invisible, but for the most part when I move I appear. There is definitely a bug where things, players, environment, and enemies dont visibly spawn in. 
---
Ahh okay, I thought it was supposed to be a guaranteed unlock every time. That makes sense, thanks
---
No. The market would self correct. The demand for TSE goes away. Don’t need new currency or a ton of other things. I agree with a level increase which is normal for most games.
---
I tend to put excess plans in the mailbox of the Responder church in Flatwoods. Lots of folks coming through there early and no item limit on the mailbox.
---
Make a mule, sell duplicate shit you get. Even plans sell for 50-1k+c aps.
---
Also, please read the title. You're point is irrelevant 
---
Dmg bobbles for scorchbeast queen, but they are rare. Stat boost bobbles I drop or use asap
---
Ive never seen so much I CANT PLAY this rage from any game ever.
---
Fact is its not your average fps fortight-esque game. The game takes skill when you first start out as a lowbie.
---
Stay out of high level areas OP. Level up then return. Like others have said the top half (western mainly) is where you need to roll. If not? Make some friends.
---
Oh and if higher level beasts move in randomly? Not today for you- Just like in a post apocalyptic world.
---
it happens to me all the time when i’m in a team. i guess if someone in your team aggros another player it aggros the whole team :( other players can kill you. 
---
I'm not sure how he didn't get a bounty. But pacifist only stops you damaging other players. It doesn't stop them damaging you. 
---
I mean I can see how this can be taken the wrong way but deep down anyone who gets mad over an idea meant to help a situation is just mad at something else in their life. Converse with the like minded wastelanders and ignore the haters is all I have to say :) but again... Thank you for taking the time to find a logical solution to this &lt;3 it is appreciated
---
Ive got electrically charged, marsupial, bird bones, eagle eye, adrenal rush, and healing factor
---
Ps this type of idea would make all their duped work in vein and my main reason for loving the idea.
---
🤢🙌💊
---
It's more like a photon torpedo with the warhead and guidance system removed, rather than a coffin. 
---
He didnt gain a bounty? I have heard people mentioning getting 1 shot while pacifist on this forum, but have never seen a clip or vid or proof. You sound actually sincere instead of someone posting to make excuses and rage though. Im not aware of any exploit, although I would not be surprised.
---
Oh shit
---
Literally every item in the game has been duped though. TSE weapons are a small portion of the problem.
---
Nope, I checked everything. Even logged out and back in, unequipped my perks and re equipped them.
---
"This game will START losing player..."!!!????? That ship sailed a long time ago OP.
---
It's random
---
His pilot license was revoked by the FAA in 1996 for his repeated DUIs. It is most likely that he was fully loaded when he ILLEGALLY flew his plane and crashed, killing only himself.
---
If arrested, it would have been a 3rd dui felony and a felony for piloting without a license while under the influence.
---
The only positive take away here is that this FELON only killed himself and no one else.
---
Has the name “FalloutGlitches” and is trying to direct you to a YouTube channel about fallout glitches and getting into a vault. It’s a very thin veil you’ve tried to mask yourself behind. 
---
Do I? Report my account. It's the same as this reddit. I'm not selling rmt. I just didn't think it was illegal but he seemed confident that it was so I was asking if he had something I could read on the matter. I'm a curious person.
---
I did. You want a perk from a different build.  If every build. If every build had the same perks then the only difference would be animations. Use a rifle if you want tank killer or ask for a different perk that makes pistol unique. 
---
You won't get banned for going in it
---
Furious melee can do it, but I have never heard of a shotty doing it. My furious 50 cal can also but it takes a long long long long time which says hrm... maybe a furious expo shotty could maybe.... will need some testing.   
---
wait, unless they stack. but I haven't tried it. 
---
I’m not sure, to be honest. Maybe Watoga. 
---
But the gun itself drops frequently from Feral Ghouls for me.
---
Limbs are limbs, it’s all four limbs. 
---
Settle down on the caps there buddy and i don't see an issue with checking out the vault. I believe Todd left a funny message inside there as well.
---
I'm fairly certain this is correct I had a similar issue a few days ago. Though I was able to kill someone else on accident while in pacifist mode. I was in a team of 3.
---
Couldnt agree more. Holotapes, keycards, keys stuck in inventory making a simple list utter confusion.
---
No and I just checked my screenshot. Player is also listed as a level 0. 
---
\-2 charisma and you fart often. 
---
Are you on pc? I can give you my metal helmet. Id have to log on to find the place i found mine, was on a farm house north east ish of vault 76
---
There shouldn't be any one shot kills with slap damage though, right? 
---
Exactly. Everyone says they want things and they dont utilize. Ptt is lame. No one speaks now!
---
Thanks man
---
Brace yourself for ppl getting upset from ur complaint. Anyway, someone higher lvl than u, spawned the mobs. Not much u can do rly, other than team up.
---
yeah and when i was a heavy pvp player, my team mate would attack someone but if i hit that same person they would turn red and i can do full damage. 
---
same way the other way around. 
---
Level 90 with a 3* TSE handmade, lvl3 rifleman, lvl 4 explosive expert, lvl 2 grenadier. It barely makes a dent in these assholes. It’s so dumb. I resolved to server hop every time I random encounter one now. 
---
I think the duping might actually be why we don't have any new content yet. They've probably been trying to figure it out but don't want to release anything new if it can be copied a million times
---
-2 agility, the itch 
---
Meat
---
Fix duping and ban people with 1000 bobble heads (just an example). They know who is duping.  It will be fixed. Expect a a post saying the have banned thousands of accounts in the near future. 
---
Its not like bethesda cares 
---
Ah damn unfourtantly I'm on Xbox but thank you for the offer really appreciate it :). I will go check those areas now thanks again 
---
Are you sure you didnt accidently drop it? Like others have said the glitching community cant replicate it.
---
I believe thats half the issue, people dont realise they drop sh!t.
---
Ive aold and dropped things accidently because of lag.
---
I.e. you hit spacebar to sell an item, but due to lag its delayed yet you move your mouse (if PC) slightly and then the game catches up and you sell the wrong fkning thing. 
---
I lost a hunters longcoat this way :(
---
Find a list of mods that are earned by scrapping (some are plans only btw) count them up double that amount and that is roughly what you should make with super duper to make sure you get all of them. That is what I would do and I have every possible now. 
---
Never...  I drop them or use them up when I find them.  Same with Magazines.
---
The reason, carry weight...
---
Aren't neutron bombs nuclear bombs? I thought they worked by forcing neutrons to move from one nucleus to the next setting off a reaction causing each one to do the same thing and each releasing a tiny amount of energy a huge number of time which adds up to a big explosion. 
---
Nope not on console
---
Very much doubt they will, but they’re old enough that they’ll pretty much run on just about any pc or laptop. I downloaded mine today on my crappy little Hp 2in1 (literally just use it for internet and YouTube/twitch etc) and they run perfectly fine.  
---
it will happen intensely tonight with a patch looming
---
Damn that really sucks, but I’m certain I didn’t drop it because I didn’t access my pip-boy or any corpses for that matter until after I saw it in his hands
---
Thanks for the info. I'll keep an eye out, this games bugs truly renders it nearly unplayable 
---
Good thing we can craft mods for OH WAIT
---
They're not coming to console. If you got them from the giveaway you can only use them on a PC or laptop. Download the Bethesda launcher and log into it with your console Beth account and you'll be able to download them.
---
Sick of these statements coming out with no proof. Screens or it didnt happen.
---
Found a level 1 legendary frog once (well my 7 YO did with great excitement) 
---
Lmao I just noticed that
---
Top of west tek has a spawn for one too
---
Home sick
---
Actually sending you in the wrong direction. North west at anchor farm. Had to look it up.hope you find it
---
Inspired
---
I try not to get it on my hands.
---
I want a radio so bad! Why would they remove it 
---
2 metal helmets on the mezzanine of top of the world one across the street on a motorcycle from the order of mystery house (you will see two mannequins it is across from them) 1 can also be found at the snow lodge west of top of the world those are the 3 spot I know of.   
---
If on xbox I can also make you one for free it is like 4 or 5 steel. 
---
Technically they already have a fail safe in effect. They fix current dupe glitches then raise level cap of weapons to 75 and add a star. If they find new glitches then raise to level 100 and add a star. By then they should have patched all possible ways of duping. The caps argument is invalid to a point. I can  loot Fort Defiance, solo, in a little under an hour. Collecting everything. I usually find enough straight jackets alone to collect my daily 1400 caps. Not to mention the almost 200 weight of junk. If you raised the cap limit or change the currency people can use this same method on alt characters and still generate basically unlimited caps or whatever currency you switch to. Basically caps are already easy to get, duping/exploiting is just a little quicker.
---
Brilliant, ty!
---
I have never wanted to do something more than I now want to do this. Brb, role playing as a space marine from now on
---
They said they’d release the patch notes also at 9am🤷🏼‍♂️
---
The amount of power armor pieces I scrapped thinking "oh, it just must be rare to get a mod" is insane. Nothing, you literally get NOTHING for scrapping power armor pieces.
---
Which makes me wonder why the fuck they loaded up an orbital missile platform with dog food.
---
The drugs do not surprise me.
---
Exactly! It's gotta play the theme song at least !
---
It thinks it is pennies
---
ahh different then the one I was thinking of, that must have been swamp gas. 
---
Gotcha. Still appreciate the data. I have an antiarmor knuckles with 40%+ power attack. And a 40% better swing speed plus anti scorched meat hook. And I keep trying to convince myself one is better than the other but they really seem to be about on par depending on the situation. Sadly I don’t have anyone to test the numbers with. And have no clue on the numbers the arms give. 
---
He didn't even try. 
---
yes haha, i probably should’ve mentioned what it actually was. which disease were u thinking of?
---
watoga bos vendor has it. might need to hop a little.
---
Juke box has a mind of its own... O_o
---
My camp is also a covered bridge... except mine is two stories. The top is my hous the bridge below is full of traps and turrets. 
---
I’m not sure but I see people talk about leaving the area, etc.
---
I don’t want it to go completely to waste. There’s some OCD part of me that won’t let that go.
---
never even said i was thankful. Not hating on the bethesda does not mean im a big fan of what they're doing but if you're telling me i should hop on the bandwagon and hate on them like every other imbecile then no thank you. the game has its flaws but daily challenges are not one of them.
---
i got mine from defending a workshop. Sold I would guess maybe savage divide vendors? 
---
Now most that bloaty environment stuff is part of the server instance, separate from your save. Those servers crash a few times a day and we get fresh, restarted, bloat-free servers. The Whitespring goes back to its intended population size. NPC's and turrets stop dropping dead at random.
---
Though there are some known character-corrupting bugs, like if you dig up a lot of treasure maps.
---
Sweet Jesus cinnamon tittyfuck, you are a god for laying out this info for the public. May your good works never be forgotten.
---
Well I wrote my own ideas and others seem to like it.
---
Holy shit can you imagine how many resources they waste per attempt to... waste our time?  
---
Unless MODUS values humor as the most efficient result, for an AI concerned with efficiency, it is extremely inefficient.
---
Yea I bought them of the Watoga BoS Bot just a day ago
---
I just love the premise that Mr. Prize Bot is scarier than any of the cryptids in the game.
---
-20 to agility as your ass leaks 
---
Spammimg the same vid too.
---
That channel must be dying if it's that lazy
---
this sounds like some weird clickbait
---
Probably not even possible. The way they work, requires a mouse to function. Porting then would require the games to be fully remade from the ground up. 
---
Ya lots of people including myself are having that issues with phantom stored purifiers. Bethesda is aware if the issue so hopefully it's one of their fixes.
---
Yep, same here. Not to mention all the weapons that SEEM to have mod slots but it turns out there are either no mods for, or one. And no way to know when to stop wasting weapons and mats. Poorly done all around.
---
probably better with the dysentery since that’s literally diarrhea LMAO 
---
Given that there really is no downside to the attacker, there is very little reason not to destroy every camp you come across other than just not being a dick. Needs to be a higher negative for the attacker. 
---
I had a rocket house take a lot of my farm yesterday so I annihilated the camp with 5 orbital strike grenades. I had a 260 cap bounty after. Someone else killed me soon after and I continued on my way. The guys camp would cost way more than 260 caps in value to repair.
---
Downvoted for invisibility

Addictions don't show on the effects screen

Are you level 50? I might have some heavy metal legendary armor im trying to get rid of. Ill be on soon to tell you for sure.
---
If you need some radaway or stimpacks, let me know.
---
That's what I'm hoping for. It's just the fact that it survived into FO4 is why I'm worried about it 
---
Basically 
---
Fun fact: Trump's brother, Robert Trump, sits on Bethesda's Board of Directors.
---
And bugs like those are odd too, but probably just the servers being overloaded too quickly. At least, I hope it's just a server malfunction with it
---
Handmade has plans for both. I would assume all the other assualt rifles are the same. 
---
there is no way they would ban that many. The most serious offenders, the ones selling for cash those are the ones they will ban.   
---
Most companies will buy items from these people just to find out who they are their main account and their IP then do a mass ban. That scares the normies that dupe into not doing it anymore and they removed the worst offenders.   
---
Also under that to many people would be caught in the crossfire. I have picked up thousands of treasure maps as I found a dupers stash, I have picked up so much stuff from random places that I use a mule to store it. I am not duping but I am liberating their items for myself.   
---
Don’t let your reality get in the way of my fantasy!🤪
---
How does this fix selling duped ammo, materials, misc tab items and consumables though? Gear is only a part of the problem.
---
&gt; Basically caps are already easy to get, duping/exploiting is just a little quicker.
---
Yes they are. The reason why I put **everyone** in bold on #3 is because not everyone knows the methods of farming caps easily. We need everyone with max caps to truly make duped vanilla items worthless.
---
It’s my favorite quote from him. My friend was with him earlier and started complaining about it. Our other friend in the party wasn’t listening and started losing it when the other friend was mocking him by listing off meat too.

I've been to mama dolce's and the university during a nuke and it was literally unchanged and barren of ghouls

I find her annoying after a while.

Those games were designed with that as a core feature. It's something you have to build for, not just slap it into place after the fact.

the voice chat was wild when i proved my friend i can get one of those cakes
---
So when do you think we'll get to see the actual post notes?
---
My guess is that it's meant to be an anti-cheesing tactic, although it's a very crude one.
---
Well yeah, but basic writing principles would ALSO have you assume your conclusion is the last section of you you wrote. Your intro was "This is what I like, but others want it this way". Your body was "Why are people like this". Your conclusion was "Others shouldn't be able to do that"
---
So yeah, reading comprehension would ALSO indicate the actual point you were making was that FO76 shouldn't allow perk card swapping. Once I looked at it from your point of view it made perfect sense. Upon first reading though, the questions in the middle appeared to be waxing eloquent about the state of people's behavior.
---
Yes I am and that would be amazing! I'll pay you for them of course. Deffo let me know :) 
---
Maybe don't let the desire for revenge on a fictional entertainment platform consume you.

Either seek revenge in real life or just carry on playing in spite of the jerk that stole your scraps.

Lol I have my camp near Charleston. 
---
Cats, squirrels, opossums, beavers, chickens, ragstags all frequent. 
---
I see them every time. 
---
Welp, I did try urging them to set up a Beta patch program to prevent regression bugs and other breakage. I just didn't expect them to include literally every PC user, lol.
---
I don't wanna sound like one of these complainers bitching about everything... but...
---
You'd think with the short "story" we got, we would have at least got really awesome weapon customization to make the end game varied and interesting, hunting down different mods and trying them all out, mix matching and all that.
---
I was very sad when the already low damage MG42 (Light Machinegun) only had like 2 mods for it.
---
Damn, I left my peer reviewed studies, empirical data and graph sets in my other pants. I forgot this sub reddit had academic standards of conversation, like at a university. I thought it this was just a place people browse on there phones whilst taking a shit. I apologise profusely for my error.
---
Wait a second!! If I look at your post history I see all sorts of, well, what I can only describe as your disgusting, unsupported opinions. Ugh, this is reddit man, you need to back your shit up. I can see you making all kinds of statements without presenting any credentials, or references!!! I am disgusted and appalled at the standard of your scholarship.
---
Its annoying, but the games really weren't made with a controller in mind. It would be a little cumbersome to play them without a mouse.
---
Holy shit fallout and 40k this is the greatest day of my life. 
---
Thank you very much I'll go check these areas quick and if I have no luck mind if i message you? Ill have the steel for it :)
---
Yet you hold on to the items when all you have to do drop on ground and log off to delete. You are a part of the problem by storing on a mule.

Personally, I’ve collected all 17 holotapes, the 18th unnecessary holotape from the bed and breakfast, and all of the overseers personal logs. Despite collecting every single holotape, the quest still won’t clear for me.

It's based on your armour. Did you change armour?

150 new bugs*

I'd just be happy if the lockpick and hacker cars were merged into one card so I don't have to go searching for them every time I want to use a lvl 3 terminal or lock.
---
It's not just ps4... I only freeze in an inventory menu as well. On Xbox. It's not a platform issue it's the game in general
---
Below a certain level, Scorchbeasts are just not tenable to fight.  You end up running away.  I like it, actually - how there's this big bag enemy that you can't do much of anything about.
---
Above a certain level, especially with crippling perks, you can take down Scorchbeasts methodically.  Crippling their head makes their spam far less accurate, and crippling their wings prevents them from flying at all.
---
Awesome thanks. Anyway we could get a link to it? I don't have Twitter and I'll be in the field all day tomorrow for training.
---
You should continuously crash servers until Bethesda has to do something about it.
---
This explains the kind benefactor who must have given me 20k in ammo, 7 mini nukes, 30 missles, 100 40mm grenades and countless other useful items. I always thought that was an extremely large amount of items for a level 4 to get from an in game cache.
---
Also, if you have a berserker weapon equipped, it will effects the damage of other weapons when you look at them
---
It's not bad. Run Martial Arts with it, add prime, and you have a pretty good backup weapon.
---
I have no idea what the final boost is. It seems to be slightly better than my Zealot's Laser Gatling and the ultracite fusion cores are pretty cheap.
---
Blade of Bastet, IMO...   100% reduction of armor and resistances makes it deceptively powerful.  
---
&gt; All software has bugs
---
You've never seen my hello world program 
---
Theres server and ur client in the middle. No way other player can access other player's inv.
---
It's because the RNG is completely broken. Some people have TSEs drop left and right and the best others can get are assassin, nocturnal or zealot? That's not random, that's bullshit. And no, I'm not talking about dupers. I ran with a friend through Whitesprings the other night and every single legendarie we came across we had different loot. He got 2 TSEs (Gauss and Shotgun) and I got 1 Nocturnal and 1 Assassin. The other crap isn't worth mentioning because more often then not they don't even have a legendarie on them when you drop them because one shotting doesn't seem to trigger the correct loot tables. Everything about the loot distribution in this game is just weird.
---
Especially at $1 per 100 atoms...
---
None of those mods are suppose to lower resistances 
---
Game crashes and server disconnects usually have different causes.
---
*usually*
---
I bulk a few specifics components like acid/aluminum/lead/springs but otherwise limit it to 50 of each type
---
I think the most impressive part of this story is the fact that it's one sentence, a number which coincides with your English grade level.
---
So if I'm understanding you then, it is 'shared' loot, and I should be able to watch my friend grab a plan in front of me, and not be able to pick it up myself, and what is 'effectively' happening, is the game tracks if YOU picked up the object, and loads it if you didn't.  
---
However, if someone else loads into an area 'first' then you go to the same spot, they will 'generate' a new spawn for the location if they haven't already farmed it previously, and you can grab thier iteration of the same object. This would mean that with 'two' players, one to load in before you who never picks anything up, and a second to farm the location off the other persons spawns, you could farm the same location indefinitely.   
---
I'm implying a lot because you didn't explain in detail what you do, so please tell me if I'm grossly incorrect or misunderstanding. I'm going to do some tests based on this interpretation now in case it's correct. 
---
&gt;  I waited 10 years for a koop/mmo bethesda game.

They released an MMO 5 years ago. You may not like ESO, but it still exists.

Thank you very much.

Go with steel, I have both and it’s easier to find steel than concrete and it’s stronger.
---
Yes true visited a silo for first time way back got the Holo tape screaming at me what did I do lol...I was like I didn't do anything yet I'm lvl 17
---
There is an interval to it. I'd guess around 3-5 minutes, judging from how much progress I've lost when the server crashes. And support has said they lack the tools to look at character inventory.
---
All of those things are intentional deterrents for raiders. We knew it was the only way to hit home.
---
What players? Noone plays F76 exept some die-hard bethesda fans right now. Game in it's current state is in barely playable state. Bugs pierce it even in basic things, like lighting, gameplay, leveling, animations, controls, optimisation etc. It's actualy smart to wait a year or so, untill some of the most crazy bugs will be fixed. F 76 is somewhat solid game in terms of exploration, but everything exept this is hardly can be seen as working as intended. Game needs drastic fixes, not only bugs, but in terms of gameplay and tech as well.

I'll take electrically charged...

 IGN?
---
Ayyy, thanks man! I wouldve rebuilt my database if I knew how to, but now that I do time to go and give it a shot!
---
Yeah, he’s not that clever or patient. First time his place got nuked he packed up and went back to the savage divide.  I’m going to miss that free fast travel to those vendors.
---
Upload screenshot please, someone else reported seeing a 0 level player on PS4 (tho I suspect it was actually a high 1000+ level player with the level getting cut off, they didnt have a screenshot)
---
Yeah, figured as much
---
The resistances shown by the Awareness perk reflects your armor penetration. I’m not meaning to say that it reduces their resistances for others. 
---
I don't think it affects those values, I think it just ignores a percentage of them
---
metal helmet spawns at anchor? farm just beside vault 76 as well , safer spot for lower levels
---
😤😂😍
---
It is only fitting that someone talking about the lamenters would have responder flair
---
I use it on low level enemies to save my preferred ammo outside of that.
---
Swamp GAS it caused me to fart and have the -2 charisma. 
---
I shouldn't have to farm a weapon i dont want to use or have no fun with just to kill a monster. I have never had a shotgun with my melee character so i have no mods and i havent even seen one in quite a while. Not saying it won't work but its poor game design when you make something nearly impossible to kill with the way someone wants and force them to play a way they do not want. Im sure if i swiched up my play style and farmed for perks i dont want or will never use unless im fighting scorched, but if i want to use my play style i wont be having a shotgun with me at all times, and i wont always have the perks equipped. I shouldn't have to stop and switch perks and weapons while getting bombarded with screeches just to kill a giant bat. 
---
In that case I would say visual.  People have done testing to see how much armor pen these mods offer theu work fine
---
Thank you!
---
As much as I'd love that, nobody would ever use cosmetic apparel then, unless it gave some stats similar to the rad suit.
---
Related to this, when I unlocked her radio station, I thought it might function as an alternative to Appalachia Radio.  They could have most of the songs in common, but on hers, she'd be the DJ and maybe have a couple exclusive songs.  Something to listen to when you don't care for what Appalachia Radio is playing (or vice versa).
---
But it's really not, unfortunately.
---
Yeah it's a drag.. granted I spend most my time helping low lvl players and giving them outfits and other random stuff so I'm always in my inventory and I always freeze.. it sucks that I get fucked over cause I like helping people lol

oh my god, i didn’t pay attention to the effects idek what swamp gas even does 😂😂

Big facts 
---
I just kinda feel like this is someone complaining about someone else farming a spot better. You're both going there to do the same thing, they just have a more effective means. Idk, this just doesn't make any sense to me.
---
Lol nice.
---
Exactly. It's extremely easy to just locate the character connected to the gamertag and view the inventory. This no tool bullshit is irrelevant and a cop out.
---
Damn, sorry man I mustve gotten rid of them, but I can make you heavy chest and legs if you got the materials. (I somehow have lost all of my steel)
---
They also can shoot them where they aren't looking. So when they are flying away from you during their loops/figure eights, they are constantly spamming you from... somewhere.
---
Extremely poorly designed enemies.
---
It would be a massive development cost to port something only to give it away for free. It won't happen
---
Awesome, thank you, I will add a note about the level 3 locked safe. I believe in general safes with high level locks stand a good chance of generating plans, but I haven't verified this yet, and am not 'entirely' sure how I would go about doing it other then keeping tedious track of every safe and location I interacted with.
---
I just give all my junk and caps to my second account and level the whole place when I find a base like this. I’m hoping they come defend it cause with no junk and no caps I got nothing to lose. 
---
Excellent post.  Now where do I get this endangerol?
---
Fuck your stupid wall trump
---
Yeah I have screenshots, but since I'm on Xbox I have to wait for the Xbox Server to upload them before I can pull them and add them to the a sharing platform and then link it. Unfortunately it's a long process, and doesn't upload fast when I'm actually in game. They will be appended with images in the future however. 
---
Thats fine but the issue is i dont like shotguns and dont have any perks for them. Why should i have to waste my time farming for things i dont want just to kill a worthless monster who won't give me anything good, and wont stop chasing me until im dead? I have a play style i enjoy that the devs put in place and i have fun with it, until i meet one monster then i just get angry and annoyed. If i wanna beat the monster ill have to lug around equipment i would never use otherwise and farm perks i would never have otherwise. Thats poor game design. 
---
The cake is a lie
---
So it turned from much more worse to just worse? Damn at this rate we might get a complete working game in a year. 
---
I will update the post to verify that a recipe at the very least can be found there. Thank you.
---
Oh well drops suck. Nothing worth doing at high level 165
---
We’re they possibly overrepaired? That will increase the damage until the return to the normal durability
---
Craft and break down syringers. *this guy said that it is bugged right now. Soooo, I've swapped over to a Rad scorpion barrel for 40 bleed damage over 10 seconds, but may swap to the bloatfly barrel just for fun
---
Good idea.
---
I've been nearly crash free and a couple of dcs since the last patch.
---
But i run lean and never go encumbered and my stash rarely goes over 500.
---
Yeah. And walking cane and normal sledge paints? Where's my fire axe and super sledge paints?
---
NO BANS, BUT THE FBI IS ALREADY ON THE WAY
---
Nope, haven't changed anything in a few days. Damage was fine yesterday when I was playing. 
---
Or a debut like the gas mask
---
? I am part of it because I use a mule?   Well if Bethesda didn't cap storage it wouldn't be a problem. I mean come on server stability due to storage my ass. I have been on servers where I know of at least 18 people that had used the stash glitch and has over 100k in weight in it.   
---
Oh not to mention the fact that my house is over 300% budget because Bethesda can't code right, no one is laggy at my place and it is right at the golf course with a ton of travelers. Hell if it is in a nuke zone even more shit going on.   
---
This is the first Fallout with an artificial storage so I mule. Oh and I doubt if you found what I have found you just drop it into the world don't kid yourself it is a fucking game there is no morality unless you are roleplaying. 
---
Impressive
---
I never use chems though
---
How do I get blue and gold paint? Is it the Atomic shop ones?
---
Overrepaired? Is that a thing? How does one even do that?
---
You’re complaining about people complaining, and criticizing people for voicing their opinion. Not sure what you’re trying to accomplish here. If you like the game, play it. Just think of the bad PR as incentive for BGS to improve their game and be more careful about future titles.
---
Huh, sounds good, I have the ultra cite Gatling laser not the prime version. I’ll check it out and get some mods.
---
Okay it might be related but I'm on PC - I'll say it anyway - my game started crashing all the time one day - I searched reddit around concerning all the things it might have been and stumbled across "charged barrels" on my tesla rifle.  Sure thing, I changed out the charged barrel for a normal one and I've not had a crash since.    SO crashes COULD be item related, on any platform really.
---
Or a debuff like the gas mask
---
A perk card called weapon artisan, intelligence 
---
I admire the fact that you never go encumbered AND that your stash isn't full 😄😄😄
---
I still have a long way to go 😔😔😔
---
Okay that explains literally all of the Fallout 76 hate right there.
---
Yes you are a part of the problem if you find duped items and keep them. Balls to talk about fixing the problem while contributing to it. 
---
You might as well. Bethesda stated that they fixed exploits involving caps stashes. So apparently finding a good caps stash route is exploiting their game. Any exploit can get u banned. What they consider exploit, only they know. So dont do it if u care for ur acc
---
I don't think I have that but I'll check.
---
Try equipping a non berserker weapon and look at damages, then equip it and look at damages and see if that effects anything. Is it possible you haven't looked at the numbers when you've had berserker weapon equipped? They generally drop your damage unless you have really low resists
---
"Just stash your junk" isnt a solution the the issue I'm seeing, the junk thing is just what made me think about the pvp events. Maybe I explained it poorly, I often get lost in my train of thought when writing, but its more about how pvp events are separate from the "tension factor" pvp in the game, where the devs want you yo be a bit on edge when you see players because you arent sure if they are hostile or not. That completely changes when you know they are hostile or not(when you enter a pvp event you know who is friend or foe), and I think then rules and gameplay should change as well. 
---
My philosophy behind pvp in games is that all players should start on the same footing, and have the same risk/rewards. I know the optimal choice is to stash your junk before playing, but what about players who didnt stash their junk? Sure, its their fault for playing at a disadvantage, but its would be more FUN(games are supposed to be fun, right?) if the restrictions were lighter for special events that hardly get filled in the first place. The rewards for the pvp events arent worth going to my stash to play(monster mash is an exception with the train station literally next door, i know), and I know its a non-issue to take a minute to drop off your screws before but still I'd rather just skip the event, and not play. And I do that. I guess the reward vs time spent arent good enough for me. I spent like 20-30 minutes playing monster mash and got like 400 pieces of candy. Im not playing 4+ hours of that to get the max prize(a 1 star item if my googling is the be believed).
---
Maybe im not end-game enough to start playing pvp events. Maybe pvp events just arent my thing, maybe they just suck. I dunno. Clearly im in the minority so far here, and thats fine, my goal was to see what everyone else thought, so goal achieved.
---
 I'm not complaining, I just wanted to see what other people thought. I don't expect changes to be made to the game about this, and if they did get made, it would be such a low priority that it wouldn't be seen for months if not years. Just hypothetical here.
---
Good Job!
---
I'll try that. That may be what happened as I just hit 45 yesterday and was able to equipped it right before I logged off.
---
The image of people that actually like the game is being hurt because they’re seen as stupid fanboys, and Bethesda of course. We defend it because we like it, but we accept it has its problems, the line has been crossed and it’s just beating a dead horse at this point. You tubers will just be like “Bethesda bad!” When they can’t have an idea for a video. They’re just bearing a dead horse at this point and it’s just over the line because if that. Sorry for the late response. Forgot about this
---
You may be on to something. In fact, I have a tesla rifle in my inventory so maybe specific items could be the cause...
---
Nice Catch! I'll have to experiment tomorrow!
---
Maybe you should... take the.. Calmex. 
---
 On a side note I would love if people would stop promoting using glitches for this game. Even this is a problem till its fixed, I can pvp rampage and then use the glitch like this guy is talking about and just hide from everyone. Yes I watched the video. 
---
I came down the elevator at Top of the World and met, in the lobby, a radscorpion (???) a good 60 levels higher than my character and my half-suit of janky Raider PA wasn't much protection against a critter I could barely scratch, so I ran. I ran (serpentine, I ain't no Rickon) down the mountain. It followed me. I jumped off the cliffside. It popped up out of the damn ground partway down. I kept running. I paused between Horizon's Rest and the radio tower. It came up from the ground there. I ran to the river, stopped to see if I was safe, got attacked AGAIN and at this point I just had to exit the game. I don't know where the line between thrilling and fun is, but I believe I stepped off the elevator about three miles the other side of that line.

Good luck and grats on 45

How do you transfer items to a mule?

I drop a lot of ammo/legendaries (armor and weapons) in the white hamper in the "3"spa room. Also, in the registers of the workshop store, the spa, ect.  They have unlimited storage. I'm a hoarder but a giver so if on Xbox, check those😁 I also only drop my spoiled foods in the toxic water in the spa. Back up in the corner like a cat..... 💩

depends on a lot of factors I think base with how my perks are right now is 60 or 67. my two shot is 128. I'm not on to look sorry.

And you don’t get damage from her wing slaps. But hope she didn’t eat any beans...lol
---
It's easier to load up the perk that gives you 2 items per harvest (Green thumb), then go collect fluxes in nuked zones. Can easily harvest over 60 fluxes in 30 minutes and saves you running around trying to find chem boxes.
---
With Bargaining at rank 2 fluxes sell at 10c each, 20 = 200cp
---
Been happening since online games introduced inventories.
---
Tbh that's a bit better for me as my raider is level 10 and I'd be able to use that armour and get the look I want for that toon. I should deffo have the mats for you, what's needed and I'll double check now. Was wondering if you was able to make me a level 10 set and a level 50 set? 
---
Ask a mate to lend a hand.

I’ll paste a picture soon.  There’s a note in there as well, a chemistry work bench, a trailer, a few computer desks, and some random small level containers.

Once you enter, there is a red exit button that opens the door, meaning anyone can be let in by anyone else that manages to enter.

Better Be worth it Bethesda. youve had a nice holiday away from the controversy so lets hope the bad shit gets sorted as i dont wann deal with dupers and every person shooting at you with 2se weapons almost killing you without activating PVP.

Best of luck hope to see you all out there :).

Worrying about ammo and consumables is only for new players. I wouldn't pay someone for ammo or stims when I can make enough to last me a week in less than an hour. And, seeing that this is strictly from an economic standpoint, if caps are easy to get and people carry over a stash of duped items to sell for caps then eventually they will sell off thier inventories anyway. Once they fix the glitch that its.
---
The bobblehead issue can be remedied by simply making it where the effects dont stack.
---
I wouldn't be against the alt currency idea though. People have suggested that vending machines only accept prewar money and the like. Making the new camp/player vendors only accept the new currency would be okay with me. 
---
If I understand your point correctly the making where new players couldnt trade for the old stuff at all would also be a good solution in my opinion. 
---
Nice, as another thing to maybe add to this for the Scorchbeast Queen, the total number of monsters, and the amount of health of the Scorchbeast Queen appears to be directly tied to the level of the player who activates the Scorched Earth event.   
---
I didn't realize this until after I was over level 130, and wondered why every time I launched the nuke and started the event the Queen seemed WAY more OP then when my lower level counterparts did it. Turns out I was screwing everyone.  
---
Good tip is let the lowest level player activate the event, makes it easier. Also the quality of loot doesn't appear effected by the level of the player who activated the event, at least not yet.
---
I badly want to stop buying duplicate plans, if that is in I will be happy.

Uh oh better watch out before the sanctimonious pricks come in and bash you for muling as part of the problem this game faces.

Good day. I don’t give a shit about your morals. When you get caught in the mass banning for “finding” duped items don’t bitch. You have shown your true colors by “justifying “ your cheating because of other bugs.  Thanks for truly caring about solving the duping problem. 🤣🤔🙄

Awesome, yeah I should probably just add that to the original post, if people give me screenshots I can just add them, and won't need to verify the post.

upvote for a common wasteland sickness, swamp ass

Haha thx. When the stash was 400 i came close but i realized, like in every previous fallout game,  i hoarded stuff i never used so i stopped.
---
Plus my buddy that weight exploited quit because he crashed none stop.

Was so bad he couldn't even get rid of stuff to be able to salvage his character.

Bulk Acid, Aluminum, and Lead, everything else limit it to 50 of each unless you're collecting to craft something specific. Acid bulking changes 10 acid into 15 acid FYI so great way to get more acid for smelting ores.

What’s with the randomly losing health when you have no ill effects , well fed and hydrated ? Spawn after spawn it quickly drains and I die. Ran into this “top of the world” and  “hornwright estate”. Had to log off and lose my stash. 
---
I wanna be clear here that you're moving the goal posts. You were skeptical of shotguns and Enforcer, and I went out of my way to pick up a low level shotgun and Fraps a video for you. Now you're saying well, a shotgun, one perk card, and a handful of shells is a waste of your time.
---
You're asking for your melee build to be effective at everything. Well you can. For the low low price of literally one Agility perk card.
---
Consider what you're saying: You absolutely hate that your current build cannot effectively deal with this one end game enemy, but you refuse to commit one perk from your build to deal with it.
---
What are you farming? You carry a shotgun - any shotgun - and you find shells through the normal course of play.
---
Builds should, as a matter of "good" game design, have tradeoffs. Frankly ranged players tend to carry decent backup melee weapons with a point or two in Incisor; this is not some overwhelming burden on melee players.
---
Perhaps
---
best to have a friend put items in world storage or trade with said friend force quit game rejoin on other character. Force quit acts as a DC so you can rejoin with team instead of dancing through the hoops to get back to your buddy. 
---
Probably the first suggestion post I’ve liked. This actually makes a lot of sense and is impactful on the game.
---
i’d have swamp ass too if i was trudging my ass up and down WV 
---
It may be worth considering downloading the fallout map and making edited bright markers for easy reference, vs an interactive map 
---
150 fixes claimed by the same stating 16 times the detail 
---
It messes up if you don't place it on a flat surface
---
it actually spins and you can hit it to speed it up, so it has physics, so any slant bugs it because bethesda
---
you probably had it perfectly straight or something the first time
---
It should work after they implement the update 
---
Omg that was it!!! Thank you so much!!! I thought I was crazy!
---
I said Good day sir.
---
It's not like on PC most people dont already have them, right?
---
Btw, theres a list of all diseases as a challenge to acquire them all. 
---
When's the last time you played? lol
---
No worries, I was wondering what you could get out of it in the best case senario, I have a ts .50 but no heavy perks yet.
---
Im currently running a rifle build with tse gauss along with radicool and nerd rage and have gotten as high as 2400 but Im getting bored with it.
---
So did I. Doesn’t mean your right. 
---
Andall the PC cash dupers and dev room hoppers are rushing into the game now to get one last hoo rah off. 
---
Just repaired stuff.
---
How'd you get a lead extractor in your camp?
---
You could build in there???
---
StEaLtH BoI
---
haha i saw that, i wasn’t big on doing the challenges but i think i might 😂 
---
Not sure about Luck Break.. But only your Intelligence effects crafted items.
---
Vic 20?
---
The SBQ is definitely tied to the level of the player. But, I say just make it as hard as possible. What is the fun in defeating a weak boss unless it's just for speed farming.
---
It's absolutely stupid that you don't automatically scrap beer bottles because you can craft with them, but hardened mass gets scrapped. 
---
Berserker is a shit effect, it will be negative dmg if  u are in PA. And a bit better if naked. Could be that. 
---
Consumables is a temporary problem because you know they are consumed. 
---
Is the tse 10mm 2* or 3*
---
An Anti-Armor Minigun was the bane of my existence. It seemed like once every 4 opens of the stash or pipboy .... Boom, crash.
---
People really complain about mules 
---
The engine being "old" has little to do with anything. DirectX, which is the API between the graphics card and the games graphics engine is "super old". Windows itself is "super old". C and C++ are super old languages (though not dinosaurs quite yet). Lots of modern day game engines are just improvements upon older game engines. Most modern operating systems (pretty much all that are mainstream), aren't recreated from scratch every year. They improve upon the old. Seriously, hardly any software is developed by saying "lets scrap everything we worked on before and recreate everything from scratch."
---
Non-programmers like to think everything has to be recreated from scratch. Actual programmers know that you don't do that if you ever want to get anything out of dev and into production. You don't want to constantly reinvent the wheel. You don't usually want to obsess over performance of every section of code (code readability and maintenance is far more important), but when you do have to have sections of highly performant code (which is common in game engines obviously), and you have hard to understand-at-a-glance sections, you better have some good documention for when you come back to that section to fix something 2 years later...because we all are excellent at commenting our code \*eyeroll\*.
---
There's no phones,
---
No lights,
---
No motorcar.
---
Not a single luxury!
---
I literally wanted to include this but I thought it was just me lol
---
I know how to do it. By the same way you counter everything in this game: a TSE. 
---
Balance, baby!
---
Better be fixes for all the dupe exploits and the removal of all duped items or it doesn't matter a whole lot.
---
Thanks I spit out my coffee
---
Oh that gauss will have better up front damage for sure fun for sniping and solo play. But it is nothing like the 50 cal in the long run. I was a rifler for a while on my main until I tried a  ts 50 cal on the queen I found and was like wow, then I bought a shit ton of 1 star two shot 50s for dirt cheap from various people for 100-300 caps each while everyone was looking for TSEs (pre dupers everywhere) and have been a heavy gunner ever since. 
---
If you like hoarding legendary items I highly recommend making an alt to transfer to. I have 2 dozen friends I've never talked to (which is common for me for some reason) just so I can reconnect to a map and transfer stuff via a 0 capacity cabinet (my only real friend and favorite NPC in the game). If you have future builds planned, make the base level 2 characters and move the items over. Be prepared to lose stuff once in a while with that method as people sometimes ~~quit the game~~ crash or disconnect in the 15-20 seconds it takes to swap characters. This has the side affect of being able to give those alts stuff to sell once you've capped your primaries daily sales.
---
So with pretty much no weapons or armor in my stash here's the priorities I use to reduce back to 400 when I hit 600. This is mostly in order, although I never remember to do it all in this order.
---
**Crafting**
---
* Smelt all of your rotten stuff into fertilizer and dump the remainder.
---
* Convert all of your ore using acid.
---
* Cook all meat and produce so you can get rid of non-perishable foods and use up water.
---
* Craft merged drugs, Stimpacks, and other regular drugs.
---
* If you don't care about the things they make scrap all Beer Bottles, Molerat Teeth, Circuit Boards, and Deathclaw Hands.
---
* Craft bullets. You might think you have enough, but if you have guns, you don't. If you don't use lead in repairs, use all your lead this way.
---
* Repair your own stuff. (This should be done first, probably. I usually forget until now. Good thing I don't use lead in repairs.)
---
* Bulk up Aluminum and Lead.
---
* Repair all expensive armor and weapons you intend to vendor.
---
**Shopping**
---
* Sell Non-Perishable food. It just ends up adding up over time, dump it and cook better food for buffs.
---
* Bulk up and sell most junk so you only have 5-10 of each in bulk. 5 of rarely used and 10 of what you repair with. I'm a non-power armor user so I only keep Adhesive, Acid, Plastic, Wood, and Ballistic Fiber in 10's.
---
* If you keep having non-bulking junk hit over stacks of 100, sell the individual back down to 50 (Because Vendors will buy most non-bulkable items). It's usually good for 50-70 caps per stack. I constantly sell Yarn, Crystals, Silver, and Circuits; 50 of each cleans out 1 vendor. Keep all plastic for bulking more items for sale.
---
* **Sell chems** that don't match your build. Melee build? Sell your Calmx. Sniper build? Maybe dump some fury. Keep 5 of each for posterity?
---
* Check your Misc tab for burnt books and such. They sell for 1 cap each and have weight.
---
* If you are not in the habit of using mines, sell them as well. They're good, but if you never use them they are just dead weight.
---
* Bobby pins. You shouldn't need more than 30-40 on hand. 100 bobby pins are 10 pounds.
---
**Dump/Transfer/Use**
---
\*Leave things in cash registers, garbage cans, or suit cases at shop vendors to help out your fellow 76er's.
---
* If you don't use the weapons dump, Missles, Mini Nukes, .50 Cal Balls, Cannonballs, Harpoons, Crossbow Bolts, Flares, Railway Spikes, Plasma Cores, 40mm Grenades, 2mm EC, Gamma Rounds, Cryolator, Flamer Fuel, and Paddle Ball String. You can find/craft more in the future if you need it, even that smaller size ammo is 1lb per 100.
---
* Any Fusion Cores under 50%. If you have 3 at 100% that's all you should need. I can't even give fusion cores away to PA users I meet.
---
* Scrap Steel that you couldn't bulk. If you hit 200 Scarp Steel you're hoarding wrong. If you need more steel and can't find it, you haven't left the vault yet and don't need to be reading this.
---
* Books and Bobble heads you'll never use. (See "Sell chems" above)
---
* Left over Rotten and Spoiled foods.
---
**Other Things**
---
* With junk in your inventory, go to the junk tab in your pip-boy and go to component view. Tag what you always need/want and only grab that junk when out. This will reduce the speed at which you fill your stash
---
* Consider using Nuka-Cola's as a replacement for Stimpacks. They weight the same but build up over time. Save the Stimpacks for when you really need them.
---
* Connected with the above, consider Traveling Pharmacy. Even 1 level will let you just stack bunches of 1lb chems in your inventory. At level 3 100 Chems weigh 10 lbs in your inventory. It's the only weight Perk I'd recommend for the sole purpose of mediating Stash weight.
---
This was longer than I intended it to be. So I hope it helps some, none, or all who read it.
---
Throw me an offer 
---
Quad is in same category as two shot, so no
---
Thank God. I thought you'd be here forever.
---
nope, two shot and quad a prefixes whereas explosive is a major
---
Bethesda doesn’t it whenever they feel like it really 
---
Yea this was a one time menu pop up that happened like a month ago
---
For the low price of 100 magazines I can just show you ....
---
Yep.I was told it is cheating the system and I am just as bad as a duper. I am an asshole but these sanctimonious pricks are so much worse. 
---
prefix, major, then minor, one of each.
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
Yeah, I changed back to the deathclaw gauntlet and my damage went back up.
---
Yes, I think I may have resolved what is going on, but it will take me a bit to verify it as it takes two players. There will be a major update to the original post soon.
---
Haha awesome, I love the sound they make. Im getting up there in levels so will start unlocking HG and bear arms asap.
---
I have not been getting any upgrades on syringers when I break them down, I only have the karma one from a quest.
---
You’re welcome. 
---
I see but it’s weekly right 
---
Wow thanks Bethesda. NOT
---
To all us console players who barely venture onto tehe PC FFS why give us something we will never use.
---
Could of come up with something better i think not just here you go heres some Free Games that were pretty much already Free to begin with.
---
Hmm bethesda i F'n Love you but this shit is silly now come on....
---
Its really cool.
---
Get an explosive weapon. I got my first tse from nuking harpers ferry and several other explosive weapons from white springs and sbq
---
Couldn't they set the mouse control to using the joystick as a cursor? I know they have games that are top down like C&amp;C with controller options. 
---
You and anyone who upvoted this comment only prove my point 
---
Wow, I guess they never played an mmo ever. BTW I think the “cunts” is a bit more to the point with describing those cunts lol
---
Well unfortunately for you, I barely even have one to my name, and even if I did, i aint desperate, just want to see what the deal is, is it a 1000+ player, or is it (im assuming now, due to ur mention of magazines) a glitch
---
i’m not completely sure i haven’t played in a while either but it seems to be almost every week. I’m pretty sure there’s been a week or two without maintenance 
---
We're not privy to when individual servers reset, but that which matters to us... Midday Monday's is when the weekly stuff (launch codes, challenges) seem to reset.
---
I’ve been away from Fallout76 for a while. I have a few medical issues going on atm.
---
Ok thanks 
---
Thanks for the help
---
No, taking a break. I also have that water purifier bug eating my camp budget so I can't build. Decided fuck it...back to empyrion will Bethesda works this out.
---
You on PC? If I can trade I'll give ya my maps to play with.
---
Well, ppl play fo76 to mainly loot on sight and kill ghouls in golf club. Most of them arent exactly looking for complex posts that boggle ur mind. 
---
The fallout community will be in a huge lose, how will we recover.
---
Uh 50 caps each?  I will go no higher than 55  caps though. 
---
Doesn't most of this already exist?
---
Still fair game depending on proximity 
---
I definitely want the 50 Cal. What price? 
---
Really weird that you’d think we care 
---
Get max Licensed Plumber and you gain access to learn those easier. 1 to 20 rate. Its ridiculously low rate of success.
---
I’d take the Gat but all I’ve got is about 3k
---
Thought the fast travel mat you place in workshops allow players on team to travel....
---
3/3 btw^
---
lol I've been looking for a TSE gatling for a while. Bummer I don't many caps at the moment. You should make a mule so you don't have to get rid of them.
---
Shell shock was cool. 
---
god i hate shell shock 
---
I can't remember where it is but its in a small house on the bench. Where a teddy bear is pretending to be a cook on a tv show with another bear filming him.
---
Yeah, pretty shitty lootboxes. I'm not doing the Watoga one again for another box of shit :p
---
Suitcases.  Cash registers.  Mailboxes.  I leave stuff all over.  I got no use, someone might as well have a shot at it!
---
This was amazing thank you so much
---
Or, you could just learn to recognize that a camp doesn't have any turrets.  It's not that hard to look and see. 
---
I tested it a few days ago. The resistance values from Awareness take account of Tank Killer and possibly other perks, but not weapon mods. The Perforating magazine still works as expected.
---
Its works everytime for me. In fact it fixes alot of bugs Ive  encountered. 
---
Hope it works for you.
---
Ah. Interesting. Set it as something that you're searching for when trying to craft it. 
---
Best
---
1K for the TSE Lever Action
---
Like Robinson Crusoe 
---
It's as primitive as can be
---
There is an obvious difference for me when I don’t have a an armor piercing mag installed. Usually against super mutants it, takes at least 4 shots to down them without, and no more than 2 shots with armor piercing installed. 
---
It's the magazine glitch. Extremely high damage is prorated down and not capped.
---
Thousands of damage won't do it. Ten thousand won't do it. You can crank it up and keep the effect indefinitely with a perk glitch. Once someone does it one time they just have to remember to refresh it and it's pretty much permanent.
---
I'll take 2k if you fast travel to me RaezorZ EdgE
---
You will be missed.
---
I’ll be honest I don’t know enough about the obsolete programming used in FO1&amp;2 to be able to accurately explain why that wouldn’t work. The code is so old, the program used to run it even on a modern pc is a self-contained emulator. To run it on a console in its current state you’d need to run it as an emulator of an old pc OS inside your console’s OS that then runs the game program. 
---
Idegaf about that I want my combat mechanics fixed and the response to my controller input not to lag me to death literally
---
 glad I could help lol
---
They're not freeware games.
---
Rage kills
---
Gratitude saves
---
I know it difficult I suffer from rage so games are my zen
---
Go find yours
---
Here for the comments
---
Fyi a regular shotgun will destroy a wall section mn in one shot as well so the explosive shotgun just has splash damage as an extra perk
---
No I'm sad thatbthis game sux and i hate it
---
They definitely scale. 
---
If I enter an area with too- powerful enemies I server hop until I find a better one. 
---
Thanks for the stats!
---
I didn't! :P
---
Use a shishkebab :3
---
im aware of that one, i was referring to the level 0 that the OP mentioned that I responded to, not the amount of damage
---
This is a pretty good community.  What are you talking about?
---
There, there. It will be okay. Everything will be okay, my boy.
---
Don't bother looking for the patch notes yet. Bethesda said the patch notes would come out when the patch does, and the only elaboration they gave on the content of the patch is: "this patch will address many issues raised by the community as well as continue focus on improving performance and stability".
---
That is PR speak for "nunya".
---
Try having your own opinion and see how that goes
---
I’ll give 2k each for the 50 and the lever. I’m trying to get in your world 
---
yea lol, well anyway i still think there is potential to pull it off, it remains to be seen if bethesda can do it, but they did announce 150 bug fixes in tommorow's PC patch ( next week for consoles ).
---
We'll see just how good this patch is when they release the patch notes at that time.
---
At least you have a sense of humor 
---
Sorry to hear that. Wishing you a speedy recovery.
---
That's too bad. How do you figure it'll work once it hits 5 Stars?
---
Nope, you dont need TSE. 
---
In fact I found it to be very useful against my first ever attempted griefing against me. Ol' mate was using stealth boys and I didnt even realise until after me sniping him, that the DIAMOND above his head was giving him away.
---
Keep thing inside the square, its working wonders clearly.
---
Oh and thats just one method to seeing through cloaked abilities.
---
Oh. For that I have no idea. I've never seen a level 0 in the world. I have seen a friend appear as level 1 when they were really nearly 200. I would guess that's either a visual glitch or 1,000 as you mentioned.
---
Well, having my doubts, I have full power smith and other power armor perks, got a calibrated shock from somebody for my excavator, installed, then scrapped. Didn’t learn anything; I realize it’s not 1 to 1, but still I can’t scrap tons of expensive to make X-01 legs if I did find the shocks!
---
Is it just that or is it the wrongful banning of players? Cause 3 of my friends got banned for having cheat engine on their PCs over the break. Mind you they didn't turn on cheat engine at all during playtime, but the fact they had it on their PCs = to ban. 
---
If you mod up your weapon it will be far better than the random drops. Scrap weapons to unlock the mods. Also there's no need to farm materials if you're scrapping regularly and only picking up good junk. 
---
True.  But others will get the wrong impression being outside the back of the golf club.  
---
Also OP hasn't factored in those who do this might be the ones tagging the ghouls and destroying his base out of spite.
---
You didn't think complaining on any non-self-help forum would get a response like this? Did you just recently find the internet?
---
Shit game is shit.
---
The real Question is what were you doing At Supreme Court ayy??
---
Someones been a bad boy hahaha
---
This drove me nuts but I finally got it to work...  here's what I learned:
---
\-- You have to have the Advanced Power Connectors plans, specifically the "Conduit - Wall Pass-Through" variant of the Conduit Junctions.
---
\-- I didn't need a solid wall.  It worked just as well with a windowed wall or door wall.
---
\-- I had to remove the roof in order for me to place it.
---
\-- You need 2 Conduit - Wall Pass-Throughs.  The first one gets placed \*through\* the wall - rotate it so that the single conduit is outside of the wall and the 2 inner parts are inside the wall.  Then you use a 2nd Conduit - Wall Pass-Through that is mirror image - it connects to the first one so that the 2 top/bottom parts of each conduit connect to each other.
---
\-- In order to connect a wire, I had to go to a generator outside, choose to connect a wire, and then run inside and connect it to the inner portion of the Conduit - Wall Pass-Through which intersects the wall,, which doesn't really make sense...  but after doing this, you can see that visually the outside generator is connected directly to the portion of the conduit that protrudes outside of the wall, which does make sense.
---
\-- Once all that is done, you'll see that the 2nd, fully-inside, Conduit - Wall Pass-Through is powered, and can now be connected to anything inside.
---
Hope that helps!!
---
Keep thinking inside the square, its working wonders clearly.
---
I'm good with everything but rule #6 can't remember what it was and I'm going to have to go back and look but rule #6. Gotta go. 
---
Why did you rage quit? And why is the solution a new character?
---
Context is key.
---
You have to wait a few minutes. It’s happened to me before but in a few minutes it pops up. 
---
You might want to check their update page. Patch is tomorrow morning. 
---
My first wendigo encounter scared the crap out of me as well. Mostly because I ran nose to nose with it as I crested a hill. 
---
I am certainly not qualified enough to say how much of the original NetImmerse/Gamebryo engine carried over when Bethesda turned it in to Creation - but I would assume not much on the netcode side since they tried to shoe-horn in the netcode from a different engine rather than rebuild what used to be.
---
That said such a move could have also entirely been a management decision. Why pay to rebuild a wall when another part of your company already has a wall built? Never-you-mind that said wall is built to a different building code for a different style building.
---
They posted today 
---
Played the hell out of them with the steam controller it honestly can be run by steering the cursor around exCtly as the map cursor is steered in F76. 
---
I wish bc my friend is Xbox only he can’t run pc games in his old old mactop
---
The powered door plans (keypad doors) I got from Grahm. The switches are part of the advanced power connectors and I see that plan at harpers ferry and BoS vendor in Watoga shopping center. 
---
Yeah, but this isn't just about "inside the vault" they've promised repeatedly detailed patch notes, and a 150+ fix patch is coming TOMORROW with zero fucking patch notes? That's a problem. 
---
um.. they just did an inside the vault today mentioning a patch coming to PC tomorrow (consoles early next week) with 150+ fixes, so no they arent quiet
---
How do you know it works as expected? Have you tested with and without and experienced a noticeable difference?
---
You need to wait up to 10 minutes for the loot to show up.  The loot lags out.
---
021574
---
Yep we got a mega patch comming tomorrow they even said over 150 bug fixes alone in it. Really can't wait to see it.
---
What level are you. Is it one of those level locked plans?
---
&gt;
---
I would rather play goat simulator
---
&gt;I'll be trading my copy in pending another attempt with a new character after 100 or more hours based on the earliest versions of the game.
---
... you people are ridiculous.
---
Not sure. You can get 4 stars with scorched killer receiver ive heard 
---
I use this method if I don't have anyone online although it's a bit risky. Anyone can take it while your gone but as long as no one is around you and your in sneak mode to hide your position on the map, it's great.
---
I know when my bro and I try stacking a Rifleman perk, it doesn't display that are weapons do any additional damage than if we weren't sharing it. This led us to believe that it is only worth while to share a perk that no one else in the party has equipped.
---
Further testing is probably needed, but thought it was worth mentioning.
---
Thanks !!! Sorry I work nights and I just crawled out my coffin haha cheers !!
---
Iirc it evolved from an multiplayer engine...
---
Mind you like and uber old one, but still.
---
Great, now we have to make a detailed list of things in our inventory that crash the game? This game is turning into homework. 
---
Really wierd anyone gives a shit someone made their house look like a bridge while we have to frantically mash left on the dpad to get our sword out until we waste a stimpak trying the other side or that we have to reload 5 shots on the lever action when we only fired one 
---
My stash box kicks me out more than anything else. Trading a few times has blue screened me but nothing like a stash box(watoga)
---
No, the cake is a pie.
---
Reading is hard.
---
Well, it's difficult to counter when they do have a TSE (no need to aim at me), and I can't use VATS against them.
---
As it is right now, the PvP in this game is one-shot or getting one-shotted.
---
Yeah, I measured it at around 40% damage resistance reduction, assuming that the game uses the same damage formula as Fallout 4. The Watoga robots are handy for testing once you've completed Mayor for a Day.
---
ok, I only have 2/3.  I just read she doesn't like it up the butt lol.
---
Tbh its a crappy sword anyway. All it gives +1 strength from memory so you aint missing much.
---
U want 2he or a fist weapon currently.
---
I find it hard to believe there aren't algorithms which make certain users and posts generally more or less seen based on popularity 
---
Heresy! PA is how we RP as Space Marines!

Also I figure i must have focused on the wrong skill trees
---
Stealth boy, stealth boy mk3, and you don't need a Tse, you can literally fire into every direction till you get a hit, swing around with a melee weapon, use a grenade and back yourself into a corner, on top of that stealth boys are good but not perfect you can still make out their outline when they move. Another comment even pointed out you can see the diamond. If you think that's not fair you haven't seen an assultron dominator yet.
---
Stealth boy mk1 lasts something like 30-45 seconds and the mk3 is 2 minutes I think. It's a mechanic that's been in EVERY fallout game. (I'm pretty sure) 
---
Just to show that not everyone is doing well exploring and reclaiming the wasteland.
---
Nice. Do they all do 40% or are the “improved” ones lower?
---
I'd love to buy you the plan for connections - I see conduits often at the free states vendor in harpers ferry. I'm so glad to see a kind person playing instead of rampant toxicity i have encountered more than a few times today alone.
---
I like fighting em personally. I also have my camp adjacent to the fissure prime site too for my chances of bumping into them.
---
You could just leave it as it is and then create a new "league".  You can then create a new character in this new league if you want too and all the old stuff will still be there in the old league.  Games like Path of Exile do this to keep the economy fresh.  It is not worth doing though until the game is fixed, and currently there are too many exploits and problems that can affect gear.
---
Load-outs would be great but I feel you'd really only have 2, Combat and Pick/Hack/Carry. I guess it would be good for multi-specialization but hot swapping quickly feels a tiny bit OP. Like, you could go from a Heavy Gunner to a Beat Stick in 3 seconds while fighting the SQ or Swap to your PvP build if you are wanted and get shot. Just seems like specializations would go out the window with 3 second swap ups.  
---
If there were load-outs I'd prefer them to only be usable at C.A.M.P.S and such to maintain some sort of balance in the game play.
---
The community is friendly; it’s pointless posts like these that get no sympathy.
---
PS4. I have a mic, but it only worked once with the ingame chat. Since them nothing. Husband and friends all have the same issue. Have to use Playstation Chat parties. It's sad cause I really want to be able to communicate with other players in the game.
---
I've found T60 Motion Servos plans along with Excavator Motion Servor plans here. Nothing else so far myself.
---
Somehow it's empty. I can't even see the loading circle spinning on my screen and the corpse disappeared just after 3 minutes. :P
---
My guess it's for the opening of the vaults and new content. Highest rating legendary is in fact 3 stars
---
Because sharing experiences and camps are why we are here, not to read your farewell post. If you have issues submit bug reports instead posting on this Reddit about it. If want to play, play, if you don’t, don’t. 
---
I appreciate it man but ive been playing since fo4 so I understand that however the cost in materials outweighs the efficacy fornsomeone who's trying to build the damn excavator suit just to get the power armor bench for example
---
Well, sure, but my point was rather that the damage output was pretty unimpressive for what should be a powerful weapon, particularly considering that a supposedly less powerful weapon performed better in the exact same situation. 
---
Oh if you’re not even getting a circle spinning then idk bud. I’ve never had that happen. 
---
Ikr unless you have some time to test things and or gain a set of a certain few types of legendary items.
---
I can currently take 2-3 shots and survive and Im cool with that. There are 2  TSE weapons however that are unstoppable no matter what.
---
Farming whitespring &amp; server hopping for a nuke in whitespring.

I just keep getting a spongebob meme

Must be a lot of duper fans in this group...

Remember when they said fallout 3 was at 200 endings, confirmed? Pepperidge farm remembers.
---
Haven church is that where you found one if so I’ll go take a look tomorrow and try to figure out where he/she is from
---
What do you expect us to say?, all your doing is creating a thread that will get heavily downvoted. People despise leaving threads and that's not just this game thats all games man.
---
They are the most annoying things to constantly hear. Also really annoyed about what you said towards the community.
---
The 76 community is one of the best ones i have ever seem on reddit.
---
I don't care about people who just want to destroy camps for fun.  More power to ya. 
---
My post was specifically for people who assume every camp they see near the golf club is a turret farm.
---
Powerfist in all regards - yes they can be legendary.  
---
Funny enough, there is a mod that does exactly that. 
---
[yup](https://xkcd.com/927/)
---
Yea, though it's more of a downgrade, I think. Why reduce a weapon down to such a basic point of only being truly effective against one enemy? Unless you have over a dozen copies of the same weapon with different effects to combat different enemies (Which seems extremely boring to always be using the same weapon, in my opinion), it just reduces the quality of it to being nothing but a Scorched-Only Killer.
---
I second this, I use it and it's so much better. I have it hooked up so when I open my garage door it plays, it's so much nicer.
---
the smoke it's self is the repellent, as nicotine is actually quite toxic to insects even in small amounts, and cigarette smoke has it in quite high amounts
---
The cult of mysteries could boost stealth and hacking skills.
---
Kill a frog, the tiny blue ones. Get the legs as a drop, cook'em.
---
10 minutes !? The corpse disappeared within 3 minutes (at least  for me)
---
If you're going to buy the game anyway then what does it matter? Pre order doesn't cost more than day 1 and usually gives some sort of bonus or beta for free.
---
What you're trying to say is that people would be happy if they didn't buy it in the first place, and that's just a sad opinion.
---
But I'm low level (created a new character)...my weapons blow dogs for quarters. Lol. 
---
U gotta be more specific
---
Sometimes you can even hear it clunk when you place it.  Ticked me off - I had to totally redo my ceiling layout at my disco pad.  XD
---
Yeah fair enough. Those damn springs, I just did that quest. Try Sugar Grove - loads of clipboards. 
---
Doesn't help me at all and I smoke a pack a day every time the bugs swarm me 
---
Assassin's armor, I suppose?
---
The ones I have found were from Vault 94. They’ve also always had loot on their body. Typically a good amount of caps (10-20), some random food item and a weapon. 
---
Nope, but these ones are mine XD
---
You mean like this?.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aaedli/want_to_know_why_the_servers_are_unstable_bethesda/?utm_source=reddit-android
---
Or my many other threads. Its all about how you address yourself and your criticism of something.
---
Not childish leaving threads like yours above.
---
I have had to wait 2 minutes myself but others in another post have said between instant and 10 minutes.
---
Some high level may guard you. Lol.      
---
Find a way to farm enough caps to buy a low lvl TSE weapon &amp; you’ll be fine. 
---
That would be an effective solution. Splitting the playerbase or forcing people to make new characters in order to experience new content has its downsides though. 
---
The only downside to my solution would be perceived from the viewpoint of an exploiter since this method would make their thousands of duped items inferior and worthless.
---
Non-exploiters would be able to experience the game as if they had duped anyways since all of the vanilla items would be so cheap and easy to get.
---
Where do you find those? 
---
Wait 2-3 times a day? Damn I think I got kicked over 7 times today and this was less then normal. Maybe I just play to many hours though lol 
---
Well, not every Fallout had PvP. 
---
I didn't check. No weapons bench at Watoga Station. I should probably move my base there.
---
Once I’m over with no workbench in sight, I go into vacuum mode—nothing is safe! The only problem comes when even after scrapping it all, I’m still over... but that’s what the steaks are for.
---
Just farm the areas. No easier way, but at least there's lots of events in those areas. 
---
Destroying any camp for any reason is "fair game".  It's just senseless to destroy a camp because you assume it's a turret farm... without ever seeing any turrets. That's all.
---
That's a pretty decent use of them honestly... Unless they are for a future event of course
---
Maybe this guy is more intelligent or more experienced with gaming than i. All I can do is say I've have a shitty experience and that I'm fed up.
---
I was in side the white spring resort with my friend 
---
If it disables slap damage between factions, that'd be pretty cool.  
---
Although TSEs have to be rebalanced before pvp can be developed further. 
---
It's just a fuckfest of one-shot shotties atm.
---
Where is this located on the map....roughly. I like the spooky spots.
---
Did you understand what was meant: yes, that is the point of language, to convey points and ideas.
---
Spelling Correction/Grammar Correction are fine and dandy, but not as a solitary thing to do when it contributes nothing to the conversation that's at hand.
---
It's like walking upon two gents who are talking about how they think grilled cheese sandwiches should be made and you saying how it should be called a cheese sandwich that's been grilled as the cheese it's self isn't grilled.  Yes it's vaguely related to what's being discussed but it has no bearing or point to the given conversation, nor does it contribute anything of worth to said conversation.
---
Quite literally the opposite
---
I believe so, I think it’s the actual reward for completing the quest 
---
3 star is the highest to drop, a scorched-killer receiver on a gun or a sacrificial blade mod on a machete can give an artificial 4* when used on a 3* base (the mods add a star)
---
Not to me...
---
Had a friend of mine get over 1000 weight in under an hour. He got pissed at me for telling him to scrap everything and to drop all duplicate guns he found and armor, he later uninstalled the game cause of that reason lol.
---
That is pretty cool, its like a more stable troll under the bridge feel then the other cliffside bridge CAMPs i've seen people post about, this ones more homey too.
---
Yes, there is one there. I tried to get a look at their back but I didn't see any numbers.
---
K thanks 
---
Not spooky just more creepy.
---
Oh, that wasn't a shot at you, buddy! I feel your pain, completely! It's Bethesda, lol, look what we've devolved to! Haha
---
well, that's if DT and DR are the same, DR in older games was applied after things got through DT.  DT being your armors Damage Threshold, and DR being your damage resistance.  The problem is, with 4 and 76 is, we got alot of numbers but the scaling is...wonky and it's not as clear as to what does what.  Before if you had 34 DT, you'd resist the first 34 points of damage from an attack, and then your DR would reduce it by a percent after that (normally 50% as that's what Med-X did) but 4 and 76 made things....not as clear, sure you have alot of information, but there isn't exactly a manual on it, and with how much of these things you can stack they put diminishing returns on stuff and that just makes it even more of a pain in the arse to try and sort out.
---
What's the difference from getting shafted by an assultron dominator with built in stealth boy and a mountain of health and Jimmy brown with his stealth boy? 
---
If not inside ur power armor chassis, then dunno.
---
#6 just makes it to where duped items can’t be traded for the new currency. This solution isn’t effective in creating a market with value without #6.
---
You wouldn’t trade new currency for old items because new currency would actually have value.
---
When they released they last patch I stopped having crashes but then people started duping out of their ass. I literally could see the difference with each day that past till it got as bad as OP
---
🚬👊🐜
---
The sacrificial blade is so cool
---
The community is friendly enough, and I see some cool stuff sometimes but I do agree with your point about upvotes. I have seen comments where the reply says something like "I agree with OP but instead of them doing xxx maybe they could do xxy or just add y with OPs idea" and it has a -3 . While I also see like 5 posts a day with a title like "Is fallout 76 really as bad as people say?" that has 100+ upvotes. But, as others have said, its imaginary points.
---
Need help. I went into a nuke zone in my power armor but still was getting rads. I had to keep using my rad away and such. Didn’t even get to kill anything anyways because all the mobs were like lvl 50+ and I’m lvl 16

Well, I got free space in my stash and some metal, so I’ve got that going for me which is nice.

Happened to me once, I was then stuck in my PA and it would say Pip-Boy unavailable when I tried to use it. Quit that server and logged back in and it was back working again.
---
People goin' in the front and other people comin' around back, and the hallways are all so damn big....
---
Just picked up an instigating handmade. The damage displayed is just 90 but does this mean when the shot is fired - that all related perks (including sneak as my build is sniper) will stack up. Also are the all rifle perk cards going to handmade damage? (got all rifle perks maxed)
---
Appreciate any inputs. 
---
I use my explosive shotgun for pretty much anything that gets too close for comfy lol. 
---
PS. I have an extra legendary handmade if there’s anyone looking. Mutant advantage. Just sits on my stash. If anyone is looking to buy. I’m on PS4. Also if anyone needs help on mods for their handmade got the hardened mod up. Happy to help no caps needed. 
---
Im just asking a question, no need to be a dick about it
---
Difficult to get funky in bed when only one person can hop on at a time :(
---
Where wendigo moan and guns thunder.
---
Really glad you got it sorted
---
That's what I was thinking cause I got a mininuke also....
---
I'm confused.
---
You don't know why you rage quit?
---
I've had the same experience. Someone was ranting about the game and I "bragged" about me not having a lot of disconnects and not having any issues partying up with my friends. Got like 14 downvotes iirc lol
---
I think the saddest thing is, that we as the consumers are at fault we hear new fallout and it’s time to change our trousers, we gobble that shit up knowing the likelihood that we’re buying a bunk product, now granted 76 is beyond horrendous for bugs but it certainly sets the tone for future and honestly it’s a shame and what’s worse is us as the community that supports this greed machine will never truly stand against it and say we will not tolerate this, we won’t buy your games we will not buy into your micro transactions 
---
We can bitch and complain and we get things fixed, but why are we paying 60-200$ on a pre order that really is just us paying to be Bethesda’s testers 
---
WE NEED TO STAND TOGETHER AND MAKE BETHESDA TO UNDERSTAND WE EXPECT MORE FROM THEM 
---
if I were invested in Bethesda my goal would be to remove Howard once and for all his reign of greed needs to end 
---
The best thing you can do is to write up a constructive thread. Show the good the bad and the things you would love to see changed or added.
---
Don't forget tomorrows patch is a mega bug fixer as well.
---
Faction specific buffs would add such an extra dynamic to the game.  Fantastic suggestions!
---
This presumes that they use the same sort of design as our own vending machines.  
---
I was curious so I went and looked at one: https://gyazo.com/1f1cdc02561cb249638e518c27876124
---
It doesn't give much to go off of. Seems they didn't put alot of detail there.
---
Still, that top slot has enough of an opening, it could easily fit the bottlecaps.  
---
If it's a mechanical mechanism like our current ones, you're right, it'd be tricky. It'd need someone good at machining and design. But it's not a stretch that someone would retrofit them sometime in the 25 years since the war.  Someone was stocking these things, and they'd want whatever the prevalent currency is.
---
The other option is that vending machines have evolved a little by this time. (They are already evolving NOW. Many take credit card...) Instead of being designed for specific coins, it could scan the objects inserted, compare it to it's list of accepted currency and either count it or spit it out. 
---
I feel like doing those events should increase your faction with enclave, and as your standing rises more difficult events become available as well as new items on their vendors.  For now there’s just no motivation for me to do pretty much any event other than queen.  
---
I got that from your comment dont worry i just thought you were maybe not level 50 plus lol.
---
Love these ideas!
---
Of the three photos, where is the last one with the stone arch located? Would love to build there. 
---
Sentinel.
---
Love your name
---
You're trying to fill unnecessary roles which already exist. I will never understand this, especially since your domain name isn't even the same as your idea
---
I got mine in the wild and have heard of many others too...because it's one of 19 mutations, I'm sure rng can be cruel
---
Me too. 
---
I would love humans in this game honestly. I think they can totally incorporate vault dwellers, travelers from other parts of the country or world. It feels too cold sometimes walking around with no human contact besides the ghoulish and mutated kind
---
Pretty sure the system is in place not to restrict hording as a game mechanic but to restrict hording to keep the servers from crashing as it tries to process 2000 individual weapons. So those ~~sanctimonious pricks~~ people who don't know what they are talking about can lick my mule's Legendary Ripper.
---
And if a mule is cheating, does that mean if they're playing with friends they can't give the items from another character they have they're not currently using? It lines up with the logic of their thoughts on the meta.
---
The only impression people should be getting is that there are clearly no turrets, so there is no reason to destroy it. We shouldn't have to avoid building there just because some people don't care to use common sense.
---
I thought it applied specifically to all non legendary items, the legendary effects will most likely be included in new content as well. 
---
Perhaps they are fixing exploits or maybe even doing some about the exploiters and treading the patch notes would top them off.
---
They are releasing the patch notes with the patch.  I don’t see a problem with this
---
The answer lies somewhere between spending 20 minutes killing mirelurk Kings trying to get my stuff back and dying only to have everything lost or otherwise forgotten by the server so I ended up with nothing and no Aid left on top of it and getting killed five more times in 5 minutes at the next location I found
---
But....now who will jiggle all the booty?
---
Built my camp around a lead resource deposit (not to be confused with the small mineable veins)
---
100% possible, got them for both my main and my alt through radiation. 
---
Seems like an obvious idea, and one that would be easily implemented, and one that surely someone on the dev team would have thought of.  I just can’t imagine a online game like this where the endgame is a single enemy that’s easily killed by half afk people with basic items.  
---
Truth be told it's all very overwhelming and I can only imagine how it is for the Developers I had an entire notebook basically full and after posting tidbits of that and having them downvoted I decided it wasn't worth it much less could I put it all into one post which I thought would be best
---
Traps aren’t gay. 
---
Time to pay another 160 caps to move my camp
---
I'm mainly talking about people who have successfully farmed powerful legendary weapons and flux already, and have  more than enough firepower to take on the queen. I just feel like TSE were meant for the queen, yet those who have them just keep going back to white springs and shooting ghouls.  I don't get it.  
---
To clarify, any items in the game pre-patch would belong to the caps market. Any items that generate after patch would belong to the new market. This would ensure duped items stay out of the new market.
---
Thats a good analogy. Far out assaultrons piss me off! 
---
Thats funny you say that my camp is right by the Gilman Lumber mill, just south of the Vault. I have one turret and it allways blows the ticks away.  I should be selling my bloodpacks. Go there.
---
I love getting a cap off all my delicious nuka colas. 
---
I'm still out there m8 just perhaps in other worlds
---
Hoping your issue gets resolved because my level 300 character is in the same predicament LOL.
---
Amen brother.
---
That's the best way to do it when you have no friends. I have 2 dozen people on my "friends" list I've never talked to. All of my camps in the same area so I can do it at a near by tool shed out of the way. The cabinet in the tool shed is the closest thing I have to a friend on FO76.
---
South East of point pleasant
---
The caps I lose.
---
You are very unlucky.   
---
Best bet pay the 200-250 caps for a serum while you can. Prices will be going up sooner than later. Oh and make sure you take off starched genes otherwise you won't get a single mutation nor will the serum work. 
---
Nice! Have you considered doing like a first story bridge/hospitality, second story home? Like an inn over the river? 
---
Alot of those are nice ideas mate, you actually made me google this Interloper thing too and i could see it brought in as a DLC.
---
Lol - me too
---
This story 😂
---
Puncturing power fist and 3 claw deathclaw gauntlet have the same dmg but powerfist has extra armor penetration. 
---
I'd use any legendary with +swing speed over them tho
---
LOL.  I do this pretty often while in Watoga, just for the caps, xp and because it's there.  Today I was in the area with two others that were activating the dishes.  I knew where the coffin would land, so I parked up on top of a garage to defend it and took out the scorched attackers pretty quickly.  The hardest part of this quest is hunting down the attackers and getting back to the coffin in like 2 minutes.  I secured the drop and looted it ASAP to ensure we'd all get completion rewards.  I got 5 throwing knives, some ammo, a radaway and a sturdy combat armor piece.
---
I'm imagining a real-life illuminati-like entity such as the Enclave spending trillions on sending rockets into space loaded with coffins full of pop-tarts, a couple pairs of jeans, a police issue kevlar vest, a roll of toilet paper and a revolver as essential supplies to be called down for their best and brightest soldiers in times of need.  LOL.
---
I don't know what Sentinel does. I haven't seen it on the list of legendary prefixes for armor.
---
Clearly
---
Apparently you dupe nuka-colas, drink them all and then buy your TSE from another duper with the caps.
---
If you want a less cheaty method and don't fancy bugging high levels to escort you around Whitesprings, it's going to be a lot slower. Just kill the highest-level stuff you can handle and do events any time they show up in the Forest. Workshops also give decent chunks of XP but they open you up to PvP griefing.
---
And while I have your attention as an example why not make something like the knuckles of fast weapon? Have you ever seen somebody fight with brass knuckles... they're very fast... that was just one dumb thing out of like 100 I wrote while playing through
---
WOAH MAN. FUCKING SPOIL SKYRIM MUCH?!
---
(I'm kidding, don't Zerg me)
---
Pffff come on man.
---
They won't do that
---
oh... 
---
Yet the Internet in all of its wisdom has weighted it as having more worth than your statement. Funny how that works.
---
Are you gonna be on in about an hour and a half? 
---
Damn. Y'all new to the internet? This troll is getting fat af lol
---
I lost ONE thing and I've been bummed about it for days, can't even imagine what it's like to lose your entire inventory. If you're on PS4 I can hook you up with some bits and pieces to help you start out again.
---
Just an FYI, you can buy most mutations for 500 caps on PC if you go to forums/discord and barter.
---
Yup among many other not so common and oft not talked about stats.
---
Oh and its super rare thats why. Let me give you a hint: 15% DR when standing still. Get 5 pieces and some other perks and you too will become a god.
---
It will be posted to this reddit many times as soon as they tweet the link. 
---
I quit my game and rejoin the server not there restarted my Xbox and nothing only my old t 51b 
---
I had the stove too till I redid my camp and found I could no longer build it. I went looking and found the Plan: Cooking Stove on the Watoga Station vendor. But since I’ve bought it, I’ve seen it on the responders vendors as well.
---
If they cant fix your character then there is literally zero chance they can do anything to fix the economy from dupes.
---
It's not like that's uncommon. 
---
Newsflash kids: THERE IS NO ROADMAP
---
The “DLC” planned for this game aka “the vaults” are the only thing they have “planned” when in reality they were supposed to be part of the game upon release. Bethesda’s shitty management pushed this game out like they did to Obsidian and New Vegas and it shows. 
---
I think they're extremely annoying, but not really OP. They are supposed to be the second toughest enemy in the game and can be killed in a couple of hits with end game weapons. I think them making it so hard to aim through their particle effects is a problem and their relentless pursuiting, but I don't see the difficulty as a problem. I'd also like to see the drop rate for some of the rare plans they drop increased by a lot.
---
I'm not surprised being that far into the mire and cranberry bog wearing nothing but a vault suit 😂. 
---
I'm pretty sure you came out of that vault too
---
I agree with your name
---
Sorry man let me dumb it down for you. The glitch was hilarious in FO4 now it falls about as flat as most of your sarcastic punchlines. A AAA game should better than this and if you think this “glitch” is the only reason why I posted then you haven’t played the game. 
---
Yeh it has been in every fallout game.
---
Also there is a certain perk that can extend the life of stealth BOIs
---
It’s funny I own the entire collection on pc since I found the mini Nuke collection at a collectors shop but it didn’t have the key code so I never installed them, so at least now I have some fallout to play until 76 is fixed
---
Who said it's part of the fun?
---
1. Great
---
2. See the future? Really?
---
3. Devalue the only currency for players to use? And if you add currency barriers for new items, then new players would never obtain vanilla items.
---
4. Make the currency system confusing and different for no reason? A sarsaparilla cap is a cap nonetheless, more currencies muddy a game's economy. It would just mean people have to add more steps to trade between currencies anyway.
---
5. This will happen in time
---
6. A real pain to not only designate items as only usable with certain currencies, but again would hurt the economy
---
7. Checkpoint ideas just don't work. Flagging items as new or old is not easy and would run into a crazy amount of bugs, it partitions new players and old players.
---
Having the caps that have been the currency in every fallout game be not usable at a vendor for half of the items they own would be profoundly confusing to anyone who doesn't have a deep understanding of the game, as well as a portion of those who do understand it.
---
Multiple currencies don't work unless one is tied to endgame content like raids or dungeons and has it's own vendor (i.e. ultracite tokens would drop from SBQ and have a dedicated vendor which only took that currency)
---
There are many ways to effect change 
---
It's possible (been reported by others) that you can end up with a bugged version of a mutation, especially Marsupial (even if you didn't notice you got it at the time), later lost it (due to a RadAway or shower), but the game then won't let you re-gain that mutation again ... if this is the case, I don't think even a serum will work correctly, and you'll be out the caps ... so *if* you attempt the serum route, make sure you find someone selling it cheap; do *not* pay full price in the bunker ...
---
The only known cure is to remove *all* your mutations (easiest to do via a shower) and start grinding them again. :(
---
All issues are management issues. That's why they make the big bucks, right? It's always their brilliant leadership responsible when things go well, yah? They're the ones who go or no-go all decisions. Ergo: all issues are management issues. If they're incapable of dealing with that, then they're weak management. More likely, this is just another example of a public mega media monstrosity making demands like "why aren't we making money like Fortnite?"
---
In the name of saint Todd and saint Pete...I dub you sir imsortauseful.
---
Now you have a title,carry on.
---
Screenshots of all this or you are making it up. Someone who would be willing to exploit or dupe is not afraid of getting banned, and he would not admit it then give it back lol.
---
I think its really cool that they added those small touches to show the dire situation all the dwellers find themselves in.
---
PLans are not in game, you have two options, server hop the vendor until luck hits or buy from a person with a high probability it was duped. Cheaper and easier to buy from a person but then as others put it you become part of the problem.   
---
Myself I play a raider so I don't give to shits and would buy from a duper any day, also steal their shit while they are duping just to hoard it  and have useful things, but that is a thing for another day in another thread. 
---
Like us probably got a tad too hammered on the day and just skipped the robots giving advice. See we might have started half drunk but atleast we paid attention to the bots.
---
Having the loadouts only available to swap around at camp would make a lot of sense. Good balancing. I would totally be on board for that
---
to start off with, im the friend this guy was playing with. we were in the whitesprings lobby selling stuff we dont need and buying stuff, he was in his t-51b suit and not his x0-1, we were walking from vendor to vendor bartering then the server hits a massive lag spike and i get dc'd while hes still in game,  then he says that all of his x0-1 is gone and looks through his inventory to see if he accidentally scrapped the chassis, which he didnt. he didnt scrap, sell or drop the chassis it just disappeared from his inventory taking all the time farming and all the resources sunk into it, into the void 
---
Considering most of them are at locations with vendors, one could presume that the Radaway was NOT prewar. That the vending machines were filled with new items after the war by enterprising factions hoping to rebuild something resembling a society.
---
But theres where you are wrong homy. There are no rules in a fight. You are describing how you would like things to be which will get you killed.
---
Fighting (or we shall call it pvp) is always dynamic. You cannot say I will do X if you do Y. Theres too much variance.
---
Took me forever to figure out a use for them. I use them for when I’m mobbed and throw them almost straight down. The low explosion range keeps them from hurting you. 
---
&gt;You don't want to constantly reinvent the wheel.
---
You might if your first three wheels come out square.
---
Another good way to get lead easily is from tin or aluminum cans. They give you the steel or aluminum, but also lead. Very useful because they are found everywhere
---
Yes and no. Apparently when Bethesda cut up the Gamebryo engine to make the Creation Engine they just took what was needed and left what wasn't/developed what was missing. When they started development on 76 they tasked Battlecry and id to somehow squeeze quakes netcode into it. 
---
Yeah I noticed this when I marked lead for pickup. Disarming those can traps is great for this!
---
If everyone started duping they would have to do something  about it, so dupe away peoples 
---
That's what I think will either save or break Bethesda in this instance. They can't just "modders will fix it" any more. Either this will finally give them leverage to go back upstairs and say, "if you want these nice juicy online pvp profits you're drooling over we're going to have to actually invest more in making it work first"; or Zeni will fail to realize this won't be some quick Battle Royale clone they can just shit out from old code, and demand results without providing proper resources, and the game will tank.
---
I like this... but also the other way around would have been cool too.... 
---
 RP is important!

---
You'll notice that all the new weapons that didn't exist in FO4 have very few - or no - mods available for them. It's almost like the team wasn't allowed to create much new content and was handed a mandate from management to "reuse existing assets" above all else!
---
I bough an extra copy of fallout for my son for Christmas so we could play together and he's always playing rust so I think I found my muel "friend".
---
Moving your camp to whitesprings near any robots will kill him (near the gates) as sloths are normally in an agro state. I know this works from experince except I wasnt trying to kill him. R.I.P Steve the Sloth.
---
&gt;If you're going to buy the game anyway then what does it matter?
---
Oof. 
---
For one, you're giving money without getting a product in return. You're not incentivizing the company to make a good game, but good trailers. You promote bad business practices (for the consumer) of different pre-order bonuses at different vendors, you're buying an unknown, etc.
---
&gt;What you're trying to say is that people would be happy if they didn't buy it in the first place, and that's just a sad opinion.
---
Don't put words in my mouth boy. That's not what I said. But had you maybe not of pre-ordered, you could have gotten a steep discount, you would have known "hey it's another game beth released half baked, maybe weight a year", etc. 
---
There are little to no benefits of pre-ordering, but mostly cons. 
---
Unless a teammate kills them immediately to get the bounty and then buys a clipboard for 500 caps from the wanted friend to "gift" it back
---
Harpers Ferry always has brick building plans for me. I have never seen the barn or warehouses plans. If anyone has them, I have caps! 
---
Look lets start with deleting this thread. You have no idea how much gaming communities can't stand leaving threads. It just does not do well for anyone and no one will see it once it hits enough downvotes.
---
Maybe take a day or two from the game and reddit. We have our mega patch tomorrow on pc and Monday for console. Jump on then try it out and then write a thread regarding your criticisms of the game.
---
If after all that it still is not working well for you. Then grab another game and walk away from this one. No harm in stopping a game you don't enjoy. Afterall they are meant for fun.
---
It's been said quite a bit here, especially when you bring up the DMV quest. 
---
Should be
---
I usually play from 7-10pm cst during the week and randomly throughout the weekend. I’ll dm you my ign.
---
It comes out on console next week.
---
I like this, but instead of limiting it to your team make if where you have 24 hours to put it for sale in an auction house or clan trader. Like the auctions in never winter or the clan traders in ESO. That way once they fix the duping all that exploit gained crap will be gone but you can still be a trader in game. 
---
They are though. They were released as freeware awhile back during a dispute. 
---
I just lost my jetpack
---
eat them immediately
---
? you scapped it
---
I don't want to get your hopes up, but I heard that Sacrificial Blade thinks you're pretty cool, too. ;-)
---
" beyond horrendous for bugs " maybe if you stop exaggerating people will take you seriously.
---
Just do Posiden runs. 9 cap stashs if they all spawn (happens even couple of server hops for me). I usually get 300-800 caps a run that takes around 3-5min to do depending on if you have marsupial/speed demon or not.
---
Thank you
---
Oh, thanks for the tip, friend.
---
I just want a balanced PvP, though, that's all. I think it should take way more bullets to kill someone, so that they have time to react.
---
14th
---
It is pretty good for scorchbeasts keeps them from flying away. Ammo is expensive though
---
Sweet.
---
I only take the useful ones; leader, small guns and explosives. Use them immediately, otherwise I'd "keep them for later" and they never get used. 
---
I take that as a no 
---
No I put it in my stash
---
No worries man. 
---
Sunset Saparilla you say
---
then yes you scrapped  it if you run out of steel it will scrap that to get steel , I have one to sell for 1000$ caps
---
Had similar thoughts while playing and added them all to S master community list. Might be a good place to leave all suggestions for you as well.

I'll have to think about all the options man. I'm very angry rn. That fucking sucks.  No other way to slice it. 
---
That's why I uninstalled 1 month ago and reinstalled Fallout 4.
---
Thanks all. I'll just have to start asking on the bazaar.
---
Well you see... After an unfortunate PvP situation I am left with uh... 23 caps. So... 23 caps! Lol 
---
I never ran out of steel
---
What is the difference between pre ordering and buying day 1? Because most people who complain about pre orders still buy it on the first day and have the same experience for the same price without the little bonuses. Your argument isn't to not pre order it's to wait a little while after release, there's quite a difference 
---
I like how defensive you get to belittle the people you respond to though with remarks like "boy". Must be a solid ego boost.
---
The game was so bad they died of boredom.
---
Big ups 
---
"My philosophy" Your opinion is your opinion, not everyone elses.
---
"I know the optimal choice is to stash your junk before playing" Then do it. If you dont, you are taking the risk. PvP with no risk means its boring for a lot of people. I intentionally often dont deposit my stuff unless I am in dire need of it for the extra thrill. The point is the option to avoid what you are complaining about is literally already in game, you just want to avoid doing ANY work even if that means it deletes functionality and option from others who might like something you do not like. I think leaving the choice up to the player is the most fair way to compromise here.
---
"but its would be more FUN" Your idea of fun is not everyone elses. Sometimes fun comes from having risk and reward, or risk and potential reward. 
---
"The rewards for the pvp events arent worth going to my stash to play" Sure, the event rewards alone are not.. but a nice junk drop of gears screws and springs from another player if you end up winning against them? That sure can be.
---
" I know its a non-issue to take a minute to drop off your screws before but still I'd rather just skip the event, and not play." So its a non-issue requiring minimal effort on your part, that allows choice of how much you risk, but you want it deleted because you are too lazy to do the self-admitted minimal effort to avoid ANY risk? Interesting you value your own laziness over other players being able to choose their own risk levels.
---
"a 1 star item if my googling is the be believed" I have gotten 2 shitty 3 stars from 5k candy turn ins. Not worth it, but I look at it as candy on the cake and is not the reason I go there.
---
"Maybe im not end-game enough to start playing pvp events" There are no real PvP events anyone does aside from monster mash, and seeing another player there is honestly mostly rare. Even when I do they tend to not want to pvp unless I engage.
---
"I'm not complaining" Fair enough, Im down with voicing opinions and hearing what others think
---
Idk man, not meaning for any of that to seem harsh but from most of what you have said this is what I am hearing: You personally do not like having to take a few mins to deposit anything of value before doing the 1 pvp event in game others sometimes choose to do and when doing sometimes choose to pvp in. You would rather take choice out of the options in favor of saving you those few minutes, even if it might take the fun out of it for other players, and despite the fact there is already something in game to prevent your major complaint that takes a few minutes to do at most. You feel the rewards suck, but do not think there should be rewards outside of the event rewards (in the form of dropped player loot). I guess I just either am misunderstanding your position, or find it very self-centered and selfish.
---
Try logging in and out a few times. I had something similar happen (different trigger, seems like accessing my stash while cloaked from chameleon does some wonky shit) and it took a couple of times logging in/out before I could access my stuff again.

Been there many times because i have been a front runner against exploiters everywhere. Almost left the game if it was not for those i play with keeping me level headed. Now we spend alot of time hunting griefers and dupers for the good of others. 
---
Until Bethesda does something about them....
---
I do. In fact, I am a proud nudist. "Let it all hang" is my motto.
---
Pc only
---
Whoops...here's a spoiler alert xD
---
Wait killing the scorched adds on the ground actually makes it land? Are you sure? Cause I’ve definitely had no adds left and the damn bats stayed in the air forever still, pretty sure they just land at random times.
---
 Also shouldn’t tell people that they should always melee it, I’m a melee build sure but plenty of other people aren’t just cause they can afford the weight to carry a single light melee weapon doesn’t mean they don’t probably do way more damage way faster with whatever theirs main weapon is 
---
Side note, at this point they don’t even damage me much anymore just annoy the hell out of me with how much of the screen is covered by their nonstop of blasts, and if they ever do land I consistently kill them with melee before they ever go back up in the air 
---
Dildo?
---
Bethesda ***can*** help you.  If your character is crashing the server, they need to.  Keep playing, keep crashing the server, and force them to fix the bug they've told you they don't want to address, because allowing them to just leave these bugs to crash the game forever doesn't improve anything and that's what they told you when you gave them a bug that you can repeatedly crash the game with easily.  
---
I would love to do drywall with paint on my metal walls...

Did the nuke extend to Morgantown? Nuked Morgantown is pretty great apparently, lots of ghouls and some flora. 
---
Just make sure to delete this thread all i can see is downvotes everywhere. But first save that list i sent you above and post suggestions there.
---
I sell everything except psychobuff and overdrive. I make razorgrain soup from my farm for food and water. 
---
I never use my bobbleheads or magazines, or chems for that matter.  I'd sell the sh1t but the vendor caps aren't high enough and I'd drop them but they're worth too much so in my stash they sit.
---
If your build and weapons are able to cripple their limbs in the first place that means your actually able to damage them while in the air so your probably fine 
---
Different strokes for different blokes is all.
---
Fallout has always been about eventually reaching uber power. Just that glitches made it happen faster the it should have.
---
Also I grew up playing one shot one kill fps (Army online, tom clancy games etc) so Im used to dealing with said mechanics and I guess its why I just couldnt get into fortnight. So plasticy.
---
Dont stick your head out from that ledge. Cover cover cover. Always check your 6, and I mean ALWAYs. Peak around corners. Use 3d spatial mapping + physical future event reading to your advantage. These are real world skills from the military. And when you can pull them off in a game successfully- its super rewarding.
---
Well, I've been a PvP player in every game in which it is a feature. I understand a thing or two about it, but I've always found there's a common rule: one-shots are a bad mechanic. 
---
Let an attacker have a challenge; let a defender have time to shoot back. This first shoot - first kill is what gives us the endless Revenge loop currently present in the game.
---
I don't mind playing dirty. Hell, I've just sneaked inside a Workshop (from a guy who killed me earlier) using a PA trick; I've waited in Chameleon beside said Workshop until this guy came for almost an hour, just to finally contest it in his face and get my revenge. I didn't even want the place. I just took his junk and went on my way.
---
But come on, there has to be at least a bit of balance.
---
No reason the handy couldn't be nuclear for the main power source but need a hydrocarbon fuel (oil) for the hovering thruster. At least, that's my headcanon. 
---
I meant (and of course, iirc still applies) that gamebryo was made from some other engine, and that engine was based off of aultiplayer engine.
---
Not 100% sure though, anything older than oblivion/morrowind I don't have much of an understanding about how they cut up/evolved the engine.
---
That much should be obvious seeing as how the premice of each can easily be done by recycling assets from fallout 4 or with what was already made for 76
---
Animal vault? Nukaworld animals
---
Plant vault? Strangle vine creatures
---
Ash heap vault? Moleminers... Again...
---
Only thing new about them will be the creative ways they try to implement more monetization opportunities.
---
How are you possibly at max caps without any sort of exploit? 
---
Im running around half the game barely able to scrape together more than 1000 caps at one time and running out of lead for bullets... :(
---
...and Im level 83.
---
On the ground.  A shame as I'd love to scrap my extra ammo for 5.56
---
I thought that perk was trash until now. Don't know why i never thought of it, but I'm getting those cards.
---
Did somebody one shot her?  Or if you kill her before health Regen then she won't drop loot.
---
Had a guy one shot her and no loot appeared.  Seems they used the explosive bobblehead stack glitch.
---
He didn’t say it was 10-50 of one kind of map.  I’ve played over 80 hours and don’t even have 13 of one kind of map.  But I’ve got probably around 30 or 40 maps total. 
---
That could work too.
---
Beckwith Farm by the top of the world spawns an armor mod plan, usually trapper, leather or raider in the tool shed by the house. Also in the toolshed are loose screws and springs usually. Then back by the fire pit and dead hanging radstag (gotta get that +20 carry weight food) a mod spawns, also the recipe for delberts mountain hocks are always right on the fire pit. The area also spawns three big monsters, usually yao guai, mirelurk kings, gulpers, anglers or radtoads, good source of mats.
---
A good place for recipes is the middle mountain cabins nearby. Two recipes and a mod of some sort can spawn on the picnic tables out front by the single dead hanging radstag. Usually this place spawns three honey beasts, but yao guai and radscorpions can spawn as well. Oh and a raider power armor can spawn. I usually don't go in the cabins but I think I remember some plans or recipes spawning inside too.
---
And those are two of the places I always hit up on my farming runs, real quick and usually be pay off 
---
It's possible, go for a melee build. Put points in strength. Grab some PA as soon as you can and just do events til you can at least survive in a blast zone. Then get some molotovs and enable passive mode. Find a nuked Whitesprings and throw your molotovs into the horde. If you damage an enemy but someone else gets the kill you still get XP so be sure to hit as many as you can without worrying about trying to kill them. There will be enough high level players there farming legendaries that you shoukdnt have to worry. 
---
And please, dont use exploits like duping. Not only is it risking being banned but it ruins the longevity of the game and screws up the economy.
---
I'll usually feel a server out before attempting, there is some signs if unchecked lead up to having a bad time.
---
Try doing uranium fever. That one drops tons of shotguns 
---
I did the same thing for my visual settings. I find that when in first person the focus changing too much is very distracting and annoying. 
---
Best bet is the head down to the bottom left corner of the map and plant your camp near a deposit and just let it farm for you. Shouldnt take long to find one, there everywhere along the mountain.
---
Man is available in game. All others are not currently legitimately obtainable. Period.
---
I mean, it's not like it's a far walk from the bunker to anywhere they're sending stuff. I keep meeting a Mister Handy that's been wandering around the wastes for 20-someodd years trying to give me 20 Pre-war cash. Surely there's an easier way to transport dog food.
---
I’m surprised with the amount of people on reddit that don’t know what /s means. I even added /sarc to try and be more obvious.
---
Caps are already devalued. They are next to worthless for most end game players. New players will receive caps and can buy vanilla items with them.
---
It’s not confusing, at least to me. Old items sell for caps, new items sell for new currency. Old items trade for caps, new items trade for new currency. People wouldn’t want to trade new currency for old items though, the value wouldn’t be there.
---
I figured it would be easy to clone and change item IDs or to flag items. I’ve worked with a few editors while  scripting and I was able to do it in other games.
---
They should totally allow it.. but have it do nothing but apply a negative buff to AP, make you eat more and have a slowly accumulating chance of lung disease!
---
Yeah not paying $10 for a singular weapon skin.
---
I'd pay $10 if it applied to all weapons (and better yet armor but lets be real).
---
For a reskin of 1 weapon I wouldnt pay more than ~$2, and basic colours should be available for free within the game.
---
That is an amazing C.A.M.P. love the look and the layout, seriously awesome work. :) 
---
I'm not moving my camp.
---
Can't do it bb.

If you get the camo paint from the atom shop, that will persist... otherwise you're out of luck.

---
I don't have any kind of military training or combat knowledge, but I will try to put those tips in practice for the next time.
---
I'm curious about how the Faction PvP they recently announced will be.
---
Even with my melee i need to be super careful when tapping them. Something that never makes sense is these are the end game lads as well you know.
---
What if :
---
Lets take the top one Whitesprings.
---
》 We had a timer on the side while in the area and an alert message after 5 minutes saying something like. A highly mutated creature is nearby, group up and end it before it escapes into the wastelands. These were mini bosses and they provided an aura to all mobs in the nuke zone if left alone. Increasing all mobs health and damage until its killed. Could have different ones for each area of the map.
---
》Just gonna say it all mobs in nuke zones need to spawn in bigger numbers and more often and need to be more of a challenge. Tired of trying to tap mobs and not accidentally killing them. Whitesprings is a speed run and its super boring for end game challenge.
---
》 Give each area of the map different effects and mobs. Where are the exploding glowing ones for whitesprings?, what about packs of ghouls that roam the area they all just spawn in the same locations its boring as hell. Why don't they have different abilities based on some mutations they might have?. Why not have crazy stuff like slow moving ghouls but they hit really flippin hard or ghouls that have mutated to spit toxic waste at you?.
---
Give end game a real oompf sorry for rambling OP love your post man.
---
Happens to me too sometimes. Just a spinning circle and then disappears. Sometimes the loot loads before she disappears. Sometimes not. Dunno why.
---
r/gamersriseup
---
What does this even mean?
---
I've had to spend about 10 perk cards to reduce weight of ammo, food, chems, armor and increase carry capacity, not to mention have all my armor pocketed because of food/drink and chems taking up so much damn weight.  And I'm still always walking around encumbered.  I'd sell a lot of it but the vendors are always out of caps as well and I'm not high enough level to make it past the scorch beast buffer zone on the east side of the map to get the other facton vendors.  
---

---
Fake news 
---
Level 118 never seen a single behemoth #behemothsareamyth 
---
!RemindMe
---
They can't even access players inventories to restore lost items or progress due to a few severe glitches, that's asking quite a lot.
---
This has been proposed a few times, sarcastic or not, and people are just getting tired of the hundreds of "I know how to fix things better than a company with a lot of professionals who get paid to do this" posts (again, sarcastic or not).
---
Things will work out, it'll just take a little bit. This game is already fixing itself much faster than ESO did
---
Sometimes when a server lags and disconnects you lose progress. Like I've lost the last couple of minutes of building a CAMP. So if you recently took it out of your stash check there or it your crafted the set just before the DC then it might be gone for good. Yiu can also send Bethesda a support ticket and see if they can offer any other assistance. Sorry you lost your shit.

Which armor?
---
And even the existing assets don't work properly *cough* plasma *cough*
---
I built most of the armor yesterday and finished to day 
---
I got screwed by that once. Stopped playing for a long time. Came back. Found out they'd started the season nonsense and my stuff had been mailed to me and had long since expired from in-game mail. Support was able to retrieve it for me. But it really turned me off the game.
---
Sorry not huge into using Reddit, is this a link for me to repost this on or does it link the thread to it automatically 
---
One I can handle. Three to four, nope.
---
They literally havent even told us what's in it?  How can you be disappointed?
---
And it’s not in my stash 
---
what system u on?
---
Wish we had a mission that explained why caps were used when we got the the first responder vendor after coming out of the vault.
---
The shortfalls of Fallout 76 does is nothing close to the shitshow that was Star Wars Battlefront 2.
---
Check your stash for a chassis and see if it's there if not then maybe you scrapped it by accident or the server crash took it and contacting Bethesda support is your last option.
---
I go by the same name on fallout feel free to add me. Not on too much during the week.
---
But radaway will get rid of their mutation completely if you catch them while they’re swapping perks around!
---
 You are not in Power Armor are you?
---
Im at artisans corner in whitespring, and he has excavator overdrive servos and reactive plate mods. Ive never seen that guy carry *anything*
---
If they're smart, it never comes off.
---
It's just a link to another subreddit. I was just poking fun at you because you were saying how we should take action against the game companies. Just something that reddit does. You can just ignore it if you want.
---
No, probably should have mentioned that my bad lol
---
I actually really like their version. The singer has a lot of soul in his voice
---
"We are proud to announce we fixed 150 spelling errors."
---
I would not mind it so much if they at least got "exhausted" and had to land and recharge a bit. At least there would be a reason for it to land for a bit.
---
Yea I was lucky to have disliked the first one so never bought into it
---
Jesus Christ I wrote that response 20 seconds ago that was fast 
---
Everything you said is the truth and you get downvoted. Just further proof that like you said, Bethesda and other companies will continue to do what they want and get away with it. 
---
Couple of hits? With what? Melee or some sort of TSE weapon better than a handmade? I've got a TSE handmade 9/9 rifleman and 2/3 armor pen and the lvl 80s still take more than "a couple hits." 
---
Also a seemingly broken thing I've seen is that they suddenly regen health as far as I can see because I'll shoot them a bunch and watch a chunk of their HP come back all of a sudden like they used a friggen stimpack or somehow healed..
---
 OK. I got nothin' then. That is weird.
---
They should contain dog meat too and imply an laikka situation
---
They aren’t collecting thousands of items. They are collecting 1000 copies of 1 item. The server handles it differently
---
This enrages me - definitely should take pre-war cash.
---

---
Also I know I was briefly experimenting with taking starched genes off for a different luck perk and just putting it back on when I use radaway out of combat, or in nuke zones when I’ll be needing radaway more, I’m sure there are people out there who actually do that kind of build even if I gave up on it decided it was to much trouble 
---
You can't say the epic gamer word 
---
&gt;They can't even access players inventories to restore lost items or progress due to a few severe glitches, that's asking quite a lot.
---
That’s a whole different ballgame than what I’m proposing and way more difficult.
---
&gt; "I know how to fix things better than a company with a lot of professionals who get paid to do this"
---
That’s not my tone at all. I’m offering an idea for a solution to this mess. You insinuating that I’m not as smart or capable is a bit rude though.
---
I got the barn plans from capping and defending a workshop from the mob wave. I would suggest farming those if you want plans for building stuff, as both the capture and subsequent defense both gave me plans for building things.
---
You also get less mats than other items. A 10kg plate of steel that's electronically controlled hydraulics and wiring? 1 steel 1 plastic. Wut? 
---
Also while I'm complaining. When do I not have rad worms?
---
&gt; Your argument isn't to not pre order it's to wait a little while after release, there's quite a difference
---
That is *not* my argument. I'm not sure *how* you could even get that. But good job on finding a way. While yes, I would advocate it, you can however find out on Day 1 whether the game is complete bunk; and you still don't pay for, literally nothing, you have the game at that point. You aren't incentivizing bad business practices for the consumer. 
---
&gt;I like how defensive you get to belittle the people you respond to though with remarks like "boy". Must be a solid ego boost.
---
I belittle the stupid. If you're going to say I'm arguing for something I'm clearly not, you've given me no reason to respect you. So I'll do as I please. Mental midget.
---
Since we're nitpicking, it doesn't make any sense to refer to someone as a felon if they weren't convicted of a felony
---
I mean, I've got a pet Brahman. Ramen the Brahman. 
---
I'm sorry but the mire creeps me out day or night *shiver*
---
Relog.
---
I ignore them.. pointless.
---
Yeah, all the perk swapping is kinda annoying.. as far as the quick response, I just happened to have my phone open already when the notification popped.
---
Its Clancy Manor near Hemlock Holes golf course.
---
Fluffy is the name of mine 
---
*Yeah...*
---
*I'ma need all of your steel, and all of your springs bucko. Also, Can you hold onto these 14 Legendary lead pipes for me, my STASH is full!*
---
*Kthx*
---
I 2shot them quite a bit with a prime TSE gauss
---
Some sweet pieces of armor you have there.
---
I don't get this one, while annoying. The game allows you to do it so just let people do it if the so wish to. If you done like it fine just leave the area 
---
I mainly see people agreeing that the dmv quest is the worst, and that the other problems suck too. I have seen a lot of people, like you, say this sub is full of fan boys, but I haven't really seen that.
---
I think that's a half-truth. It's pretty clear that (like sea of thieves) F76 is clearly being developed via 'agile' development. So they likely have ideas, but rather than a set road-map they'll be guided by 'user stories'. 
---
Ya, you'd think they'd at least include 1 legendary. I stopped doing them as it just is a waste of time (IE almost get no legendaries for the time spent).
---
...which is at 35% CND, because of the time it spent in orbit....
---
&gt;...removal of all duped items...
---
You do realize this would remove items owned by people who purchased them via trade without knowing they were duped items, yes?
---
True, I didn't consider that
---
Do you want scorched skeevers in the cellar? Because that's how you get scorched skeevers in the cellar.
---
Sorry, not that you could build, but that entering it worked like a warp.
---
I must be unlucky. I've done literally 100+ workshop events. 
---
Well, if one turns a blind eye to it or is new here, sure. 
---
People here *love* the DMV quest. They think having it reset is *good design*. 
---
I wish there was human NPC's.
---
Hell I don't even care if they retconned the current lore just to put human NPC's into the game.
---
I mean, Pillars of Eternity, Wasteland and so forth are on console... but yeah, there are no Console versions of 1/2. It's silly to think they would be ported just for this.   
---
Before taking off you need to push the button on the stand to the right of the bridge.

Welcome to the internet.
---
I calculated Perforating Magazine at 40% AP with a Watoga robot test, which fits with your results. "Improved penetration" looks like around 20% AP.
---
They do?
---
I’ve seen the Nuka cola clock plan on the rare Charleston vendor bot. If you’re on pc I can help build one in your camp. 
---
Ok so you’re saying things like the stuck in power armour glitch was fine then? Nothing horrendous about that, sure there was a way to get it fixed but how many people didn’t, how many people just lost there shit, I know it cost me my whole set of excavator armour 
---
But I guess being a fanboy makes you right, it’s really people like you that make this worse you have blind faith in a company that has literally lied to us 
---
I think if you can't grasp basic english you should stop communicating. I DID fast travel, OVER 10 FUCKING TIMES. You know, exactly what I said before? Guess what, it didn't fix it. Killing myself with no cores didn't fix it. Closing the game and joining a new server didn't work. Did I make it clear enough for you? 
---
At least two are wearing Vault 94 suits, which makes sense given the backstory we got on that clusterfuck.
---
I played litterally all day and night today on the Xbox and not one drop the when day.  This is my first day without getting dropped from the server every hour.  Maybe I got lucky or maybe they've fixed some problems.
---
I seen it on a vendor I forget who tho
---
I posted a video above with me landing a scorchbeast with a level 5 pump and R1 Enforcer.
---
Even if you maxed Enforcer and Skeet Shooter that is in no way "most of your SPECIAL and Perks".
---
We killed her after the health regen and no one was using explosive weapons or bobblehead.
---
you are one of the players i value most and the kind of player who will be best served by a multi character base construction/level up system. a place to pool very large amounts of items, a place inherently for more enterprising players and groups of players (ones who rise toward a factionhood, whether they themselves are a faction of one or of the efforts of several players collective characters). that mutation shelf setup looks so awesome. I know I myself have no good use for the small letters, so I'm saving it for give to a worthy dweller.   
---
Are you able to stock shelves or is that area just for convenience to show what ones you could offer?
---
This could bring a lot of needed "fun" back into the nuking. 
---
I've been meaning to make a post that the really most rewarding way to get one of any kind is the event breach and clear. A. You have to clear out several mole men dropping black titanium. Otherwise, I've gotten tons of iron, lead, uranium, more black titanium and even ultracite. I don't he event anytime I see it pop up.
---
Except what you’re saying is physically impossible. There’s literally no way in hell you couldn’t possible figure out how to exit the power armor
---
50 cal receiver.  Why have the option even selectable?
---
It’s a sad world we have to deal with greed and corruption everywhere 
---
Yeah I was gonna say perforating is the best armor piercing weapon mod. Would be curious to see the numbers assuming the combat rifle can use it?
---
Looks like we're eating good tonight boys, see y'all in the Appalachia.
---
Try making sure nothing is placed close to it. Mine had a light in-front of it and it kept doing this 
---
What material are you trying to extract?
---
I have been here for awhile, and I don't turn a blind eye to it. Nobody likes the dmv quest. Quit bitching.
---
I got a 3 star Grognak's axe with a 30% additional damage vs Scorched, and 40% more damage with power attacks, and 15% less damage when blocking.
---
Paired with the 2h perks and incision
---
Can easily 2-3 shot level 65+ scorchbeasts (trying to find a level 95 Scorchbeast to kill...)
---
Well it’s proof enough we keep buying shit they’ll just keep feeding it to us, so poke all you want 
---
On a side note interesting subreddit 
---
Thats unfortunate 
---
Never played WoW but Blizzard is a serious company as far as i can tell. Buggedthesda on the other hand is a joke.
---
Back against the walls!!
---
They can't do their stupid Jump/slash attacks with nowhere to jump to, so they tend to slow down slightly. (terrible turning circle)
---
This strategy has worked for me on 5 separate occasions with lvl40+ Wendigo's of various degree's of Fuckedness.
---
*I hope this helps you to get that bloody clown suit onto one of them!?*
---
End game
---
Are you getting serums at those prices through player trade? Otherwise I've heard they go for about 5k through vendors.
---
I find strafing them + speed demon helps alot. The most ive ever killed by myself was 4.
---
I truly enjoyed exploring this area, it was  creepy and intriguing listening to the holotapes and experiencing the “happenings” there. After watching an youtube video about this place, I realised there’s more to this place than what I managed to  discover the first time! 
---
Theres tricks to getting them to land
---
Mostly just junk at the moment. Claiming the workshops is getting annoying. 
---
Yup. It's why the Statue of Liberty is green.
---
Are you a moron or a troll? I can't tell. Let me spell it out for you. Bethesda can't program for shit. They left hundreds if not thousands of bugs in this game. If you played it for more than 2 minutes your brain might have figured that out. One of those bugs causes you to get stuck in Power Armor. There is nothing you can do until the bug resolves itself. Or Bethesda gets off their lazy asses and learned to code properly. I know, you're either too stupid to understand or are just a fucking troll. Either way, I'm done feeding you. Bye! Don't let the block hit your was on the way out!
---
This is my current camp, I kinda wish I had went with something a little larger and more lively such as the way you have yours. but I’ve put in a bit of time and the location is too good to give up honestly :l

You mean..... I don't have to be stuck building a Perk set for TANK PA only?!

There is something you can do, you’re just too much of an angry garden gnome to bother fixing it.

Ramble away good sir, that's what Reddit is for ;)
---
I half sure (and half hoping) better end game materials are coming that will be somewhat like you mentioned. I'd love to see wandering hordes of enemies that scale or even scaled  CAMP attacks that are more than a molerat munching on my porch. 
---
I've played tons of MMO's from close to release dates spanning back to MUD days and I can't remember any that had challenging end game content in their first year. Even with Warcraft in its heyday, the challenge was trying to figure out even where the hell your next quest was and once you figured out mechanics everything was easy. 
---
I too watch Netflix or Youtube while ~~running the gauntlet~~ moseying around the Golf Club. After 30 minutes I take a break then go back grab all the meat clumps of fleshy crap that sells well. Makes capping vendors daily a ton quicker when you have a hundred meat clumps in your inventory selling at 5-10 caps per. I think the only thing that breaks up the monotony for me is jumping in the air with marsupial, VATS targeting enemies, then falcon punching them on my way down. It's the little things.
---
the fact that the m79 benefits from shotgun perks but can't be made to fire 40mm canister shells disappoints me lol
---
I have my camp on top of seneca rocks, and I have one of these traps on top of my base. When it launches me, it takes a good 15 seconds for me to hit the ground.
---
Just go with a melee 2-hander build... one shot everything until end-game and even then you're sporting one of the most overpowered meta builds in the game. The other build is the  Explosive shotgun build but you need to farm for that gun.
---
I'm guessing we'll get more context on them in a future expansion/dlc. I think they're all from 94. And I think 94 residents had made contact with some of the locals. Especially in Harper's Ferry. Then something happened, like a large explosion or something. So I'm guessing something went wrong with 94. I believe they were also rumored to have a geck. 
---
Easiest solution, destroy every camp you come across just in case they might potentially do something that you don’t agree with.  Don’t stop at the golf club either, there’s 24 camps per server so better get to work because they are all potentially ruining your fallout experience. 
---
I’ve already quit
---
I have 25 K caps and nothing to spend my caps on.I can easily make 2K caps /day by just playing for a couple of [hours.In](https://hours.In) 10 days that already means 20K. You guys don't know how to play the game because all i see you doing is farm that whitespring 
---
I think OP's period and Comma keys are broken.
---
Are you saying the handmade is a new weapon? Cause the handmade was introduced in nuka world for fo4 so it isnt new with 76 at all.
---
Stuff for camps and maybe lockpicking and hacking should just be passive 
---
Before February no other news atm
---
I only run into them when i'm searching for loot/ingredients in the mire and my PA is broken from something else lol
---
Wow. I kinda feel bad as the FIRST workshop I ever claimed and defended gave me a duplicate barn. If I'd have known someone needed it I would've kept it. I'll keep my duplicate building plans I guess from now on and I'll offer them for trade.

I can walk through the Ash Heap and be almost completely unhindered, I'm basically LOOKING for shit to wreck!

Whitesprings is a fight-junkie dream, but it hasn't really be replicated anywhere else on the map it seems.

I'd love to be swamped by Mole miners, in a hail of shotgun pellets and Darth Vader screams, trying to find refuge in burnt out house rubble, with mole rats digging holes and risking my perfect disease-free playtime.
---
It’s not that the weapon is a common drop, it’s just a common trading/selling item.     
---
If everyone liked having mutants two shot weapons it would be MTS.     
---
But everyone wants a two shot explosive weapon. 
---
Ha, that's gold....or perhaps I should say, it's Ghould ;) 
---
It's dangerous.
---
Somebody did this down in the Fissure sites... I found the bag and looted a dozen stable flux and some 3 star legendary armour (2 pieces which I'm wearing still).
---
On top of 91 stimpacks and around 60 Rad-Away
---
They’re linked to your Bethesda.Net account
---
Shit man we should definitely get springs and screws from a gun. Are they legit telling me that the guns have 0 springs or screws at all.
---
It's not that they are common drops but that they  are commonly requested/sold as they have the highest damage outputs of any weapons in the game. They are actually extremely rare drops.
---

---
Yes. I just farmed 11 back to back. Killed mobs, it lands, I kill it. I eat it's heart and lungs. Yummy. Looking to make that stew soon.
---
I also stated that when it comes down, melee is amazing and can be used as a back up weapon for when it's down. I'm not specifically telling people to only play a specific way. I am elaborating on my playing styles. Check out the other replies to the comments and you'll see how many different t characters and styles that I have went through. Scolding people doesn't really work on me when it's a video game. I don't know your play style but I'd love to see gameplay footage of you on YouTube taking down minions and them not coming down.
---
I have literally joined with 10 people today from this post and shown them that it works or how it works. 
---
Lol
---
I think they fixed that in the last patch, the M79 no longer benefits from the shotgun perks.
---
Why bother with it when hardened dos more damage?
---
Thank you so much for doing this - I was literally just trying to find the numbers for this to explain to someone!

Are you thinking a Red/White Skin hue edit? Or are we talking FULL Santa whitebeard Deathclaw with a sack of loot tied to it's tail?

Highest I've been kicked was 8 times on 12/24/18, 3 times on 1/7/19..I agree its ridiculous 
---
I've had this bug exactly once.  It definitely was a star on my weaoon, but no legendary abilities showed up when inspected.
---
Figured it was a buggy weapon and with no way to know if there really was a legendary effect or not i scrapped it.
---
As others have said, it's a popular item. Speaking in abbreviations is just common in trading.
---
This is the sole reason I don't buy plans. I'm supposed to remember what plans and recipes I know from a list of probably over a thousand? Seriously?
---
Thanks so much! 
---
They still have to go, sure it sucks for some people but if ruins an important part of the game economy, they gotta go.  Period.
---
Those fire-frog bastards would be a raving success! 20 of those things, all irradiated and glowing, spitting fire, bulletproof and angry...

It rattled round in the casing,  wasn't properly secured.
---
I'm pretty sure they can't.
---
I've called the company and gotten a call back from the CS department to speak on the joke that is FO76 CS.
---
They have no tool to modify/edit/access in-game data like your char.  So don't blame CS.  Blame bethesda for not actually doing their job to allow CS to be useful.
---
The enclave quest series was amazing, dropping nukes = amazing... CRAM from SPACE!!!!! WTF?   
---
Seriously, re-enable the commendations, let us TURN those in for DEDICATED rewards, no more server hopping. YAY.

Glowing mutated DMV waiting rooms are the worst :S
---
That's an awesome C.A.M.P. / Workshop you've set up there, love the layout. :) 
---
That is amazing!! Respect
---
3500 seems like the lowest, that's what I got both before and after the grape mentats with onions and gear.. Unyielding gear and hard bargain 3
---
did you use any bobbleheads?
---
Idk how you run a business like that in a fallout Bethesda game and NOT treat your inventory like it's made of glass especially after all the news about how it affects server stability
---
What’s the point of getting all the perk cards if not for swapping them out to adapt to your situation? 
---
It would be nice to hot swap my perks for PA, when I get into my suit, or for when I don’t and need armor weight reduction. 
---
Or when I’m heading into a nuke zone and need to equip my flora and rad perk cards.
---
Or for when I play in groups vs when I play solo. 
---
Swapping them for all those scenarios is super tedious. 
---
That seems unlikely, og game everything stayed in your OG box. After seasons started that's when stuff got mailed to OG game when the seasons stopped.
---
did you try?
---
Never pay that though. They're valued at ~500
---

Amount of health removed because of rads =/= actual count of rads. You rads cap at 1000 rads which is when you’ll die. You can have 150 health and have 300 rads and not be dead. 
---
It would be cool to have an underground den of mysteries with just an outhouse elevator on the surface...
---
That’s awesome, thanks!
---
Yeah it is although I put all my stuff in a wooden box a bit farther from the station. I make sure to do it as quick as possible and probably use a friend for the higher end items like TSE
---
When you have Glowing Pustules.
---
I'm also super interested in whether this leads to something.
---
Thanks for the questions and answers, I was actually wanting to know the same thing myself. Some of these perks look cooler than they actually are and you dont realize it until you have sunk a bunch if points into it.
---
Thank you! :)
---
That to me is the main issue with this game. 
---
The workshops, these drops and maybe even event rewards are just the random stuff you already find in the game.
---
If it were exclusive stuff the game would've been SO much better.
---
Had an explosive situation like that found a 15 cap wanted by mama dolces, chased them into the broken pipe, with my miners gauntlet, they toss a land mine so I shoot it they blow up, but no reward for me
---
Have you invested anything in the LUCK cards "Lucky Break" and "Luck of the Draw"?
---
I have used them for about 10 levels now, and the frequency with which my weapons repair themselves, and my armour gets a \~50% repair every other skirmish is a big bonus for me.
---
Maybe they'd stack with "White Knight", make your stuff nigh-indestructible?
---
Makes sense. Thanks!
---
Pps: I suck at typing 
---
Some players ARE using it for signal flare use.
---
I haven't personally seen one fired for help yet, but stories abound with Power Armour Ultramarines arriving to help out!
---
I might just shoot a flare next time i'm in a pickle, see what comes of it!
---
I felt like the queen was more difficult. There was like 10 of us and we only just ended up killing her with a minute to spare where as before it used to only take about 10min max

I ran into a invisible Assaultron in Sugar Grove. This was different from the Mr. Gutsy. I could see a shimmer effect and the glowing red eyes of the Assaultron.
---
Are you going to be a super villain?
---
I have muraipal too and have jumped up there.
---
Was not on purpose though, confused the hell out of me trying to figure out where I was.
---
If anyone is wondering there is absolutely nothing exciting up there. It's just the ceiling....
---
Pretty sure it’s actually because of natural oxidization. Maybe that’s part of it too
---
i just waited long enough, it was throwing my friends in and out of the list every 3 mins but they should come back eventually
---
I lost my excavator armour back with the original stuck in pa glitch and later after I wasn’t and literally dropped all my stuff to bring me to zero weight did I find two sets of other power armour that was completely invisible in my stash, sadly neither was the lost excavator armour 
---
I bet there was a failed game Bethesda was trying to salvage, and ended up just tossing the assets into a blender with what they had leftover from FO4 when the funds ran out
---
Hard bargain adds 3% per star

Just make it like a certain mod for F4. When you go into your bunker it places you into a "room" in the game world.

I had feral dogs get under my junk generator, I think they got this.
---
My issue is losing server connection while doing a daily and having it all reset. Kills the mood to play instantly when I lose 2-3 hours worth of work 
---
You're not wrong!
---
My build is
---
S &gt; 15
---
Blocker R3, Slugger 3, Expert Slugger 3, Martial Arts 3, Incision 3
---
P &gt; 3
---
Green Thumb, forgot the other card
---
E &gt; 5
---
Ironclad 5
---
C &gt; 4
---
Lone Adventurer
---
I &gt; 5
---
Makeshift warrior 5
---
A &gt; 15
---
Action Boy 3, Marathoner 3, assorted others like less damage during sprinting eg eg
---
L &gt; 11
---
Class Freak 3, Bloody Mess 2, Starched Genes 2, Serendipity (may look at adding Bloody Mess 3 sometime)
---
Mutations are:
---
Speed Demon, Twisted Muscles, Grounded, Carnivore, Healing Factor, Marsupial so far...
---
This build allows you run around -a lot- due to the reduced AP needed for sprinting, and take very little melee damage due to Blocker 3 and Lone Adventurer. Pair yourself with a good 2-hander legendary and you'll be 2-3 shotting level 65 Scorchbeasts at end-game, and one-shotting pretty much everything including level 68 glowing ghouls.
---
If shit gets too hot, just run away... you have more than enough AP to do so.
---
If you're heading into Nuke Zones, slap on power armour (X01 for rad resist) and swap out Ironclad for the perk card that heals rads during the day. With Green Thumb card you can harvest over 60 flux in 30 minutes to sell at the vendors for easy caps.
---
This build is so overpowered it can get a little boring when you're one-shotting everything :(
---
Because gunpowder too is so incredibly rare in the world.
---
Or you can pay 500-1k to another player on market for them.
---
I have a couple times and nothing's come out of it, I feel like the problem is the flare isn't visible enough, which is why I think they should add a mini-event or maybe even a notification so people can better see it.
---
It happened to me at Camden.  Maybe a preview of a new boss?
---
what is the deal here? what is the problem?
---
my new character relies on camp moving and offensively using turrets against enemies that chase.
---
need to know whats goin on for podcast coverage
---
They look better in photo mode after you destroy someone's camp, you should try it
---
Been my experience as well.
---
right?  I'm pretty sure the only time I DIDN'T have any gunpowder was when I was making my way into Flatwoods fresh out of the vault.
---
Doesn't it drive you crazy that the flora is popping through the floor. Same with my place. 
---
I meant the 50 cal machine gun.  It allows you to select receiver, which no mods other than standard exists for, and barrel, which only has the one barrel.  
---
Okay so. Get to level 15. Get a RAF suit. Tag mobs while others are farming white springs. 
---
nearly every vehicle was powered by an atomic Pile.   Makes sense that rad-x and Radaway would be pretty common.
---
Awesome. I'll just keep my fingers crossed that it just fixes itself when I log in tomorrow.
---
I saw a guy who actually built a functioning electric chair using tesla arcs. only problem is you have to get the victim to willingly sit in it 😂
---
I like to imagine they hacked up some janky homebrew system based off the same savefile format they've been using since morrowind and that's why they've never had stable savefiles since... morrowind.
---
Just to clarify, when you say you have no mutation do you mean it doesn't show up in your effects tab or it just doesn't do anything.
---
Bird bones always sounds like it would be a really obvious thing to notice the difference in using it but it's not really. Dont get me wrong, I still recommend using it but you still take fall damage if you are too high (just less of it) and you do fall more slowly but only really really subtly slower. It's good to combine  with Marsupial and Speed Demon.
---
It was the same in 4. Over time I just got used to it I suppose. 
---
I love that pc became the unofficial beta testers for patches
---
Or don’t start you off in white springs with 5 seconds till the nuke falls
---
If that's the case it must be cumulative instead of additive with Charisma modifiers. With Cha 4, 3\* Hard Bargain drops my cost from 4600 to 3880, so \~15%. I was assuming 15% per level.
---
and 40mm rounds on vines like Cucumbers.
---
Please post a source, I need a good laugh.
---
They released part of a game and locked the rest behind free DLC that takes so long to be released that most players quit playing before the first one hit having finished the game (and most likely will pick it up again a year or two later to finish the content).
---
I wonder how many people aren't sure if I was talking about MHW or FO76.  &gt;!I'm talking about MHW.!&lt;
---
Usually fixes itself in a few seconds. That just means you went into your social tab before the game was fully connected 
---
That did it, thanks. 
---
I like the theory in this thread.
---
Whitesprings was operational and safe,  acting as a trade hub and all the bots were already programmed for Cap usage,  that spread out into the world.
---
I don’t cheat. I use an Unarmed Bloodied Unyielding 20% build and I can solo her in one landing. I usually farm her 3 times and wait for my silo timers to farm her again.
---
Is it really surprising? I mean how many times have we entered an area no ones been in since the war to unlock a safe and find a pipe gun and raider armor.  
---
Eat sh.. Good for you!
---
(Starts Slow Clap) Bravo Wastelander, Bravo
---
I agree that this is one of the most frustrating things, and should be addressed. :|
---
I had I think 12 charisma when I tested it. Nothing else that affects it and it did 3* per for me
---
Actually it has Prime Receiver and Heavy (or Long?) Barrel.
---
I'll have to try maxing out Charisma on one of my characters and stacking gear. 3500 caps is exactly 30% off from the 5000. I'll see if I can drop it lower, but 30% seems reasonable.
---
So I was all excited to test this out...went and got the mats to make several different kinds of tea, got more than enough but it says I lack the materials...wtf?
---
Read something that said you can only make certain recipes in certain zones...well all zones didn’t allow me to make tea
---
Awesome updated harpers ferry to reflect the church as a viable spot for plans. 
---
I had a slightly similar issue where I couldn't bring up my Pip-boy or interact with anything.  I didn't have a huge inventory or anything, I think it happened when I was messing with my inventory though.  I could bring up my map and fast travel but nothing else, not even open doors.  I tried interacting with anything at all.  It finally fixed itself when I got to a water pump of all things, it let me collect water and everything magically fixed itself.  My advice is just try everything and anything, you never know what's going to straighten it out.
---
Thank you very much, checked and confirmed the location, much appreciated. Will also add Middle Mountain Cabins as an honorable mention since people looking for plans also tend to be looking for mods, and it I can confirm recipes and mods appear here, even though I didn't find any plans. 
---
Ah!  That makes sens (In that yeah it makes no sense).
---
I was stoked to find a .50 cal receiver plan for the hunting rifle,  I thought I'd get a nice bump in damage on my sniper.
---
Nope.  loses 8 damage compared to the Hardened .308
---
Except the robots at the Whitesprings were hostile to outsiders for several years afterwards. Thus why the original guests had to leave after a year. I really don't think that was the reason.
---
Plus, we see absolutely no signs of outside encroachment on the Whitespring. It looks pretty well preserved and unaffected when we get there.
---
Optimized Bracers for Excavator x.x
---
&gt; 99% this is going to bar 2 shot and explosive being compatible. at the very least, it's going to remove its OP status. 
---
I doubt it. That'd actually be benefital to the game. It's probably for glitches like this guy on one of my servers yesterday who had a 2 shot combat knife dropp for him lol
---
Platform:Xbox 1

The quest was Tracking Unknowns, the part where you need to enter the Dyer plant sewers. I entered it in my power armor and used a rad x. I was taking more radiation than I would have liked so I did the following as soon as the option was available: I exited the power armor, reentered it, and left the sewer (I was going to put in the prototype hazmat suit then realized my mistake). From then in I was taking major radiation damage as if I was still in the sewer even if I moved to a radiation free location. Rad resistant items barely helped and the Hazmat suit got it down to 3 rads a second. I had to let it kill me to stop it. I’m not sure what triggered it. I’ve not tried to recreate it. 
---
It's a great sniper rifle for heavy weapon builds. With a Two Shot Harpoon launcher (doesnt need to be an explosive one) you pick up like 4 harpoons for every 1 that you shoot.
---
Buying serums isn't the main reason for the post. I'm trying to figure out the max price reduction you can get with buffs and perks. Serums are the easiest way to calculate it since they're the highest price point item that spawns in a vendor reliably. I'd use the serum recipes to compare if they spawned consistently.
---
if you have the resources don't waste the caps, the resources are worth much less than the 80 caps you need to move the camp twice (assuming you want it back in the original position). 
---
I would like a cellar door or a regualr door that loads us into an empty space for building. It was a mod for 4 and it was simple and made building seemingly massive building easy.
---
I'm pretty sure it's both. My axe has this legendary effect and I tend to sprint/power attack at Scorchbeasts.
---
Still, even farming whitespring nuke zones for couple hours already nets you half of that amount. All these meds/mats/legs sell for a crapton of caps. It's totally possible to cap out on caps in couple of weeks without much effort. The thing is most people never play the game effectively, min/maxing stuff and such...
---
I'll try to stay logged in longer than a few minutes. Maybe that was the problem all along.
---
A butt FULL of nuts. Consider this statement stolen.
---
Bethesda is planning to release the console version of tomorrow's patch next week.
---
Maybe they plan on fixing a lot of shitty player behaviour (dupes) and don’t want to give people a heads up on how they will do that so they can’t prepare in a way to counteract it. That said there will be a week delay before consoles anyway probably.
---
Or parasites.
---
Some areas are like that. Flatwoods, for example, will only spawn up to level 6 Scorched so that new players can actually play the game without getting their shit pushed in constantly. But most areas will spawn enemies based on the highest level player in the area.
---
This would be great, I can never decide if I want to go rifles or pistols!
---
There's acid rain in the game? I played for like 50 hours or something, never saw the weather change at all.
---
Same. My group of friends were all super excited for this game. We played quite a bit. But in the last month or so, the disconnecting has been getting insane. Back to Overwatch until they fix this stuff. 
---
Absolutely not. What you are suggesting is Making items untradable except for with the team when it was found. I'm not going to go into the many problems with this. Il just give you 1:
---
What about solo players 
---
You kid (and i laughed), but a LOT of these bugs do seem to be simple typos and omissions, so you're probably not totally wrong.
---
Shoot up supermutants at jail. Scrap weapons. Workbench there. 
---
My bet is they'd love to do stuff like this but it will take aaaages to develop and make sure they're (relatively) bug free.
---
I had seen a lot of questions and no answers. I had to know.
---
For the Lazy: " Update: Containing more than 150 fixes, the patch will now land on PC beginning tomorrow and consoles early next week. Similar to what we did with the December 11 patch, placing it on PC first will give us time to make further adjustments as needed before releasing the patch on consoles. We will communicate if there are any further diversions from the schedule. PC players, please note that tomorrow, January 10 at 9am ET Fallout 76 will be receiving this update at which time we will also post the patch notes. Thank you! "
---
Not true.
---
I used the Speed Demon serum a few days ago with the perk card equipped.
---
Honestly I would carry it for that purpose if the gun and the ammo weighed nothing but even for as light as it is I want all the carry capacity I can so it just doesn't make the cut.
---
Man, Pizza MRE and Jalapeno Cheese Spread.
---
I disagree. I like the new repair system better, I think it's far more realistic, and makes much more sense. I wouldn't want to have to carry double the weight of an item to have to repair it.
---
It... It was the "Seek revenge in real life" part of the comment that caused the downvotes if you were wondering
---
I found an Unstoppables comic today in the diner/restaurant building right behind the Brotherhood of Steel vendor in Watoga. It's my first issue I've found of it but have found other mags in that diner as well. Hope this helps. I'm also on PC but don't plan on selling my copy as my hubby and I also collect them. Good hunting!
---
lol. I'm an attorney - I was arguing a case.
---
Fair point and makes sense.
---
From what I've gathered so far, Charisma is \~1.7% per point. So if that's the case you'd have a base mark down of 24% before HB. With the 3500 price u/KingEvilCody just gave, if we assume a hard cap at 30% you'd be at 21% rounded up before HB. So 30% is starting to look really good.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
The moral of the story here is. Don't exploit the game by duplicating items.  
---
Hold club is a super popular spot to farm experience and legendaries, both as a nuke zone and regular. People build a camp right outside the back door with a platform full of turrets. The turrets attract and kill all the spawns in the club, effectively kill stealing from everyone else in the area. To make it worse, they leave their camp there while they go off and do other stuff, so their turrets are blocking people from getting exp and loot, and they aren't even there to benefit.
---
I'd rather see the perk cards for rad resist be bumped up with a downside attached.
---
What kind if price are you looking for?
---
Except the springs you put in to repair it... 
---
Good call, I used the wrong name for the magazine. We used perforating.
---
Here's how to fix this:
---
* Get a whoooole lotta people together.  
---
* Contact your friendly neighborhood duper.  
---
* Get everyone hooked up with a bazillion maps.  
---
* Everyone breaks their inventory.  
---
* You now have an army of server crashers.  
---
* Go crash as many servers as possible until Beth fixes their stuff.
---
Thew way I understand it the quest is left open ended, so that when DLC is released, the story of the Overseer and what happened to her can continue.
---
meh, real glory lies in bayonet charges as a proud meatshield.
---
or beating people up with the rolling pin RP'ing as an arbites
---
It probably will help actually. That's one of the few places I still haven't explored. Thanks for the tip, I'll check it out! And I totally understand haha, collecting in these games is half the fun.
---
Stay in the forest 
---
3500 is the minimum it can go, not what the total effect is. The only chance you’ll have of getting the max possibility is looking at signs and letters or a serum recipe 
---
I know right!?!?
---
I'm pickimg them up thinking I'll get a good supply of lead for some ammo, but NOOOO, blergh!!
---
If you are looking to buy serums, I would suggest checking out a trading subreddit or discord. You can get them for a few hundred caps. I have a few serum recipes, and they are surprising easy to make, most difficult ingredient is 1 flux. 
---
Do you know if Perforated has more armor pen than the other two or if they are all the same?
---
Fingers crossed they are being coy with the patch notes because there’s a mass duper cull!!! 
---
I know this may affect people who have unknowingly purchased duped weapons so I’m not asking for everyone to get booted but I think by now dupers should be pretty easy to identify and cut.
---
I’d love to see all duped items disappear and anyone in possession of multiple (say 15-20) items booted.
---
I know for a fact nothing i own  is duped ( it’s all crap I’ve looted ) but if I was a victim of unknowingly purchasing a duped item I’d sacrifice that to some server stability.
---
Anyone know the feasibility of this? I’m a simple console peasant and know nothing of coding etc.
---
I would suggest staying around the Forest, Ash Heap, and Toxic Valley. everywhere else will probably spawn higher lvl enemies. Forest 1-15, Toxic Valley 15-25 Ash Heap 25-35. Don't worry about the quests, but try to do the dailies and events, saving the big quests for later
---
God damn it, just got kicked from the server right before killing a *** legendary super mutant. Fuck.
---
use cheats and exploits 
---
A blue circle on the mini map?
---
So we get an idea "someone needs help in THIS area"
---
Acknowledged doesn't mean allowed.
---
Hrm? You mean the threads where people say they love it and think it's *hilarious* that it, and other quests reset were all figments? 
---
Fuck off fanboy.
---
Perforating offers the highest armor penetration. I believe improved is 10% and superior is 20%. Perforating wins at close to 40% based on another thread where someone did testing
---
While I love this idea, and it’s absolutely something I am begging to see in the future, I feel this same thing is posted about once a week. “We want more nuke events and nuke bosses depending on where you nuke”. Hell, I even made one post about this WAY back just after the second BETA day on Xbox. 
---
Not that I’m complaining, I do hope Bethesda sees our posts about it and reads them. But I think the community has given at least one nuke boss idea for every location in the game by now, lol. 
---
Could you repair in 3? I thought new vegas introduced that.
---
I hope they fix explosive vent since it's the only mod I can make for my Ultracite 😑
---
They also didn't speak about any reworks, something many aspects of the game are in dire need of.
---
Are we just going to get a bunch of hotfixes that should have arrived weeks ago bundled together?
---
My excitement level is bethesda/10.
---
Wtf.
---
There aren't any that would help a low level player.
---
Random drop I know some people were looking for them.
---
I've never found or seen any reciever mods, I know you cant get it from scrapping, wasted a lot of mats and time trying that with crafted and found guns.
---
workshops (really fun, good xp, also gain useful items and caps), event missions, side missions found by exploring. whitespring enemies (i can easily solo them with rocket launcher, grenades, and somerset special, my tech long range character started doing sessions there about level 6. working up thru the 20s now, starting main quest experience at level 33 for a more balanced heavy weapon power armor perk build
---
Shoot her in the belly
---
its common
---
it wasn't supposed to be, but people duped so many of them the market is saturated 
---
At that level i was in the forest mainly.
---
Go up to morgantown.
---
Btw a level gap that small shouldn't be so crippling.
---
Tell your friend to use a two handed melee weapon and a hunting rifle.
---
Melee is strong throughout the game
---
More will come very soon. They’re just trying to fix all the shit before releasing more. 
---
Woah there patriot, the man setting up the turret WINS like a TRUE AMERICAN BADASS. It sounds like you have been outsmarted by good ol' American ingenuity!
---
Ahh, awesome thanks so much, I'll pass this off to my friend, we've decided to go to the Mothman museum so hopefully, we won't die haha. 
---
It is mechanic that protect game from power leveling, same as in world of warcraft. (There in party you had % of xp if you was in party, and with much higer level you get near to nothing, but there you get most XP from quest not from mobs, here is 1200xp for scorched earth event or 2 glowing ghouls)
---
37 here, only get to play Thursday nights from 8pm, and Sunday arvo from 3.00pm, Unless my wife is out/asleep. Slidehoon 
---
Gotta pick up tin cans and pencils my dude... idk why
---
I intended to look into other things. I think across the board everything from recipes to bulk junk will have cap at a 30% discount from base value even if you buff to 50%. 
---
The serum recipes, for example, will probably only go as low as 14K regardless of a 30% modifier or a 50%. Unless each item or item type has an individual min/max on discounting, which would be cool but probably not something I could being done.
---
I hate how you can't even hide from them in a building, because then they'll release a toxic cloud that covers everything.  
---
Prime receiver plans only come from Scorchbeast / Scorchbeast Queens.
---
Nice!.
---
My camp is just a bit higher up the mountain(hill?) from yours, its right below the big Lion King lookin' rock.
---
I love the view from here, its way too pretty
---
Well. I bought what I think was barn plans and got electrical conduits instead. 
---
It's official, folks.  We're the guinea pigs in this latest experiment...  :P
---
Oh great, those are lvl 1-6s I believe, I farm the eggs there! Be sure to check out the statue mang!
---
It was boring and a dated mechanic.
---
Above a body of water. Mobs can't spawn in water
---
Well, one, nuke zones are supposed to be high end content and you are level 16, so makes sense. Two, a power armor chassis doesn’t provide much, if any, rad resistance. You’ll need a full suit of power armor, and I’m not even sure Raider Power Armor will do much anyways, the next step up is t-45 and you don’t get that til maybe level 25 if you can find a full set by then. You can drop power armor all together in favor of a hazmat suit, but then you don’t have any damage resistance. 
---
Long story short, you don’t need to be doing Nuke zones at that low of a level unless you know what you are doing and have a team to support you. Plus, beyond leveling, there won’t be anything for you there as most weapon and armor drops will be max level. And if you are there to level, solo leveling at level 16 is MUCH better done elsewhere.
---
I wouldn’t say we are afraid, more don’t won’t the hassle that potentially goes with it. Possible setup and the revenge feature etc etc. Not worth it IMO
---
They're common because they're duped
---
where did you get the connectors plan from?
---
Repairing has been around for as long as fallout itself.
---
Vendor caps are set by character, per day, and there are 7 "factions" with their own stash that refresh each day. Server hopping won't refresh a stash. I've also noticed a vendor won't load their caps stash sometimes when you first talk to them (it'll show 0) but you just have to back out and re-initiate trade once or twice to get it to load.  
---
A very useful map for finding the vendors and their "factions" can be found here: (credit for the map to u/Channel5Gaming )

This is kind of a dumb question. Its abbreviated for the same reason anything is... its shorter and faster.
---
go to: Menu &gt; Challenges &gt; World &gt; "Find the Overseer's logs"
---
to see a list of all the &gt;!17!&lt; locations, the ones you already found will be marked.
---
Sadly the quest does not appear as completed in the quest menu after you find all the locations.
---
Yeah. That hasn't shown up as an option, which is why I asked. 
---
Same. Except I woke up from surgery 12 hours ago and have a cast from my mid bicep to my fingertips. No playing for me for a while, so hopefully there will be plenty to do when I get back.
---
I am little over that level, and yesterday i oneshoted two of legendary mobs in uranium fever, becouse i was doing **Kill 5 legendary enemies weekly challenge**. I do not give shit if other dont get loot as i was there first. I am not risking **someone would have last shot** on those and if i had to go find another legendaries, i couldnt even have revenge cause how pvp works.
---
Scrap guns.
---
Extractors aren't worth your time.
---
After 30mins you'll get 10 ore which will turn into 5 scrap using 5 acid too.
---
Or scrap a shotgun and get 5 steel scrap
---
I may be mistaken, it has been a long time. 
---
99 little bugs in the code,  
---
99 little bugs!  
---
Track one down,  
---
Patch it around...  
---
124 little bugs in the code!
---
Just a warning though, the Keypad Switch, is broken. No one will have to type in a code at all to access what ever its connected to. All you gotta do is flip the switch. 
---
Oh cool, good thing I suggested going there! Too bad the PS4 version kept kicking us out of the server... haha. 
---
I've done the same with the Double-Barreled Shotgun. Scrapped at least 80 of those things and got maybe 2 mods total.
---
Woops. I forgot to mention is scrap.
---
You need to find the rare vendor bot by charleston trainstation (not the one in the station)
---
How to find it? I just described it in my recent post here on reddit. Just check on my profile. 
---
When another player enters the area it repops everything.
---
Ahh okay, yeah I've mainly been knocking off the enemies I can, she's been able to kill a few but I didn't know a) enemies scale to my level and b) that she'll get little to no XP, thanks!
---
This is the first time I've heard that mentioned.
---
They weren't hostile to everyone.  The Modernization initiative furloughed staff and evicted all current guests, and all the survivors there fell into one of those groups.  The shops were open to day guests during this time.  We're all day guests, that's why we cant get rooms, the modernization initiative is still running, but no one is coming to actually do it.
---
Thanks for the tip, chief. Sadly I'm not one of you filthy muties and I keep my body clean
---
I didn't meet SB yet (and not really excited to), but asking just to know - how effective would be throwing in a frag grenade (unaltered by cards) when the beast lands?
---
Keep to the north/northwest of the map for now, maybe head towards charleston as well. Certain main questline spinoffs give you legendary weapons, I would suggest doing those to completion and some pretty good legendary weapons/armor along the way to help you along.
---
P.S.: I would suggest looking at the perk planner ([https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)) and both of you plan your particular build and browse all the (eventually) available skills. It will help you make a coherent build for your character, which I did NOT do with my first character and am still trying to get the proper perks to use my build.  
---
Camden. I got the Motion Assist and Rusty Knuckles plans there too.
---
Home Base essentially works that way in Fallout 4. 
---
Lol, I didn't say it was hard. Yup.  
---
That's the whole technique for plans/world loot: If someone else server hops before you, all world loot spawns for them. As long as they don't pick anything up, you can pick of the same loot every hop. So, for example, any world loot that spawns on a cooldown can be farmed with two people: bobbleheads, stealthboys, mods and plans. All farmable.
---
It's why common spots seem to overspawn, because if the cell was loaded by someone else and isn't stale enough to reload for you, whatever plans they spawned will still be there (TOTW/Harper's Ferry are two excellent examples).
---
It's also why coding a location (at least one other person mentioned it) works:  
---
If you grab a couple of garbage items (like vases at harper's ferry) and server hop, every time you see those specific items missing, you know either:  
---
a) you are the one who loaded the cell
---
b) someone coded the same as you (so try to make it unique xD)
---
It doesn't mean you're on the same server again, it means the cell loaded for you. Using coding for Harper's Ferry the hit rate for obscure plan spawns goes up a lot: if my code isn't there, it's almost certain one of the spawns other than the first display case will have a plan.
---
Thanks for the explanation. I’ll just watch the mushroom cloud from the sidelines for now I guess lol 
---
This is correct. The barrel you get from scrapping it does add a few points of damage and until you scrap enough is quite often on the (raider i think) vendors for dirt cheap.
---
Just had a discussion an hour ago about how mob spawning needs to be increased so we can farm a nuked Whitesprings.
---
I also sympathize with your Wendigo. At least the Mirelark Kings didn't respawn.
---
What system are you on 
---
Her health goes up as more people join in.  I've killed her with 3 people before in a reasonable amount of time but killing her with 8+ people seems to be extremely difficult unless people are cheating to up their DPS.
---
[So you’re saying...you’ll light my country music award on fire?](https://youtu.be/oXPSlzQ_D0k)
---
I think just raider armor. Whatever the lowest one is. 
---
Have you any information on my traitor brother? I am looking for him.
---
Even the current endgame is bugged to heck. We launched a Whitesprings raid night before last. Total lag fest. It was idiotic how much the server was behind.
---
Last night we got a Scorch Queen Beast and batter her quite easily. Then server hopped to get some more bullet materials only to have someone else call in a SBQ. After a solid 20 minutes of shooting the heck out of her we hadn't reduced her below 1 star. I ran dry on .50, 5mm, .308 and she wasn't landing long enough to melee.
---
So yeah. More content is a must. As well as fixing current content. And maybe getting less stressed servers? 
---
With the limited carry weight and stash size this would be really impractical for someone who uses big guns or weapons that don't drop as frequently.
---
&gt;There aren't any that would help a low level player.
---
I like how that's the take away from the comment.
---
How about a reroll mechanic
---
They'll scale to the highest in the party or whoever enters the area first.
---
In the forest it should cap pretty low, 1-6 is normal.
---
Doing events and exploring should get her you levels.
---
Tip for power cores, if you relog with PA on it replenishes the core to full.
---
I think he said others can't even come near him without crashing the server. 
---
The Marines Malevolent probably would have killed you for being in the way.
---
Did you include the FO76 black market where you can pay to buy super rare items for real money online? 
---
A discord collaboration leading to a massive load of BS, not to mention what you missed at the locations you're talking about.  
---
We'll see if it's still true with next patch, but i do know a legit way to get all mods for armors in a single location - and except for some CAMP shits, i already have ALL the plans in the game, for all armors and all weapons.  
---
This reddit is rigged with amateurs, wannabees, fantasists and delusional bethesda fanbois. Because of you Bugthesda is gonna nerf the shit out of TSE because you wannabe progamers doesn't even know how Perception works and how to beat a guy in PvP with a non-legendary wep just using the legits mechanics of the game.  
---
You're making me puke.  
---
I have noticed that when crafting, it will choose mods randomly if they are made of the same material you are using to craft, even if you are not out. I couldn’t believe my eyes so I tried it again with something different and made 100% sure I had enough material and sure enough it was still choosing to scrap the mod instead of using my material.
---
Or Orks.
---
How “soon” are we talking with the new content phrase at the bottom? Like, “Are we there yet, mom?” soon or Blizzard Entertainment “SoonTM” soon? If it’s the latter, we’re all fucked and should just move on to Anthem or Division in a few weeks.

PS4
---
As someone that regularly nukes "other" sites I can confirm something of this genre already exists... for instance drop a nuke on the Toxic Dried Lakebed near the waterpark... wily willards waterpark or w.e it's called you literally need the Toxic dried lakebed location marker as the drop point as close to the centre of the blast as possible.. result.. respawning 3 star legendary mirelurk queen... just one example the best of several I would say.. for instance if you are too far away the spawn becomes a Boss Snallygaster instead.. drop zone is critical to creature spawn when it's not the SB queen you want to summon
---
Yeah it has bad resists. You on pc? I can give you some gear if you want.
---
Much simpler explanation.  Mr handy fuel is for their flamethrower.  Any oil based fuel for the thruster would have run out on most of them, especially the crazy ones, ages ago.
---
Protectron would be the only acceptable DJ in this Wasteland 
---
We had 4 of us all pretty decent level with pretty decent weapons, 2 M2s, non TSE, a combat rifle, also non E, and I can't recall what the other guy was using. After 12-15 minutes we got her below 1 star. She was also just landing and taking off immediately. Eventually we just walked away. There was zero chance we'd get her. 
---
player trade

First time I saw one I was in the Mire minding my own business when I looked over to my left and saw 2 large red eyes staring at me in the distance.  Teleported over to me and killed my lvl 30 ass.

I would imagine a more complex version of: 
---
Select \* from PLAYERINVENTORY where ITEMEQUIPPED = 'FALSE' and ITEMCLASS in ('Weapon', 'Armour', 'Junk') and PLAYERID = 123456
---
then run a delete of the same. obviously this would be several tables and stuff, but i don't know their system lol. 
---
I’m personally fine with a magazine fed version like Ana from Overwatch, myself; but more the merrier.

---
I have mostly all of the mutation serums recipes so I can make you some.

Would trade for any of these:

# .308 ammo (I got a new 2 shot non explosive light machine gun and I dont have ammo to use it)

I dont really need caps because I am always selling anything I pick up but the vendors and they never sell what I want but then it's always useful for fast travel anyway if that is a you have.
---
Meh, by the same token what do I need the junk for really? I've acquired so much of everything that my stash box is almost always full and I don't have a whole lot to spend it on even after building my base and repairing my weapons and things. I can't stop myself picking stuff up tho it's a real problem
---
Reach out to GhostAgent. He is selling them for 3k for PC players. Look for his recent posts about it. 
---
I would love this, though RNG would probably still give me the finger.
---
stop reposting this
---
Now he knows where you live. Pleasant dreams!
---
I don't think it's from space.  I think it's just an artillery shell used for long-range supply deployments.
---
Stop duping these posts
---
Just block me thanks
---
I am.   I'm the ammosmith for my crew and we are bottlenecked on lead for 5.56 rounds.
---
I may have to dedicate saturday to just lead runs.
---
To be clear, it's possible to get it from regular scorchbeasts?  Cuz I'm about to start farming 
---
I feel you. I burn through 5.56 like nobodies business. If you’re on Xbox I can maybe help

Hey, thanks for reading! Here's the approximate location: [https://imgur.com/eIE1t7K](https://imgur.com/eIE1t7K)
---
There's so many posts on this reddit, it's hard to get anything noticed hehe - Enjoy, and make sure to come back here if you find any other cool spots to build!
---
For me, it’s going to be the lack of loot. Killed the SBQ for the first time and had a bugged corpse with zero loot.
---
I frequently kill 3* legendary mobs and get 1* or no legendary loot, even after letting the health regenerate. 
---
Still great, since now we can't do anything about legendary weapon 
---
The effort put into this map is much appreciated. However I use https://fo76map.com/ and I'm not seeing much of a difference in primary locations. Perhaps you could use your project and get ahold of whomever owns that website and do a collab to get more info and a solid functioning map?
---
Me and the group I play alot with anytime we are doing a nuke zone we all switch to tesla rifles to tag groups and let others have at it while only taking off around 5-10% of their HP per hit. Most of us either have TSE weapons or 1shot 2h melees so we try to play nice. 
---
Will most likely improve when they figure out a way to ban dupers

There were some clothing items removed from world spawn to event items. Someone datamined it iirc and it was posted under a jumpsuit post. Here is the droptable. the dlc items were worldspawns but are quest rewards now. The chance of getting a clothing reward is insanely low though glhf.

&gt;A discord collaboration leading to a massive load of BS, not to mention what you missed at the locations you're talking about.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;This reddit is rigged with amateurs, wannabees, fantasists and delusional bethesda fanbois. Because of you Bugthesda is gonna nerf the shit out of TSE because you wannabe progamers doesn't even know how Perception works and how to beat a guy in PvP with a non-legendary wep just using the legits mechanics of the game.  
---
&gt;You're making me puke.
---
Well congratulations to you, why does it bother you so much that other players might find a way to get to where you are?   
---
As a side note for someone who seems to be 'highly' opposed to people min-maxing and using legendary weapons, you seem awfully proud of your ability to get 'all plans' from one location, which I'm sure was 'intended game-play' that Bethesda designed with the idea of being 'legit mechanics.'  
---
I'm not quite sure if you're aware of the sheer overwhelming hypocrisy inside your original post, I'm quoting it in it's entirety just in case you take the time to re-read it and change it up so you don't look quite so thick. Wouldn't want anyone to miss your original drivel. 
---
Wow, thanks so much. Definitely going to check out this spot when I jump on next. 
---
For sure will come back to this post to share!
---
Thanks for the link, that's awesome I didn't know something like that existed. Thank you for the suggestions, I'm sending everything to my friend so hopefully, we can get a good start in the right direction when we play next. 
---
Awesome, I hope you don't mind me amending the original post with these details. It might make this form of farming a bit more common, but generally the reddit community is a small enough minority of the over-all players that it doesn't change the balance too drastically in my experience. 
---
Could go the eso route and make legendaries bind on pickup...
---
I like that everyone comes up with these ideas, but I think fixing the game as it currently is should still be a priority. I'm still getting consistent D/C from queen fights, instability in nuke zones, and frustrating issues in the nuke silo. It seems to me that the best way to enjoy this game is to put it down once you get "end game" until they patch the rampant instability and performance isues
---
I saw this when you first posted it changed my whole game. I do a 20% with bloodied grognax and carve my way through almost anything.
---
Ahh, well, good to know then! Thanks!
---
100% bullshit. Nice fairy tale but it doesn't work like this. At all.
---
deleting and reposting ain't gonna help
---
your ideas are not innovative nor effective, you sound like a kid who won't shut up about his oc donut steele
---
It is funny in a game with big scary creatures and ghouls running around, I find that empty power armour suits appearing in multiple places around the map like they are following me is the most creepiest thing.....
---
If you've ever worked for a government you wouldn't be quite so surprised.
---
I’m just updating it and reposting it bud. Sounds like you have a personal problem. Have a good day :)

It took me 125 levels to realize that I could only build 6 different variations of mods for each armor piece/section.  They stay in the order I learned them, but I can't scroll down to craft anything past the first 6 I've learned.  There are some that I know I've seen unlocked while scrapping or learned from reading plans but I can't build for myself.
---
My first time was level 60-ish. My CAMP is on the lower part of the golf course, there are some wonder robots there that help with the random spawns I get all the time (not so great when it's 2 Scorched Beasts, it leaves you with no roof). I fast traveled home and there was no spawn, not uncommon. I went into my house, up the stairs, and into a narrow section. 
---
All of a sudden, 3 feet in front of me, there was a loud \*poof\* sound Mothman TP'd in front of me, eyes filling my screen. I too jumped from my seat, but not for the same reason you did. I was not confirming something was there, I knew something was there and I wanted to get away from it IRL. I leapt out from the second story through a garage door I have open there and since, unlike you, I have no friends, I ran towards the robots.
---
Now I'm not sure if this is a bug or not, but robots don't seem to really care about targeting teleporting mobs so now my only ingame friends are as useless as most of my real friends. On top of that, since I'm at my house the Mothman is dividing its time between staggering me with blurry white rings and trying to eat my porch.
---
Now like I mentioned before, I had just Fast Traveled home, the main reason for that was to repair armor and weapons. The Mothman had about 10% left to it when my Power Fist broke. Seeing as this thing took a few years off my life with a Five Nights at Freddy's style jump scare I wanted to punch it to death. As that was no longer an option I did indeed kill it by dropping 2 grenades at our feet, killing us both. I was able to respawn at my base after the death, it has yet to.
---
Well have you tried unequipping SG and applying the mutation? 
---
Prior to this week I have about 20+ kills with a melee build.  The last few times she simply hasn't seemed to take damage and I know the three people I'm playing with have optimized builds and good weapons.
---
Either she's scaling too high or I've had repeated bad luck in having other people in the event that didn't have enough DPS to kill her.  But if it's happening repeatedly just in the last week after not being an issue before and you as a player can't control who comes to the event so it's not a very good mechanic.
---
And if that's how people want to up/down vote, that's their choice, doesn't make 'correcting people' any more contributing to a discusion than your statements are.
---
That said, more to the point of where I was originally going with my line of thought;
---
Legendary effects should have a 'weight class' similar to things like boxing.  Things that always effect damage would be your 'heavy' class as every one an their mother wants the, I'd also consider melee vamprism in this category as it's a garunteed 'heal by hittting' kind of thing.  Medium class would be your 'utility' things, nice effects that come in handy, but ultimately don't make or break a legendary.  And last would be light weight, which would be your situational effects, like furious (I mean, if your attack kills the enemy in one hit this does nothing), or x% damage to y enemy, or 'sometimes bonus, other times penalty' type deals (seriously though, why would you make nocturnal items work like this, in my experience with weapons the bonus doesn't make the use of the weapon worth it due to the daytime penalties essentially 'locking' your weapon to only be usable, sometimes), this type of weighting could also tie into legendaries with more than 3 effects, with it being like a '2 medium weights are 1 heavy, 2 lights are one medium' so you could get alot more interesting combos with that, like one 'heavy' effect, and 3 light effects instead of 1 heavy 1 medium 1 light on a typical 3 star legendary, or 3 mediums and a light for the effects, etc.
---
Middle age is terrible...
---
What does it ruin? The ONLY thing I have ever bought from another player is a TSE.
---
What else do you need to buy? The game provides. 
---
Its because this is a simulation 
---
This makes me feel like the one smart thing I’ve done in this game is add the Firebreather receiver to my L50 Perfect Storm.
---
except you've done it about a dozen times now
---
it's annoying and it ain't gonna change the fact it's a stupid idea you're trying to make look the second coming of Christ
---
Bring on the 90% weight reduced hunting rifles!!!!
---
Oh, that'd be amazing. Thank you, dude. How should I contact him? Got a link?
---
It’s funny how your last 20 or so comments are all downvoted. Your opinion is noted. As I suggested before, you can block me.
---
iirc there are variants on the alt ammo receivers also, they are just stupid annoying to get
---
Or bind on equip as binding on pickup would get rid of trading legendaries all together.
---
Things naturally attrite out of the economy. I don't think this is necessary, a good use of resources, or tactful on Bethesda's part. I think this is something we should take a laissez-faire approach to. 
---
And let's be honest, the worst burden to the in-game economy is the fact zero effort was originally put into fleshing it out. No option for item for item trades is one example, or utilizing work arounds so you can sell rounds for less than 1 cap a round
---
Not everyone has those weapons. If you can only 2 shot kill them with the very end game gear, how is that balanced for every other player? 
---
Both ends of the curve are useful, but the low end is important for isolating the point where less armor (or more armor penetration) makes no difference to the damage output. If it was the same formula as Fallout 4 then that would be at around damage = 6\*armor, but it may be as low as 2\*armor. With that number (or nearby data) I can complete the damage formula.
---
I would be inclined to lend a hand if such a beacon were to go out  
---
Put 2 single beds really close together?

I found Modern Kitchen Tables tonight while exploring the far NE of the map.  I want to say it was the Freddy Fears place but I can't say for certain.
---
The wife &amp; I are always helping others on xbox. We aren't chasing the story line at all, just building camps &amp; enjoying the open environment.  
---
She is lvl 80ish &amp; I'm lvl ~71.  We hand out all our extra plans, share ammo when we can.
---
It's pretty easy to help others.  
---
Nor can you outrun them most times. I feel like their radius to follow you is so ungodly large it's ridiculous. If you're underprepared to waste 1000 bullets and 25 stimpacks to get yourself a wing fragment then you're totally screwed because if you run they follow forever. 
---
They were never hostile. They're in the same state now as they were back then. They just insisted on doing "renovations" and kicked the residents out of their rooms. They're friendly to anyone visiting but not trying to live there - i.e. traders. I'm sure the reason it looks so well preserved is that anyone "encroaching" was removed from the grounds. One way or another.
---
South of Hemlock Holes golf course at the north side of the map.  Back of a pickup truck.  I always grab it from there.  You'll see a crashed vertibird next to it with some baddies.
---
doesn't change the fact this shit you're trying to pull feels forced and is not helpful at all.
---
you're not some master strategist.
---
In trash cans, where they belong
---
Would be nice is the gaming community stopped accepting this release like shit, finish over the next few years crap. Is that in the patch notes?
---
Sorry if that came off as mean. Wasn’t my intention, I’m a bit tired. But my best advice I can give is to not worry too heavily about it yet, Nuke zones aren’t really too crazy special. Work on just seeing all that you want to see, level as you go. If it’s your first play through, don’t worry too much about grinding heavily, just enjoy yourself, you have time to do it all. Make some friends and get yourself a decent team as you go. Get your level into the 30s at least, get a decent set of power armor, and as long as at least one person can share rad sponge with your group, you’ll be just fine. Bring some firepower though, you’ve never seen a real horse of ghouls until you step into a nuke zone, trust me....
---
I remember FO4 and Skyrim crashing on my PC, but it does not compare to how often it happens in 76. I use discord now (never used it before FO76) specifically because it enables me to talk to team members as I'm crashing out/getting DCed from game
---
Steve1989 is that you?
---
Hey man, I’m just throwing an idea out there trying to get it to the masses. If you have any insight or thoughtful discussion towards the topic feel free. Right now you’re offering nothing except giving a glimpse of how fun you are at parties.
---
I know the feeling, I had to try the DMV missions six times because of crashes or DCs.
---
I haven't messed with nukes yet. That should add a new layer.
---
I probably looted about 200 legendary weapons before I finally got an explosive weapon. I have yet to see a two shot. As someone else stated, TSE is the most commonly traded as the combination of two shot and explosive is over powered. 
---
I just got kicked 6 times tonight during 1 queen fight. One of those times I was only connected for 10 seconds before I crashed out again

No problem! I'm trying to spread the knowledge of those resources and thinking about making a post about it in the near future when I've gathered up enough information. 
---
Also, if you guys are looking for another (On PC) I have a lvl 11 character I'm making into a power-armor/heavy weapons guy. my IGN is same as above.
---
&gt;Right now you’re offering nothing except giving a glimpse of how fun you are at parties.
---
doesn't mean much coming from the obnoxious guy who doesn't know when to stop.
---
just give it a break. your idea is not gonna get adopted by Bethesda.
---
It bothers me reading people trying to teach bullshits and/or thinking "they know", when they don't.
---
And yes, my way is legit and probably intended since it's an end game location but you actually need to look a bit onto it unlike just rush it like everyone does.
---
I don't cheat, don't use exploits in general, don't even "server hop", just a real, legit (and tired) experienced fallout player speaking.
---
And don't worry for me, I make my own "real and useful" tutorials which everyone are successfully using in my community, "how to make 30k ammo in few days the legit way", "how to kill a scorched beast with a regular wep" and the likes.
---
Piper has a smoking animation when idle in Fallout 4. 
---
I'd really love to see load outs. I'll even be so greedy to say that I'd love the ability to have each load out have it's own s.p.e.c.i.a.l respec. 
---
I'd love to be able to have one set for crafting and building at camps, another for exploring and scavenging. One for nuke zones. And even have our own presets, so I can have one deck set up if I'd like to melee that night, or another for heavy guns so I can swap play styles as I'd like. 
---
I've found this is really one of my biggest complaints with this game besides the obvious bugs and crashing issues. I cant stand having to constantly load into the pwrk menu just to pick a lock, then load back in to reequip my rifle perks because they're all in the same special. It's just too restrictive. 
---
In fo4 when you leveled up you earned that next perk and could use it all the time. I get that this is a different style of game but the system they used is so restrictive and tedious that there isn't much reward for continuing to level up. 
---
Just block me, problem solved. Unless you like whining.
---
His post literally details how he plays this game to be a merchant. Specifically serums, which sell for a pretty penny. I've never exploited, nor am I super into trading, and I'm sitting on around 13k. 
---
There is almost nothing to spend caps on besides fast traveling. My CAMP is where I want it, I've got most plans I want that can be bought from merchants. What else is there to buy that you're losing so many caps?
---
Mini Minotaur?
---
To each their own. Despite its flaws I've had so much fun in this game with my husband. Fun we couldn't really have together in 4.
---
The worst plan ever, still bizarre no matter how many times you repost this.
---
or you could do everyone a favor and stop. I'm not the first one to ask you to, that should tell you something.
---
By looking at this game you would think they never even released ESO and took a beating over that launch too. I fully expected Fo76 to have similar mechanics to ESO, especially faction based PVP. I’m still dumbfounded as to how they fucked this up so bad. I know we will never get an honest explanation either
---
Different play styles..
---
I think you're referring to the calibrated shocks, not the optimized servos.
---
Unfortunately that’s only a level 25.
---
I’m not hurting anyone. If it bothers you so much, block me. Unless it’s the actual message I’m conveying that bothers you?
---
I want to know, if the issue with server crashes is in part by unique items, then why do they allow us to actually pick up every holotape and note? I realized I was carrying tons of them and when I went to drop them I crashed multiple times. 
---
I'm not a programmer but wouldn't making notes read only, and not generate copies in people's inventories help this issue? 
---
There is a water generator in my stored inventory that I have been trying to scrap since before Christmas.
---
If I had the atoms, I'd buy the confetti photo pose if ONLY to celebrate accomplishing that, if this patch finally allows it. 
---
Personally, i like the idea of both..... you have parts kits etc to build a rifle.... so gears n springs and steel and polymer makes sense.... but if youre going to repair a rifle it makes sense to canabalize a rifle. 2 broken rifles for one working sorta deal
---
We should get better dog food. Why doesn't the Enclave have name brand?

You can totally do more than 50 at once, you just can't spam the maps (I've done it)..
---
Hit "Dig", pause for a second, Hit "Dig", pause for a second..
---
If you do 50 maps over the space of 5 or so minutes (one every 10 seconds) you'll have zero issues (unless your on a laggy server, then of course hop first)
---
Bethesda is beta testing the patch tomorrow with PC players so the console players won't have to.
---
I want to play with your team. Also you have to explain how you pulled off that Wiring. 
---
Again, it's simply not possible. They don't have the tools to track down duped items. The only solution will be to fix the exploit and then use power creep to make the duped items less valuable.
---
no, it's definitely you. you posted it once, it didn't get enough attention. just move on and stop spamming trying to get Todd's attention.
---
Care to elaborate why it wouldn’t work or what would be an effective solution?
---
Shrug, you sound pompous. I claim to know nothing, I'm sharing information, that's it. It may not be perfect, it may even be wrong in some spots, but it's what seems to be working for me, and for some others.   
---
As for all your claims to fame, making 30k ammo in a day without using any exploit is easy (In fact if you're talking about 50 cal ammo it's easy to make that in 3 hours without using exploits, so I'm thinking you're pretty off), so I'm not entirely sure what your getting on about, and killing the scorchbeast with melee weapons that aren't legendary is also relatively easy and well known and completely legit, but that doesn't mean that it's fun for non-melee builds.   
---
I can make a combat rifle that can deal a fair bit of damage and wipe out a Scorchbeast level 80 in one clip that's non-legendary and works fine with the right build, but chews through ammo like crazy, so yeah I prefer my legendary weapons. I'm not sure what makes you think that 'everyone' in the Reddit community is clueless.   
---
Knowing a 'few' things better than others, and then not sharing them and keeping them between you and your friends may make you feel special, but really doesn't impress the rest of us. Unlike you we don't run around with a weird superiority complex, we just share what we know and try to have fun with the game. 
---
Unethical, but seriously... squeaky wheel gets the grease!  An incident of that magnitude would get attention on it.
---
Oh please do, it looks fun but a tad confusing. Aww I wish, we're both PS4 players! Thanks for the invitation though!
---
Its gona be ketchup and armor

There are very few XP buffs in the game. Make sure she has a well rested bonus and pumps a point or 2 into Charisma for the Inspirational perk. 3 Charisma minimum is usually good for teams anyway and 3\* Inspirational (+15% XP) at that low of a level will help her close that gap with you for starters.
---
There is some good advice from other people here about staying in the forest, which I've been doing with my second and third characters. My first time through I did not take the advice about not doing quests and did quests. I did most of my lower leveling in the Airport area then at around 13-15 moved up to Grafton. The Super Mutants in Grafton are not all that easy, but manageable and the quest line there takes you to Wavy Willad's Water Park up north. This northern area was where I did levels 15-20ish. Just a thought if staying in the forest gets boring. 
---
As long as you stay mid to northwestern sections of the map, or most places east, you should be fine. But you should also make note of where you see higher level players frequent outside of the forest area,they can spawn in scaleable mobs and not kill them. Happens all the time that high level players hit up Whitesprings and what was level 9 Golfer Ghouls 20 minutes ago are sexy bloated level 62 ghouls now. Same with Watoga, the robots there can spawn from level 32 to 50 depending on the highest level player that was there when they spawned.
---
At the end, I think the best advice you can be given is explore. Not only do you get tasty experience points for finding new areas but you'll be able to find out for yourself where the best places for fun are for you and your friend. At the end of the day, keep you junk in your stash and death will just be a silly, "Oh shit" moment to talk about when your level 50.
---
It's one of the side effects for making the game multi.
---
Good so it’s just me. Go ahead and block me thanks. I’d just block you but you still see my posts unfortunately. 
---
Wait! I can block you and then not listen to you whine! Yes! Problem solved! Take it easy bud.
---
I find Whitespring Nuke sites more fun. Easier to find enemies, loads of ingredient for making flux (you dont even have to kill enemys to get hardened mass, just look in meat piles) and no matter how many times i do it I find it fun to use melee on groups of ghouls (pain train, choo choo). Also handy having 2 vendors onsite for selling stuff to and you have stash boxes and craft tables that you can actually use in the middle of a nuke site. What's not to like here.  I dont really farm for legendarys there but any good drops and XP boosts are always good. And because people that are hard core farmers get so much gear they end up dropping a lot of it and you find weapons for free that are specific to your build or stuff you can sell to vendors. Have you ever tried to find a brown paper bag dropped in the middle of the cranberry bogs, they are impossible to see.
---
I dont mind doing the queen fights but as soon as she is killed it goes really quiet in the area and not a lot of enemies around as afterwards (especially when everyone now set the nuke off centre). And fighting the SBQ with high level players mean it actually doesn't take long to kill her and the game breaks most of the time before she dies anyway. I get a lot more time out of Whitesprings.

I leave all my unwanted ammo and plans and stuff in the flatwoods overseers cache. I dropped about 40 plans and recipes there tonight. 
---
&gt; I’ve been a firm believer that the armor ignore perks are generally better than the damage increase perks and this seems to confirm it.
---
Armor penetration is better only up to a point: if you deal enough damage that you negate the armor anyway (i.e. the target's armor is ~15% of the damage directed toward it) or if you cross that threshold with the additional armor penetration, raw damage bonuses can provide greater effect (i.e. Incisor provides no benefit to a Blade of Bastet boosted by the Eye of Ra). In most cases this won't be an issue, but for those who stack melee damage bonuses sufficiently high, there's no reason to run both Incisor and the Armor-Piercing legendary effect.

ESO was made by ZeniMax. It was only published by Bethesda. So completely different people made this game.
---
For now the map is just a sort of 'add on' the post is mostly about plans, and the map happens to provide some locations that 'may' be good to check for plans after you finish the confirmed list of locations we're compiling here. Based on my experience the map is actually not that great, and it seems that they didn't use a good standard for what it meant to find plans when making it. Finding plans in a container is not as reliable as finding them outside a container, and a lot of the locations that list RNG plans actually 'set' plans not RNG, so they are useless for most of us.  
---
I think collaborating with one of the sites that makes these maps would be a good idea, but I may not be the one best suited to do it, and as far as I'm concerned this post is everyone's not mine, so anyone who has the connections is free to utilize all this information and add it to their own guides, or send it to whoever they please. I'm not doing this for any sort of credit, just to collect the information for my own gain and the benefit of anyone else who wants it. If no one else does a collaboration, and someone reaches out to me, I'm happy to trade information, but frankly everything I know is publicly posted here, so it would be a pretty weak collaboration as I really don't have all that much to add besides what I've already posted. 
---
Only spout truth, ya dig? X)
---
It's supposed to be the second hardest thing in the game. I think people without end game weapons should be able to escape it, which is why I said their relentless pursuits are an issue. How many multiplayer games do you know where players without top tier gear can easily kill the second hardest thing in the game solo?
---
just stop, jesus.
---
this guys keeps spammng these posts.

I mean, I have thousands of caps, I've given away thousands of rounds of ammo at once with minimal issues, I don't understand how the server A) can't pace itself appropriately, or B), why server-side inventories can't immediately detect an overload and just crash you out for making it happen until it can resolve your previous action. I'd rather not be allowed to loot too quickly vs not play because someone fucked the whole server.
---
I sell bulk everything and crazy amounts of amo, this is my mat farming character so if you need any mats add me in game serozeno I sell everything ^_^
---
Im blind. Like i see only a black screen an my hud, i cant see the game dude like please help am i blind from now on or what i cant anything at all an ive tried all the tricks like leaving server an signing out please help me
---
Far as I know that was design rather than bug. Something to do with hire much .50 ammo is astound because of the .50mg.  I don't agree either, but it kinda makes sense....
---
A "superiority complex"... In F76... LMFAO. We're not talking about ESL or WGL on CSGO or SC here ffs. This game isn't - and will never be - a competitive one. Not in a serious way. By far.
---
This reddit is litteraly rigged of "fake news", posts which are upvoted containing massive amount of BS, just like yours, or people making up stories in their mind and posting it. This is cringe and misleading for new players.
---
And regarding your claims " i can do this and that " i will just say i won't trust any word from you unless you can prove anything, and if you're going do the same, damn wannabe, i do have twitch replays and youtube videos to show you how it's done.
---
So just quit acting now and delete your post.
---
This is my bulk mat farming character I sell every kind of hulk in stacks of the thousands and ammunition too, i sell 5k-10k of every ammo kind.
---
Serozeno is my in game name add me if you're in need ^_^
---
I didn’t think it came off as mean. I need to find some other players. Are you on ps4?
---
It's possible to identify the accounts with duped items.. as they'd have as you said many multiples of high level legendary items and they'd be fairly easy to identify by their 100k+ carry weight alone... thing is those are only mule accounts.. the psn id behind the account is responsible some of these individuals are profiteering from the game trading literal cash for virtual items they've gotten through exploitation of a trademarked game all monetary association with the product is the right of the trademark owner.. pretty sure that's how it goes anyway... It will get stopped if it can be stopped... as to tracking down legit players who traded or acquired weapons from a duper if they only got one it's not going to be easy for the devs to determine who got their weapons legit or through a dodgy transaction.. the weapons with literally 10's of thousands of copies.. can probably expect to lose them.. the not so popular only duped a few hundred times maybe a few thousand they are probably not at risk of being deleted
---
Hey. Hey. Look, just take the Calmex and think about how much you like your dog. Everything's going to be okay in about three minutes, and you'll be enjoying the rich, artificial taste of beef and rice in a smooth yet chunky, all American recipe.
---
The most annoying thing is you can't see their vault number drives me crazy
---
Yeah I sell bulk ammo and mats in the thousands if you're ever in the neighborhood find me I'll sell ammo in the 10k's
---
SOB that's why my camp can't be placed lol I'm in the same spot though mines not as decked out
---
2 words, missile... turrets...
---
Equipment repairing was introduced in 3. It wasn’t in 1, 2 or tactics.
---
There's actually a lot more in that container, but MODUS only lets you access the part specific to your genetic fingerprint.
---
Weird flex, that.
---
That and makes PvP not even desirable...
---
I got it with SG equipped. Thanks.
---
If you do end up seeing up camp there, I'd love to see what you came up with! Cheers!
---
Stop, I'm salivating. ... Anybody else hear bells?
---
Well. I agree with fixing the duplication bugs. 
---
Those have to go.
---
Everything else is probably way more complicated than it needs to be. 
---
The Legendary loot drop system is deeply flawed and should just be scrapped in favor of a crafting system more in the players control and less on digital dice rolls.
---
Get rid of legendary drops altogether. Attach the bonuses to mods, and put the resources needed for that content at the mid to end game.
---
Nuke zones should be equal amounts killing and gathering. Right now it is all about body count. 
---
And there should also be just as good of a reason NOT to launch nukes. A powerful motivation to stop people trying to launch one. Perhaps the devastation should be more persistant? Buildings leveled, vendors annihilated. And once its gone... Its gone until we have rebuilt it.  Imagine if the nuke blast zones persisted for a whole week or a whole month...
---
Everywhere you go its radioactive hell. No vendors to sell to, they have been vaporized. No plants. No wildlife. Nothing but craters everywhere. 
---
Bethesda needs to worry less about 20$ power armor skins and get players invested through benefits and consequences of our actions. There should be just as good of a reason to be a villian as it is to be a savior. Most of us will fall into that nebulous grey middle ground. Sure I'll buy your shitty bling paintjobs just as soon as you give me a reason to organise my fellow likeminded players to systematically target and stomp the shit out of mouthbreathing youtube wannabes. 
---
Fo76 right now reminds me a lot of my childhood playing in the sandbox with army men and fireworks. Only I'm the little green army man, and I can shrug off a cherry bomb scotch taped to my back. But, instead of fireworks, some fascist asshole gave the rest of the kids on the block 100 pounds of homebrew RDX, primacord, detonators and told the little pricks to "go have fun!"... Damn the consequences and corpses in the interim.
---
Because bethesda decided to release an unpolished, unfinished game and naturally you have people who try to break the game any way they can and thus the “TSE” economy is born. 
---
I refuse to take part in it.
---
stop. reposting.
---
it's spam at this point.
---
Can we just accept that the loot tables, crafting system, plan system, and legendary drop system are awful and basically broken?
---
Schooled harharhar
---
Being second hardest is fine but the hardest enemy in the game tells you flat out that 8 players are recommended. 
---
So tell me why when adventuring out in the wastes it's ok to spawn 2 level 80 scorchbeasts  and a level 50 on one or two players? 
---
The scaling is so off it's not even funny. I like a food challenge dont get me wrong. But make the damn things scale properly. I shouldn't have to wander with a full team and waste thousands of ammo, which take me days and days to make, because of triple sonic attacking, constant aggroed scorchbeasts. And then when I do engage, they drop absolute garbage. There's absolutely zero reward for fighting them. I've had ghouls drop random plans and they are nothing to go up against. 
---
They need to rework their idea of risk vs reward and how to scale these enemies to the number and level of players.
---
Because actual games dont erase 100s hours of progress for playing the game unless you are caught cheating. He shouldn't have to be mindful of the game nullifying his experience. Or at least in an actual developed one.
---
You just got school son!!!!!
---
I like " fixing a few Legendary mods" part. Hope they remove two shots+explosive mod.

I’m just editing and formatting. Block me and report for spam please. No reason to keep harassing me in my posts :D
---
Not at all. I wouldn't have said anything if I did :P
---
This is also possible to all change with the next two patches, they've hinted at plan changes
---
Yes it's just a billboard next to Slocum's Joe :)
---
People in England would say it's spelled wrong too
---
Sounds like someone's been reading too much Commie propaganda. It doesn't matter what you think of Uncle Sam's grand plans, soldier- what matters is that you're going to eat dog food to die for your country! In the future! The radioactive future!
---
 havin a good time in Appalachia then hearing that noise of your character dropping all their loot is gut wrenching 
---
when i open the playstation quick menu (hold home button), while ingame the controls of the game are still working: i navigate throw the menu and the same commands will be executed in Fo76, like moving forward and backward.
---
Thank you so much for doing this!
---
So far today I have gotten the following from the Watoga "stagecoach" (that really threw me as I kept looking for an old sk00l stagecoach)...
---
- marine armor legs (x2)
---
- tactical marine helmet
---
- BOS officer underarmor
---
Well, yes because I degenerated into a naked, handicapped, pipboy-less human being. May I drank too much serums by accident.
---
spread the word then let them hear !
---
AL YOU MINNIE UM!
---
I have seen them, I've seen a few from vault 94 and have screen shots of them, I'll link them later on
---
I mean.. I'm about 73% sure I'd just spend the commendations on dog food anyway, if they let me. That stuff is GOOD.
---
Sounds like you need to relocate your camp. Don't put it on top of a mob spawn point.
---
Todd himself is not gonna descent from heavens and give you an upboat. your "ideas" are never gonna be implemented in any way, shape or form.
---
just stop. can we get this guy banned for spam?
---
Oi whatd you call me
---
noticed this as well with a pump action explosive shotgun, although it may be due the weak spot being the stomach area that's where I find its most effective 
---
That's why I have said twice that I think the way the continue to pursue players is a problem. You absolutely should be able to escape them, but I think it goes against the design intent of the game to have only one enemy in the game that poses any sort of threat. Also, you may not be told that teaming up is recommended for fighting scorchbeasts, but the entire main story tells you repeatedly that the are supposed to be a threat to be taken seriously. Don't get me wrong, I think the spam is horrible, you can't see through it, I think they shouldn't be able to poison you through walls, how far they chase you in a joke, but I still don't think they are too difficult.
---
I live In twin lakes so the worst I get is scorched with is rare, I mostly get bloodbugs and bloatflys
---
Two shot explosive legendary firearms are actually really rare. 
---
I found one. Just one. In 130 levels of play. 
---
99% of anything you find out there for trade has been duplicated by using broken mechanics within the game. 
---
TSE weapons are also the only thing keeping ranged player builds at pace with melee builds. 
---
In short Fo76 is a shit sandwich served on a It Just Works brand ashtray. 
---
Thanks! I found it on the Grafton Station vendor. Much appreciated.
---
Yeah some kind of balance or shift needs to be implimented.
---
I'm hyped, if this was anything like the December 11th patch I know it will improve the game for everyone.
---
Beautiful house actually.
---
Its impressive you were able to plan the foundations in such a way as to be able to build the ceiling-floor like you did.
---
I'm willing to bet it took longer to make that than it looks because having to keep moving around the foundations.
---
You do know you can respawn the glowing ones at whitesprings every like 5-10min right? Join a team and leave and come back and they respawn for everyone. To have it work better just don't kill the king at the swimming pool and make sure everyone is out of the golf couse building by using emotes/chat to come back out. Once the person has spawn back in it usually takes a few seconds for the mobs to spawn. Just have to be careful because after around 15-20 respawns the meat piles start to lag the area and if you continue past like 30 respawns it'll crash the whole server.
---
It’s descend btw. I don’t care if they do, just want to spark discussion about something that may. I said you can report me. Technically it’s not spam if the content is different with a different title though so good luck. I did report you for repeated harassment though :)
---
johnson's acre. (it's a marked location at the very south end of the savage divide.) it's not a huge area, you'll see the rock formation leading up pretty easily.
---
Jesus, I've been saying that since they initially announced it.. dying and coming back, arbitrary and illogical rules and limitations, fantastical beasts that somehow never get seen in the wasteland again? If this isn't a "based on current readings" style 112, I'll eat my fucking hat.
---
You don't need to invest all 5 points. 1 point for up to 36% damage increase is well worth it.
---
Still waiting for that bulldozer.
---
@bethesda - zzzzzzzzz
---
Actually I just made one single post when I started my business and another one a few days ago to gather more maps quickly. But in another sub.       
---
      
---
You may have saw those screenshots a few days ago in that damage exploit post but that's it. Check my post history ;)
---
The Charleston responder bot vendor always has it along with the cuckoo clock.
---
When they track and fire.
---
Using the mod for perk card loadouts, I regularly use five groups.
---
Standard walking around, crafting guns, crating armor, crafting camp, and lockpicking.
---
Would need catapults.
---
We need more actual gameplay: questlines, radiant quests, PVP missions (with gear restrictions), building and less glowing one/beast farming for questionable legendary loot.
---
The entire game loop at the end is a boring beat down exercise for very low drop rates of usable stuff. 90% or more of the drops are basically no worse than a crafted version of the weapon because the effects are useless. 15% against bugs? 15% against ghouls you can one shot anyway?
---
All I can tell you is that I bought a mod, then needed materials to equip it onto the PA.  Maybe your gameplay is different but that's what happened to me.  Gee, maybe another bug?
---
I don't think it has ever worked that way in previous fallout games. That's the tradeoff for being radiation-proof: No armor. 
---
Glad I could help you out bro. Technically I can’t take full credit though, the general idea of the build was in FO4.
---
I haven't been able to play because I'm moving. Any idea what's on the patch?
---
What does TSE mean?
---
Ahhh thanks for the great explanations!
---
So is there a sweet spot I should be using for my monitor without prematurely killing my gfx card if I can't use 144hz for hours on end?
---
59? 60? 100? 119? 120?  Water cooling?
---
Also up on mount Blaine in a safe on one of the catwalks leading down from one of the shafts not far from belching betty. That's where I got mine so I'm not sure if it's random. There's also a black titanium node at that same catwalk
---
you could use spotlights at your camp. i've noticed my turrets react more to mobs if the spotlight sees them (commonly when it is either dark or raining)
---
If deathclaws get jet packs we are all fucked
---
Adapt or die. 
---
I like the DMV quest.
---
Of course it just worked for me, no glitching, resets or anything.  A quick, funny, easy quest.
---
Maybe I put too many points into LCK?
---
I agree.  They need to put about 10 second delays between looting things like water, stuff from boxes, ect.   If it will prevent dupes and prevent issue where someone build the character described above and have it all destroyed in a instant.  That is so disheartening.   I hope that eventually the OP can use his character again.
---
You know I wouldn't mind it but it seems like one of those things that, yeah, would be more realistic but also would take away too much fun from the game.
---
I mean how far do you take it? Load bearing walls and columns? Do we need to work out how much load we need to account for and factor in enough supports to cater.
---
I get that it doesn't look the best but I leave it to the individual to sort out whether they want something that makes sense visually, even though it punishes them in terms of build budget.
---
Problem is still having enough to cover the building. It takes at Least 2 regular turrets per side, and thats WHEN they actually do something.
---
Haven't seen a decent haul of Hardened Mass in weeks. I'm usually the one cleaning up while everyone scurries like rad roaches over loot. Definitely feels like its non-instanced as I used to get tons when I ran more melee.
---
TSE Lever action, full sniper build, adrenal reaction, unyelding Gear, party bonus band of Monsters.. i Need 2/3 critted headahots for a lvl 65 scorchbeast. It's bugged the sonic beam spam, not the difficulty imho
---
Hey you done ya run yet
---
I haven\`t even received  my order yet. It\`s do in a few days. I wonder if i refuse the delivery ,will they send it back? More importantly will i get a refund? I defenatly don\`t want that cheap looking piece of crap.
---
They need to adjust it so weapons do not stack.  That should significantly reduce the duping.
---
It's been confirmed before, but if you put awareness on and have some use endangerol it does nothing to their resistances. Unless there's some hidden resistances going on in the background (and there is a hidden resistance happening when you wear PA or hazmat), I wouldn't bother.
---
^All-ooo-min-yam!
---
Are you serious right now?   
---
One lead extractor in a camp provides 33 lead/hr, plus weights from silo alpha, bravo, charlie, vault-tec university (Which has 2 gyms), the palace of the winding path, charleston fire department, and green country lodge, which can each be farmed once a day provide around another 400 lead.  
---
With that we have at least 400 lead, if not closer to 500. That will take all of 15-20 minutes to do, so that's hardly any time at all. A run through big bend tunnel will give you anywhere from 200 to 300 steel this is well known, if you make me have to 'prove' this to you with a video, trust me, it's you who is the noob. Anyway, that run with someone who has been playing for more than a week probably only takes 10 minutes, but we'll go worse case scenario and say it takes 15 minutes, and you only get 200 steel per run. We would have to do 8 runs in order to make full use of our 400 lead at this point, for 1600 steel. So that's about 2 hours of Big Bend Tunnel runs there.   
---
So far we're at two hours and 20 minutes and we have 'most' of what we need. Now I'll be honest with you, I'm so inundated in cloth that frankly I don't really know off the top of my head where to farm it, but I know you can get a ton of 'cash' from requisitions, and shooting down the bots that carry the nuclear cards, so if you were short on cash I guess I'd suggest that, and then you can get cloth from that. Acid is easy, you just go kill yao guais, I tend to recommend the bed and breakfast, it takes about 3 minutes to kill two and another minute to reload into the game and get another two. So 40 minutes there and you have all the acid you need to make a ton of gun powder. Almost certainly the measly 480 you'd need for this ammo.   
---
This will allow you to craft 50 cal ammo 40 times.   
---
From there we throw on ammosmith and super duper, and you craft your 50 cal ammo.   
---
Each time you get 180 ammo, and 30% of the time you do get double that. (40\*180)\*1.3= 9,360 rounds, and that's about 3 hours of work assuming you started with absolutely nothing and had to make it from scrap.   
---
So I guess I can 'see' putting a 'day' into getting 30k starting from scrap. I'll admit I personally rarely find myself running out of supplies and having to start from scratch, but if that's normal for you, then I can understand taking 8 hours to get 30k ammo. If on the other hand you're not perpetually running out of stuff, then ideally you shouldn't be spending that much time. I have the materials on hand right now to make about 20k ammo, and then I could do that farming for 3 hours and finish off the 30k.   
---
Fortunately, I'm not running a machine gun build so I don't have to struggle with the burden of needing to make that much ammo regularly, but clearly you know what you're doing so more power to you.   
---
Do I really have to post a video to prove that all of what I just said is completely viable? I mean honestly, I don't think there are very many players in this game who couldn't read that and perfectly comprehend what I'm saying, and see that the numbers obviously add up. I'm seriously hoping you're not the 'one' who has problems with math.
---
I did something similar will make a post and show you mine.
---
I can see how the camp limit can be a problem. my camp is on a mountain so there is only 1 possible route for the enemies to take if they decide to attack my camp, so for me 2 turrets is enough. But if you need to cover all sides you would barely have any budget left for a foundation or two xd
---
I have an instigating bowie knife and cannot repair it. Does it just get used up and go away. Also could you either make vendors independent or refresh their money every hour like fo4. Thank you.
---
I just shoot the queen, throw a nuka grenade to her left, shoot the queen, nade right, shoot the queen, nade friendlies that are probably getting melee'd. Tends to keep the adrenaline running

Cazadores

If you're still here you're a dedicated man. I haven't played in a month. I'll come back next year when hopefully the game is playable.
---
With just 2 hours of farming junk &amp; weapons you can make 1400 caps per day from selling those to vendors.      
---
Serums sold for 1.5k at the start but I'm now selling those for 500. The average costumer buys 5 serums, some even 20+. Actually I don't have 1 character with 25k but 5. But the rest are Lv2 store-alts. Sure I have 100k left but caps don't mean anything to me and even with 100k I won't be able to buy the armors back (those were unique) or the plans and recipes I learnt (all serums, all PA parts and a lot of mods incl. t60/t51 calibrated shocks and t45/t60 jetpack &amp; all camp plans but 2)
---
1. I haven't used shotguns much except at point blank, so I'm not sure how important hip-fire accuracy and range are for them. Generally you're picking between True and Aligned barrels and stocks, with Precise sometimes worth it for the durability buff. Recoil shouldn't matter on a pump because they're fire-rate limited. Compensators cut the range so only use them if you have a specific close-range shotgun.
---
2. The scorched in Camden Park usually have a few, I think. Best volume of combat shotguns is probably Mole Miners, either in the Ash Heap or Blackwater Mine.
---
3. You'll probably need to carry multiple shotguns simply because they break quickly, so having two for different ranges makes sense. As soon as you're carrying two of them, Scattershot is good value. Enforcer is great once you get to level 30. You'll want Ammosmith and eventually Super Duper for making the shells.

Interplay was allowing Fallout Trilogy to be free after all the back and forth with Bethesda of its license. By court order as part of the Fallout Online and Trilogy agreement, Interplay's licensed expired on the Fallout Trilogy in something like 2012-2013 and Bethesda controls it. Since they sell it, on their own and through distributors, it's not legally free anymore.
---
Imagine them going down to the bunker server hopping for one for ages lmaoo
---
1k for the lever action?
---
Me too lvl 35 stalking mothman killed me in about 30 secs 
---
Please, please, please use the AMMOSMITH perk when you get it!
---
You can swap it out when finished crafting, but at max level, the extra 80 rounds of .50cal has been a blessing for my disgusting machine gun habits ;) haha
---
800 for the lever action
---
It would be nice if they would give us some options in general, but why do they keep releasing these skins for low use weapons? I’ve never seen someone use a fatman as thier primary weapon. I’m sure some people use the minigun, but far more use a gatling gun or 50 cal. More players would be happy with skins for more popular weapons and they would make more money. Seems like a win-win to me.
---
I get lots of duplicates. I had 5 gas signage and 4 metal tables yesterday. Occasionally I'll get one I don't have. 
---
Hmm... You know.... you have a point.
---
Those things look like space torpedoes or coffins with high technology and worth like 1000 times the value of the items delivered.  Seems really overkill.
---
I've been camped for a couple of weeks at Solomon's Pond, just east (up cliffs) from The Whitespring Resort. Specifically, my base runs from a foundation placed in the central pond near water's edge near the west rocks, opposite the buildings (i.e., closest to the Resort cliffs), with crops planted in the dirt area just beyond the rocks.
---
My observations:
---
(1) With the base of the camp surrounded by water, few if any enemies will jump across. I've had zero burrowers. There are spawn points in both building groups to the east of the pond, typically wolves or ferals, but they frequently get confused by the water and end up running around back and forth until they're turret bait. (I do have level 3 home defense, so I have a missile launcher and searchlight.) So far the only beast that's done any damage to my base proper, or to the industrial water purifier that's also in the pool, has been a scorchbeast. (I do get some minor crop damages from time to time.) But:
---
(2) While scorchbeasts do fly by occasionally, they're not nearly as frequent as when I camped near Fort Defiance.
---
(3) There are a TON of flowers/herbs, including silt beans, blackberries, carrot flowers, and firecracker berries in the area. Also several woodpiles by the structures. You can't enter the house, but the shed near the power armor bench spawns a few junk items (nothing fancy).
---
(4) The site already has a complete set of workbenches — weapons, armor, power armor, chemistry, and tinkering benches — and is a power armor spawn site, meaning regularly respawning fusion cores and scrappable power armor parts. If you're trying to use your build budget efficiently, this means you don't need to build those benches. 
---
(5) The site is outside the blast radius of nukes centered on any of the Whitesprings map icons — views of the blasts are spectacular! — and hence fast-travelable to for free any time there's a nuke zone there to exploit — just a skip and a jump down the cliffs in your power armor, and you're at the gates. Of course you're also close to the Whitespring merchants, XP mills, the Enclave Bunker, etc.
---
(6) Using a base here and the Vault 76 as free-to-reach relay stations (your base in the southeast and Vault 76 in the northwest), you can cut your fast-travel expenses for most of the map.
---
(7) Minor downsides: If you use the pre-built workbenches, you'll end up running around the pool a lot. And there are a couple of radioactive barrels near one end of the wooden bridge across the pond, and a pair of others near the house, but they're easy to avoid.
---
Explosive harpoon gun with flechettes beats it out every time. 1250 damage in a single shot for my build. 
---
I'm not hopeful fixing the duper glitch will even do anything. The markets been ruined and the servers require wiping. I know it's extreme and it would destroy lots of my progress but this game is totally ruined thanks to dupers and without them going one by one and removing inventories I don't see another way to fix this game.
---
He's legendary for his stories of how much slaughtering you did with him being the sole survivor. He's been there before. He's packed stimpacks. Improved the armor. Super Mutants aren't smart, but they understand *fear*. 
---
Poor buddy
---
That's the problem with these vague comms. We have no idea what they're prioritising and it looks like they don't know either. The guys doing comms are asking what will be ready in time and the devs obviously don't know what they can get fixed for patch day.
---
Don't bother, it doesn't work and has been cited as a bug for a while
---
I am not certain its the maps right now doing it.  It might be just your character inventory corrupted with the rewards from the maps.  But the maps might not be doing anything to you at the moment.
---
So its a matter of getting rid of all the rewards you have in inventory doing this to you.   I know there is not a drop all, but there is a scrap all which will at least nuke your junk into components which may help some. 
---
Then perhaps try going to a box and dropping stuff in a box?  See what you can reduce?
---
for watoga, id see them just replace the laser beams with "ultracite" beams. green lasers and extra damage. all robots would be hostile due to them malfunctioning due to chunks of ultracite stuck to their bodies and in their "eyes"  (even if you became the mayor of watoga)
---
just imagine scorched robots (even it may be a stretch) 
---
Everywhere i see is \~1k-1.5k atleast for ones people want. Maybe 500 if you bring your own mats. But yes spending that much at the enclave is crazy. I've gotten lucky and the last 2 queen fights I've done have given me 2 plans for mutations so I can atleast make 1 decent 1 for myself (Bird Bones).
---
Spelt, not spelled 
---
How much for execusioners grog?
---
I literally made a military compound style camp and used them more for decoration than anything. The turrets are still dumb. I've got 3 wallspotlights on each side and a floor spotlight sitting in front.
---
couple hundred thousand crossbolts ;-)
---
So...PC Master Race = Super Mutants?
---
1000 caps for lever action

You can't stock them yet but so many costumers wondered how many mutations there are so I figured I should display them all. Still I always advised to consult Doctor Google regarding negative side-effects.     
---
Just a random fact:      
---
Those 3 shelves &amp; the Mut-A-Stop neon sign took roughly 55% of my camp budget.
---
I have it but I don’t need 50 cal. I need 5.56!!!
---
Same bro. So sick of staring at that water purifier.  Waste of 2% storage I can't get rid of, as well as my friend
---
Bye Felicia
---
In the last week of attempting to kill the SBQ I've noticed she's scaled really high with multiple people.
---
My most recent attempt had 4 lvl 150+, 6 100+, and a few 80-90's with a few stragglers. And it seemed we couldn't even tear it down to the last mutation. 
---
On the other hand 3 lvl 100's I grouped with accomplished it in less than 15 minutes.
---
I have no idea how the mechanics really work but their is a huge breakpoint where it becomes near invincible with legitimate players attempting her.
---
The ramp up is pretty insane the last nuke I dropped I was the first to make it to the zone and opened up with my barrage of mini guns (vampiric and 2 shot) and explosive .50 cal which allowed me to rip through the first mutation and nearly the second  before, a swarm of lower levels showed up and I watched it's dmg decrease, stall than practically take zero dmg with in a minute or two. Which are that point I just left the encounter.
---
Has anyone also noticed A Nerf to legendaries with three attributes? Or is it just me I have routinely focused on hunting level 40+ three star legendary creatures to only receive a one star drop. I do not server hop so it can take a entire night to end up with vendor fodder at the end of the night.
---
These are all theory and does'nt work actually. And shows how ignorant you are. And obviously, being lvl 180+, i have super duper &amp; cie.
---
Just fyi I spend a whole week trying to find all the best ways to make ammos, and from what I'm reading from you, you do look like a random liar who didn't actually did shit.
---
lol those were so tough, made the jourey from goodsprings to thhe strip a living nightmare!
---
Correction: People in every country with English as a first language outside NA
---
I agree with the direction of your post.   While the Brotherhood should probably have the best PA, the Enclave should have the best armours.  Their Urban Scout Operative armor is very cool and I have a whole set of it... sitting stored because I cannot get very many mods for it and the ones I can buy are hard to figure out what pieces they are for.  Plus they are kinda rare.   So I still have all my other legendary armours and keeping the urban scout in my stash for a future day when I can use it.
---
Yeah, what happened? Is there a video?
---
Just getting launch prep started at Charlie
---
Thank you so much for clarifying. I knew it wouldn’t be simple but mule accounts wasn’t something I’d considered.
---
This is disturbing on so many levels...
---
Not in the US
---
Please submit an application to Bethesda &amp; fix my character :D     
---
I'd supply you a lifetime with serums for free - but max 10 per day so I have enought time to farm &amp; craft new ones
---
Them and mole rats have weird tethering for sure.
---
if you find a troublesome radscorpion, your best bet is to find a tiny bit of high ground. Don't need much, really any elevated world piece will do. Cars are nice. True to form, they don't path all too well beyond burrowing, so you're free to take potshots at weak points/poke at it with melee. Seems more intimidating than it would be to kill it that way. If you don't have the armor pen it could be not worth the ammo/durability loss to weapons though.
---
Had that happen in 4 quite a bit, pussed out with handling a group once leveling. Works well!
---
Isn't that because it's much easier for them to push updates to PC than consoles? I'm having trouble keeping track of which game is in what situation because nowadays every fucking game I play needs its own publisher's launcher and update schedule
---
And actual games have tools to recover player inventories
---
I just one shot them...
---
I'm pretty sure everyone that's played the game for a while thinks they have figured out how SBs work. I'm not sure any of us are any more right than the other and we're probably just seeing patterns we hope are there. I completely ignore the groundlings and just find open ground. It lands like clockwork to me. When the queen isn't landing, I go to open ground. If she still won't land, I shotgun the wings and enforcer+scattershot are the only perks I run for it. There does seem to be a mechanic where limbs do heal and you can often see this in regular monsters as well. With SBs and the SBQ it seems to happen faster, so I'm not sure if crippling is as reliable as others think. 
---
Your suggestion for endangerol is wrong. It's a known bug that it does nothing. You can easily test it by using awareness and viewing her resistances before and after shooting her with it. 
---
Sure, mine are always on the roof, when I did have them.  However they still will not stop the tough.  I am talking about deathclaws, SBs, ect.  All they tend to do is annoy them.  
---
Turrets dont work very well against molerats either unless you get some of the Punji boards to make them pop above ground for a bit or in LOS of the turrets while attacking something.   
---
Example, the molerats can pop up to the wall where holding up the roof where the turrets are and the turrets cannot point straight down to shoot them.
---
Only way to really get 100% defense is to put traps in there as well.
---
I found that you can just eliminate all traps/turrets and just kill the stuff around your house when you pop in or just repair the 1 wood fence or 1 wall when get back.   They usually wont destroy more than 1 thing.
---
You just got schooled son. Make that skrillah
---
Yes.  Console patches need to be certified by MS or Sony, PC patches can just be pushed out to the end user.
---
Could you please tell me how to get it?
---
May the moral should be:      
---
Better actually read posts &amp; check users post history before accusing someone of something. In general, not only regarding my post ;)

Why are all of these haters down voting my post x) what the heck!

I feel like you're a radicalized member of the church of atom...

Genius
---
Ten second? Try 1 2. It would hardly be inconvenient as a temporary fix to SO MANY ISSUES. The average ping of a player should never get over 200 I'd say, without having frequent connection issues. So if they implement the delay, you can add a line of code in the onlootevent or w.e. to help the client (your Xbox) chill the F out, and it could handshake with the server to let it know that your game isn't crashing to pieces and even let you keep playing while it finished proper loading.
---
I feel like Bethesda writes their code as run on sentences though, and it's just absolute nonsense how the different strings for different things aren't neatly layered and woven like an elegant tapestry, but rather wrapped  around an angry cat writhing in the throes of a bad acid trip.
---
What aluminum tray? I only recall plastic cafeteria trays and steel surgical trays. 
---
I wish i was easily amused like you. The game is a wastelands. Empty. Killing the same thing over and over without any reason is not content
---
I really don’t think they can. This is why the “unlimited atom exploit” is a thing. Even if they refund you for something you bought from the atomic shop, it doesn’t get removed from you account. Because *they can’t*.
---
I don't use excavator, but i'm interested so see how this goes.
---
Anyone know where I can buy pure flux to make jet-packs with?  It's really involved to find it.

You only get DC'ed 2-3 times a day? That's cute. I got dropped 6 times in an hour and probably in the neighborhood of 10 times throughout the day

The stupid thing is that we have way more prewar money than caps lying around, so using caps is pointless in the first place
---
Thank you :&gt; now go cause some chaos
---
What I meant was Manual swapping whenever, full load-outs in camp only.
---
A per my example, imagine fighting the Scorched Queen. You have 2 setups, heavy guns and melee weapons. Each setup takes 6-9 card swaps. You're in your big guns blasting miss cantmelleeme as she flies around. So now, the AI trigger happens and she makes the mistake of landing in front of you. Manually, you're probably not going to be able to switch your entire build from PewPewPew to Smashy-Smashy before she takes off again, forcing you to pick one or min/max both together best you can. With out-of-CAMP load-outs you could and the concept of having to decide how to fight her goes out the window making an already not all to hard fight pretty eays.  
---
In lore they are humans that have eaten other human flesh and turned cannibal, they are then possessed by a demon, here’s an  actual game about fighting them but I can’t remember what it’s called
---
I love scrapping power armor, gives me that sweet, sweet plastic.
---
Every time I look for mods I just get YouTube videos about people being banned for mods... or potential mods... or things that are not mods but Bethesda thinks they're mods.
---
Amazing camp! Where do you get the plans for brick walls?
---
Plans, serums, ammo, rare resources, anti armor legendaries, quad legendaries, instigating legendaries, furious legendaries, weight reduction legendaries, sentinel's armor, hunter's coat, calibrated shocks, jet packs, and stabilized flux...
---
Oh, and that's only the popular stuff that pretty much anybody will accept as currency if they don't flat out ask for it. You can get away with selling much more niche stuff...somebody bought 6000 gunpowder off me recently, and pretty much any legendary combo will sell for the right price as long as it's interesting and has some purpose.
---
I'm 42 and on PS4, I do play some games on PC as well
---
I don’t buy this because they won’t even remove Atomic shop items from your account if they grant you a refund. You can literally buy multiple things from the Atomic shop, request refunds on all of them, get completely refunded, and still use all of those items PLUS buy some more with your refunded atoms. They WILL NOT remove the items from your character. Why wouldn’t they do this if they could?
---
Nice work.  
---
I recommend the hazmat suit from poseidon exterior rooftop (white and yellow trailer) as some of the most useful armor to carry, or wear all the time if you have a useful mutation and do not want to build further mutation that would decrease its value before you level enough to starch genes
---
*no one likes a showoff, Hobo* ;)
---
i'll guess.
---
step1. ask you nicely how you get it.
---
step2. receive link with the hack/tool that allows you to access to dev room.  or   link where you pay with paypal to obtain paint plan that you obtained from dev room and massively duped.
---
step3. pay irl money to get something that is supposed to be released in future patches.
---
Did a queen today, took \~15min, but that's much worse than normal considering that it hardly spent any time in the air. My own weapons suck, so I assumed fewer OP guys showed up then usual.
---
Also I didn't get anything because the corpse vanished before the inventory stopped spinning. Terrible waste of 556.
---
Add me if ya want

Lol.. Throwing around your level aye? Not impressed. Funny how reality is faster than theory when you use the worse case scenarios to make a point. Best wishes man.
---
Wasn't it explained in New Vegas or something that bottlecaps was just the right size to fit and fool vending machines pre-war.
---
One thing I'm hoping they're going to do with the vaults is lock teams in and lock their perks. Internal data makes it look like they'll lock teams in for the quest lines but if they also lock perks that will make you need to decide who will be doing what, which will be kind of neat for multi-player content. Someone to pick locks, hack, repair, heal, etc all while still maintaining a good defense and DPS. If they do something like that, then I like needing perk cards for mechanic stuff.
---
This makes the accident less tragic and more a contender for Celebrity Darwin Awards.
---
Kinda wished I didn't know now.
---
GT?
---
That would be great just need to be careful not to scrap prewar money.
---
I'm not sure of that. I was in a lookout tower once when one attacked. I ran down the tower and it landed on the cliffside next to the tower. It could never attack me directly and it never took off. I've a rifle character and didn't melee it.
---
3* lvl60 super sledge  reduce  weight, how much?
---
Signing up under every word. I was able to solo 3 scorchbeasts at once, but it still feels awful. And their "loot" is just a spit in your face.
---
I've had similar reactions there too.  I've also encountered a 
---
 Legendary super mutie that yells retreat and runs away from me at the steak house more than once.  It may be a guarantee legendary spawn.
---
There is an "aluminum tray" junk item that only gives you steel when scrapped
---
2 beasts 1 bullet
---
It would be cool if they removed that possibility completely (maybe by  making two shot a secondary effect instead of a prefix) and changed all the currently existing ones to something that's not as good but still somehow better than a normal one. Since no more would ever drop, they would become unique collector's items
---
Basically no trading. Nah, I'm good.
---
Feel free to add me
---
Or its simply not possible to remove duped items, as has been mentioned before. 
---
Removing methods to dupe is probably the only thing they can do, and I hope they find out a way to stop it once and for all. Then they can work on fixing the rest of the mess that is fo76.
---
I like this. I also feel that you should HAVE to nuke and close each fissure site to seal them shut for an endgame event. They would probably have to be done in a set order, so the game could track them appropriately.
---
That may require the game to also keep track of everyone who is at each step, and segregate them by servers based on progress, which I feel should happen anyway. 
---
Given there's 3 working methods I wouldn't hold my breath.
---
Is it over?
---
Don't forget the Super Duper perk as well, chance to double the crafting output.
---
But it was added last patch...
---
It was more directed at the guy that said it as he is just being a troll.
---
Suggesting cheats is rediculous
---
I'm not the person you're speaking to, but I developed Half Life 3 and  the person you're speaking to is saying exactly what I would.
---
Nope. You can easily farm 100k worth of stuff. Doesn't mean you cheated to do it.
---
16 tons is 32,000 pounds though? 
---
Feel the pain brother..
---
I get hassled and called a cheater often.. 
---
Was trying to give some a full set of weightless 1* armor today and he felt uncomfortable taking it from a cheater...
---
I've had mule accounts dating backing UltimaOnline/EQ, it's a stable of MMO's yet someone people think it's "cheating" in '76
---
So your pro dupers and wouldn't want all their characters to just die and be unaccessible?
---
I usually tag enemys n drag them to the robots...they kill the robots and i mop up and save ammo or the robots kill them and i get exp either way saves pa and weapons
---
Yes but the Grahms, Fawkes’, and Lily Bowens of supermutants. Very very good ones. 
---
What I do
---
Especially because Zenimax already does this with ESO and they use the exact same CSR support system. ESO support requests actually get routed through Bethesda support, so it seems like this is the domain of the publisher. Why allows reps to access player inventories for some games but not others?
---
how?
---
You can run 2 clients on the same computer if your machine is robust enough!
---
I don't think their broken really I tend to kill all of them in the watoga zone as a melee dps for their own meat.
---
Primarily all of their mechanics can be negated by Los or being able to use cover and movement to avoid the AoE attacks. My experience engaging them as ranged on the other hand is trying and pretty annoying i.e I don't like range.
---
But I do agree Scorchedbeast Queens are entirely broken in many ways and definitely need to be addressed.
---
On another note after killing so many Scorchedbeast I feel like they all have unique personalities or A.I some will stay ranged and touchdown rarely. Some will stay grounded and engage you constantly I'm melee range. Some will use the crop-dusting attack to saturate the ground but rarely use their Sonic attack etc.
---
Another point of interest I have noticed is how they react when they are engaged by various mobs such as super mutants, robot's or weirdly enough ranged scorched. I've even seen a Mire lurk Queen nearly kill one which was pretty damn hilarious.
---
It heals them 
---
I'm glad they're fixing stuff, it needed to be done. Still probably won't play much until we see some new content or features though. I've had fun but the game got stale a little too quickly.
---
I waited to launch to figure out how to broadcast live on ps4 gotta wait 24 hours to go live on youtube but I'm broadcasting on greaver8769's live broadcast on ps4 from the control room lobby of charlie
---
I do development using angular and other web frameworks.   When talking about Objects, one can assign a specific unique identifier that no other object has which is different than a database primary key.   This identifier is really just a tag, if you will, does not really "do" anything.   But, when an item is dupped, it might get another unique primary key but will keep the specific unique identifier.
---
Within about 10 seconds, you could delete every single item in game that has that unique identifier.  poof, gone. Its actually very simple to do.
---
Now, if you do "not" have that, it gets very complex for the same thing.  Say the items only have a primary key, each dupped item will get its own primary key.  Now each item is unique and not tied to the original.   Every database has transaction logs, every company will backup these transaction logs.  So Bethesda devs can actually figure out the duping thing if they want to throw a lot of manpower at it.  But thats alot of time on a single person duping.   There are probably quite a few people doing the duping.   
---
It would be tough to spot and prob require a developer coordinating with SQL Admin to spot the duping.   Because a new entry into database could be a bought item, or a found item or a given item.  Plus it might be that the stacks of "1000" TSE Shotguns count as a single item in the database just the property of "weight" and "amount" goes up.  Thus the number of entries remains unchanged, but those two values do change.   Then they would need to do queries for changes in weight and amount.   Well, those two things change on every single character in the game just about every 5 minutes.  When someone takes junk from stash, scrap junk, sell junk, buy chems, sell chems, found items, kill stuff, ect.  So they have to be really specific in their queries.  But dupers target not only weapons, but serums, items as well.  Just tough to spot sometimes.
---
So if they made a unique identifer for each instance of an item, then easy.  But that would mean Shotgun A would be a seperate entry than Shotgun B and the weapons would not "stack".
---
Endangerol was brought to my attention earlier. This isn't a post to have an arguement over but to help others with my experience of my playing style. If the advice is in any form ignorant then please call it out. However, it works for myself and hopefully those that read it as well. Try it out, maybe it does work and it will work for you. This is more so geared towards people that are having trouble drowning the SBs.
---
There are many ways to skin a Scorchbeast. If the playing style doesn't suit your needs that is completely understandable.
---
All hail the Kovac-Muldoon!

I've been making my camp on lead deposits for that sweet, sweet ammo! My current base is a short walk east from top of the world. I plan on moving to the forest soon though. I've yet to build a really good base there and I want the next one to be more public with no locks. It really is beautiful place too
---
Because being over encumbered in fo4 was buggy af. Use a crafting station for a high chance to die. And you're also saying people should take damage during load screens which makes no sense whatsoever. So if I log off encumbered I'm just going to die the moment I log back in? Strong back and lone wanderer are bad in this game so an average player would have a cap of around 180 which is barely enough to carry the basic necessities. And you want the stash limit to be at its lowest when people need it the most when there shouldn't even be a stash limit that small. 
---
That is neat.  I wonder how much CAMP budget these things take base on level of the creature and type.  Like would a level 90 Sloth take much more budget than a level 50 Deathclaw or a level 10 Brahmin?
---
From what I can tell containers don't respawn cross server (PC) including the ability to "search" them. Not sure on the timer.
---
Plans and plants are wonky. Sometimes I can swap servers and pick them up, sometimes I just stare at the "Press E" prompt. It may have something to do with state resets like if the area was under Nuked or Fertile conditions.
---
I think it's safe to say that they are intended to be on a timer.
---
I would imagine dupers are already assuming the worst and preparing for it whether or not Bethesda confirms ahead of time.
---
Ha.  No, they don't go that far.
---
Like I posted just let them Die. It's a simple solution Damage for being over weight it worked in survival before and it's not like you suddenly wake up and have 10,000 LBS in 2 seconds. even equipping all your reduction card and equipment will most often take you to 3K-4K max. Kill them and make them unplayable at load.  If they fallow the old calculation it would be 10hp per 100lbs over your limit. every second.  Make you have time to put the card back on in game if you take it off by accident. but if your just using a MULE it would kill that little shit.
---
 
---
And still Bethesda ignore the most posted topic on here.

“Slap mode” is active but you can be slapped to death. The attacking player will get marked hostile or wanted if they manage to kill. Plus there have been reports of one-hit slap deaths.

Might be a molerat problem.   I never had my Fusion destroyed.  But my Radiation Arc did get damaged, so I had to build a wall next to it.  Hoping that will stop it from getting damage.   I may have to put the arch inside the house.
---
Please explain to us how you do it then. I would love the feedback.
---
Thanks, I will have to go in there and poke around!
---
learn to word better when then comes
---
I set up with stairs and first story crafting station with a bed. Saw someone was wanted at my camp and they were destroying it. It was way back towards the fence and assaultrons. Wtf is the point 
---
Hmm... Guessing it's a close battle between rabbit and frog. Makes me wonder if there is a legendary chicken or squirrel.
---
Never. 
---
I sell them. 
---
The timed nature of them and the magazines makes them completely useless. 
---
Not very effective. They move around quite frequently. Mines would work better in that situation, but, even with mines its hit or miss in my experiences. 
---
If you had a friend melee and hold it in place for a moment, you could hit it though. 
---
You know, I was thinking this too, and my train of thought took me to... a flare gun. Which we have.
---
The Ice-Man cometh!
---
Ah.. Good old
---
Hmm, may have to relocate your CAMP to try and see if it will re-calculate the budget.  You can probabably just move it a few feet.  But you might not be able to place it down again without breaking it down.   plus deal with the duplicated water pumps, crops.  Not sure if you want to go through that hassle.
---
I'm pretty sure that was all completely false, it came from one youtube host who claimed he was banned for using mods, but it later came out that he was using real cheating programs and was banned for that.
---
And you know how gaming media goes, one person says a controversial thing and all the sites pick up on it and repeat the story.
---
Now, that's just hearsay, but I don't think this is true.
---
I'd honestly like to see the Stash be a level 25 reward to prevent MULE characters and then have it scale from there. It's the wasteland only carry what you need. Inventory management is a skill that people need to learn. While were at it Stash's boxes should be either general all can access your stash and a private stash that is only in the player home and is loot able by other players.
---
I think they're just more concerned about working in the back end. They're going to announce a character wipe or fresh servers in a couple months.
---
Oooh. Good call, time to start a new build.... feck.
---
Has nothing to do with be pro-duping, but everyone with a mule alt or a second account to mule extra stuff would be penalized because you think this is the "best way" to tackle the dupers..
---
literally no one thinks that.
---
Either you're a troll or you have poor understanding of jokes. They're just acknowledging the "aha" element of that. Don't get all wound up about stuff like that.
---
Yeah I shocked someone by buying a quad ammo lvl 25 lever action the other day - the poor xxx was just complaining they'd spent all day farming and got nothing.... I just thought hey perfect for my new alts as I level them. Everything has a value to someone. ;)
---
This is the exact answer I was looking for. Exploits and glitches are interesting, as are potential solutions. Thanks for taking the time.
---
Only if they fix the absurd weights on some of the items in this game. Looking at bobby pins and stims for starters. Long arm guns are next (21 lbs for a handmade rifle?) AK in real life weighs like 7-9 lbs, and what's wrong with mules? It's been a thing in gaming forever.
---
Fuck yeah
---
Don't those diaries from huntingpoint? still traumatise me every time i read them. :(
---
I "think" the bonus stacks but might be a  5 second buff to damage type thing.  You can test this out since you have said weapon.   Record the damages and times.
---
Like how much damage is done on the first 10 seconds, the next 10 seconds, the next 10 seconds. 
---
If the damage stops increasing after say the first 10 seconds but stays higher than normal, then its just time based.   But if the damage keeps increasing every 10 seconds, then its until the mob dies.
---
I'm just guessing based on the text on some perks.  Some say the damage buff lasts 5 seconds.
---
I had not touched the game in two weeks for this very reason.  Finally logged back in a couple of days ago.  Managed to fast travel, walk around a bit, and then disconnected from server.  I think I managed about 5-10 minutes of actual gameplay.  I didn't even bother trying again.  Every time, I get less and less invested in even attempting to play.
---
I don't *think* so - at least, I can say for sure that I had a developmentally disabled person slap me for about fifteen minutes solid one time, and no part of my power armor ever turned red. It might have lost a small amount, but probably negligable. Only cost me like 10 stimpaks.
---
On the other hand, it may be damage based, and if those rumors of slap damage one-hit-kills are anything other than lies, that might hurt your armor. 
---
Hey Vic. If you read up in this post that you replied to, I had even stated that it is bugged. You are one of those players or redditors who just have to spew nonsense and make sure people acknowledge you as being correct, right? 
---
Well, here goes. You are right it's bugged. I tested it and it is definitely bugged. Thank you for jumping all over this post. I appreciate the time and effort that you spent going into making sure that people understand that the endangerol stringer is in fact, wasteland tested and approved, to be bugged at this moment. 
---
I would give you this post's silver medal if I could. That is how well you have impressed me with your due diligence. If you are on Playstation, please drop me your PSN ID. I would love to see your C.A.M.P.
---
We need nukes to spawn enemies first. Also need them to drop the correct loot. I was in a nuke at Morgantown last night, killing level 68 scorched. I just loved that all they dropped was non-legendary weapons that were level 5
---
What about Princess?
---
The last thing the servers need is a wipe as that mainly hits those of us that play heavily every day aka their most dedicated playerbase. 
---
I don't use turrets anymore as they take up so much budget and really are completely useless, most mobs spawn somewhere my turrets cant hit them or my turret just watches them destroy my base and takes 1 or 2 shots every now and again, instead I've worked out where the enemies spawn and I've built myself a watchtower in the corner for a little manual defence.
---
Let get the game to work properly first. But I like where your heads at. 
---
Yeah I was even ignoring them as they sat there for three mins hitting me with melee weapons. Then I see him pull out his gun and bam, dead. I got a great laugh out of it. His buddy was trying sooooo hard to kill me thinking fought back. And when they realized I didn’t they were trying super hard to push me off the bag he dropped.
---
Yeah things would be so much better if we were all using quad explosive shotguns and anti-armour explosive weapons etc.... wait... ;)
---
back when server hopping duped all the items placed on the ground in a base, it was amazingly easy to rack up items in the store tab which bypassed the base budget since the game thought they had already been built.
---
Kill them. They land when they die.  
---
Alternately, shoot the wing roots. If you can see them between sonic spam attacks. 
---
I love their myth, it's really interesting how the story spread to the Canadians and how Wendigo Psychosis, which makes the person have an intense craving for human flesh and fear of becoming a cannibal, is named after it
---
And a reasonable mule is fine but not many game have an unlimited inventory and a server stability issue with number of items in the world.  The inventory needs a cap or a soft cap that causes damage the more you exceed it. but will ultimately result in death. And yes we all have used Mules in the past and you still can but not to excess and when it comes to excess if you have seen the screen shot of the people with 4mil of each bobble head? or 6000+ Nuka cola. It's the reason your getting disconnected from the servers, it's the reason your getting random lag spikes. It needs to be handled and its not simple back in code limit it an engine limit. So the simple solution is to put a limit on it like all other MMO's 
---
There's a reason he's still alive (and thus legendary): unlike most, he knows when to run

Well nuking the toxic lakebed up in grafton spawns a glowing mirelurk queen. Would like to see a boss queen, but since that dang poison is a b*tch, I kind of donlt at the same time, aha.
---
Well, that was quite a reaction I'm just going to ignore, but feel free to continue your tirade
---
wut
---
thanks
---
Yeah it makes you think if wendigos are actually real since it is a documented medical condition [wendigo psycosis]
---
Murica Fuck Yeah!
---
I have no issues with them. Theres tactics and specific abilites that nail them.
---
I haven't really have to many issues with being disconnected, except yesterday. My girlfriend and I got disconnected like 5 times. It was even more annoying because we were trying to take over every workshop. We were 13 in and the server crashed so she quit playing. 
---
I mean, Howard explains how the endings worked right there in the article?  Which is how the endings in 3 worked, you had bits that changed and had variations.  Nothing about that was incorrect.
---
Huh. In the Cranberry Bog there's also an elevated train that has something like that, it gives off arcs of electricity and if you get close to it you'll get super irradiated, but it doesn't seem like you can do anything with it...
---
Also have submachine gun &amp; pump shotty prime plan
---
Super useful post! Mirrors a lot of what I was saying on or discord server last night but far more eloquently!
---
radiation heals ghouls as the lord todd said it would
---
Last two times that I been attacking the queen I have encountered that we barely do any damage to her, burning through ammo on weapon after weapon and stimpaks ever so slowly with barely doing a scratch to her. 
---
23 minutes in and we have taken maybe 30-40% of her health and near 7 minute mark she decides to reset and take off to the sky again and at this point people start to give up and leave. 
---
Annoys the hell out of me
---
You hear of this thing called school? Should go there sometime would teach ya some reading skills.
---
or use it as a healing tool if your friend or teammate has the perk which restores health from radiation he can get healed from it
---
But, why? How does managing inventory add to the experience of playing this game? I understand that this sort of thing appears in many other survival games where it adds to the conflict and tension. However, FO76 this isn't like those other games. So, what does having to carefully manage our inventories add to this specific game?
---
Like ol mate below said: adapt or die. xD.
---
Mutations are so much fun, I would not play without them now.
---
Also theres no way Id be able to solo the scorched beast queen by myself without them.
---
people would trade an X-01 jetpack for that thing, at least so i heard. one of the rare actually useful things that have like a 1% chance of being at the vendor
---
Step4 get permabanned
---
Step5 get your computer hacked
---
I think it would depend on what type of lighting they use, and if they can use terrain masks. If they use terrain masks, you could in theory vertex paint to remove the visible Geo and texture. You can then add a different "hole-mesh" that could be your basement interior to hide seams and such.
---
I think the problem would be recalculating the collision mesh for the terrain, I'm not sure how they're doing it at the moment.
---
Second problem might be lighting. I think they're using dynamic lighting for SOME things, but it's probably baked lighting for most. If they use baking, they need to rebake the terrain lighting, or make it dynamic. That'd probably add to the power cost of the game, which is not something we want (right?)
---
Trap doors would indeed probably be easier, but then you'd need to make a new worldspace for every character. I'm not sure how big that impact would be.
---
You are a genius damn 
---
Kinda hesitant to give it away but since you asked Ill give you a tip: limbs.
---
People with very keen eyes and a knack for measuring variance are king in the fallout series.
---
Literally as you sent that I bought it from the vendor. Not sure if I’m gonna use it or sell it. 
---
not involving mods ?
---
They're not jokes, people *literally* think that. "It's just like the DMV, I think that's what they were going for." 
---
Just because *you* don't like it, doesn't mean other mongoloids don't as well. 
---
i aways think of ways to help not to harm
---
You do know that in GTA you can smoke and drink with animations. Both games are rated M. 
---
To be honest, they're a bit underwhelming. I'd google what it looks like before you use it. It's just a subtle red outline around mobs
---
Tldr
---
Oh, even in PA you wouldn't last long
---
You must be reading that wrong. That was a compliment. I kind of understand your personality now. Best of luck in the wasteland.
---
I had this same issue, except I was naked and pipboyless for about 3~ minutes until eventually it all loaded in, but damn was it laggy until I dumped my inventory.
---
Update I got that shit at watoga station after just one relog
---
I disagree and I play alot myself. The health of the game would improve if once they fixed all the exploits they wiped the servers or offered fresh start servers that couldn't be accessed by older characters. Allowing players to ensure the economy and experience is legitimate and not exploited.
---
It is unfair to compare any name to that of THE Pwent. Obviously.
---
I don't think they're ignoring it. Hopefully it gets fixed with this patch. They just take forever (well it feels like forever sometimes even if it's just a week or two) to fix things. 
---
Looks good for the most part, just a few suggestions. First, why refractor? It is pretty useless especially considering that the grounded mutation exists. Also, rejuvenated is not that useful imo because your hunger and thirst meters go down decently fast. I would recommended moving two points from endurance to perception for two reasons: ability to pick level 3 locks, and max rank glow sight. +60% damage to glowing enemies is a huge difference in damage in nuke zones and picking max level locks is just good for loot and accessing alternate entrances.
---
As for weapons to look for, mole miner gauntlets are easy to get (and get the plans for) early on. For end game the highest damage weapons seem to be either deathclaw gauntlet or power fist. (Dont take my word for that though, just seems to be what people are looking for the most so it makes sense)
---
Yeah you save a lot of time having a mule character, I wasted countless hours so far managing everything. Time is so valuable in life, you only get a certain amount of years before it's all gone.
---
Pencils, give 1 lead and 1 wood. Liscensed Plumber Rank 3, only need one of each of the four materials to repair pipe guns. Pretty sure one of them is wood. So I am repairing my pipegun with a pencil, some glue, and some other odds and ends. Is my gun just a katamari at this point?
---
You see, if a publisher wants to put a game on steam, they would have to pay Valve 20% percent of the game's earnings as a fee. Bethesda don't want to pay for that fee so this game won't be on steam ever.
---
p.s: oh also I think you got scammed :)
---
Hardened .50 cal reciever does more dmg than regular hardened reciever
---
Fight four of them at once. I did tonight and I'm afraid I might be epileptic now lmao. Seriously though, it was absolutely absurd. 
---
Same. A friend built mine for me, and now I can't place it anymore.
---
It fits in seamlessly. 
---
I did lots of research on it, it does seem a little underwhelming but if it’s rare people will buy it, I hope. 
---
I  have that bug too, consider yourself lucky mine takes up 20% of my camp!!!!!!!
---
Take this with a grain of salt. Last update didn’t even fix the major issues it tried to address. That paired with the lack of any idea what these “fixes” are is going to lead to a lot of disappointed hype train riders here.
---
I do love the game, but I’d have to tell anyone thinking of getting it right now to wait for patches. It’s actually gotten more unstable for me.
---
If deathclaws get power armour and jet packs we are fucked 
---
I thought the hardened .50 receiver didn't exist? 
---
Tbh the instable client is punishment enough currently.
---
It has always been part of Fallout, but there was never a problem with the things you do affecting other players.  When you start a game that is an MMO you need to find a balance and them taking away damage for over encumbrances was the worse choice they made.  Especially when they already had a server stability issue. If they want to fix the stability issues this is one of the thing they will have to do. I've caught duper on my server you will see 2 guy next to each other and one will disappear and re-apear. The sever started to lag each time the guy would login. with no ingame ticket or even a way to report them for investigation. They need a way to automatically fix the problem and this is a simple solution that will honestly not effect most player.   
---
For PC users this mod is super handy. This one im not sure of regarding terms of service, but it seems safe so far.

And that is caused By?
---
Yeah, I stopped claiming workshops because of this.
---
I hadn't had an issue for a few days, so I figured I'd mass produce Salisbury steaks.. sure enough, disconnected in the middle of placing turrets. I've easily lost 500+ caps to workshops that I couldn't even collect anything from.
---
Always crash in nuke zones....
---
most players still value that red little outline like gold, i dont like to use it because i want things to look natural but if i didnt care that much about it i would definitely buy the mod because it could be pretty useful in some situations
---
Seems overkill and boring as sin
---
Dupers should dupe a crap load of ghoul slayer gamma guns and give them to everybody
---
Is that the k e that highlights enemies in red, or improves VATS hit chance?
---
I personally quite like the enemy highlighting, but it only seems to work like half the time. 
---
I'm not a duper and I still think it's irrelevant to kill character. Stash size should be further expanded - 1000 lbs would be enough, in my opinnion.
---

 This guy asking for mobs to spawn slower while everyone else wish for them to spawn faster.
---
This guy base hunts.
---
That is why I really want a link that confirms it will not come to steam... :/
---
And it will as the content comes out and the space is expanded. but that limit shouldn't just be handed out at level 1 it needs to be scaled with level or in game cost. If you played WOW or ESO you know exactly what i'm talking about.
---
What's that in kgs?
---
Although, if so, the console players are going to have a 4 day headstart
---
That's all true--- if they were starting from scratch. Of course, they're not. They've got their buggy, cobbled together, Gamebryo based engine, which has never had terrain deformation. I don't think they're about to add it now. Using the existing cell interior structure they already have is, I think, the only realistic option.
---
You can score them from doing the prison patrol event, completion gets you a random gun plan, took me two tries to get the handmade plans
---
They do. I have one myself. But cnt show it coz im workin atm.
---
I can’t say for certain it does or does not exist, but other variations of the .50 receiver do exist, like Hasty. So it’s not a huge leap to assume that there is a Hardened .50 receiver. But it’s probably a pain to find.

---
Our thirst can not be quenched. 
---
Wiping the servers will prompt a lot of players to leave. They need to fix explosive weapons, cut the duping and ban the worst offenders and introduce higher level content to nurture power creep. This will take a fair bit of time because they need a dlc with new higher level areas for that to work.
---
I had an accessible rad shower in my golf club base briefly... the problem with an open base is people run in there and let ghouls break your shit instead of fighting them.
---
End result, no more public rad shower, a locked door, and I put all my turrets back up
---
What are flux actually used for in this game?
---
Damn, if I can find a hardened .50 receiver for my rifle build I'll be I'm heaven 
---
I imagine cool ass Deathclaws with webbed skin, giant arms, and claws. Imagine that randomly jumping you at night lol
---
Fine by me!
---
PS4 but thanks.
---
We had the ammo plant for about...  20 minutes before we were blocked and assassinated.
---
See I woulda stood next to you and exploded you as soon as you hit 100 caps or so
---
I found that one last week, there's a holotape at the drivers seat of the train that details the scientist there was trying to build a time-space portal thing to go back and stop the Great War. His skeletal remains and the state of Appalachia confirm that he did not succeed.
---
This sounds terrifying
---
All you need is access, a ticket system and customer support. Blizzard has the ability across all it's online games. Hearthstone, WoW, Overwatch, HotS with millions of players in each games across the world. They manage it just fine.
---
Stargate sg-1 crossover dlc?
---
Must feel liberating to change words in the english language for absolutely no reason whatsoever 
---
You can build basements currently, but it's actually an exploit because you're glitching under the map. It's kinda funny
---
Highlighting system. 
---
Would be cool if it just gave a legendary weapon instead of some random assortment of junk.
---
I didn't played any of this game, but I played Diablo 3, where stash space were also valuable and you could earn more stash tabs by doing season journey. That way you reward active players. So yes, I agree that stash could be limited to player level and be rewarded as "mods" to expand it with event/DLC rewards.
---
Yeah, thought that it would be “luring” technique but no way.
---
But what you're saying is you made up working as a game developer. which means....
---
ooooooh
---
you're clever.
---
tesla rifles are for killing crowds, not for long ranged combat
---
unless they are explosive then put a shotgun mod on it
---
I read somewhere that energy weapons don't take into account any anti armor including perks, if I were you I would hold on to it, it will get fixed sooner or later and be a good weapon, but never against solo ghouls
---
Well, when you have 16 tons,  all you get is another day older and deeper in debt.
---
I don't know where it is or how they get there. but we know how Bethesda makes games and how people go through walls to closed vaults ..
---
No, they should also apologize for not releasing their next patch earlier. Literally more than three weeks since last one shm. I cannot believe it I almost died of old age our true developers Obsidianos wouldn't treat us true Fallout fans^tm this poorly.
---
It's definetly not the maps but their loot. I just have too much different items in my inventory. I scrapped like 2 dozens of 10mm pistols and a dozen of automatic grenade launchers before I logged out. Because of different mods &amp; condition they do not stack. I'm pretty confident that my inventory just contains way too much different item IDs.       
---
2 different weapons of the same kind are storage-wise worse than 1000 exact copies of a weapon. So this issue won't even affect dupers as long as they don't gather thousands of different items. But if you legit collect treasure maps (too fast) you risk you're inventory getting corrupted. This is beyond frustrating...
---
That specific gameplay would be fun, and I totally agree with with locking perks, however I, like many players am solo and the time wasted swapping cards, with the fact lockpicking and hacking are three separate cards sucks so for regular roam around solo play passive cards would just be nice 
---
It’s always a nest nearby?
---
The Eastern Penitentiary has a bunch of phones.
---
Thank you but all these still say it could at some point come to steam. But I will try.
---
Yes imagine this for 20min before you crash the whole server just because it tries to load your inventory.
---
I know but I have 400 of them and I don't have space for them woukd be a waste if time to walk to everh vendor.
---
If you're on Xbox I'll give you the advanced Power Connector Plans. This is an exquisite base OP, well done!
---
Funny you mentioned all possible exploits and you didn't use any, specially for serums. ;)
---
Making them peaceful to players under 50 would suck a lot of the tension out if the game. Just trying to survive scorvhbeasts made them some of my best memories as a low level player. It also made it incredibly cathartic to finally kill one by ourselves when we got to level 50
---
That's a definite. 
---
Can you image Diablo 3 if players had unlimited carry weight or tabs they just got a little slower? 
---
Log out and log back
---
Server hop
---
You know what people never mention in these threads, just how easy it is to melee walk through the clubhouse and murder the majority of the ghouls before a turret base gets near killing them. Or how people love to cheese the golf club by running onto the garden on the left side and killing the ghouls while unable to be attacked, or how people with explosive weapons can monopolise all spawns.
---
It’s just a thing among many things people do to cheese whitesprings. If you wanna blow up bases and wear the bounty, great, if you wanna get all righteous about it, go somewhere else to farm.
---
If you want it to change, make more threads about how rubbish the end game is with only one place in one location worth farming ad put the blame on the developers, not the other players.
---
I have a sneaky sniper build,  yesterday a scorch beast landed 10ft from me and I was still in [caution] and just walked away. 
---
It is actually spelled incorrectly. 
---
It’s spelled “aluminium” as that is the actual name of the element. 
---
What platform are you on? I'm on PC and I've had absolutely no server issues bar the team invite function not working once, which fixed itself in about 5 minutes. I've not had it crash once and apart from up near the water park I get a constant 70-72FPS. I've not seen any bugs bar a single t-posing ghoul after it was killed. Granted I only bought it on the 26/12 so maybe these issues were fixed when I got to it?
---
He means from vendors not duping plans. ie the game tells you when you've already learnt a plan before you buy it
---
Why not kill the king?
---
No idea I only speak Murican.
---
But seriously.. per google its 14,515kg 
---
On the flip side, the game also gives you the ability to blow up bases. 
---
This happened to a buddy of mine, once they do a maintenance or a new update it should fix your issue. It did with my buddy. Has to be something with your character de syncing with the server 
---
When they do an update they reset all connections, it should fix afterward.
---
Again like I said this exact same probably happened to a buddy of mine. Wait for next patch and you should be good :)
---
Yeah but BGS might like the classical conditioning and increase player time
---
People also build camps over containers at white springs so they can dupe under cover. They get blown up too. 
---
He didn't live very long pulling that shit on me!
---
I've never had my C.A.M.P. attacked except when I'm there. If I hear them, then I just go take care of them myself. It wasn't worth the budget hit to have a glorified early warning system I constantly had to repair (even when they were "upgraded").
---
Proximity to mob spawn areas might play a factor, but I still get attacked and I seem to be set up where few naturally occurring mobs spawn. The system for random attacks seems to be like Fallout 4.
---
Turrets need to be buffed. My theory is that one of the reasons they are so weak is because of PVP and they could be used to grief. Create separate damage output for PVE and PVP?
---
Even with new content the games ruined people have limitless caps and resources making content trivial forever more or less. New god tier item gets released and the people with hundreds of thousands of items and caps stored through duping and Nuka cola etc will just buy it and inflate the price beyond what normal people can afford.
---
The games literally ruined on an economic level rendering the game only really playable on the macroevel with people you know and trust to not dupe and not PvP ing.
---
And If people like the game they won't leave because progress got wiped. Plenty of people make new characters as it is if they could offer servers with guaranteed no dupers or exploiters I would pick it at the cost of progress every time and im not the only one.
---
It would make them dangerous. As it is they r just annoying. 
---
Knowing Cheat Engine is usually used for exploiting and cheating.
---
Knowing most game's anti-cheat are likely to detect it. 
---
**HAVING IT ON WHILE PLAYING GAMES ANYWAY.**
---
It really wouldn't be santa claws any other way would it?
---
I have 4x 20% weapon reduction. My weapon loadout is 4 different rifles, a shotgun, 2 melee weapons, 50+ grenades and 20ish mines. All of that weighs 30 pounds.
---
The weapon ones seem to scale with perks. With ordanance expert on my grenades weigh .01 each. With Scattershot on, my shotgun weighs 0.25 pounds.
---
The armor/food/chems/ammo affixes dont scale with perks. Or maybe they dont scale with perks as the game cant make something weigh less than .01 pounds other than ammo.
---
The green hood exists. I have one. It still removes the characters hair. 
---
Do you know where in the map that would be at? I wanna try my hand in getting some legendary stuff 
---
Some people build camps over containers so they can share things with their friends and teammates.  I guess they get blown up, too.
---
If you marsupial jump out of their AoE attacks and hip fire at them it's pretty easy to take them down. Once my build relied on ADS less, it became much easier to just jump and blast until they fell from the sky. 
---
Not every build it best suited for every enemy type. The spam is horrible and should be tied to something like AP, but it's easily negated with the right armor. T51/XO1/full zealot armor makes the sonic blast laughable. Get a couple friends with empath and you'll ignore the sonic blasts while looting others' dead bodies for SB steak
---
They can be used to improve under armour such as the vault suit and craft things such as orbital beacons, rad removal shower, ultracite ammo, etcetera. 
---
Good guy! Maybe you can heal yourselves if you shoot on the ground? I will try it today 
---
Fast travel works inside. 
---
&gt; I'm not the person you're speaking to, but I have developed commercial video games a lot, over two decades, and the person you're speaking to is saying exactly what I would.
---
&gt;If I were in the credits for this game, I would feel rather ashamed. I've never asked that my name be removed from a game's credits before, but if I saw that this game was going out the door in the state it did, I would have.
---
I really feel bad for anyone who works under you.
---
Was on my way to the Platinum trophy for this game but unbelievable amount of crashes etc... I felt like I was turning off the power to my frozen PS4 more then playing the game. I did the thing I really didn’t want to do and shelved the game :(
---
It's what I've been told can help the mobs spawn back for some reason. Its easy enough not to kill him so might as well just leave him be incase it is true which most people I've talked to in servers about it agree to keep him alive.
---
I'll buy the next fallout for sure. I'll just wait 3-4 months for the price to drop and main issues to get sorted... Better wait 6 months...
---
what about a troubleshooters gamma gun? robots cannot take rad damage.
---
Oh snap, where did you find it?
---
I found one near that civil war fort, in one of the outhouses outside the fort. 
---
But in D3 you can't expand your backpack, only stash ;)
---
It will be hard but good luck :)
---
Players already left.
---
No Vulcans inside though
---
They fucking nerfed it anyway :(
---
trolling is just one of those niche activities I'll never be able to empathize with or understand.

Work those hormones out on yourself and go to bed.

The creators of the new dumbster fire that is “pretend” Star Trek should team up with Tod. They seem to have this make people rage thing down really well!
---
I saw a mire lurk queen kill a scorch beast while the queen still had around half health 
---
Hopefully it's going to address some major exploits and they don't want offenders to ramp up their abuse before the fixes are in place.
---
There are other mods that also add a legendary pip. The other one that springs to mind is the Sacrificial Blade mod for machetes. 
---
To be honest, I don't remember. It's been so long. But, it definitely wasn't on any of the special vendors. Possibly at Watoga Train.
---
you can't nerf yourself and complain why your build sucks. That's the build you chose, so live with the suck, smoothskin
---
If they were to add overencumbered damage, it would unnecessarily kill a lot of non-dupers. My stash box is full of junk, and because I don't want to drop my legendaries, I'm stuck being overencumbered half of the time. If I were to slowly die just because I was overencumbered, it would be pretty fucking annoying.
---
Their loot makes them unworthy targets for the effort required to bring them down. My strategy when coming across a scorchbeast at random is to simply quit to the menu and reload in a different server that doesn't have that SB at that location. The only times I'll actively engage one is when either I'm fighting the queen and they're in the fight too, or if I'm near a BoS SAM site with enough spare parts to repair it a few times. I let it do the work. A handful of gears and steel isn't worth the measly loot they drop, but it's better than chewing through a day's worth of ammo.

They'll have the codes up within a few hours of them resetting every week. Look towards the bottom where it says "this weeks codes"
---
How do I get the enclave missions once I have completed the base game?
---
Yes. The pipe perk is brilliant. You can scrap for mods cheap. Plus they break so slow. All I can say is I need REAL firepower 
---
Yes, this is my mistake. Probably very dumb. But it seems to me that for a stupid mistake, the loss of access to everything that you have bought for many years without the possibility of dialogue is somehow... too radical?
---
Thanks! Any tips for my first ka-boom?
---
If you wear Raider's armor torso they will mostly freak out and run away and scream flee. When I stopped using it.. they do not run away anymore.. so now I want a full set of Unyielding raiders... just for the lols

Wait for the hype to die and find a used copy, you get the game and Bethesda gets nothing, guaranteed it’ll be a bugged mess and a mint used copy would be available in no time, that’s gonna be my plan for all future Bethesda games

He ran away before I was able to kill him.

PC patches can be pushed and repatched nearly on the fly.   Console patches require the consoles company (Sony/Microsoft) to okay first.

This gives them time to verify the patches work and to allow Console companies the time needed to okay the patch.

I encountered a level 35 Stalking Mothman at lvl 23, on the highway running parallel to the south edge of the golf course. I 'chemd' up and decided to take him on.

He just stood in his hunched stalking pose and let me kill him with no response. Bug? I was very underwhelmed.

How do you get that suit?

Metal and molded plastic.

Here's to me hoping you can atleast wear underarmor while in PA so im not losing so many extra stats, or better yet since when we get in and leave the PA we have all our armor on and you can still see it on in the pip boy (unless you're in a trade/vendor window) the stats actually still count so you're not losing carry weight.
---
Don't get me wrong, I certainly don't have trouble killing them and I wear x01 in nuke zones where I normally encounter them and run ghoulish 3 so my health doesn't go down much, but I do find it a bit annoying and I think the attacks need to be spammed less.
---
Maybe I misunderstood the information I was seeing, but I was tracking a guy for a little while in stealth until he reached a stopping point at a workshop area, he had a 30 bounty or something but it went down over the course of time when I started following his movements. Before I knew it he was a 10 bounty, when I was trying to visually find him in the workshop zone, seems like he was hiding. But then I referenced the map again and he was gone, but I did see a different player there who I assumed was tracking him as well. Maybe it was him with no bounty? IDK. I thought from this experience that bounties did go away. 
---
Removal of the possible combination of two shot and Exploding.
---
One or the other,  never both.  all weapons with the perk get random re-rolled into one or the other.
---
God that would be hilarious as fuck.
---
well you know, in lore, there were budget cuts see and the items in there were removed. The stuff you found was clearly for space dog and the drugs were to keep him calm because he has realized he is stuck in space. How do you think he feels now that a robot shoved his food and daily drug into a coffin and fired it at earth? 
---
If you remember how it worked it would be about 10 damage per second for every 100 lbs your max weight was exceed by. So unless your playing the game constantly over 100 lbs you would be in effected. To make it easier I’d say since we can’t gain HP per level make it for every 200 lbs over. You take the 10. Because if your 200 lbs over constantly you need to really evaluate what you have and need. 
---
I wouldn't say that to be honest, Fallout 4 had a tendency to randomly crash for no reason as well, and that was a singleplayer title. 
---
The easiest way to do this is to join communities in the various podcasts. Fallout feed is an excellent one that is geared to toward slower playing and RPer aesthetic. I recommend inviting people to team that you find in the world, and play with those who accept and want to be teamed - because everyone has such different schedules that even after you link up with some people outside of game you may not find that your play time matches up very well.
---
I usually sell them. I only keep a few to use, I. Special situations. I like keeping a Strength one around for those desperate times I need to fast travel but I’m overweight. And usually big guns if I’m going after the scorch queen or anything else that takes a lot of Gatling bullets to kill. 
---
I kinda do this regularly. My character is kinda an aristocrat that only dines on scorchbeast steak. 
---
I for one would have 3 if not 4
---
I maintain the original east coast enclave were like the paste eating kid in the group. They couldn't kick them out, but with all the weird and dumb shit they did, they just kind of ignored them. 
---
Until Dawn
---
Honestly, a TSE based build is going to be ridiculously OP no matter what perks you take. 
---
Might as well take enforcer.  
---
Completely agree.my brother and I were talking about this. you could even call them "perk decks".
---
Also Aussies. 
---
Yep sound perfect but adding an item number limit wouldn’t work. So a hard weight limit would be fine based on that. Just a message saying you can’t pick anything else up doing so will cause you to suffer damage. 
---
I don't know if it would be better, but you'd have an incentive to do something else than "farm whitespring". 
---
I love workshops, I really do , the concept is interesting to me, but no one gives a shit about taking them, which means it's only "kill three ghouls, pay 5 caps, receive a reward, build 5 turrets, wait a second, kill the three scorched, receive a reward, ok you can play somewhere else we'll warn you".
---
I'd love it if the workshop gave you specific mods/materials you can't have somewhere else because it would mean something to have one.
---
Maybe not but it IS possible to force the game code to never pair Two-shot and Exploding.   Removing the combination from all existing weapons by cutting one or the other off of them.
---
That dog food is premium blend sir. Working as intended. Now if you excuse me I’m going to order another 100 pre war money to put in my out house. /sarcasm gosh I hate the drops.
---
Are you kidding? 
---
Surviving them is dumb and wasteful both ammo and stimpack wise. 
---
On the contrary, Scorchedbeasts suck the fun out of the game at lower levels and are pure  harassment, randomly spawning next to you when you arrive somewhere after fast traveling.
---
It's honestly getting tedious to have to relog to avoid them.
---
Yeah that’s the one
---
Are you telling me to calm down MODUS!? 'Cause I'll calm down on your goddamn cpu with a super sledge! 
---
Make sure you are prepared if you enter the silo alone. Lots of respawning bots that will make tasks difficult if you don't have a melee heavy build. I run a sneak/rifle build and it took me almost two hours to do my first launch solo because I didn't know what to expect and had to deal with a lot at once without my stealth advantages.
---
Do you know how boring it is to manage your entire inventory and stash? There's not a button to take all your junk at once, so you just have to keep spamming the A button, and how come I can't drop some notes and shit? I don't want my inventory full of random people's diaries.
---
I deeply hope so! Sadly I'm on PS4 so I have to wait a bit but I'll try for sure.
---
Shotgun turrets are pretty good. I got killed for a workshop a few days ago and my shotgun turrets killed him immediately after. 
---
They're still garbage at targeting though. 
---
Wait? They're supposed to become peaceful after the mayor quest?
---
Scratch that, I realised I actually haven't completed it as I was too low level to get in the robco facility back then
---
Didn't see the plans part. Apologies.
---
We just need a mierlurk queen with death claw speed.
---
"I played legit and never abused any bug."
---
Yeah, except the one that broke your shit, dude. 
---
Yeah fair enough. I haven't worked inside of their engine enough to know anything about it. Maybe that's why it's so baffling to me that they couldn't take shortcuts like that. Honestly though, rebuilding the game in a different engine wouldn't be feasible anyway, so I'm talking out of my ass without adequate knowledge of their engine.
---
Gets me thinking, if they're doing their next two IP's in the same engine, the games will be severely limited in their capabilities because of the engine. Seems like company suicide to me, with the graphical fidelity and technical tricks being invented every year.
---
Anyway, yes, I think you're right.
---
Still it's a supplement to my work at the Tinker's Bench.
---
Always nice to have a few extra rounds rolling in.
---
Yea, noticed. Lol
---
The wife &amp; I were randomly invited to a Nuke at Whitesprings the other morning.  Our "host" asked another player to use a melee weapon instead of his explosive.  We leveled up 7 times each that morning.
---
Definitely worthwhile to share the xp in that environment.  
---
The leather coat (if its the one from the link) is a quest reward for numerous quests in the mire (obviously RNG based). The following quests all state that they have a chance of rewarding said coat:
---

---

---
Event: Always Vigilant
---
Daily: Waste Not

---
Power armor has some set spawns so you can get a whole set pretty early if you look up the locations. 
---
Probably, but there are plenty of tactics that work for plenty of builds. I can’t take a cargobot down to save my life, but I can take multiple SBs fine. That’s the direction I pushed my build and it’s what I’m good at. It’s not reasonable to think you can design a build that good for all things.
---
And tbh they didn’t become “easy” to deal with until I crossed the ~125 mark. I think that’s about appropriate to expect
---
Make sure you got lots of stimpaks, unless you choose to use ghoulish. And rad away/radx, unless you group up with someone with rad sponge. 
---
As for location, if you want cobalt flux to upgrade your vault jumpsuit, nuke the toxic dried lakebed. There is a LOT of bloodleaf there and some enemies to kill for the high radiation fluids, glowing mass and hardened mass that you'll need to stabilize the flux. 
---
If you want to farm legendaries and xp, nuke whitesprings and run a circuit from the golf clubhouse (by the tennis courts) to the end of the street with the little houses and then head through the parking lot of the hotel and shacks just past the entrance to the hotel for a few more ghouls.
---
If there are a lot of high levels (65+) then you might want to nuke prime fissure to fight the queen. Just be sure to nuke a bit southeast of the fissure site so that Drop Site V9 is outside of the zone. This'll make it so that you can fight the queen and not deal with the fps drop from the nuke zone effect. 
---
We had a pretty great response off the bat with very little pushing. That said, I learned a lot about the needs of our community, I am working to meet at least a few with our latest update. Here's what's changed:   1. (possibly most asked about): Requesting Items. Items will be able to filtered (requested) 2. **@\[pc\] IGN Joshuadaleadams on Discord** Added a feature for trade only. 3. Before, we have four-ish sections on the home page: Header with search bar, Browse buttons,  Admin Featured, Recently Added. I added a requests only portion button to header. 4. **@Infernus\_ on Discord** Added a highest lowest price sorting button to results page. 5. Notifications are emailed now. 6. Upgraded Database Plan. Increased speed on loads 7. Added a feature for items where if we have an image of that item it will show it. WEAPONS ONLY FOR NOW
---
As much as I want to be excited for this patch, Bethesda's history of patches usually involves addressing 1 exploit, and introducing 10 new game breaking bugs. I'm cringing more than anything
---
Those damn turrets are the worst!
---
Use the flavored mentats that highlight living things... I think it's either berry or orange... 
---
The targeting hud is the same effect. 
---
Second pick looks really sharp.
---
I found green hood yesterday in sutton station vendor, if I knew it's so rare I would buy it...
---
I miss talking Deathclaws. :( they were my friends.
---
No fucking way!? The amount of those useless pathetic weapons I’ve picked up and just assumed I get lead from them... I feel cheated 
---
Bring stimpacks. My first delve into one of the silos cost me 30 of them. Or go with a friend that knows what they're doing.
---
Youll get to witness the ups and downs of the patches! 
---
Yea, that's the problem I've been running into, people will confirm that it exists, but they will forget where they found it, but you're the first to actually state a possible location, so i'm gonna put that in the post if you're cool with it
---
I'm level 61. Can I have some please?
---
And the stealthy assaultrons! Thank god I had a two shot dragon (non explosive, sadly) for those! 
---
Awesome, i'm gonna put that in the post if you're cool with it
---
If you are an active reddit user and play a lot I'd say it is impossible to not know about wide-spread bugs &amp; exploits. I think a lot of causal players know about those issues as well. Moreover I do believe that the very most of server crashes are tied to players abusing any bugs or exploits.     
---
In short: It's impossible to miss if you play FO76 for a while...
---
Do they sell the pure flux to make the Jetpacks with? I don't know how to set off a nuclear explosion and all the other stuff you have to do to get it. It was so much easier to fly in FO4.  
---

No one cares about mules but when you run into these guys this is the issue.

For some reason, screenshots I take with printscreen show the world as black. I can see my hud and any quest markers, but the actual world view is just blank.

https://imgur.com/yY7G8h3

What level are we talking here? 
---
So this is where the man out of time comic falls into place maybe... I noticed all the magazines talk about stuff that is similar to what kind of tech you find in the game.

np

Awesome info, i'm gonna grind these events and see what comes of it.

Can you even play if you don't have your programs? If that's the case you'd need an extra special flag saying you're allowed to use cheat flagged programs.
---
That won't work. Malicious people can have disability too.
---
So I guess you can play 76 fine without them? That means with or without your "need" for these programs, what it boils down to is the fact that you had a slew of cheat programs running while opening a AAA company newly released online game. Gotta say, as much as making that mistake would suck, as a pc owner competent enough to keep all of those sorts of things synced and running, you should know better and be tidier. 
---
Acting on your situation is a no win/decent potential loss sorta scenario. I wouldn't expect much.
---
Either way. You seem quite knowledgeable about potential ramifications of using these things, yet you made the mistake yourself. A little odd.
---
I think the problem isn’t scorchbeasts it’s that there are no weapons that force them to land 
---
Ok I'm UK and I've never heard it used differently. There's a very slight semantic difference regarding timing (and possibly emphasis) but it's slim. Could you elaborate as to what's incorrect about that usage?
---
future atom shop helmet, has been datamined a while ago:

I have it, it's garbage. 
---
I was a level 40 at the time!
---
and it seems the green hood should really be available anywhere the gasmask can drop, they are in the same leveled list
---
You're preaching to the choir. I already came here and got downvoted for trying to tell people they're not hard
---
They're keeping a tight lip till it releases tomorrow for PC
---
I’m level 59 here. How many stimpacks realistically would I go through? 
---
You still need the required perks though,  at least I couldn't attach a stealth blade mod to a combat knife without makeshift warrior. 
---
Does armor piercing work for energy weapons like gauss rifle? 
---
I hear the trading is crazy bugged out and what not 
---
Mutation that makes MODUS rain cat bowls all over me pls
---
Excavator PA
---
.. With Calibrated Shocks
---
Strength Chemicals
---
Perk that reduces chemical weight by 90%
---
Any melee weapons that increase str.
---
After any of those, drop what you need to and then sell the rest.  I know 
---
I could probably hold 400 of them with just equipping the perk card, enough to Fast travel.  I have about 100 lbs available on my character when not in a PA.  I think 400 weight 200 lbs, so the weight reduction perk would be enough.
---
It's spelled different here too
---
Quite a few if you are running it solo. I went through roughly 15 to 20 on my run, plus I had to teleport back to base midway because I ran out of water and was dying of thirst. Definitely be well stocked. Don't worry about weapons breaking - I think I ran into 2/3 benches of almost each type along the way. 
---
ive never seen one and ive seen a lot of the game so far. i think it was supposed to spawn in events in the mire but i never received it despite doing them all multiple times, i think theres something wrong with how it was implemented, like it never rewards that particular outfit. the person offering 25k caps, did they have a picture of themselves wearing it? its very doubtful someone legitimately got ahold of one, outside the debug room stuff like the owl masks we've seen before.
---
Yeah, I took the Red Rocket Mega Stop yesterday. It would have been really nice to get at least plans for the Red Rocket posters out of that... 
---
...or for that matter to find some of the Nuka Cola related items when I dug through the Nuka Cola factory to the west. But nope, the Mega Stop only got me more Daisy rug and Jukebox plans. 
---
Just like we threw the tea in the water, all in the name of freedom.
---
 multiplicative, Did the test a few time to make sure looks like all the math is in the game except stats.
---
Rifleman perks don't work with shotguns. Demo expert only works if the shotgun has the explosive legendary effect
---
Could you explain to me which bug I should have abused?     
---
Trading? It's actually pretty easy to gather some dozens maps of one kind in a few dozens of trades. Most people don't farm treasure maps at all and some even gave me all their maps for 1-2 serums because they were grateful for the offer.      
---
     
---
Also if you play with a few friends and you'll decide to split treasure maps - let's say everyone gets all maps of a specific region - you'll may come across the exact same issue.
---
Dude thank you for posting this. I can now free up 3 points thanks to you. I was wondering why my sword wasn’t just ignoring 100% of armor. I have an armor ignoring asultron blade and was running incisor, didn’t see or Feel like there was s difference.
---
Oh don’t remember but wall decorations?
---
i have only seen a bullet vending machine at a range (and that was an oddity), they are not common at all most people buy ammo in bulk from gun stores or online 
---
So shouldn’t they just choose store on their turrets for when they go somewhere else to do a thing ? Most of them probably aren’t aware of the negative, I wasn’t 
---
i mean Walmart in the US sell guns and ammo 
---
This just happened to me with the diseased protectrons tonight. Really threw me off haha. Almost every single one was dropping legendaries though so that was nice.
---
My camp today actually was up in the nuke zone at whitesprings. Was incredibly convient for my group and I to be able to hit the stash box and scrap when we needed to. No turrets my base is for everyone.
---
A lot of online games do this. Binding weapons and armor to accounts is not exactly an unusual thing. It would indeed put an pretty quick stop to 3 party sales. Even if it was only weapons and armor. Sell all the wood you want I guess, but I didn't sign up for a pay to win game.
---
Good to know! Is power armor worth bringing? For rads or anything? 
---

Painted things. Toy cars, trucks, wood blocks, tin cans, paint cans, toy rockets. All have lead in them and other useful materials like screws, aluminum or oil. 
---
I built mine next to a gold club spawn for those sweet quick salvage spawns
---
And that's where the problem is, the lack of proper accounts and proof of its existence. It looks cool and is one of the only clothing items that i know of that pairs with two others. The green hood and the leather coat are extremely glitchy it seems. The green hood removes all of your facial hair, and the leather coat may have a drop issue.
---
The exploit is really the big deal here, your right. I feel Bethesda should REALLY crack down on real money deals outside the game as well.
---
The MG42 has mods? I've scrapped probably 30+ and have never gotten a mod for it.
---
The drugs explain the dog food and the metal arm bits. 
---
You probably confuse it with the Firebreather Outfit. Thats not what I want. Theres a different Firefighter outfit in-game.
---
I read the "CRAM from SPACE" in that voice from the old "Lost In Space" TV show: 
---
"Cram... from... SPACE!" with lots of reverb and Theremin effects. 
---
I've never had the energy to loot a single map location but the way everyone seems to be talking, you're able to repeatedly loot the location with a single button press for each map instance, instead of just once per multiple map instances. Doing this enough times that the loot load corrupted your character sounds like exploiting a bug to me. 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Have you tried injecting yourself with Old Cat Lady serum? Try looking outside for it. Under those toxic waste barrels! If you can't find it, don't worry- that means you're getting close!
---
It varies by person. I imagine people have been leveling up pretty fast with teams but like alot out there...I'm a lone wanderer at level 22 and I have barely discovered half the map. I am still exploring and in no way close to the endgame. There are tricks to sever hop and farm for XP but I find that boring and too time consuming. I'm doing it at a slow pace and trying to enjoy it. Idk how people are flying through levels so quick. Has everyone put 100s of hours already? Icame across a level 52 Mirelurk Queen and barely put a dent in her. So I ran away. 
---
Level 3 hacking can make life a little easier
---
I almost always need X-Mouse Button Control. I have cerebellar ataxia, so I almost always have to reassign control in games with macroses.
---
Most games on my computer do not care about this programs. Yes, Vermintide or No Man's Sky are not exactly the same online games like Fallout 76, but you never know which game will trigger on this kind of software. I haven't shut down the computer for months (as it seems to me, many people do the same), so restarting it every time I want to play one of the games with a bad anti-cheat is very tedious. But at least I know that it needs to be done. I was warned!
---
If I were asked how to fix this situation, I would answer: do not use such anti-cheat. Really, there are thousands of memory editors, what's the point of detecting them by file name or window title? Or at least then check whether it worked correctly…
---
I got one at Seneca rocks visitors center, on top of the red rocket by the dead raider.
---
We need more shitposts like this.
---
There is a small area (at least in the silo I hit - charlie) that had a rad heavy area, but they provide you with a few hazmat suit options. Power armor would probably help with damage resist, however!
---
Give us some bloody locations!
---
Love my sneak/shotgun combo nocturnal explosive handmade and an anti armour shot gun 
---
It's weird that the event automatic reward is almost always better than the "space coffin" reward. It should just all be in the space coffin, would be cooler.
---
That’s absolutely mental. 
---
I don't know if any of the other armours have an equivalent paint to BoS Combat Armor, as currently the DR boost you get for the BoS limb pieces is something like 75%.
---
Have you for quit the game or FULLY rebooted your console/pc?
---
Would like to know too. Asking for a friend.
---
Damn. crashing right after killing the queen and not being able to loot it feels nothing to this.
---
Unfortunately if it's an instant disconnect you cannot avoid this, but soon as i start to get the waiting for server response notif i just stop doing anything. If that starts, and lead to a dc i realized the last few minutes won't get saved, so i just save skip situations like this.
---
I wish you to find an even better one soon.
---
EDIT: nevermind its real. its just super, super rare. again, i think its a problem with the drop rate for events and probably some level-limit bullshit as well.
---
Nice, ill check it out
---
So you don't like the basic mechanics of the game at all? I'm guessing the reason that there is no take all option is due to the fact that the game original had this damage for excess weight.  And if you ever played survival mode you would know empty a full work bench could easily kill you.
---
I can't imagine it wouldn't. I've seen anti armor energy weapons.
---
Oh I see what you mean. And indeed it might be a bug. But I have no idea if this is intentional or not. Honestly I saw it as QoL feature.
---
yeah, that would CERTAINLY cause bugs.
---
Maybe not interesting to most, but if you're looking for nuked flora like I was, dropping the bomb on Vault 94 yields high Violet and cobalt in the area. Though there's not a heavy spawn that I found worth burning ammo in like Whitespring.
---
Sick, where did you find the info on this? I want to see if its possible to get these items
---
Thy just incrementally update it as they go, but it's always a bit of a mess. Everyone complains at first, but they keep buying the games and playing them, and eventually everyone forgets how buggy the launch was, and nostalgia effect makes everyone remember the good parts. Bethesda knows they can get away with this gambit over and over. Ultimately, their games are fun enough that they're worth putting up with the nonsense for. Fallout 76 launch has been bad enough that they -might- change, but I doubt it. I bet in 2 years 76 will be loved, too. After all, it is a fun game, despite all the hate it gets.
---
Ha! I was in that fight! Crazy small world. Next time drop the nuke radius south of drop site v9 to make the fight easier. 
---
It's a case of it's entirely possible to do it but they didn't bother to develop the tools to do so.
---
You need tools to look at and modify a players inventory in a meaningful way. Most online games have these for their server data, but Bethesda evidently didn't realize this was needed. 
---
I'm fed up with scrub ass low levels ruining my SBQ runs. That's what I'm fed up with.
---
Sell it. It only works like 40% of the time. It will piss you off more than anything. I had one and ended up just putting a different mod on top of it out of frustration.
---
Oof, those things are the WORST! I have a two shot handmade with +50% limb damage so I always just blow their legs off and then I don't have to jump around and use a gazillion stimpaks. That's if I see them first though... if they see me first then the jumping and screeching begins!
---
I'm at level 72 and I've got about 100 hr. Can't tell exactly with no game counter, but that seems about right. I wasn't especially efficient about levelling either. Once you can survive in a nuked whitesprings long enough to tag stuff other people kill, you level insanely quickly.
---
Wow, I can't believe you have all that and turrets. What are you like level 450 or something?
---
The problem is by doing that, you'd remove the only viable damage combination. The problem with the Two Shot Exploding weapons is they are super common now, instead of extremely rare as they should be. 
---
Now if they upped other methods of dealing damage to remove Two Shot Exploding, that would be a fair compromise. But then you have all the players who bought a Two Shot Exploding and didn't dupe would now complain as they lost the weapon they worked to get fairly. While there is a lot of dupers, and it is a major problem, they risk alienating a portion of the player base who bought the weapons leaving. Which considering the dwindling player base they definitely don't want. 
---
I'm hoping they come to a conclusion that fixes the problem without driving people away, and prevents duping ever happening again.
---
I’ve got a three bladed miners gauntlet, never even seen a power fist outside of other players using them and I’m lvl 81 I know my gauntlet beats the death claw, I keep it for farming ammo off low level mole miners 
---
I had to construct an Excavator left arm for my wife last night.  It just unequipped itself &amp; left.  Good thing we had enough scrap. 
---
Hopefully they fix some of these bugs today (on PC).  The Herd Mentality one and Strange in Numbers bugs are really irritating for someone who always plays in a fully mutated team.
---
Got high level enemies couple of scorchbeasts earth mover went as planned got the first two defense events in had about a dozen players involved then someone else launched at fissure prime so we all went there and killed her, earth mover was over before I got back and the surrounding area didn't provide much incentive to stay my mutations were hyperactive and I was able to broadcast myself flying to white springs from the very top of the rockhound I didn't touch the ground till I got to the golf course carpark lol
---
I was just tired and that was the first thing that came to my crazy brain. 
---
No money needed friend. What I did was took on the queen by myself. I'm want to see it you can do it with under 8 people because when I did the quest it said optional have at least people
---
What I learned about this game is, it needs its time, never spam any button, that only makes things worse, especially those things which do something with your inventory (give, take or modify your items/equipment) inventory system is really a problem in bethesda fallout games. Always wait 2-3 seconds before using anything again, be it drinks, chems, foods, world objects or whatever... Rather be safe then sorry...
---
Just the question what Game VaultTec plays with us... ;)
---
True maybe give those types of cloths the ability to become bullet resistant. That way you can wear that around areas you think you can handle then go power armour when something big arrives.
---
At the moment I am using the excavator armour but only for the plus on carry weight. Don't know if I can bring myself to leave it but once I get weight perks for heavy guns and exsplosives I might start looking for better power armour for the big encounters.
---
This makes the game is literally unplayable /s.
---
The issue is exactly that, their AI is of those dragons and this is a whole new fckin game. There they breath flames, here they blur your screen with 999 explosions. There you had rend shout to force a landing. I hope you got a nice mic to make that shout work, cause I yelled a lot to no avail.
---
&gt; They do get praised because they stuck it out, and especially when you're a consumer and you go through 6 months, a year, 2 years, of patches there will be some patriotism. Yes they fucked up but more importantly they fixed their mistake, it's not praise worthy but it is redemption. And redemption is far better than what some companies do which is to ditch a project all-together which negatively impacts the fans it did attract. 
---
So when it comes to the next game they will decide that actually the brand will have a better image if the ship crap 12 months early and fix it in the public eye rather than shipping a finished product at the appropriate time. Because the gaming community doesn't seem to be aware that development and testing happens before release day and the 'Guy's it's only been 2 weeks' excuses start to fly left and right.
---
Unfortunately it was instant, in a way. My screen went black, still heard some noise but no keys responded. Didn't know if I was crashing or what, then it came back and I was disconnected. Nothing I could do...sigh
---
Impossible. But a nerf to both would be easy to implement, and is very likely to happen... Like 2nd bullet doing half damage and exlosive adding just aoe without the flat damage.
---
It turned into a meat pile under the exact spot she died. Next time find the pile. Lost half a dozen before I learned that.
---
Yeh if you keep running straight towards them that will happen.
---
With 3 or more you need to duck and weave and steafe as much as possible.
---
Screws - Enclave bunker military wing has about 10 fans, a few globe and a hot plate. Abandoned bog town, go to the top of the tallest building and jump down the elevator shaft, proceed to giggle like a small child at the amount of screw items around. Building next to Nation Isolated Radio Array has a few fans and typewriters. 
---
Lead - one GREAT place is the nuke silos. The weight lifting room in the first area has TONS of weights. However, they weigh a lot (duh). I have pack rat and a piece of armor rhat recues junk weight by 15% so the 160lb curlbar weighs only 16 lbs. This one can be a hassle as the nearest place to break them down is in between the reactor and first mainframe area (in one of the rooms as you make your way throuh the tunnels, I believe, don't quote me!) Also, nuke silos have quite a few fans and globes. 
---
Hope that helps, bud! 
---
Well, it's better to fix bugs BEFORE you add content. 
---
Otherwise you'll have bigger bugs harder to remove.
---
I understand that you'd rather have had those fixes weeks ago, but it's still a good thing that they bring it now.
---
Xbone, 37 here.
---
Sugar Grove for screws, Charleston fire dept for lead. Easiest way for lead though requires server hopping. Go to penitentiary and disarm the tin cans then server hop and repeat. There's about 7 can chimes I think and they each yeld 9 cans... there's a tinker bench inside to craft ammo from too if that's what it's for
---
smoothskin xD i grinned ear to ear. Haha
---
Another option for lead is if you have Excavator armor to go to Lucky Hole mine and hit all the lead deposits inside, I regularly walk out of there with 400+ lead ore.
---
Oh yeah, and if you nuke whitesprings (and aren't trolled by TSE wielders) they drop quite a few pocket watches and lockets. 
---
Or you know, the obvious solution to not having the proper tools is to just fuckin build them. They have the data, and access to it, they just need to develop the tools necessary to modify it. 
---
Very much appreciated! 
---
We did 2 queens yesterday. The only plans I got were ones I had already. I can build Ultracite arms and torso, about 3 times each. No legs and no plans for weapons. Such fun. 
---
Same. I will bavk away immediately if any lowbies come out, I just revert to hardened mass farming etc.
---
Not giving any lowbies free rides/ the DR scales too much vs. Their puny weapons 
---
Yes it does,  thanks for replying fast. 
---
TBH I have 😂
---
I've never gotten loot from a Queen run. I've crashed out and never been able to join back fast enough to get a chip damage on her every time. 
---
Don't really know how you prepare for ban/item removal, but okay.
---
Oh, and if you check the fo76 interactive map (not the ign one) there's a good camp location up to the west of the grafton zone. It has a lead deposit and a junk deposit right next to each other and you can place your camp to get both of them. Sorry for the spam :X
---
That's actually Skyrim
---
Can I be Marcus ?
---
Whoaaaa, that's cool! I'll keep this one in mind!
---
I play melee build :D :D  
---
Ill just wait till they land and then I basicly 5 hits them and they die.  
---
But its jsut boring when I have to either wait ages for them to land or if they decided not to land I just quit.  
---
This could be somehow improve so not every1 would be forced into heavy gun/rifle builds for the only endgame there is.  
---
GIVE US THE LOCATION OF THE SUGAR BOWL!
---
There were robots in the vault? *hick*
---
I thought it was her heart. 
---
I've asked this question a lot of times, what makes you say with such assurance they don't have the tools ?
---
All my knowledge in IT screams it's possible to track at least some of the items, and especially possible to monitor the behaviour needed to dupe items.
---
So who says they didn't develop those tools in the last 3 weeks ? 
---
Mabey have a separate serve or two so you make a entrance to a underground camp then teleport to a space were you can do what ever you want. 
---
Then over time your camp can come under attack from mole rats, mole miners or any other enemie that is more home to the ground.
---
That way if you really hate scorch beasts you can hide under ground but still have the threat of the underdround.
---
Well, nuking DMV could also spawn SM Behemoth, and forest, point pleasant and others are protected, cannot be nuked, and as far as I can tell it's better to keep it that way (honestly, some players may nuke forest, especially vault 76 just for fun not any reward and when there are new players... better to keep them safe from mayhem).
---
There are and I have seen more than one at a time at Harper's ferry. 
---
Whitespring Station and Charleston Station don't appear to be in the same pool.
---
You get caps for clearing all the enemies from a Workshop if you have the quest up (were running by) even if someone else did it.
---
It is possible to hand over the ownership to a teammate and have them run the event again to just have continuous defense events occurring be in a team with a friend not a random lol drop from the world after earth mover ends and teammate inherits the workshop and can run the event immediately you can rejoin your friend and enjoy 6 consecutive high level defense events more if you swap again and you have the resistance to stay longer or a monster stash of radaway lol
---
Yes like a cousin to the deathclaw that grew wings instead of razor sharp hands. 
---
Power armor + jet packs + chameleon, we would be dealing with predators without dreadlocks!
---
Holy S, somebody gave me one of those lettering plans yesterday! That's a ridiculous price. You'd think Bethesda was making a profit out of caps.  I did the Poseidon event once (quite a long event) and got as a reward a plan for a, get this, ASHTRAY. It's like a really mean person designed this game. 
---
What killed the dinosaurs? THE ICE AGE!
---
Working to buy something you know has been cheated in the game is not "working to get it fairly".
---
If I buy a car to a guy in the street for a tenth of it's price, I know it's shady.
---
Also, there's nothing in the game that REQUIRES a TSE's amount of damage, with the exception of the SBQ, aka "the ultimate boss of the game",  aka "the broken bullet sponge which should probably be fixed with an incoming patch too".
---
So removing that combo of affixes would not be an issue. 
---
As per the risk of alienating the few who duped/bought a duped , that's a lesser risk than alienating those who want to play fairly and have a balanced game. 
---
To hell with them, no one helped me. I'm sure as hell not helping anyone else, what am I? The f76 community welcoming party? Foh.
---
They ruin EVERY aspect of the nuke, white springs, the sbq, everything. I've even trolled people and launched the nukes at primes they've never seen a nuke at and flock to it and all over the mics you hear "what a waste there's nothing here."  The irony is I think that same exact goddamn statement when they show up to "help."
---
They're just trying to give you back your wallet.
---
I have one. Someone was trying to buy it from me the other day. I got it as a quest reward for joining the enclave. Was super surprised because it was the 5th char I did that quest on. Pic of me near grahm at whitespring station: [https://i.gyazo.com/thumb/1000/ff14cf1356fc5a7ebffe71fa4581ec90-png.jpg](https://i.gyazo.com/thumb/1000/ff14cf1356fc5a7ebffe71fa4581ec90-png.jpg)
---
Yeah, citation needed. 
---
Once you get "dense" armor mod, screech becomes a thing in the past. Keep your eyes open for the mods at watoga vendors.
---
TBH they should have wiped after the beta :/ 
---
Or if they tunneld 
---
I will never understand why every time someone makes a post about how annoying scorchbeasts are a bunch of people need to come in and brag about how easy they are with their all mutations TSE build.
---
No one gives a shit, and you're contributing nothing to the conversation. It's common knowledge that those weapons trivialize literally everything in the game. 
---
Good exp farm if you hog the defense event kills lmao bit hard when there is a dozen or so others with the same intention haha running earth mover multiple times has spawned well over 200 mobs to farm
---
I don't believe you, please add screenshot when you'll back from work. I've seen many .50 receivers - critical, hasty, calibrated, but not hardened.
---
Even a dragon gets tired after flying and breaking fire for 5 hours straight 
---
Take my upvote, Sir. You're absolutely right. And it was indeed my fault to hurry in farming that one spot before leaving for dinner.     
---
I'm from Germany and cigaretts need to have a very big warning label with disgusting pictures due to their health risks. I think treasure maps should have those too. With pictures of corrupted high level players :/
---
I fast Travel, kill him with explosive tse Dragon and log off.
---
Don't the gamma gun do a bit of energy or ballistic damage as well?
---
Thank you very much for this, I really appreciate it! I think that's my problem, I'm so used to just exploring/exploring for a quest in other FO games that in 76 I do the same thing and it doesn't execute as well as I'd like. 
---
But thanks for the information and suggestions, it makes a lot of sense and I appreciate it!
---
Pvp is fun and all, but when they’re using shit they duped or bought from a super it’s hardly fair or fun.
---
Bulldoze is an automated feature that removes small objects like grass, rocks, and some trees while you're building. If you see those disappearing while building, that's the Bulldoze feature working.
---
Yes cuz there is lots of cash everywhere
---
Yeah, absolutely. I know for sure it wasn't on Graham or the Responders Traveling Sentry Bot. I had it long before I had ever even ran into them.
---
Are you happy to see me or are you a duper?
---
There are a ton of mods for the double barrel, my only good legendary is a double barrel so I was scrapping them for a while.
---
And I built no static defenses wanted all exp for players I did put up a couple barricades though
---
Oh snap, that answers the question of if it exists or not, but how to get it consistently is the question. Thanks for the info bro, mind if i use this info in the post?
---
The almost 95% of the time i never get a mutation, i irradiate myself till the end of my life bar but i barely get one.
---
You have to be hungry and thirsty to get a mutation? 
---
I thought that be in a good state overall decreases the chance of getting a mutation, right?
---
The counter point is that three points in white knight is a much cheaper point investment and you don’t even need to use the card all the time. Just swap it in when you repair. 
---
Can you show the owl mask image? Can't find it anywhere
---
Alright, but that’s not really trolling and griefing. Like you’re not killing lowbies getting a bounty and letting your friend take it. You’re not wrecking someone’s base, I assume, just for the fun of it? Griefing sucks ass and is petty as fuck.
---
I'm currently at level 80 en I helped with killing a SBQ yesterday. I did not seem to do a lot of damage with the exception of vats critical shots from my Armor piercing dragon rifle.
---
I also kept some of the scorched mobs away from players that were more effective in damaging the SQB and it let my recharge my criticals.
---
No, steam will show the current online players numbers and reviews from players.
---
For 76 at current stage, no
---
Go for it. I've finished the other listed events and dailys dozens of times and never seen it again, so it's pretty much my most prized possession at this point.
---
I recommend having yourself set to offline while playing Fallout to avoid server hoppers from stalking you if it’s undeserved. 
---
Should look it up, but my opinion is that quick swapping perk cards is a gamebreaking element. If you can switch within a second, there's no meaning of having a deck at all. 
---
You're not supposed to quickly swap in your combat perks, when you get in combat for example. You should've prepared.
---
If you have herd mentality and egg head, do you still not have any loss of stats with class freak?
---
And give everyone 10000 atoms!
---
Didn't they also claim that all cosmetics and outfits were also available through just playing the game? I smell bullshit, Todd.
---
I’m with you!
---
The game had such a rocky start and some people still stuck with it, some only play because they have a high lvl character, alot of those would just leave. Its not like you need alot of min match or caps, since the game has no content where you need to push urself or be organized, you basicly shoot brainless helpless monsters that have higher hp than the others, as for a pvp they can just make a special template or rules basicly.
---
And if you’re online they’ll just keep joining your game to try and grief you. 
---
It is I played it one day and got disconnected five times FIVE. If that was not a sign of the game trying to tell us to leave it alone then I don't know what is lol. 
---
What I find funny is I posted a similar post yesterday about issues I was having and ideats to fix it. But I got bombarded by toxic Reddit users instead. 
---
There were how ever two or three Reddit uses who came too my aid but there is only so much abuse I can take before I say enough is enough 
---
Glad to see you are have a more positive response.
---
Try 49%..  On the bright side, I've adapted some very frugal design techniques.  :\
---
Nah, I get legendaries, but typically no loot above normal or the usual dreaded 4 L's Legendary Left Leather Leg....
---
33 ballistic, but thats still horrible
---
maybe
---
You do realise that it is impossible to tell between a duped item and legit one unless they're stacked? Does that mean all people trading at good prices are duping? Perhaps an entire wipe of everyond would be the best case scenario, as there are most likely countless weapon and armor mods, serums and everything else out there. This would be fine with me, if everyone had to start from scratch, but people would complain.
---
I agree with you about the SBQ, but that brings up another point. Bethesda have put in nerfs to player damage to both AI and players, and increased tankness to enemies, yet have never buffed or fixed any damage bar automatic receivers and TSE weapon bug. If they remove TSE which took so long to fix, do you have confidence they'll address the damage issues? I don't. 
---
Take her down to RAM RANCH.
---
"Today, we smashed around 150 bugs... mostly radroaches and ticks, but there was also one mothman." - Patch notes  
---
:D
---
I spent literally 12 hours straight farming mutations (correctly) trying to get marsupial. I ended up with talons, muscles, adrenal and speed demon. I then bought marsupial because I didn't want to mess up those 4. Bird bones is slightly interesting... I don't want to try for it though!
---
Hmm shame there is no mod to make the shots electrified
---
Hahaha that would certainly cause you to be creative
---
No Fun Allowed.
---
I'd be happy just seeing more Deathclaws instead of Scorchbeasts. 
---
? 
---
Thanos snap...50% of legendary weapons are gone.
---
I gotta level more alts.
---
yeah, but all gamma guns are useless outside of pvp, unlike the radium rifle
---
Great answers. I'd add a few things:  
---
- Shotguns are very common among Super Mutants, Scorched and Mole Miners, but maybe not at low level. OP, you don't really need to farm those guns, you'll have enough to unlock all mods at level 30-40 just by scraping your loot. You won't have the best perks for shotgun before that, don't worry too much and take your time to test and have fun with other weapons.  
---
- Speccing in Shotguns AND melee weapons isn't really viable. Too many useful perks for both (+weight reduction perks) in Strength.  
---
- I do carry 2 shotguns most of the time. An instigating combat shotgun for mid-distance, and a two-shot pump for close action. Mostly because you can't boost armor penetration on pump action, and it's super useful against armored targets. Also, the two-shot for close distance because it's not very reliable at longer range.  
---
- My [no-PA junky explo-shotgun tank build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3249f8&amp;d=sb2sd0su0so0sg2sw2sp0s01pc2eg1c72ib3ic4a72s72a41as2a12a00l71lt2lu2&amp;w=&amp;n=Explo-shotgunnner9).
---
they area annoying, for sure. 
---
for example, i cannot fathom why the hell it fires its sonic blast directly towards me with pinpoint precision, while i literally see her flying the other direction at the same time. shooting sonic out of her arse? how's that fair?
---
so the only way to kill her (without GG or explosive weapons, but even then it takes just more time)
---
a) use something that cripples (preferably Enforcer and shotgun) her wings, which makes her land. Only requirement for it is open ground (and use perk card and carry a shotgun).
---
b) this gives you 10-20 seconds to damage her while on the ground. Melee works well here. Might use explosives too.
---
i feel your anger. i was there too. now i'm not, now they're minor nuisance. just a few shots and they're history; and if they for some reason land (on their own will or by me), they've signed their own deathwish. they can come in packs, even level 80 ones. At least they give meat that give decent bonuses. they should be afraid of me, not vice versa.
---
Brilliant.
---
Can't you block them and prevent them from seeing you?
---
This should help with the bluescreens on ps4. Went from 5 in a day down to 1. 
---
Just curious - I'm 83, have fully modded X-01 and TSE's (shotgun, Handmade, Lever action) and can kill two 80 lvl SB simultaneously below 5 mins solo - can I contribute on SBQ fight or should I prepare more? Almost finished all quests, need to kill SBQ only to finish BoS/Enclave questlines and will be looking for a group to help me with it, but don't want to be a burden.
---
Thats what I thought the scorch-beast in the live action trailer was. Was a little surprised to find out they were bats.
---
I'm headed to bed, but if you have any more questions or want more screen shots, just reply to this or PM me or something.
---
Oh god
---
Huntersville to super-charge the FEV and make some ultra-super mutants.
---
Nuke around Flatwoods to try and force the alien ship to crash.
---
Well yeah because everyone uses power armour speaking of power armour I thought the t60 was made much later in fallout lore as a improved version of the t45 
---
You are completely able to pull your own weight, OP and people like them are just dicks.
---
Noted, it was a lag induced stall this time, presumably as a result of both loging in and the system trying to update the 9000rad/sec I was soaking up lol.  When I logged in again, Ole Healthy McBar was 80 red lol
---
Every time there is another CAMP thread like this I wish there was a subreddit dedicated to CAMP builds like there is for Fallout 4 with /r/falloutsettlements.
---
lol, good metaphor.  Yes, I agree with everything in your post.
---
Doesn't spoil and with the Perk fills up nicely. 
---
yeah i dislike Walking through the Whitespring golfclub and suddently **REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE**
---
No amount of ducking and weaving makes it less annoying. I'm not saying it was hard to deal with. I'm saying that it was genuinely unpleasant. Which is the opposite of what they should be going for in a game. It shouldn't be hard because it's hard to look at and broken.
---
A follow up note for anyone who doesn't know, if you go into your junk inventory, select the junk you want to keep an eye out for, then at the bottom menu on pip boy, select components and click on the junk item.
---
A magnifying glass will appear next to that type of junk and when you hover over stuff that breaks down in your travels, if the item you're hovering over contains that type of junk, a magnifying glass will appear. (Toy letter blocks for example break down into lead and wood; billiard balls contain plastic)
---
Watoga is a great place to collect screws and lead as well.
---
Good luck
---
When I go to White Springs nuke site, I always see guys with two-shot explosive weapons one- shot killing ghouls.  That just doesn't make sense to me. If you  have the most powerful weapons in the game, why not use them on the game's most powerful enemy?  I am a  heavy guns build and I now have a two- shot explosive mini-gun and a two shot Gatling Plasma.  The damage is so insane with those weapons that using them on mole miners and ghouls is just stupid. It makes no sense at all.   These are tools clearly made to take on the queen, so if you have them in your  arsenal, why use them for anything else? 
---
I would expect Calmex AND towels.
---
And VATS range becomes extremely short if you hold a Tesla Rifle. I think it is just meant to be a shotgun for Rifleman. 
---
Drop what you need to, sell the rest, keep a few.
---
If you guys are on ps4 i can craft you good weapons and armor for free
---
Yeah, well for you it is already too late, too bad I don't know how to fix such thing, maybe in future, maybe when they enable mod support... who knows.  
---
I am from czech republic, and there is a joke about man who walks in shop to buy a pack of cigarettes, looks at them, reads that smoking causes sterility, after a second he say to shopkeeper "Do you still have those with cancer? I would rather take those."
---
Also please report this guy, let's get him banned.
---
Yes, too bad there is not a button where you can drop all items.  (Armors, weapons, ect)
---
You’d have to know all the ones in their group, though. :)
---
Mr. messenger is dying to radiation in nuke zone. You sir, you are not right!
---
I swear i had one. But i had one i had it as a mod. Im not sure if i still had the gun since i got a two shot lever action and thts what ive been usin. Ill try and find the gun tht i was using b4 hopefully i didnt scrap it.
---
Dude. Read. 100k before modifiers, even if you've got double stacked 90% reduction on all loot, that's over 1000lbs. Which also happens to be where you start fat walking.  If you've had the patience to lug 100k of stuff around then i applaud that super human patience. 
---
Well we do kill the Scorch Beast Queen stone fucking dead so it isn't a surprise 200 years later there is no sign of them. Anyone seen a Quagga recently? 
---
can't get banned for glitches  
---
Oh I am, making the most of it. I actually am one of the people that truly like this game. But just don't understand how some people get off crusing in groups and picking off players slowly, untill they get the shits and fight back only to be killed in 1 single hit. Don't get me wrong I like a fair fight just not a cowards hit. 
---
It's an exploit.
---
I also have a hardened .50 receiver. Will post a screenshot in the morning.
---
Yeah its been said before but it would be great to see more boss type monsters. Most legendarys still go down in one or two hits and drop garbage, a boss would take a team effort and presumably drop better gear (ie higher chance of 3 star legendarys for example or rare mods)
---
Ive done a ton of nuked whitesprings and predominately get garbage, not to mention it is now dead boring after the 4th or 5th time 
---
Have one, and while it’s not as good as it was in FO4 (it was a bit too bright there, tbh), it’s still useful. When it works, which is maybe 70-80% of visible enemies.
---
Of course, they could just have a different friend view your profile and click join game, then join on their game, so... I’ll stick with offline. 
---
God forbid low level players using Whitesprings nukes to power level, how dare they shoot Ghouls that give 500XP per kill......spawns of Satan I tell ya! They should be grinding their ten minute daily events for a measly 200XP instead!
---
On a serious note, chill out. Low level players need the nuke zones as much as high level ones, better to help people out than push them aside.
---
Considering the physics of a hazmat suit (and also the in-game visuals), it would make more sense to wear armor over it instead of under it
---
So.. the 3 perk points in Tank Killer is only actually worth a 12.5% increase in damage output?  
---
There are such things as chameleon deathclaws (well at least in fo4, dunno in fo76) the prospect of such a creature would be terrifying to face.
---
It's not beyond the scope of doing either considering the enclave had experimented in taming or controlling deathclaws in fo3. Giving them armour and jet packs would just be a gradual progression on this experiment  
---
Well, I agree with the OP, that low lever players who doesn't contribute in the fight and only make SBQ stronger are leechers and shouldn't be doing this - they should play the game, do quests and not make other's life more difficult...
---
There are glitches and there is using them, which is called exploting, a bannable offense.
---
There is a refined .50 that does more damage than the hardened. 
---
I bought a two shot double barrel shotgun and im unsure if it shoots twice or one extra pellet. But it says it does some 450 damage and seems to do pretty well. Need to test it more today. I hope i didnt get ripped off because i paid almost 4k for it. Although caps are pretty worthless when you make 1k of them daily
---
I think what Bethesda are missing about this is if you carry enough items you're a walking server crasher and that is definitely not good for business. They really need to fix this before the wrong people start using it to crash servers on purpose....well even more than they do already.
---
I eat deathclaws to breakfast. Just killed an level 70+ chameleon deathclaw in three strikes.
---
What really would be terrible: Flying Mirelurk Queens. Imagine the terror her spitting acid and broodlings from the sky.
---
I think the idea is to teleport you out to a safe distance so the enemies in a "dungeon" don't tear you to shreds mid-loading screen.
---
Whitesprings just happens to be the odd case out where the dungeon isn't a threat, and the safe distance calculation isn't very good at actually getting you in a safe spot.
---
Sending you to the nearest train station would probably work better, though there some patches like the Mire where there aren't train stations so much.
---
Wtf are you even on about?
---
TIL If *you* go bounty hunting and get wrecked then the other people are griefing.
---
Funny, I usually get
---
1. Phone call to say "I'm sending you an email".
---
2. The email.
---
3. Phone call "did you get it".
---
but does it make more damage than hardened .308 or hardened .50?
---
I did read. I can farm out about 2k worth of junk at Whitesprings in 1-2 hours. I typically dont keep all of it, but what I do gets dumped into a mule character.
---
Didn't chest to obtain that outcome, though you may disagree with the practice.
---
Since when was there an atom exploit? I havent seen it mentioned anywhere
---
 Yeah I have heard about that. 
---
 I now have an another plan and plan to get one more. I intend to pay someone a plan to move my other plan to my crafter alt.
---
Same name in the game too, if you want to chat :) 
---
My favorite event is Breach and Clear. Gimme all them ores and sweet sweet Moleminer gear to scrap. At least the mining Glados is friendly. 
---
I thought killing a wanted player does not give you a bounty. So how did your friend lose caps over this?
---
Tagging because I want to see it.
---
Thanks.

I used 3/3 Licensed Plumber and got my first syringer upgrade.  It works.
---
"Why don't they" because you can't patch an album, you can't patch a piece of meat, a live concert, a building (although you can renovate that's different). It's a pretty exclusive thing with software in general that it can be patched post-release. Gamers have I reckon the highest standards of almost any market excluding high end and luxury products. Most loud gamers seem to be entitled and demanding. I am hoping this is a minority.  
---
They probably wont intentionally shit a broken mess in the future given the time they have, it's more efficient for the business to launch without a plethora of issues to fix. Again, misinterpretation of what I was saying.   
---
The issue is all the loud mouths make BOTH sides seem bad. The loud pricks who seem like they would literally hunt and kill people because they like and support a game, as well as the zealot paladins who will smite all those who dare speak against a game. Most normal people will either like or dislike a product and move on.
---
Me too, turns out it is junk.
---
It does 2 damage less than the hardened .308.  But the sound and ammo efficiency I feel makes up for it.
---
I just picked up a gatling gun earlier. I will have to try that out myself. Nice find. I'm sure it will get patched eventually but still.
---
Go i to your challenges and under one of the tabs if a "explore appalachia for x hours" and itll tell you how long you played for
---
Thanks for the input! 
---
You should yes. [spoiler] the Enclave is how you get nukes to call SBQueen in story[/spoiler] after they have specific events. 
---
I have a basement. You wanna see it? *smirk*
---
lmfao :D     
---
Yes I asked in my ticket why no tech savy employee has a look in tickets about corrupted inventories. I do totally understand that Bethesda can't replace every single lost item from probably millions of tickets. But for those users with corrupted inventories they totally should have a look into. I wouldn't even care if I lose all items but those I have equipped (they load in correctly on hit/use) as long as I can use my pipboy again.
---
It's baiting.  Kind of like what you just posted.
---
The most OP weapon in the game is an explosive shotgun. 2 hot doesn't do anything to it really. Better combinations are explosive armour peircing or pretty much anything. So this fixes nothing.
---
Also I have a 2 shot explosive wesern revolver that's the best pistol in the game and it's a price of crap beside almost any other top tier weapon.
---
Just to add:   
---
This is the sort of shit I see which makes me care less and less for those who are 'woke'. A typical thing will be like  
---
"Hey I like this game"  
---
"You know it has bugs right and it's shit"  
---
"yeah but I think it's good"  
---
"YOU ARE LITERALLY FUCKING THE ECONOMY YOU CAPATILIST BIGOT RAPIST YOU ARE THE ISSUE"  
---
Or the flipside  
---
"I like this game"  
---
"Fair, but you know it has issues right"  
---
"WHAT? ISSUES? YOU HAVE ISSUES YOU FAILED ABORTION DONT YOU DARE TALK ABOUT X LIKE THAT"
---
Just having bad luck mate.
---
Easy kill on a lowbie: +800 caps
---
Quick death to griefers/snipers: -150 caps
---
Overall profit: 650 caps +/-. 
---
I think I'll keep playing sheriff and dispense that sweet, sweet justice on wanted players.
---
Pip boy beacon and then free fast travel to that location could encourage some social playing maybe?
---
Armor pens buggy with energy weapons. Also high end ghouls are noticably energy damage resistant (I'm actually not sure there's anythng thats particularly vulnerable to energy really. Bugs and Mirelurks)
---
The question was 'why is it so common' not 'why is it abbreviated'.
---
I know that, that's why I was looking for hardened .50, which should, theoretically, do even more damage than hardened .308.
---
Bahahaha, you played 60$
---
I've had this exact experience trading everywhere I've ever been. In CS:GO trading, I've ended up holding on to the weirdest things and often talking to the people who were interested in buying them about what makes it special. In Warframe, I'd sometimes ask why people want a specific riven mod or one for a specific weapon, and get all kinds of stories like "this was my first prime" or "a friend gifted me this when I had no clue how the game worked" or even that it reminds them of something from their favorite movie or whatever. Hell, some guy who was buying plans off me was asking if I had any ghoul slayer guns or armor because he wanted to roleplay cleansing the wasteland. I hate when people try to classify items into objective terms. Objectively can talk about numbers, that's about it: This skin is more expensive than that one, this gun deals more damage than another. But not everybody wants to min max for the same thing.
---
Rant over
---
I was in that spot yesterday watching a nuke drop on Whitesprings!
---
We want this we've been asking since the game came out
---
ive found no differences other than what i outlined in the guide, but i found my best results with the dirty water rapid use, and card 1 of lead belly so it was doing +10 per click,
---
you should be able to very efficiently hit a mutation and repeat it as desired using this method,
---
the situation where i got almost dead and did not get a new mutation became more frequent at much higher mutation stacked (like having all of them but 2-4) for whatever reason, it is possible that you can roll one you already had and so you see no new mutation result when trying but it was so uncommon i did not call it out specifically in the main tips
---
I play with two friends in fo76. One is a total nervewreck who gets major anxiety if I fire my gun in the air or wander more than 25meters away from him. The other joined me when we both were lvl 5 at hunting a deathclaw even though we both knew we would fail at that. On the way we found a big hulk thingy(can't remember name) which we had high ground advantage over, only my friend fell down and got beat severely before we killed "hulkey". He just laughed when that happened. The difference between the two is experience.
---
What I did with Mr nervewreck was to engage in battles where we would both die. After awhile he got more comfortable with the idea of dying.
---
I suggest you make another character and just rush to a spot where you will likely die. You seem to need to get over your "need for control".
---
I've never seen one.  Wiki doesn't have one listed.  This is why I'm very interested to see these other's screenshots of it.
---
Yeah they need to make them scary, great idea
---
So then your main still abides by the rules of the game, your mule on the other hand might be affected if it has more than the limit. That's my point. 
---
A reasonable mule, holding favorite weapons, or storing bulked junk, totally fine. A dupe mule with 4 million pounds? Character is invalid. 
---
Further i doubt most mules are leveled much passed 15-20, meaning the biggest weight reducing perks are still level locked. Bear arms, traveling pharmacy, thru hiker, and pack rat 3 are all level locked at 42 (i think) 
---
My point being, while some power gamers might get hit with a dupe crackdown, they would be a very small minority (in fact a guy posted earlier tonight that by farming treasure maps he broke his legit character.) 
---
You are marked as aggro on their whole team. 
---
About those regenerating fusion cores, are you sure? I have some in my stash and for about 2 weeks (few dozen hours of actual gameplay) they are still same level asthey were when I placed them there... Though you can "regenerate" fusion cores when you relog game while inside power armor, when you get back in-game fusion core in power armor automatically gets to 100% (to remove it at that power level, when loaded back to world imediatelly exit PA without moving and replace this core for another with less than 100%, then you can repeat whole process to get bunch of stackable full powered cores).  
---
Also it is not necessary to move your camp, because sometimes you may have hard time to place it down again... Instead to freely repair any placed item in your camp, just store it and place it back, it will be also at 100% condition.
---
If they’re willing to go all the way to do that they got some major problems lmao. I’d just stay offline and come back another time, the fact he’d keep joining your games indicates he’s pretty triggered and take solace in the fact he’ll never get his loot back.
---
Husband and I are always looking for screws and lead .. or managing weight. It gets far too time consuming!!
---
EA is practically holding Bethesda's beer right now, considering how much fuckery Bethesda managed to pull out in 3 months... 
---
I've done SBQ a lot. Last I checked I've clocked almost 400 hours across multiple characters and I promise you this: SBQ is not hard. You were ready way before now unless your build was completely ridiculous.
---
Day before yesterday I was in a SBQ event with close to a full server. There were some high levels there, but AFAICT there were only three explosives players. There were a lot of lower levels, sub-50, at least 6. The melee players weren't geared, either, the Queen landed three times before she died. I was on a sub-50 level alt without great gear.
---
It still only took about 15 minutes.
---
The Queen scaling thing is extremely overstated on this sub, and people think you need a lot of gear, and frankly you don't. You just need a handful of people who know what they're doing, can aim, and if their ranged weapons aren't amazing, just melee her when she lands.
---
Well, seems like you never heard of duping or not have a comprehensive understanding.
---
Player can consume same Bobblehead and magazine over and over again to stack effects.
---
Over 5000 dmg is easy. 
---
I picked up a 2 shot explosive plasma Gatling gun from an event mob yesterday. If you takebthst away from me I'll cry 
---
Frank Horrigan but with no wall of turrets to cheese
---
"Marty! where we're going we dont need roads!"
---
This has been why I've avoided doing silos for weeks until I found a good enough time frame to run one. Can not even far an area without server crashing. What is worse is my buddy who is just starting 76 had to do the basic training quest like 4 times because that. 
---
I’ve found them quite frequently at the BOS Watoga vendor. I’ve even found them modded there.
---
dude, this + a speedy receiver makes the gatling gun OP
---
The fusion core one seems to have worked for me in the past, I  had about 5 100% fusion cores and 2 ones that were about 75-80% and when I heard about how they regenerate from someone I wanted to see if I was true, so I logged on and looked and I had 7 100% cores. Maybe it was just a bug, but it seems to be that they regenerated for me.
---
The printed ROF seems to have an extra 0. It is about 1/10 the published ROF.
---
😂
---
My main had 250 nukas until I started to use them. Safe to say there might be people with 1500 legit nukas.
---
My first successful solo fight against a scorchbeast was 3 at the same time. So much fun! LOL
---
&gt; It's a pretty exclusive thing with software in general that it can be patched post-release.
---
And yet most other SaaS outfits are expected to deliver working and high-quality systems at release. Not run beta testing on their consumer base. Imagine if the next version of Windows shipped live with the bugs of Fallout 76. I mean they could, right? And since every industry would if they could then why don't they? And how come other games hit the market in a far more stable condition when they could have released 6 months earlier as a hot mess and been thanked for their time and effort anyway?
---
You'll want at least a 6 Intelligence. Armorer and Fix It Good both go to three ranks and you'll want to use both at the same time. 
---
You'll want even more if you rank Gunsmith to 5 as Weapon Artisan is awesome.
---
Yeah you can eat a dick.
---
'That's not fair you tricked me into shooting you'.
---
I think most games have life spans of more than 2 months... So no, not really.
---
Stick a dense mod on your armour and the sonic attacks just tickle.   
---
Then the only issue is the acid dump and the scorched adds :D 
---
what, robots take no rad damage though, unless they have really high rad resist and the nike zone is too much for poor mr messanger
---
I think
---
You don't need Bloodied melee or TSE to kill Scorchbeast or two quickly. It takes less than 5 seconds with my Two Shot 50 Cal to kill one, and with non-legendary Gatling Plasma they took 10 seconds max. No stimpaks needed.
---
Could do around 60 percent more damage but looks good for what she wants
---
Yeah I swear the turrets actually did stuff in Fo4, I didn't have to worry 
---
"Almost 400 hours." Get a life dickhead.
---
Some item types are definitely more 'heavy' than others. Items that you can pull out in a stack that don't have a USE action, such as ammo, take the least load. Items that you can't pull out of a stack and have a USE action, such as maps, have the most load. Legendary items and equipment in general have very high loads. A 300 stack of weapons breaks you, a few thousand maps would break you, and probably 5 million missiles would break you.
---
You have to treat 60,000 rounds like you would treat 100 maps or so. Probably actually less maps, but you get the point.
---
I don’t go bounty hunting, lol...so? 
---
I was on a team with a friend who /does/. 
---
If you give me 100 caps I'll take it off your hands
---
You can nuke the northwest part of the forest. 
---
In the strings of the game they are already added, so probably they are gonna add it in the future.
---
I bet you would
---
If you are taking about the rifleman perks then yes but she can put more cards in to them when she feels like it.
---
I was gonna ask if you were really just a "little over," or seriously over encumbered, since there's 2 states of it.
---
Sounds like you're seriously encumbered, (barely move at all), even though you say you're only slightly OC (Can't Sprint).
---
Saying that, I don't know any fixes sorry.
---
It would be cool if there were Pre-War vending machines that used cash. If not the existing ones, than maybe a variant. 
---
We would but we're too busy weighing our junk.
---
Actually it feels incredibly easy to outrun them, either they give up and fly away or they aggro another enemy that has spawned.  The worst is when you're unintentionally kiting and get them really low on HP then they fucking fly away and you lose the kill.
---
Diabolical.
---
Plus bloody mess and tenderizer
---
Holy hell, why is this a thing, it's amazing. I have a speedy receiver gatling gun with +25% faster fire rate legendary effect and just tested this. With my incredibly scientific method of shooting for about ten seconds, I counted 32 regularly and 39 with martial artist. 
---
oh yeah, this is actually really common on xbox servers, its both funny and annoying but you get used to it :)
---
Them too they can be added latervthank you for the comment
---
^^^
---
Exactly why I’m offline now, because these kids get triggered if you kill them or if you pick up any dropped paper bag, then chase you around servers and etc. 
---
I’ve seen a lot of people with thousands of bulk junk on them lose their shit and chase players, but a team chasing one player because they took your bounty when you’re griefing a camp is pretty absurd to me.
---
#1 complaint about auto scrapping in FO4 is pre-war money needed for other vending mods.
---
I love it when ppl get creative with their camps, way too many cubes out there 
---
Solid advice, thanks! Definitely think I'll focus on my CAMP and Power Armour (especially since I accidentally scrapped the chassis with the ultracite armour you get for finishing the Brotherhood quests :|)
---
I really hope the bug fixes address my stability issues... For me crashes to desktop problems seemed to go way up since the last patch.
---
It's missing Uranium Fever. That's where I got my handmade plan.
---
Also...
---
You know if they don’t have a lot of caps (I.e. 800 caps) then you don’t get it. You get what they have, that’s it. Then their teammates can still shoot you and do full damage, getting your caps based on level. 
---
Mine as well. For me it's taking up 1%. Better than 20+% I guess, but annoying. I can't scrap or place it.
---
armor piercing
---
yeah. I customarily log out at my camp, but didn't this time, because it was whitespring. I forgot it's a popular nuclear test site
---
I like that you have a TSE handmade but struggle with Whitepsring nuke zones with lowbies around.
---
A+ comment history, would chuckle again.
---
I feel the same way, though I take very little damage from the sonic attacks I can't imagine how melee builds must feel as SBs hardly ever land, and their large health pool means it's a chore to kill them when you can just kite them over a random location and run off anyway
---
on the other hand they do a superb job of razing player bases to the foundations without incurring me a bounty!
---
You probably encountered a partial respawn. If you go there too frequently and no other players passed by there recently, you are less likely to get legendary spawn. I was alone there yesterday and it took 1 hour for a full respawn. Other times, when a player who has not been there for a longer time enters, you can get a full respawn within 15 minutes.
---
Why not share the details? 
---
🤔
---
I get the /s, but the problem is the Means, not the End. 
---
Doesn't matter what gets duped, it's the duping that's the issue.
---
That's great if you'd base isn't built to the terrain. Just had a dude show up at my camp. I opened the door to my extractor and showed him around. He dropped me some soup and I gave him some dog food. He starts to melee me while I'm in my pipboy and some how kills himself before I can retaliate. I leave his junk but he comes back and blows up my walls and extractor before I can run downstairs. 
---
The old ways are not always the best ways. Layering some armor OVER a hazmat seems plausible.
---
Progress is a forward march comrade !
---
I manufactured and scrapped a LOT of automatic grenade launchers after getting the one or two barrel mods which exist, hoping for more, before conceding that there didn't appear to be any additional options there. 
---
If you think about it, the fix for this issue &amp; duplication-exploits is quite obvious:      
---
###Do not allow stacks of weapons &amp; armors and add a maximum of item IDs for both categories       
---
For trades similar IDs needs to be excluded. Also those IDs should get excluded from your loot pool. This only affects weapons &amp; armors of course. Also you still can get 20 10mm pistols with different conditions &amp; mods.
---
Before you reach max Item IDs in a category you'll get a warning and a advise to scrap or drop items.      
---
All other item categories are capped by design but may could have a max item category as well. Just for the sake of stability.
---
I'd happily give up an inventory of junk if I knew the other guy was going to go crying to Reddit.
---
Supposedly its an engine limitation; or so I've read.  However, plenty of other MMOs have GM's that can pop in and do anything they want to your account and inventory so there's no reason this game shouldn't either.
---
Both! I want this game to be tough. It's supposed to be survival ('softcore survival' I suppose) but I'm so bloody comfortable it's ridiculous.
---
Or give us an area of the map that's much harder I suppose. Maybe vaults will be tougher and all close quarters survival raids. That would be good. Tbh TSE weapons are ruining the game though.
---
You posted a paragraph demonstrating nothing but your own spiteful attitude, and now you're spitting your dummy out like a petulant child. Niiice.
---
Has anyone tried nuking Harpers Ferry?  I found a bunch of giant naked Supermutant Warlords there, they looked like original mutants from the labs, they were half again the size of normal mutants and only had loincloths on.  I did not have time for pics as there were 4 of these guys and maybe a dozen normals.  Between them and the level 62 ferals that spawn in the trainyard, I think it might be a worthwhile nuke to try.  alas, I am not nuke-worthy yet.  I have had an entire set of codes too, so sad.
---
I'm in a server with a couple high levels, was going to nuke the prime fissure. Done a few events and some people have been assholes with the TSE blasting every legendary they see so I decided not to do whitesprings on this server. 
---
Psn Kiliox
---
I'll send a friend request.
---
With all these places writing articles about random stupid shit they hate about fallout 76 you think one of them would want to write about a real problem like this.
---
Sadly Radium Rifles and other radiation based weapons are practically useless outside of pvp, which in of itself is already flawed :-\\
---
you can learn the recipe for the muzzle brake and the drum mag (both equipped by default anyway) and the only thing you CAN make for it is the prime reciever
---
Wait a minute, is this really a thing!?
---
Who said I struggle with white spring? I said I'm tired of low levels in the SHE. You know what happens when you get arrogant on a Reddit post? You show how small your dick is.
---
Oooh and all the different mothmen too!
---
The prewar money in fo4 was weightless and i used to use it as an easy second currency. Instead of buying stuff for caps, i used that instead. Shame that has gone now, as has the weightless ammo.
---
Something that would go a LONG way towards making them much more satisfying to fight is if when you cripple their wings instead of slowly trying to find a place to land they just plummet to the ground Monster Hunter style. 
---
I do not know much about system they use to save character information on their servers, though I think they don't do anything like this to protect themselves, some players may try to abuse this system, they may say support that they lost this and that item and then they can get it back... As far as I can tell there is no way for support to say which item was gained honestly, which was gained by duping or which item you lost by accident or bug.  
---
Also when I used some save game editors on other single-player games, they worked to add items, change characters and such, but sometimes corrupted whole game... My assumption is, they don't have tools to edit save files and they won't do them just because this...  
---
To tell that simply, it's single player game masked as multi-player. Though I wish you good luck and may the wasteland be kind to you.
---
-I like the bounty-hunting and 'wanted' thing. It's fair, fun and limits the number of Griefers. It also gives us a chance to play hero, which is something a bit lacking otherwise. 
---
-Please pump up the stash quickly. It's really cramping my enjoyment. 
---
-Plans. The decent ones are too hard to find. 
---
I like the idea of more unique enemies and even item drops from enemies that spawn only in certain areas when nuked. It would make nuking new areas worth exploring and provide more reasons to nuke places other than the Fissure prime or Whitespring Resort.
---
I don't disagree with you, I'm just doubting it will change.
---
Because ESO is like a real online MMO. Fallout 76 is a cobbled together shit show. Seems pretty obvious they gave up on the game in general before it even released.
---
Find a junk heap and build your base next to it, then go claim three workshop at grafton steel yard. There's a lead node and the main machine is a steel scrapper. 
---
If you really want screws and other scrap, Charleston Landfill is the absolute best place to take control of. 
---
Does the game factor in the strong back perk when determining that? Because I been at least able to carry over 300 without power armor before and this didnt happen. But now as soon as it reaches 245/245 anything over that makes me go snail pace. Very annoying because now I am forced to be in power armor 24/7 or risk this problem popping up in a heated moment  after looting in a fight.
---
Because im not a millennial and im an old school gamer :D
---
Same problem with the water purifier :/
---
Devious... I like.
---
Interesting, first time I hear about this... I'll have to look into this, thanks
---
This what I would do. Yours if good to though (because TSE Shotguns are op af) https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f319f58&amp;d=sd2su2sb2so2sp2pc2e60ck0ce0ev0ib4i11ic4s72l71lt2lu2as1ih2cf2cd1&amp;w=&amp;n=Shotgun%20PA
---
The servers are constantly crashing without OPs help lol.
---
Why should they spend the time &amp; money to make mods when they can just sell the ones the players make for them?
---
But Blizzard is owned by Activision
---
I've been wanting this for a while. I'd probably have one for combat/exploring, one of crafting weapons/armor/camp, a utility one for lockpicking/hacking/trading, and maybe another for teams.
---
Wut. Whitesprings has literally endless waves of ferals every time I go there. Why in gods name would the spawn rate need to be higher? 
---
I was in Watoga today and the robots shot at me as normal.  I go about and have a few adventures, come back to the vendor and kill a couple on the way in.  I go to leave and there is a protectron outside saying "Warning, dangerous fugitive is on the lose, do not attempt to capture' or something to that effect.  I walk out weapon raised, ready to knock him out when I see an assaultron, so I start to leg it, because not today, I quickly realized it is not pursuing me, neither are the protectrons.  I go up and dance about in front of them, they say hello ma'am.  I see them shooting another player.  so I ran in front of the robot shooting.  I was effectively a human shield, it stopped shooting.  I have no idea what has happened, but I cannot attack passive robots, even if thier indicators are red, so we are at a truce for now.
---
An easy mod, just wait 9 months ...
---
the game is treasure, truly loving it after my non participation in the post classic fallouts. 
---
It existed in FO4 too and was equally dumb then
---
People are dropping on those 2 spots not because they are interesting, but because of the rewards. Either for the plans the SBQ or the even may drop or the legendaries at the Golf Club.
---
No one thinks it wouldn't be intersting to nuke something else, I'd say. But at the other players you don't have a chance to get that plan you wanted or the special weapong you're looking for. 
---
Basically, Bethesda isn’t doing enough to stop people from duplicating items. The duplication works by crashing the server, and it usually crashes for everyone too. So, legitmatie players who’re having fun and doing stuff get kicked from the server while these dupers are destroying the game just for easy money. 
---
&gt;And since every industry would if they could then why don't they? 
---
I gave you a reason but honestly I have to resort to you thinking you're fucking dense. Christ on a bike.  
---
Windows 10 actually shipped with some god aweful issues but they got fixed. And companies want to avoid a complete mess for the most part, 76 is just one example when perhaps it would have been better to wait.  
---
Beta testing on consumers or even just a large audience like a free beta is a GREAT IDEA. That said a release shouldn't be beta or alpha quality. I think Bethesda waited too long for the BETA for 76 but the idea of testing on a large scale is an excellent idea and practice that allows develops to save money while expanding their search for bugs. 
---
Sadly not much. It's definitely not the worst weapon out there, but it's among the least popular. It's rare, has a high level cap, deals radiation damage that's close to useless, and is weaker than a combat rifle
---
It's random when any enemy spawns that it may be legendary. The chance is affected by some factors (nuke, level etc) but it's essentially random.
---
I always thought vending machines have been repurposed by the responders after the bombs. I mean, they give ammunitions and medical care, not exactly the kind of things you'll find in a pre-war world. 
---
So you're telling me there are people trying to use that way for duping, when mutliple people are stating it doesnt even affect their game, when there are way easier and more reliable methods to dupe?
---
Well thats dumb. However - let's hope both ends with tomorrows patch.
---
I am glad most gamers are not game devs.
---
there is nothing special thats why.
---
Well, can we agree on that any kind of reasonable game economy is long gone?
---
Once they fix duping, which they will. The the 4 and 5 star weapons come out and that makes all the duped 3 star stuff obsolete, it's almost like they knew it would happen...
---
Discords or the selling reddit are good places 
---
Yeah, me too hate those ppl. Where is my commie whacker??
---
honestly they could just fix the crashing servers and i would be 95% satisfied 
---
It’s all the same. 
---
Scorched slayer mods don’t work which don’t help. I made a hunting rifle into a scorched killer hunting rifle, and the gun only fired blanks, so i broke it down, made another one - same bug.
---
What’s the point seriously, 2 months down the line, and basic things still don’t work.
---
Perhaps, but wiping hundreds of hours of playtime ain't the answer.
---
I'd shelve this game for the first and last time... 
---
What about the thousands of items that people have stacked in their inventories to sell for unlimited caps?
---
Oh thanks. So it turns out I'm at exactly 100hr (rounded however the game rounds). Damn I'm good at estimating things.
---
I get what you're saying... It would be really nice, but it would kind of make your loadout choices less significant if you could switch on a whim. There should be some kind of balance implemented. Maybe either full loadout swaps need to be on a cool down, can only be done outside of combat like fast travel is ( that option would address switching loadouts between weapon specialization perks during battle), or could only be done in camp like others suggested. Also maybe not have loadout switching binded to a key - require the player to go to the perks screen to swap.
---
Boy, that escalated quick. 
---
I'm not really seeing in any of this how it aligns with 'Gamers have high standards' because based on what you have said no one should accept the standard of Fallout 76, released early, 'beta' tested via release, bug riddled mess. And yet here we are, with an entire community of 'please Sir may I have another'
---
Jokes on them.  I don't have any caps either.
---
Well, I did already, it's the same like with gta5 online, what is the point to play honestly when there are guys with 8000 damage and million caps?
---
You’ve seen the amount of duped stuff?
---
For what benefit, caps are pretty much pointless above certain levels....no need for more than a few thousand.  
---
Tangara Town?
---
Worst clickbait ever.  
---
Headline: Interesting new Nuke sites.  
---
Article: I found it and you didn't.
---
appears the image of the vault boy with green eyes, or a kind of... but not the image of the mutation (with the third arm), maybe it's because i continue taking the same mutation that i already own (Scaly Skin)?
---
I did, have you? Single person can have 100k bobble heads and other things.
---
This guy gets it
---
Wipe all stacks of identical weapons. It's a start..
---
You don't get it, people are duping bobble heads for damage, which stacks, so they have 10 k damage and oneshot scorch beast queen..or you
---
I like the idea of scorchbeast, it gives us a new end game creature when the other games didn’t really do that as much. That being said scorchbeasts annoy me because they take forever to land. 
---
I hope they are adding missing heavy leather armor vault-tec paint skin. Whatever else is just good, game is fun. First game after years that i would compare to how great World of warcraft was.
---
It's not about the weapons, it's about thousands of duped items for selling and stacking damage to one shot scorch beast
---
I've asked this before, and I seriously want to know: How do people think a couple additional effects, however cool, are going to make weapons capable of thousands of points of AoE/melee damage obsolete? Plenty of people don't even bother upgrading to max level on many current weapons because the damage possible with the right effects is enormous regardless of being level 15 or 50. Even if they nerf the heck out of explosive (which people focus on for good reasons), we're still talking about bloodied, instigating, two-shot, etc. which, along with mutations, chems, and perks, make doing tons of damage a breeze.
---
Maybe they'll just unplug us from the VSS.
---
Hell yeah long live the enclave 
---
Lol, I’d rather keep the few caps I have; I need to buy ballistic fiber for 6x the value 
---
Easy enough to find another server. Maybe I'm just lucky but I haven't had an issue with people like that 
---
The game should also make clear what is dropped and what's from a fallen player. Sometimes it may be obvious if you witness the person dying or by the contents, but the dropped items are in a paper bag just like if someone dropped the items manually.
---
You're getting mistaken by a loud minority. When I brought up educated consumers it was in the context of how people didn't understand what a game engine really is or how it works you just took it out of context so I'll just assume that you're that shallow and miserable you need to do that.  
---
Gamers are the people who will complain because of one disconnect at times, or one game breaking issue that was a one off or once in a blue-moon thing. They will voice their complains and that isn't a bad thing at all. It's not a negative attribute but gamers are demanding which at time does press unrealistic expectation. With that said I don't think it should be stopped but rather there should be a line of "hey its' ok until you literally review bomb because you have nothing better to do (ie reviewing without player or just blindly or with multiple accounts)
---
You're 100% right there. Economy however is flawed, as long as caps are the currency. No "casual" gamer will be able to buy good weapons for caps. If they are even offered for caps.
---
So despite having 150+ hours in and completed everything I wanted and am geared for any futurure content - i'd personally totally restart on fresh and fixed servers.
---
However that may not be the way for everyone, so ofc just wiping can't be a proper solution.
---
With a bounty?
---
I agree. I would use some of my Atom Shop credits I've earned in the game for a wallpaper, even if it were plain white wall. It's nice we can have nice flooring now, but the walls and ceilings still look poor most of the time.
---
I'm willing to bet you were testing it on ghouls who heal from radiation damage, hence being ghouls.
---
Wow, sweet camp.
---
I do like the bricks, can't wait to find the plans for them, do you remember where you picked those plans up? 
---
Hey I am curious, how does furious work with shotguns? Do you get a + damage increase each pellet, or just each time you fire?   
---
(also shotguns are not rifles, so they don't get the bonus)
---
There is at least one in a house in Harper’s Ferry. I see it quite a bit when clearing rooms.
---
Becouse it is not PvP game but co-op. You dont need to care about other players. You are just jealous, thats why you want wipe. No i dont dupe, and yes i have probably duped TSE shotgun and i ended up not using it, becouse stabing shit is way funnier and i can oneshot thing even with non-legendary pickaxe i fond somewhere on ground. There is only one thing you can't really one shot. Scorchbeast Queen. And there is not much reason to want to oneshot her. If you have problem with dupers, dont trade with them and stop suggesting shit like wiping all us legit players progress.
---
I wish they would just ban whole accounts with all Bethesda games of everyone who does this.
---
You can be anyone you want baybeh 
---
1. People are contributing to the convo by saying scorched beasts aren't that hard when you're a high level.
---
2. I don't see why you "*never understand*" why people are pointing out that multiple scorched beasts are absolutely possible to battle (a long battle!). It's not bragging: it's a counter argument. That's how you avoid an echo chamber / circlejerk. Different people have different opinions. I'm in the minority in this sub with some of my opinions on the game. That's fine but I still sometimes voice them.
---
3. I actually agree with people that say scorched beasts aren't that bad. I've fought at 3 on multiple occasions and it's the only damn challenging thing in the game other than the very rare deathclaw. Virtually the only time I die is multiple SBs or some arsehole player killing me in a nuke zone with their TSE .50 cal because they are bored.
---
4. Only optimal builds can fight them? My character has 15 intelligence and 12 luck. They aren't even built for fighting anything.
---
I only have 1 mutation because I've not bothered to look into them all yet and work out builds.
---
I only have 1 TSE gun. It's in the stash because frankly *they* are broken and spoil the game.
---
I also disagree with OP and I'm not going to be silent because you don't like people disagreeing. Every day we have multiple posts from people saying scorched beats are 'broken' but I disagree. Yes, they do that attacking swoop thing while you are in buildings. Yes, they spam the sonic boom attack and I have to look away to orientate. Yes, they take a stupid amount of damage. Yes, they don't land if you're somewhere without enough space to land. Yes, they are horrible to fight and I bloody love it.
---
The vendor in Harpers Ferry had the bricks if I remember right.
---
Why the hell not
---
I'm sorry, but wiping all accounts for a few dupers is and will be the death knell of this game and prolly the franchise/company. If they cant figure out how to fix what they built, then just like pro sports, its time to start trimming the fat and canning folks that contribute to the fuckery. Bring in new minds with fresh ideas or Outer Worlds/fallout nvp2 will be... I already said to much.
---
Nuking Mama Dolce should awake gigantic commie Liberator Prime with red paintings.
---
This! 
---
This reminds me of a post where someone shot at the mothman because it was sitting on top of a building. Not knowing what it was he shot at it and got a jumpscare as it teleported right into his face :D 
---
By selling the shit for real money and buying a new game, it cost only 30$
---
U right the whole game will be trendy dances and skins for sale cuz fuck all "game development is so hard" I can see it now. Whats new and cool? Lets do that 😒
---
any patch notes?
---
Cool base
---
Perhaps, but then they have to fix the glitched inventories, so there can't be people with hundreds of thousands of items in a single stash
---
Awsome thanks for the info, I'm logging on tonight so I'll go and check it out and see if the plans are there.
---
I haven't decided where I want my camp to have its final resting spot but I do like what you have done with yours especially the pool inside.
---
I guess that took a while to do? 
---
yeah  thats the type of shit we need to make the game more alive
---
My camp in the lower right of Whitesprings near the Snake icon on the map. I've gotten attacked by Mothmen (usually Stalking iirc) there a few times, and a Flatwoods Monster once, often soon after fast-traveling back. I think having turrents helped as they attacked them before they would flee/teleport away.
---
I often see the plan at Watoga too 
---
Just make a super behemoth with a minigun and a missile launcher, with a stealthboy, super speed. And call him the patriarch or something.
---
Switching from LAN to Wifi only affects what happens between your PC and your router. 
---
So if WiFi magically makes it work, there was nothing wrong with the connection from your house to Bethesda's servers. If this is the case, the issue lies with your PC configuration and how it communicates with your router. So either faulty router, cable, wireless card or PC settings.
---
I sort of just stumbled on it by accident... I was trying to rotate the foundation so the wood panels lined up, and removed it by mistake and thought... "This is actually pretty cool"
---
This camp didnt take long to build, I get sick of them and build a lot so I've gotten pretty clutch at it.
---
Why are my car tires rubber while the wheel is metal?! FFS GOD
---
thanks!
---
You got a mic and discord? If so Add Vextroa. I do nukes fair often and am always happy 2 meet new people 
---
Yeah the brotherhood vendor in watoga has it too.
---
Amazing that you wrote that wall of text without bothering to read what I wrote. Or if you did, completely ignored what it said.
---
TSE is broken. Full stop. People coming to these posts and talking about how easy scorchbeasts are to kill WITH THEIR TSE are stupid and pointless.
---
Cool, I'll check both places out, thanks 
---
Draw me like this me of your French scorch beasts!!
---
I just wanted to point out that your item/plan location list has an entry by someone that says he got an X-01 Torso from a squirrel by Vault 76...
---
I use it because you make 180 50 cal rounds at a time. I have a lot of ammo for my sniper rifle &gt;.&gt;
---
That was this Tuesday evening (European time)? Then I joined you with my jumpy shotgunner raider, and yes I was a bit boring. Still managed to craft some flux.
---
and unlike the fallout 4 version you cant wear masks/bandana's with it.    
---
which is odd that they would actively make that change... 
---
&gt; When I brought up educated consumers it was in the context of how people didn't understand what a game engine really is or how it works you just took it out of context so I'll just assume that you're that shallow and miserable you need to do that.
---
Do they need to understand how a game engine works to make the argument 'Other development houses release higher quality products so this is clearly a problem that needs fixing'? It's a very simple case of 'Do it properly and fix it'. And if you can't, perhaps get out of the way and let the more competent development studios get in on that AAA title scene.
---
&gt;or one game breaking issue that was a one off or once in a blue-moon thing.
---
'Customer complains about Sev 1 Issue'.
---
&gt;It's not a negative attribute but gamers are demanding which at time does press unrealistic expectation.
---
The unrealistic expectation for something to work? If you choose, as a company, to operate in the SaaS world under the 'release now, patch later' mantra then you'd better be sure you have the team in place to do just that. You don't release then go on holiday. You don't joke and make cute comments about how historically buggy your games are then release another buggy game. You don't lag aeons behind the competition on release quality.
---
Yes, the whole team will be aggressive and able to do full damage to you. It’s a bait move. 
---
Most of the time when I log on my camp isn't there and can move it for free, I just haven't decide to build a proper camp yet.
---
I've gone for the one foundation at the bottom with some stars that lead up to the bigger platforms 
---
fixes=good, many fixes=lotsa good
---
Nice!  Let's get this all out on the Tray.
---
Dont tell my parents...
---
There have been other posts similar to this here and other places. 
---
Are you sure everyone was participating? It seems there are people who show up for the reward (scaling her up) but not working to complete the event. Some expecting duped TSEs to carry the day.
---
Additionally, it only takes a few people on ground duty but that becomes more important for some when they are farming masses and fluid in your SBQ then finishing the event. 
---
It may indeed be an issue of scaling but it helps to also look at other issues. 
---
I don’t like mutations, but I like jetpack. Stompin’ on ants, suckin’ their soul
---
No surprise. Its a game that helps promote an support an profits off rapes an rape culture victim blaming exploitation extortion coercion an tampering with an bribing etc witnesses of rapes etc . oh and slandering+ murdering black ppl
---
It's just north of top of the world somewhere 
---
Turrets are useless. Can't really have more than 1 if you want to build a camp with extensive deco. Also, he is freed up from needing walls, roofs and not much flooring since it's mostly based on the existing structure.. so that probably helps with the budget.
---
This is an excellent build. Love the idea of it kinda being a club for marsupials only.
---
If you don't know about the gyms, there's a few around with barbell/dumbbell and loose weights . There's one at the hotel in Flatwood and in the Charleston Fire Department for example and I think the highschools and university. You get about 80 per room so you can quickly get a few hundred if you visit a few or server hop one spot.
---
But without duping the items remain rare and desirable, people will not want to sell them. The player vending is for stuff you don't need really, lower level stuff others benefit from, it will all work out in the end....
---
Definitely easier to relocate that way. Its also hard to find a wide space for building much foundation. Thats another reason lakes are cool as you have a big flat plane.
---
Couldn't agree more. I'm level 55 and I still haven't killed one yet that isn't for a quest, or with the help of a SAM, and even if I did the rewards aren't really worth it. The only reason that I struggle less running from them now is that I got the mutation that makes you run faster.
---
Would you be so kind to share your knowledge with us? Looks amazing. 
---
Scotchbeast farts are deadly accurate.
---
And I always wondered if I can meet lvl 1 legendary eyebot.... Hope he gave you a fight. :D :D
---
So it’s on the mountain and close to the highway? I’ll check it now, thx~
---
Of course it doesn't  make sense and there will alway be people playing like that which ruins it. A lot of the time you just find good random people at the whitesprings working together who just want to play the game but there will always be the couple of dudes that are just exploding everything with over the top weapons.
---
 I am a heavy gun build with explosive weapons as well but I am not running around the whitesprings like that. And I am not saying I dont do queens fights, they are still fun but to do but that doesn't mean you cant have fun at other places. You equip you equipment to suit the situation, at white springs in use melee and when I do the queen fights the heavy guns perks come out.
---
Same reason why i dont pull out a two shot fatman everytime I see a mole rat. Yes I can kill it in one shot but it is way over the top and totally pointless.
---
A few years ago I'd say no, but honestly, how cool would that be? A Deathclaw that can fly, no OP sonic attacks or anything, just a Deathclaw that's hard to get away from because as soon as you run, it takes off and flies after you. Bethesdaplz
---
I understand that, but if something is broken it's better to remove it, isn't it? 
---
You should take the 100 caps honestly lol
---
They're definitely in 76, I found one outside of Watoga when I was only level 20. So many bricks were shat.
---
It's not amazing you didn't bother to read what I wrote or ignored it. I agreed that TSE is broken but, given you can't understand people disagreeing with you, I'm not surprised you didn't bother to read it or didn't get that. I also explained why these people post their replies (you know; what you were complaining about) and why I agree with them despite not having any of the supposed god build you also complained about. But I disagreed with you so I must be wrong.
---
I've had this post saved for a while. 
---
https://redd.it/9yza6w
---
When you build next to a resource node, a 'Resource' tab becomes available in the build menu (you'll see it at workshops) and you can put an extractor down.
---
I like the idea! Remarkable 
---
I do that too. I still pick up plans that I find just so I can give them away to new players. Water filter plants and things like Chemistry Benches are easy to find and while useless to higher level characters as you can find them easily after a bit of exploring, they can be very helpful to someone who just started and haven't explored a lot yet.  
---
If I have the scrap to spare I'll also sometimes craft low level weapons (like lvl 1-10)  and give them to new players. I'll also craft and attach some nice mods to them. Creating a low level hunter/sniper rifle doesn't cost too much and new players often find them helpful.  
---
There's not much to do later in the game after you reach level 50 and complete the main quest line, so helping others with items, plans, and quests is one thing that is still enjoyable to do from time to time.
---
Speaking of Behemoths, is it just me or do they seem to get smaller with each new Fallout game?
---
Amazing guide, thanks a lot for this.
---
Glory BE unto Atom!
---
I don't pvp, but why is this a thing? That makes bounties even more worthless.
---
Is that what it is? It’s literally so hard to play today :/
---
Not even that, it's $18 on G2A
---
I thought the mask of theirs was cool, until I found out you can't wear a mining helmet with it. Into the trash pile it went.
---
Afaik that doesn't work anymore (someone wrote this, I haven't tested)  
---
But I have no idea what kind of tools they have, but if someone has 1100309483948 bobbleheads, it's obviously duping and they can just ban them and remove their inventory..
---
I wouldn't mind them making those care package events more harder if they had better loot as a result.
---
Good guess, lol
---
I haven’t got a source to hand buye quite a few threads have suggested when people with issues have contacted the help team that Bethesda have responded saying they don’t have the ability to add or remove items. 
---
However, I haven’t personally seen one of these emails so I could be misreporting a fallacy.
---
Well.. no idea but I believe it makes sense.
---
I dont get why they haven't just made it scaled like the dragons in Skyrim, lvl 5 scorchbeast in a lvl 5 area with a lvl 5 player.
---
How the hell is it fair to confront sub-lvl 50 players with a lvl 50-80 scorchbeast when even your average player over 100 can't reliably kill them. (Inb4 "muh tse", disqualified)
---
Skyrim dragons when properly scaled will do fair enough damage with a much lower aoe, as well as landing much more frequently and not having this bullshit scorchcloud, which would be fine IF IT DID NOT GO THROUGH BUILDINGS. If im in a roofed building it should not hit me as much as outside
---
They're not peaceful, they just recognise your face. 
---
Whatever it is, it is driving me mad!! 
---
Add 'SBQ' - for Scorched Beast Queen - to your lexic, and you'll be ready to join the hardcore F76 players, and say things like 'I killed SBQ with my TSE pump shotty'!
---
There are a couple events that occasionaly reward the whole server on completion. They will likely fix that with the next patch. 
---
I've posted the solution before and its a simple way to clear out existing Duper and destroy all their reserve materials.  Fix the Dupe glitch and turn back on the damage for excessive carry weight.  If you have 10K bobble head in your inventory you would die during the load screen, Respawn and die again. your character is useless and you would have to delete it. Yes some of you out there have Mule character that could be affected by this but lets be honest if your mule has 1000 lbs over carry weight they are not the problem here it's the 10K+ people were are talking about. Plus it forces all the Chinese Farmer to have more copies of the game so Bethesda makes more sales.    
---
Lets say 10 hp per second for double your max weight. That would give most people zero effect and the legitimate mules would have time to drop some shit before they die. 
---
But those Damn duper would be taking like 1000K damage per second and poof problem solved.  
---
Agreed.   
---
I have a specific build without TSE to fight Scorchbeasts - it's still a risky fight because one prolonged hit from the blasts will kill me. It will also kill most players outside of power armour. 
---
I even had to get -poison legendary to avoid the cropdusting, and even then... 
---
Their insane accuracy makes them a tougher fight than a 3\* Behemoth. 
---
TSE is absolutely broken; I had someone justify it by saying that if you stack all damage mods on a melee weapon, you can come close to a normal automatic TSE weapon. 
---
In my opinion, two shot is fair (insane recoil) but Explosive needs to be straight up deleted and replaced with Unbreakable. 
---
Scorchbeasts need to be crippled - and those sonic blasts are far too accurate. Power Armour shouldn't BE required every time you might run into one. They just gank you instantly before you can respond unless you're quick enough to leg it. 
---
I agree. No more Whitespring. Pls someone nukes the Vault 76
---
Fair enough.. i did think that as well.
---
Should charge a toll to cross that would be a true American! 😂 
---
I understand.  But really want display racks!!!
---
It's confirmed you can't read. My argument was against a loud minority demanding a "new engine or we wont buy your games" front. It's a stupid argument and those who say it have no clue.  
---
Christ on a fucking bike I'll write it in plain English:  
---
I meant that SOME ISSUES TAKE LONGER TO RESOLVE DUE TO TECHNICAL OR OTHER ISSUES. For example take the stash weight and that Bethesda said they didn't want to make it too big due to technical issues and the engine tracking items in the world I believe they said. So an unlimited stash size would be an unrealistic expectation. But fixing major bugs aren't, at the very least a workaround is necessary and needed.  
---
" You don't lag aeons behind the competition on release quality. " One game, but fair point. And it has been called out. That said No Mans Sky got a really bad rep at release same with Metal Gear Survive. This year and previous years have had shit storm releases so they aren't the only ones; not to SAY IT JUSTIFIES IT THOUGH, IT DOESN'T.   
---
You seriously lack reading comprehension. My post was addressed exclusively at people bragging about how easy scorchbeasts are with broken, overpowered crap.
---
You arguing about how you like the way scorchbeasts are, or that they're totally killable without TSE has nothing to do with what I wrote. 
---
For more dmg id max out aderline3and get nerd rage from int. Your dmg will increase hugely this way 
---
I just want a list of all the fixes! I don't currently play like I want to because I have been a fan since the release of FO3. However I am too broke to buy at the very least a console and copy of the game. Anyways, I try my best go keep up to date on whats going on with the game I'm just frustrated that they havent released a changelog yet and from the article on inside the vault they said it wont drop until the update drops later this morning. If anyone has anysauce on the changelog or what exactly the 150 fixes are please send links!
---
You take the snake and spiral down,
---
And at the bottom, What has he found?
---
The snake goes into the rabbit's hole,
---
Then you give the top a pull,
---
Now it's ready for your use,
---
This is how you tie a noose.
---
Tick Tock Dupers.
---
I’m gonna drop a nuke in prime in like 15 minutes hopefully msg me for PSN
---
Legendary mod crafting should and probably will be a thing at some point. Make it so when you salvage legend, you get crafting materials unique to that effects, which you will need to craft the mods. Adds some nuke zone mats on top and it should be good to go. 
---
This is correct. Even claiming Grafton Steel Factory and its 2-3 extractors is nothing compared to looting and scraping guns (don't forget the Scrapper perk).
---
Ive been visiting Nuke Zones quite often bc i was curious what i find. Didnt had a goal, just went in (lvl 35).
---
after a few minutes i got bored and left. Still dont know whats so precious about nuke zones. Someone wanna tell me?
---
Come on fellow oldy. The kids spell it skool
---
*We found some stuff in the wasteland we thought you might like...*
---
*humans enjoy recreational drugs and "food" right?...*
---
I wish Bethesda has some decent activity logs...
---
It'd take a minute to isolate all dupers characters with even the simplest log system.
---
More than likely not. 
---
There is the money paid to Valve to use the Steam service.
---
Bethesda went and made their own launcher to facilitate their games (and other developers are moving in this direction).
---
Is it possible? Anything is. 
---
Is it likely? At some point perhaps but not in the immediate future. 
---
If you want to play then purchase it, 
---
Obviously the density of harvestable plants around Whitesprings also makes it attractive in terms of crafting stable flux. I've nuked Morgantown a few times for the same reason, since plantlife is pretty dense in the southern part of town. 
---
I only clicked for the awkward scoarchbeast genitalia. 
---
these ideas are cool, they seem several levels beyond whats already designed and available in game. its clear the game needs containers we can build and carry, a streamlining to how we now are accomplishing item give away / sharing. definitely also needs the ability to build our own decorations that come from found items, trophy/statue displaying. in my response to the inside the vault call for feedback i have outlined the most straight forward additions/enhancements that would solve the gaps in the process we now take in order to impact other players/share items. feel free to check it out on my profile page which takes you to 76herd.
---
&gt; run on autopilot during building looting
---
Guilty!
---
Precisely
---
You and me both Bethesda needs to swing that hammer or risk future exploits be used by most. Making the games future very bad. How they handle the exploiter for the past 7 weeks will be very telling to us. On what to expect the future to be like regarding exploits in future content.
---
Did it deliver?
---
3D Fallouts only. Fallout 4 is the odd one for not introducing weapon conditions.
---
what i think would fix that problem is if bethesda added some actual *working* end game content. most of the griefers are just bored end game players who are tired of whitesprings and the broken queen who takes off all the way to the lowest corner of the damn map for the rest of the event
---
Because there is nothing to share. Everything outside the prime is like crashed space station- When you nuke it, there is some new monsters, but the is no like real value to them. 
---
Don’t worry about getting her killed, it has minimal penalties but make sure you team up so she can benefit from your activity.  I play with my son, who is 100 lvls above me, yeah I die a lot but I get an XP benefit from his kills and we both get to harvest everything the team kills.  I have noticed a slight (no proof) if he joins my team as opposed to when I join his team that the lvls come down a bit especially at workshops.  So take every workshop you can, defend the first attack, get all the loot and walk away from it.  I was getting more XP than my son when we did this and it helped leveling up quickly.
---
It's funny because there is a pretty simple concept here: this is a post about scorched beasts being broken (let's call that A). You posted to complain about people disagreeing with that and having OP builds to fight them (let's called that B and C).
---
I replied with my thoughts on A, B and C. I also explained why I had those thoughts.
---
These are pretty simple interactions but you seem to be having trouble understanding how this all works.
---
No I love the theory.
---
But as a fresh vault dweller coming out into the world why would I be collecting bottle caps in a post nuclear world -- without having a reason. 
---
The vendor could say hey we accept caps, collect 5 caps and buy a starter item...  something along those lines. Doesn't have to explain why we we already have that tidbit in Whitesprings we would find later on our journey.
---
Plus they have no legendaries for them.
---
You do not need to follow the path as long as you get to the end point button, and don’t forget to run back...
---
Good bot
---
Just happened to me.  It was between 98 NAR Regional and New Appalachain Trainyard.  Lost 20% health in 10 seconds.  I was on the road and had to run up into the cliffs to avoid it.
---
Morgantown High School too, and it's an easier walk.  
---
Bonus: the crazy cat woman's house is close and has lots of plastic cat bowls (and toys).

I’m the friend that was trying to help, actually.  This wasn’t just some team of people that fought back and we lost kind of deal...
---
The base that was getting wrecked was owned by a guy with a Boba Fett-related name.  The griefer had a random, non-Star Wars name.  A little while after we dropped the griefer with a bounty (zero cap reward, despite the 800 “bounty”), the, I spotted a high level player in the distance also with a Boba Fett related name.  We figured it was the base owner’s friend trying to help out but we just got there first.  While the griefer runs towards me after seeking revenge high level opens up on the OP (who is also high level) for full damage - turns out all three of them were in on it, plus another one or two 100+ characters that showed up after that.  The high-level attacker was _never_ red to the OP or myself despite being able to go full pvp on us because of the broken team mechanics.
---
If someone dies due to a BOUNTY, the pvp should simply end there.  No seeking revenge, no team avenging.  Make someone have to shoot back before full damage starts like every other pvp encounter in this game so far.
---
You filthy mutants should be destroyed
---
And my original point was that the uneducated consumers are the ones going 'This is fine'. The naive gamers who wouldn't know the value of money if you put it on a Netflix special. The ones who will use every excuse under the Sun as to why a software-as-a-service offering is allowed to be worse because 'they can fix it later'. The ones who will defend companies over consumers because they have already spent their money.
---
If we examine this one:
---
&gt;example take the stash weight and that Bethesda said they didn't want to make it too big due to technical issues and the engine tracking items in the world I believe they said
---
I can accept their reasoning. But that just means that surely this engine is not fit for purpose, at all, for a multiplayer game based primarily around loot&amp;shoot item grinding. How did this get past proof-of-concept and architectural design? People are well within their rights to demand a new engine if statements from Bethesda are basically admitting that the engine won't do the job for the game. It's certainly what the publishing team should have been demanding.
---
&gt;One game, but fair point.
---
And Skyrim, and Fallout 4. Historically Bethesda games have been horrendously buggy and then the community has saved them with unofficial patches and mod files.
---
Yeah, I rather hope they do something with Whitesprings, or rather something with any other nuke spot to put a stop to the madness.
---
Besides the inevitable server crashing from the robot flood infinite spawn (and some of the ghouls, though people do clean those out obviously), its just a ****** nuisance given how many questlines go through there, along with two whole vendor factions (though you can get the Whitesprings one at the train station).
---
As much as i love them giving out the Classic Collections to players...
---
I hate the fact that i recently bought them on steam to enrich my Fallout education.
---
Gulpers do that.  Saw a bunch hanging upside down on a tree, using their tails to do it.
---
Was neat.
---
Far from it. TSE makes certain aspects easier than I'm sure the devs wanted it to be but I was only marginally less deadly to mobs before I got one and I never accidentally killed myself with my +30% against Scorch Gattling.
---
I dislike games with perpetually leveling enemies like The Devision, level 1 it took half a mag at 300 DPS to kill someone. At level 98 with a 32 000 DPS it takes 2 mags to kill someone. Wut?
---
The mobs in FO76 are too stupid to be much of a challenge. Only the Scorched use cover, and then only so so while everything else kamikaze charges into you and can be beaten by bullet spam. I'm hoping the content update will address the issue but don't fall down the trap of bullet sponges who deal instadeath. That also isn't fun. 
---
Is that what's going on there?
---
Yeah I agree. Be nice to have different paints instead of looking like a knock off bumblebee clone
---
&gt; it is not PvP game but co-op
---
It literally is a PvP game.
---
Yes
---
A long dead Enclave peon's practical joke finally pays off.
---
There is balance, you just discribed it. Someone killed you and you went through the effort of sitting at their workshop for an hour and then killed him. There is plenty of challenge if you prepare for pvp, the one shot weapons have counters. You can turn pvp off, wait until they do slap damage get right in their face and then use a melee weapon and smack them over and over In vats. Would you prefer a spot on the map where pvp is agreed upon by both party's by default? This isn't runescape, we aren't in the woods. Stealth boys were the issue of your argument earlier how did you get to Tse? 
---
Best guess is that it speeds up the crank animation.
---
My 2 Cents
---
1. Loadout's are a must!
---
2. Dear god yes we need to know what plans we know!
---
3. Mods shouldn't auto scrap but everything else if fair game.
---
4. It's annoying to see/hear this yes but there should still be a pop up to let you know it exist.
---
5. Scrap perk cards New and ones you already have when you get woodchucker in 4 card packs for some new Currency that you can buy animated cards or even full perk card for.
---
6. Don't care 
---
7. "Allow renaming of weapons and armor" I give it 2 days till the profanity and slurs get people band
---
8. Love the Idea of Recent hell add a tab
---
9. When in line of sight give the player name. or perception range.  All friend on friends list should be seen.
---
10. Not a bad idea but the back end editing might be hard.
---
New section 
---
1. IT"S COMING!
---
2. They need player faction (guilds) and faction bank (guild bank) but restrict them to location not player camps. I'd say workshops and a few world location. 
---
3. Would love a display for my junk and my Little would love to display her teddy bear collection. 
---
4.  A refrigerator is a must 3 tiers too 30%/60%/90% uses more power with each
---
5. Camp perk slot for some cards tie it to a stat or make it 1/2 your normal special that are only camp related perks
---
6. would be cool
---
I remember that post, lol the poor dude shot the moth man thinking it were just a blob of junk accumulated on the electrical tower/power rail tower ;,)
---
You can go to white springs as a low level with no team mates.  Just suck down a boatload of rad-x, have spare stimpacks and rad-away and cross the “event horizon”.  Find someplace high, like the wall around the swimming pool, get up there and when all the lvl 150+ kite things out of the club just snipe 1 shot into each creature, you will get to loot them when it is all over, even when they turn into meat puddles.  You can pull a lot of higher level junk and a lot of XP without being in the middle of it.  There are also a a lot of higher levels players who will let you team up and get XP that way.
---
If you attach a stairs to a foundation, then another stairs back down/up to the "ground floor", you can then build with floors instead of foundations and they will still line up perfectly. It seems jank at first, but it's pretty easy and works really well in most situations. The only tricky part is editing your layout later becomes tricky.
---
Thanks for the info! I’ll definitely check out Berkeley springs church! I’ve only had the chance to meet the vendor once and that took 5 hours of trying, luckily he had the hunters long coat I was after first try or else I’d still be searching, but he never had the clean helmet 
---
Well that gives me even more reasons to hate cranberry bog Lol, I dread going into this region more than any other and when I do it's not for very long.
---
I had a feeling that chameleon deathclaws were in the game since they were in fo4 but luckily I have never encountered one 
---
What about if we have some doors we could place on the ground. Different ones give different basements. And instead of it been like an over world thing. Its like a building that you load into? So you would get a loading screen when going in and out
---
Okay, I don't really care what they do, but they do need to do something, and instead they took a month of holiday.
---
Not only that, but the budget required to properly decorate.
---
My budget is maxed out and i have a few decorations but nothing special. I want to do more but i cant do so without cutting out large chunks of my camp. 
---
Perhaps allow decorations to have a budget of its own? Or make them cost nothing entirely. 
---
Since then I have found automatic Radium Rifle which is OK, but my real treasure is explosive/bloodied Radium Rifle which is game breaking good.
---
I have not used a basic RR in a long time, because of my treasure.
---
You missed my point, the debate is over. I agree with Skyrim and Fo4 being buggy but in all honesty you just haven't read some of my key points and/or manipulated them into benefiting yourself. 
---
If you ever have the capacity to not use petty tactics to try and up yourself then I'm find with a conversation but this is just stupid. 
---
I have a feeling that the fire rate number was combined with weapon reload time.
---
Glitching the in-clip ammo count (or getting quad legendary) with black powder weapons shows that in-between shot delay among such weapons are not that different with each other.
---
Funny you should say that, I killed my first scorchbeast today, then second and third. Events are weird.
---
It'll be a while until I meet any SBQs, but I will be sure to remember to call them that.
---
I just found a pair duping and stole their shit and ran away. Then tried hunting, but automatic TSE combat shotgun got me.
---
imagine how good a well designed dark color scheme would look on the ultracite, or a white/light gray color scheme on the excavator.. if they only put the effort on making something new and interesting instead of overpricing more fallout 4 outfits
---
I hate to be that person but you can’t get a million caps. Max is 25k 
---
I can already imagine it in my head...

LIMITED TIME EXCAVATOR POWER ARMOR PAINTJOB

5000 ATOMS
---
Spoiler Alert: Playing with the ability to swap load out on perk cards IS amazing!
---
There is of course a mod for the PC allows you to create up to 8 different load outs, save them, name them and load them with  a single numbered button from the actual perk screen. Its not a cheat, you still need to open your pipboy, go to the perk screen and then hit a hotkey, it just saves you from having to remove and cselect on your cards.
---
You get so much more use out of so many card then you would ever use without it. You really start to think about which cards you actually need in any situation.
---
You have a normal load out with you specialized weapon, weight perks and general survival.
---
You jump into your power armour and swap your load out that takes some of you weight cards off (because you have calibrated shocks with extra carry weight) and equip you power armour perks like full charge, pain train (choo choo), power patcher and stabilised. All of these perks (and more) only work when you are using power armor and is a complete waste of points if you are not in one.
---
Then you head back to your camp to fix and scrap stuff. You load your craft layout with ammo Smith, super duper, weapon artisan, fix it good, homebody,  happy camper and more. Again these perks are great and are totally useless when you are not using them.
---
All of a sudden you start to want to upgrade more and more perk cards because you are getting a lot more use out of them. You start to play around with different combinations a have a much greater variety of how you play the game. No more will you want to go back and start a new character when you can just change your whole layout and choose how you want to play at the time.
---
How many times have you gone to craft something and forgot and to equip something like super duper or chemist and lost half of what you could have potentially made. Or sold stuff at the vendor and forgot to equip hard bargin and got less caps. Or have come to a locked door and it is just not worth going into your perks and swapping out your perception cards and scrolling through all of the other cards to find all 3 individual pick locking cards that are never next to each other (soooooo painful).
---
It make no sense what so ever why this is not in the base game now. It is totally game changing and we are all at a disadvantage by not having it... I mean for those people that dont already use it.
---
Be careful with that. Don't know how Bethesda is going to handle duped items and owners...
---
Hey could you add a huge QoL that I think will actually improve server performance?    
---
PLEASE use the fusion core with the lowest charge first, so we don't end up with 30 stacks of differently charged fusion cores, beacause it allways takes the highest charge one=( Such a simple fix (I imagine), with a huge improvement..     
---
Also, maybe some mats to let us recharge them, but that is imo priority 2..
---
I find mobs can out range my base defence. They stand and shoot the base to pieces before my guns shoot them.
---
Them my guns shoot a Scorchbeat. 
---
I know, it ridiculous 
---
1-149 = Fixed an issue that allowed duping.
---
150 = Fixed an issue that caused the game to freeze during a server hop.
---
We will be adding new content just as soon as the game is stable!
---
Upvoted for cat tax.
---
you guys are real fallout fans. even they want nuclear launching on their accounts!
---
Customer service not having the tools and the tools not existing aren't the same thing.  
---
I should add: stole their stuff, ran away and dropped it in the river.
---
They will find a new way. They always do. It's depressing, because I love this game that they want to ruin.
---
How'd they kill Fallout? Fallout 3 and FNV (yes I know made by Obisidian) and FO4 are some of my favourite games, and yes before you ask I have played the originals
---
I’ve never had any problems with them.
---
It bothers me immensely, considering the solid behavior of the dragons in skyrim. 
---
SUPER-NIGHTKIN
---
What's the difference between your system builds?  My system is pretty beefy, and people that I've teamed with seem to have a different experience of the server issues than I do.
---
Also: are you both on wifi?
---
Thanks and I am somehow relieved to hear it wasnt the scorchbeast penis that triggered it.
---
sadly they were made from the Big empty. Otherwise Cazador-Deathclaw hybrids would be best.
---
Fair enough, I'm working on leveling enough times to be able to switch between shotgun and heavy gun perks. 
---
Any weapon with explosive is good, especially if you have it on a bloodied or two shot weapon. But I expect explosive to receive a nerf soon, as it should have been a primary stat and not a secondary stat.
---
It still requires you to go into your pip boy, go to the perk screen and select what perks you want. It is not a quick swapping game breaking thing, you do not want to be doing that in the middle of a fight.
---
It still requires you to have forward thinking of what kinds of cards you want use and equip them ahead if time. All it does is save you from going through the painful process of clicking cards off, finding cards you want, clicking on them to equip it, get out of the screen, realise you forgot to swap out one, go back and do it all again etc.
---
It actually doesn't make your deck pointless it actually makes you think a lot more about what your what to use for any situation and makes you want to upgrade more cards then ever.
---
That’s all I want. Some of these abilities need to behave independently of the perk cards. Maybe tie some of these abilities to SPECIAL level. Maybe at perception level 3 you get level 1 lockpicking. Perception 7 could be 2 lockpicking. Ect. I don’t think bethesda intended the card switching mechanic to be used frequently for individual tasks. But they way they structured the perks it’s something a lot of people are doing now. So either way they should address it.
---
Honestly, I think if the duping exploits are fixed, these types of things will become a non issue imo, I doubt most of op's maps weren't ones that were duped, not necessarily by him, but by the people he got them off. 
---
Bueller?
---
I was thinking it was a perfect mob. And the Endgame bosses would be Patriarch and Matriarch deathclaws. make them 30 feet tall. Like from new Vegas, BUT NOW THEY CAN FLY. 
---
It's possible they just saved each players morrowind-style savefile as a blob in the database. That would also explain why accessing the data is as complicated as they say.
---
I really hope that's not true, no sane developer would do that to his database.
---
Yeah, I hope there is a nerf soon.
---
Book of Eli run. /s

This is my personal build: [Fallout 76 Build with 3/15/1/4/6/12/15](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwIOAAMFCw4BAQEFAQIFDRAqTwMQAxkDCwNsA6oBAaYBA+sBA8UBAzYCuwEDRgHNAQHwAQOnAQPGAQPEAQPxAQPyAQNAAUEBAA==)
---
I would recommend taking 3 points in agility to luck.
---
Having 15 luck with crit savvy, you're able to perform a crit every other shot.
---
my build uses mutations so the luck perks for mutations are welcome.
---
Eagle eyes: +crit damage
---
marsupial: higher jumps
---
bird bones: slower fall
---
adrenal reaction: 5% life lost = 5% more damage meaning you gain 5-95% more damage based on your health.
---
Speed demon: faster reload speed and movement
---
Starched genes makes you keep mutations so that's permanently equipped 
---
Classfreak helps you mitigate all mutations drawbacks.
---
Lone wanderer and nerd rage helps you stay low health
---
Keep drinking purified water to heal you slowly and have the +AP regen bonus going.
---
Winged Matriarch Chameleon Deathclaw Behemoth.
---
Never thought I'd need this in my life, but I think I do.
---
Actualy not a bad idea.
---
I just hope that they placed a system in before the break to track login and log out. so that they could cross reference it with player inventory weight. It would be shady as shit but would be a easy way to both track and without a doubt fine all dupers. Then the simple solution is to wipe all their accounts and or hit them with the Ban hammer.
---
Me too haha, I rarely go there myself. I think the Deathclaw was in a small power station just outside Watoga, there seems to be one there every time, but it was only a Chameleon one once :(
---
What a sweet camp u have.. mine is beside a river
---
It does
---
Yes, it would and to make things even nicer, Beth could give dupers a lot of bans.
---
dang, was hoping for a big-bore break-action shotgun sometime in the future lol
---
It would totally work, think about the trenches near the Sites - they could be where the momma and pappa deathclaws raked the ground with their claws.
---
This still does not explain the lots of caps. If you kill a wanted, you don't get a bounty yourself right? So how did he lose caps?
---
That's taste. What I mean by killed is that they diverted quite a lot from the original fallout vision. This doesn't negate that they can still be great games for you.
---
thanks! if you post yours anywhere let me know, I really like checking out people's camps.
---
Mentioned it before, but you can find all these posters in-game showing off the Excavator power-armor in [a really nice looking black and red scheme](https://cdn2-www.gamerevolution.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/20181109003537_1-e1542054752231.jpg) and i'm honestly surprised that this hasn't been offered up on the atom shop yet
---
it hurts diversity. 
---
honestly if they wanted the workshop that badly they would've just taken it from you or swapped servers.
---
I've seen the junkyard/powerplant nuked before, probably for fauna, hardened mass or something.
---
You just happened to be collateral damage.
---
don't forget there's a single junk workshop close to Morgantown that's more low profile, there's also a junk pile fairly close to that (little SE) that you can set your camp on, it's next to a rail overpass (if you're interested there's a post on this reddit with all possible locations for that sorta stuff) 
---
Rad-X syringer ammo. ~~Inflicts~~ Bestows Rad-X effects on hit players.
---
https://youtu.be/L4FP1vFKyo4 here ya go bud.. 
---
Nah, I haven’t seen any other posts about it. Must just be you. 
---
I know it’s an unpopular idea but... just deal with it, there is destructive people who get a kick out of screwing with people for no reason.  Just like the real world, just like it would be in a nuclear wasteland.  
---
Thanks will rebuild and explain to my wife see what she thinks 
---
I made a water camp regretted it. Every fast travel or log in I would be in the water getting disease left and right. Was super thrilled when I log in and 2 scortchbeast are already yelling at me before I even load into the server.  Base came out so good too but it made it unenjoyable. 😕 
---
Glad you found a safe spot.
---
Hey, that's a easy solution
---
**Get rid of the fucking junk you have. Lighten up the load, mate.**
---
For weapon you should either be looking for a bloodied first weapon or instigating
---
Yupp Up for that to. But i think there will be some players out there that got duped items without beeing aware of it .. so im up for bans on dupers and exp cheaters but not for thoes gamers that didnt know that they got/bought a duped weapon . So just delete All duped items and that should be punishment enough for thoes that unentensionly got a duped item..
---
Hmm interesting points. With regards to TSE; I suppose I can only talk about my experience but my explosive shotgun (not even 2 shot) is basically cheating. I one / two shot most enemies. A deathclaw takes maybe 5? They can't have wanted us to be walking around waving these around the map like Billy Big Bollocks. I avoid using it because it feels so OP.
---
It's a massive leap between my other weapons and the shotgun.
---
Roll back tse and make either two shot OR Explosive. 
---
Both together is broken, for way more reasons than this one
---
Yeah I was starting to wonder if I was doing something wrong when modus asked me to reconnect it.
---
The previous inhabitants of the enclave vault must have had a good reason why they severed it's connection in the first place and most likely died in the process.
---
Modus explains that Parts of the vault were "damaged" ie. caved in, it's particularly shady on the subject as to why. My guess is modus ordered the robots to turn against the previous  inhabitants, coralling them into these areas and sealing them in to starve or get crushed by debris 
---
Not true, I play locally with my son on two different consoles.  We both get server disconnects at times separate from each other and we just join back on together on the same server.  At this point 99% of the server disconnects have been isolated to only 1 of us at a time.  I think I recall all of 2 times where we both got disconnect together.
---
Don't fast travel like a shitass then
---
just before i built this camp, i cleared out everything to have 0 budget and spent 4 days trying to tame something... I followed every guide, went to every location....and nothing....ever.... 
---
Cool camp and way cool sloth!
---
Yeah
---
I heard there's s bug with the plan amd you to buy it the one who cost around 440 caps
---
I'm not too worried when she dies (or me because I'm not touting about how much of a top tier gamer I am) since she can spawn on top of me. But I never noticed that about XP, I'll have to give it a try when we play again, I haven't touched the workshops, but I might try my hand at it later. 
---
Well of course they diverted a lot from the original, Interplay went bankrupt remember
---
RIP sloth im not sure if he died or not but he jst disappeared... will have to tame new one when theres new content.
---
Nice find but it might get patched today for pc and later in the week for consoles. Bethesda said they were looking at perks.
---
Actually I had to reposition my "CAMP" item after settling a few times to find a way to fast travel and not land in the water. You dont have to "move the camp" but just move the CAMP item itself to change spawn locations.
---
Maybe all the other Vault 76ers got there first and snagged all the good stuff, leaving us with a choice of duct tape or mirelurk jerky.
---
All of these and people still ask why many people dont use chat ... 
---
For me it is a game ... I listen to enough inane chatter at work. I can team for an objective pretty well without a lot of talk. 
---
I really do not need to hear or care about your life choices or life. Sorry but it isnt as if we will ever be real life besties. 
---
Team etiquette is pay attention to what is going on.
---
Yeah I agree on relocating, but it just doesn't look great.
---
Once I get the brick plans I think I'll set up a better base with a good solid foundation near the lake. Do you by any chance know where to get the big water purifier plans from, the ones that have to be in water to work.
---
I can only do the small ones and end up running out of purified water for meds and stuff 
---
There is one in your room at Vault 76 as well
---
That’s where my base is, right in the south near the Lucky Mine. I saw an orange mothman watching me from the cliffs. It was the coolest fight I’ve ever seen in fallout, it has so many unique and different abilities.
---
I thought I was done getting mods for the hunting rifle till I scrapped like fifteen in a row quick in succession.  I then received the snappy receiver.  I wonder if there is a sequence for unlocking mods?
---
Totally worth it
---
Difficulties strengthen the mind, as labor does the body.
---
TSE weapons are making us retarted.
---
I thought there was a prime receiver for it?
---
Why not be able to use the paint you find lying around to paint them yourself
---
I dont remember exactly, but I think I got them from claiming a workshop. Hopping around claiming workshops is a great way to get plans. I think the industrial water purifier comes from workshop at camp mcclintock
---
3 introduced it 
---
GG
---
TSE is definitely broken. Don't get me wrong, there *are* weapons that people can acquire (regular 2 shots, god roll fatman, etc) that are overpowered, but reasonably so. TSE is just 1 shot to everything. It's basically a hacked weapon in diablo, for instance. The thing with a game like Diablo is that if one player kills everything, you get the loot. More and more, I'm seeing TSE in events like the Nightstalker and Uranium fever. Everyone doing those events aren't there for the xp. We want legendaries. I was at a Violent night event earlier (nightstalker) and right when the Wendigo popped, this guy ran over and oneshot it. There were about 10 people here and he fucked all of them over. That's not right. Even a melee character with an instigating sledge can't 1 shot that thing and they have to run over to it to hit it. 
---
The *only* event where I tolerate a twoshot explosive is the queen. And yeah, it's  hypocritical, but it makes it go by faster. But they don't end up hogging all the loot and making all the other players waste their time. 
---
As for the feeling of power, I run a stealth sniper build with a two shot +50% limb damage. I do deeecent damage. Enough that I can go farm scorchbeasts at the prime fissure. Sure, it takes some ammo, but it's nothing holding the munitions factory for an hour can't fix, though. 
---
Then step it up with the Death-Beast Prim-arch
---
You get special resources from the plants and mobs that you craft into different colored flux, which is used to craft ultracite ammo, among other things.  Basically the next tier of guns that do bonus damage to all scorched, but can ONLY use ultracite ammo.  Most guns/ammo types can do this: handmade (5.56), Gatling laser (fusion core), even friggen pipe pistols!
---
Or, people just farm it for the legendaries.
---
I have every single full power armour in the game but dammed if I can find a T-51 Left Arm ever!!! It is the only thing I am missing and I have not seen one anywhere, it really bugs me.
---
I encountered  Already 2 mothmen. Just randomly encounters in the wild. I put on my power armor and started shooting at it. The first one i managed to kill, the second one dissapeared.  They arent much of a challenge tbh. 
---
#NO
---
If I ever get into the game again I’ll try to remember this. The last base I made on a mountain and I always had to fast travel twice to get to it lol.  
---
Also noticed all my friends would fast travel to my base and end up perfectly in the middle safely. But the owner gets sent a nice walk away? 
---
Avr medical center has a decent supply as well
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDcC94UZaz4
---
Its around the 33 second mark.
---
Right cool, I do hope around the workshops as I get a fair bit of xp and sometimes come up against a boss.
---
Mostly the scorpions, I had a level 65 legendary boss turn up and it totally wrecked me lol.
---
Thanks for the help 
---
 You can Level up fast even at High Level. Mobs Drop legendary Items, stimpaks, Rad Aways and other Stuff. It kinda sux but its the best there is right now.
---
Very cool idea for a house.
---
This
---
What's wrong with plasma? I'm level 22 and only just got laser (wow lasers are bad) 
---
Thats odd.
---
You're suppose to get the option to cook some food items once you get them. I wonder if this is different. I can't say I remember finding a frog recipe more than finding a ton of tiny blue frogs at white springs and getting it.
---
This, this could work.
---
Hang onto it or learn it. I'm saving up a mountain of prime receivers, currently have 50 Cal and lmg. (only ones noteworthy.) 
---
A high-tech net flinger would be just the thing... Wrap the wings and it's on!
---
This feels like a Fox News post. 
---
Well if you talk about c.a.m.p duplicating. Its bethesdas own fault. Its not my fault they dont fix glitches.

I think its a good thing. BGS knew from Fallout 4 that TSE are totally over the board OP but thats what kinda made it fun.If they intended to not add tse guns they would have done so. Fo76 is online so its not really fair fighting against a player with a tse. STill the knowledge that there are guns out there outclassing everything is pretty exciting. Higher tier enemies are just bullet sponges and tse counters that. I hate farming for ammo and mats to repair my guns. 
---
When 1-3 spawn nowhere near a fissure, usually yeah. It's one of the random encounters. There's also random enemy spawning locations. Like near the Whitesprings station. You can get a behemoth, scorchbeasts, etc.

4. 1st person and 3rd person crosshairs are offset when switching. This affects zoom! Meaning I can't use zoom when running in 3rd person. The situation in videos doesn't look so dramatic, but in further distance it is unplayable.  
---
To be more precise, I believe 3rd person character and camera are not in same position, I have displaced character to left - check the video with getting out of power armor.

I don't know about you, but suddenly the vendors are now selling 3* TSE guns in quantity. Both Watoga vendors were full of them last night.
---
I think someone knows something and the exploiters are trying to dump thier ill gotten gains before it is either made worthless, or made possible to track thier agregious behaviour.
---
Either way, at least one is running scared on PS4 because I know for a fact that TSE pump shotguns were the most commonly duped weapon and phoenix had 5 of them on his weapon list for sale.
---
I know this is kinda old, but I've got a ton of stable and raw flux(s)(es?). I need pure for my contamination shower.
---
How do o get them pure?
---
Is the Fusion Core thing a new development? Cuz the only time i see a fusion core regen is the one in the PA that i'm wearing at the time of a disconnect.
---
Difference is fo76 is one time pay, they already have your money....wow has a monthly subscription.  They are going to want you to stay a subscriber therefore they want to help.
---
I disagree. I don’t think the issue is TSE Weapons. I believe the issue is there need to be better perk Balance. I also know no TSE hit hundreds of thousands of damage unless some body exploits the Bobble Head and Magazine glitch.
---
You do realize that with the Magazine and Bobblehead Exploit Melee Weapons can hit for hundreds of thousands also?
---
I believe people paint a bad narrative about TSE guns. Its not the guns. It the unbalanced perks and Bobblehead and Magazine Exploit needs to be fixed.
---
Like I said you can do the same thing with Melee..
---
 It's in the next patch supposedly. 
---
After reading his response i went there to check myself and after 2 server hops it was right here where he said it was: https://i.imgur.com/XgJPANv.jpg
---
You will be banned for holding duped items. Sorry.
---
Rad-x will stack. Use like five or ten at once and it will jump your rad resistance over 1000.
---
I'm like that as well, I'd get obscure items just because of that. I think that even if I got a tse I wouldn't use it (I'd obviously keep it) just because it would essentially make any other weapons obsolete. As someone who played borderlands so much, I've never looked up guides for it for meta builds etc. with each playthrough I'd try different things, use different weapons and alter my playstyle to use what I have effectively, whereas some people just use a tool to "scale the level" of their favourite weapons and only use those. 
---
O dont worry man dupers are not the same thing as that. 
---
Far far from that hang on let me grab ya my link.
---
Make sure all your PA is attached to the frame. 
---
You want ≠ Bethesda needs
---
This! 100 cans of dog food but sell everything else. 
---
If the game didn’t crash to desktop , it would be so much better. 
---
fix? you are quite the naive one, even if they fix one dupe glitch it's rumored that people have several other ways to dupe since beta that they haven't advertised to the public yet, so even if one gets fixed, others will come out. 
---
The division was a terrible game keep that heresy 9273849938738321 feet away from me
---
Yeah thats true the positioning is different for different group members now that you mention it. I wish they would just allow us to place the point wherever we want instead of move the CAMP object around and "guess". 
---
Not gonna lie. Shit sounds scary to just be walking at night and see one of those hanging upside down while I use my stealth build to swiggity swoop outta there
---
And use Pharma Farma 3 and bring in the chems/stims for vendor fodder.
---
Seriously, wipe the whole game? Yeah im deleting it in that case. Worked too hard to get to were i am
---
i still vote for faction pvp
---
Rather just see the simplest solution that i think is that new mode of theirs anyway. PVP servers for those who like to grief , harasss etc and PVE servers for the rest of us.
---
Sure, if youre on XBOX ill help you claim some workshops anytime im on.
---
Mine barely ever crashes, just disconnected about once per every 6 hours.
---
Nah just give enemies a realistic reaction to being set on fire. i.e. stop, drop, and roll
---
Thank you for your wise judgment...
---
Naive or not, servers are terribly unstable since the latest patch announcement. Either it's pure coïncidence either dupers are duping more actively.
---
They should just remove explosive effect to be honest. That belongs on the mark19 and missile launcher and that's really it. Theres a reason the big guns damage perks say "your non explosive big guns". It's too powerful when you can stack multiple damage perks on the same weapons. 
---
A 2 shot explosive shotgun should not do more damage than a 2 shot missile launcher. It's a missile launcher.. a missile.. lol.. 
---
What I don’t understand is that they let you do this! But only at workshops, You can actually use a rug that acts like a spawn point for fast travel but they didn’t give it to us for our camps =[ 
---
Must be a way too scrap all stockpiled loot. Im no game planner. Would imagine theres some way
---
The prices need to be stupid though. I mean it's $30 for a coffee pre-war. How much you think a ticket costs to play a game? $100? $200?
---
You must be privy to much better servers than me.  The ONLY events I ever see other people joining are "DEFEND WORKSHOP" and the one at Morgantown Airport when I'm farming stimpaks and med supplies.
---
Hate to age myself but it looks like the bad guy "Coffin of Darkness / Doom" that bad guys would ride down in from Voltron.
---
According to a Bethesda posts it is player bound and it resets 20 hours after you have cleared them out. Keep in mind that vendors can have their cap values bugged (like everything in this game) and they may appear to have 0 caps. Simply try selling something to see if t hey accept it, after which the cap values reset to the actual state.
---
It's funny though. You are limited in carry capacity and stash capacity. Due to perk cards (Pack Rat, Thru Hiker and Traveling Pharmacy) only working on your carry capacity, it is often a form of miss-management to dump stuff in your stash where they would lose that benefit. Then you realize that you get carry capacity and stash capacity issues, so you want to sell as much to vendors as you can. When you start selling things, you realize that Bethesda also limited caps capacity on vendors to only 200 caps per 20 hours while being tied to 7 factions.
---
Yesterday evening I farmed a Whitespring nuke zone for 4 hours. I managed to collect about 80 legendary items. 79 of these legendary items are absolute garbage, so it does feel like a quantity over quality. It's a situation where you are not rewarded with anything except trash. I was over-encumbered so I slowly made my way to Whitespring station. I sold what I could and then called it a night. This morning I woke up on my free day, wanting to play some more. Oh wait, 20 hours haven't passed yet, so I can't sell these shitty items to the Whitespring vendor. I have a choice now:
---
\- Being over-encumbered I cannot play the game until the 20 hours reset, after which I can probably only sell half of those trash can items, so I'm forced to not play for another 20 hours until it resets again.
---
\- Or I could just drop all those items on the ground, but then what is the point of playing this game if you have to toss 99.99% of the rewards given to you. 
---
It's good to see that Bethesda managed to add some personal things to FO76: anti-fun, bugs, miss-management and a quantity over quality unrewarding system. On top of that they "forgot" to put in vending machines to sell items to other players, despite it being advertised before the release. Forcing you to use discord or reddit to get rid of the good legendary items, which is very time consuming and only adds to the problem. I hope this all changes soon though. Farming 4 hours only to discard everything is very silly in a shoot and loot game.  
---
yeah! its nonsense really. i wonder if they left it out by accident...
---
Well with the "what's coming" from the Inside The Vault yesterday, they're supposed to be working on Vendors so hopefully I can at least buy the Enclave armors soon.
---
I just think of them as the cliffracer of 2019 and smile
---
Things they will definitely do is nerf a load stuff and not tell you. They've done this in every update so far.
---
Violence against station personnel is not permitted
---
MG turrets have the best target acquisition. use on MG turret as a spotter supported by a couple of missile turrets
---
Honestly - for something like that, I almost think a quad-capacity explosive dragon would ultimately do more damage. Instead of eight explosive rounds, you’d be firing off sixteen in succession. As far as I know, they all fire continuously. It’s a long firing animation but the damage output would ultimately be higher (correct me if I’m wrong).
---
Ok i see. I am totally against that aswell. I see this more as cheating.
---
I just got spammed to death by a scorchbeast, it was just annoying. I can't see it or shoot at it because I need to constantly stimpac. I just stared at it and waited to die eventually. 
---
Hahahah no way, sorry, but a lot of people trading are not duppers, if you go to the trade discord, you can buy mats, armor, etc. If they will ban people with dupe stuff in the inventory, 90 % of the playerbase will be banned. 
---
I have dozens of transactions there, sometime s you caught a dupper and you can report this assholes to the admins of discord, but sometimes you never know at whom you are buying stuff.
---
Unfortunately, for the Brawling mod, it specifically states UNARMED, and therefore does not affect -any- weapon damage, just that of bare fists. So you'll want to go with Weighted if the choice is between the two and you're an avid fist weapon user.
---
During the promotional stuff before launch, Todd stated that you can switch out perk cards on the fly, it’s a feature.
---
Thanks! Yeah, I really like the idea of building inside of or around existing structures 
---
Well if you want, don't sneak while wearing PA, done.
---
There is a box and this guy is not inside of it.
---
Just got to farm a switch since spotlights are bugged and are automatically not powered even when they have power upon fast travel or opening the game or dying
---
This^
---
Hey Greg, your arm fell off.
---
Can I chew on it for Atom? 
---
Yeah people like to pick it apart, especially with the sweet little lies video, but he's **technically** correct, and that's the best kind of correct, even though the statement is somewhat misleading.
---
I somewhat agree. 
---
I use crouching as a way to tell if I’m detected, not specifically to sneak. I’d rather there be a nerf to sneaking in genera for PA [maybe louder noises or such, idk yet] 
---
Another thing I suggest is removing the sneak multiplier for power armor, though this seems controversial 
---
Release your inner mole rat and dig out.
---

Love the story up vote for you. I never had to get the plan before for a level 45 auto homemade yesterday. Might go get it and use it to craft a level 50 one and mod that as the LV 45 dose something like 79 DMG so was hoping a LV 50 will do more 
---
It's naive to believe everyone in the vault is all kumbaya about rebuilding together. Front the vault security logs it's clear there are some people who aren't so happy to follow the program.
---
It does kinda suck except to power level.
---
Yeah but certainly not because fallout was a flop. It was actually a success, while the reasons for Interplay bankruptcy are [several and different.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interplay_Entertainment)
---
There was no reason to divert from the original, they simply did not have the right people working on FO3, and you can clearly see this since New Vegas regained quite a lot of elements of the originals, with FO4 and 76 proceeding on a very different path.
---
I repeat, you may like it, but I can't call that Fallout.

---
I'd be down for that. I mean there should be no reason a massive collections of weighted armor plates are silent enough to sneak even if you've got a stealth boy generator thing.
---
Though this is coming from a player who does not use power armor personally. It's loud, clunky and makes you move slower. The armor is meh and carry weight has never been a issue for me as I don't travel with 500+ pounds on me and my stash is never full.
---
Nah, you and all dupers will be banned. Your accounts, IPs, credit cards, everything. I have already reported to beth.
---
Its a bugged outfit at least the hood is. I have found the hood at Top of the world and at the surrounding buildings a few times.
---
Eh, single player game with half-assed co-op and a god awful pvp system.
---
150 fixes but how many NEW bugs and problems come with it?
---
That would be cool apart from I'm on pc.
---
Do you think we will ever see  cross play?
---
Apart from the pvp I don't see the PC having much advantage over console lol 
---
Hence pvp servers for you to go be a spaz while we rebuild together and fight the plague on pve servers. ;)
---
If tse is debuffed so does mellee in 
---
Well for the rifle, have you tried it? It sounds like a full fledged 50 cal now and not just the same piddly sound 4 had
---
No. 
---
They are fine as they are. They do land, and there are ways to force them to land.
---
nah. just change it so you can have any card active or inactive at a time. and tie special to just character growth.
---
They are fine as they are, except for the loot table. That could be improved.
---
why not 1 thousand lbs?
---
And from a selling perspective I have also realized that the Hard Bargain perk is absolute garbage as well. All the problems described above are only going to  get worse if you have level 3 Hard Bargain equipped because it will allow you to sell fewer items for more caps. Making it even more frustrating.
---
It is a useful perk when buying expensive items from vendors, like serums for example. Players can also craft serums and they sell them for 250 to 500 caps, so this perk loses it's quality.
---
It's sad to see how many perk cards are useless most of the time, simply because Bethesda didn't play/test their own game.
---
No crossplay because PS4 is uncompliant. D: the FPS are a lot better on PC. XBOX ONE X in 4k it's like 25fps usuallly. Also the loading and changing menus etc is much better on PC. Server hopping though is better on console as the game sometimes freezes at the loading screen on PC.
---
Ultracite too pls
---
Cool, thanks I'll check it out. I am a Fallout hoarder and watching my weight has been one of the more challenging parts of the game.
---
No no you have it wrong its not dog food its department of giving food the standard rations for the enclave
---
It has other downsides. You're slower, jump less high, can't use certain weapons, don't get any legendary armor effects, can't use crafting stations or interact with furniture, etc. 
---
There's lots of limitations and sneaking effectively is already made difficult in PA, and entirely removing the ability to do Sneak Attack damage or the ability to lose your foes by hiding somewhere seems like a big extra penalty to slap on top.
---
Yeah thats because she has only a few lines. If she had more, it would be better
---
I don't think that sort of gameplay split is right for this game. I respect your desire but I think the stated goal for this game to have a pvp/pve mix is a noble one and worth refining and improving rather than just giving up. 
---
No PvP makes workshop ownership an uncontested dictatorship. 
---
Amazingly the vast majority of people I've encountered are not interested in being jerks to each other which is different from how I remember games with mixed PvP/pve being 
---
&gt; Stealth tank. 
---
That does sound kind of oxymoronic, haha.
---
I agree with this 100%!
---
I don't understand dupers. It more fun to travle the map and get loot by killing Gorda of enemies then standing in one spot doing a glitch
---
Might find something you were not expecting to fun. I guess they do it because of easy cap and it's faster to dupe then to scrounge.
---
They said it's in today's patch. 
---
I put over 1500 rounds from a TSE Gatling gun in her last night with 5 other players and wasn’t even close to killing her. My gun does 660 damage per shot.
---
He downvoted, he realised he wants all the others to suffer from his moronic idea too.
---
At least you tried lol
---
I can only craft at 45 max. So I assumed that’s the cap for that weapon. 
---
It literally is, huh? How about spiritually? PvP is utterly broken and the most PvP inclined people I know are the last gamers I would recommend this to knowing the other options.
---
Judging from the price tags at slocums Joe’s you’d need a fair bit of prewar money.  30$ for a cup and a donut, oof da 
---
They need to buff deathclaws.. in fallout 1 and 2 they were endgame monsters and would eat you alive if you weren't prepared. Fallout 3 and 4 they were tough but didn't seem as deadly, just dangerous. In 76 "oh it's a death claw? Meh.."
---
Tldr; deathclaws need a huge buff and should be extremely dangerous 
---
Deathclaw loot &gt;  Scorchbeast loot
---
Oh that makes sense guess I just need it for mods then.
---
Well its Chinese so....
---
I keed
---
Great list.  Please add that recipes and plans also have weight.  I was hoarding them and could not find where my weight was hiding, it was in my plans.  Fusion Cores also take up too much weight for thier worth, only carry one spare, the Mr Handy in Whitesprings changed my fusion core for me today when I was beeping about at the front door, I don't know if this is a thing, or I was just lucky, it is worth hanging about them when you are out of power and have no spare to see if they will sort you out though.
---
 what some call a nerf the devs call correcting an unintended glitch or mechanic. A typo here or there. 
---
Still kinda pissed at feed the people "nerf"
---
&gt; Do you really think that there is only 2 best nuke spots in this huge map?
---
Yes, and you've given us no reason to think otherwise with your clickbaity wank.
---
Scorchbeasts were only acceptable for me till around level 30. Then they became a chore. Now I am level 180+ and I fight them with ease, yet I still share your perspective on them.
---
no
---
As melee... I hate them. When they land I just stand there punching them in the crotch. They really aren’t hard just annoying as hell.
---
Oh okay, thanks for clarifying, I honestly didn’t know. It just seemed weird that this would cause such a drastic glitch but duping somehow doesn’t (I wish it would). 
---
Sure, begging the question is a type of logical fallacy, it doesn't mean "raises the question" even though people use it like that all the time. Wikipedia will explain it better than I can:
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging_the_question

and besides there is armour that offers better damage protection than X-01

Scorchbeast are broken they are a minor nuisance to me as their little sonic boom spam tickles it does no damage to me at all and when they spam I don’t run I just stand there and get myself a glass of water. I just worry that I might lag out due to sonic boom spam making my framerate drop a bit. Scorchbeast definitely need a timer like automatically having to land after 20 seconds. It’s a very annoying fight for a melee player.
---
Also just as a wish list item.. let us take the fev sample 52 or whatever it was from westek and turn into a deathclaw. You all know we want to play as ghouls, supermutants and deathclaws. That would add alot of variety to the game 
---
TSE firearms for one, make you lazy. 
---
I know. I have a shotgun and minigun. 
---
However, the sad fact is that for some ranged builds like pistols, there is no other weapon to make the builds viable at end game. So you can either jump on the melee/heavy/shotgun boat, or swim very slowly with those arm floaty things they put on toddlers. 
---
The problem is both with the legendary drop system, TSE being affected by perk modifiers AND demolition. That is what makes it really gross. Stacking 60 and 100% bonuses to damage. You can easily push a TSE shotgun into the 2k to 3k damage range. The guns are broken because the system is broken because the people in charge at bethesda are greedy, complacent, and willing to shoehorn netcode onto a game they released years ago.
---
Thats all Fo76 is. Fallout 4 with netcode. 
---
This could actually work and give builds real meaning. Quickly to the ideabox!
---
And WTF is up with the damage output on reused weapons? 66 damage on an assault rifle (semi-auto) with almost all the rifleman perks and bloody mess maxed. Come on BGS.
---
Scary Gargoyle monsters (flying Deathclaws)? &lt;shiver&gt;
---
The only thing I could see worse than this?  Jet-Pack enabled Col Gutsy.   Or Jet-Pack Enabled Assaultron Dominators.
---
Begging the question is a logical fallacy that occurs when an argument's premises assume the truth of the conclusion, instead of supporting it. It is a type of circular reasoning and an informal fallacy: an argument that requires that the desired conclusion be true. This often occurs in an indirect way such that the fallacy's presence is hidden, or at least not easily apparent.
---
Yeh lead is a bitch, which is why I hit up the Charlestown fire dept. Just shove the scrapper perk on for lots off of weapons you scrap
---
The only weapon you can't use is fist and honestly thats a horribily small group of players anyway. Most fisters don't need PA anyway and get by fine in nukezones with hazmats.
---
You can customize your pip light to "bright" making it on par if not better due to it being yellow, than your pip boy.
---
Don't need legendary effects on PA atm because no other armor compares, has the durability or ease of repair. t60 vs lvl 50 metal cheat armor .... plastic and steel vs a slue of mats and ballistic fiber.
---
As to crafting? Really? You're marking that as a down side? No, just no. As you can just jump out and back in within the safety of a station or your own base. Losing your what .. 10 seconds total from PA animations?
---
The benefits of PA greatly, GREATLY outweigh the trivial things you brought up. With little to no downside.
---
Yeah tell I Al know well about the freezes on the loading screen, I average 55 fps on the PC.
---
It does some times go a little crazy on the fps when the server isn't playing nicely.
---
It's a shame tho as I think it would make the game a whole lot better 
---
&gt;  They need to put about 10 second delays between looting things like water, stuff from boxes
---
Fuck no.
---
They need to learn how to program.
---
Before they nerfed Mirelurk Queen acid attack damage, back when I still could handle two hundreds of hits from glowing ghouls yet was two-shotted by her, she could 2v1 scorchbeasts easily
---
I can't wait to get yet another Furious LMG. That first double damage shot is a game changer! At least they sell for good caps.
---

Diluted Radaway will sometimes cure a mutation though, especially if you take two in a row.
---
For sure, and also having like 100 people on the server instead of 26~
---
You know what I found in FO76 yesterday?  A Super Mutant Suicider!!!   I killed him and he did not explode a mini-nuke, but seemed like a lower area grenade went off. I thought they did not exist.   I found him when going to the BOS camp near West-Tek,
---
Good thing i waited and got the Game for 20€
---
I know your pain got killed by that yesterday day three times. Lots a total of 300 caps which I was trying to save up for plans from vendors 
---
I'm more referring to the people who play the game spouting the tired BS line of 'This is for people to play together, not go around killing each other' when it was literally announced as both.
---
Thanks, now i wont be able to think of motherlode as anything else....
---
I would argue that basically....just nevermind.
---
The vendor at harpers ferry sold me a dragon at lvl 35. If you switch worlds a bunch it should show up eventually. It does a ton of damage, my biggest problem with it is low durability. Just near the entrance to harpers ferry there is a tiny building filled with ammo, too.
---
Good luck!
---
This is what I fear as well so I won't have my hopes up. 
---
That helps a lot thank you 
---
????
---
Perhaps when it came out, yes, it was horribly unbalanced and extremely difficult for players, but in its current form its actually quite a decent game. It is visually gorgeous, for a start. Enemies are no longer high damage output bullet sponges, once you're running certain builds the game actually becomes trivially easy. 
---
As much as I like FO76, I must say that The Division has a much, much better endgame, since it actually has one. Lots of DLCs and new map areas with rewarding missions, monthly events that can give you great loot, and there's even the daily/weekly HVT missions where you kill boss enemies for high end loot and consumables. FO76 currently has......none of that. The SBQ is the only glimpse we have of an endgame, cooperative community event.
---
Except there's no animation for them getting down 😞 they just kinda snap to upright standing state and fall downward
---
I beleieve stacking bobbleheads is on their fix list..  
---
I have become death, the destroyer of worlds.
---
I will say. At one point it was wise to follow the main story line as you leveled up pretty fast. Though due to the exp nerfs you have to grind a bit in the lower levels to move on now. The map linked by Arma should help a bit with that.
---
Kind of like a scorchbeast.
---
I stayed because even when the game launched, to horrible reviews, I still love Fallout. 
---
I stayed to see if any improvements would be made, in the hopes that it could be my game, but now there’s just an increasing amount of ‘Okay, I put in X amount of time, but Ive reaches the limit and I’m leaving’
---
It’s kind of weird being subbed, and I guess I’ll eventually leave, but for now I’m just reading about shitty legendary drops, tiny inventories and plastic/nylon/canvas bags
---
It would be much easier if there were actual limits of items in weapon &amp; armor tab.     
---
       
---
I'm no developer and before that issue I never thought about wether 500-700 different item id's break your pipboy or not. I saw dupers carry up to 3.2 million and they are fine because they only have like 50-200 different item ids but stacked a thousand times each.     
---
I never figured that simple map farming could have such an impact while some players force crashes for duping and stay fine with their absurd inventories.
---
See you’re triggered because I have a fully subjective opinion. 
---
I don't mind this idea in theory, problem is, my entire character is built for stealth multipliers and crits and I can't go into a Nuke zones without power armour.  They need to fix that issue first.
---
26 people, wow I'm lucky if I see about 10 people sometimes on the server.
---
Sometimes it does get a bit lonely, I've had it we're it's been days until I run into some one and either help them out of trade.
---
Unless your at the golf course and farming the legendarys I don't see many people 
---
The top of Seneca rocks is the highest point in the game
---
Nothing more than a waste of ammo 
---
Weird
---
Doesnt let me enter data so I can't use it, but I appreciate the idea. Wish they would put "stack weight" and "category weight total" in the game menus.
---
If most people wanna wear it, why the hell make it less convenient? That's not a smart move for the studio, because people *want* to wear Power Armor. It's badass.
---
And holy crap, jump down my throat about my reasons much? They're mostly inconveniences but if people wear it 90% of the time those add up fast.
---
Ya you can change Headlamps, if you find one, and there isn't a Headlamp mod for Excavator which is pretty annoying. It's also not a better lamp anyway, because the bright combined with the HUD can give a tunnel vision effect for plenty of people. Not with the Pip-boy.

I love the random letter in that URL. If I had a pet deathclaw I would name him Blagozord. 
---
Thought so as most quests or story quests only give you one level or half a level depending how many enemie you kill along the way.
---
Player v Player and Player V Environment do not mix well at all. Noble goal sure but its not a good mix its different crowds.
---
PVP servers would be a cross of PVE/PVP for your type. Most likely based on their post it would be current with no hold bars. PVE would be similar to now with permanent pacifist mod that effects camps.
---
A simple toggle choice in settings that you set for you to find pvp or pve servers.
---
Games like world of warcraft do it very well (even though not a current fan of BFA).
---
No one should ever be against it since our shards are only 24 people at a time. 
---
Oh btw, i found this video that describes perfectly how do I fell about the topic: \[Why Fallout Isn't Fallout - 20th Anniversary Analysis | Interplay vs. Bethesda's Fallout\]https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=amtsN-NRqwM&amp;index=20&amp;list=LLpXwEHU4kJkihR6IMI5FlmQ))
---
Becouse level scaling to higest player around, it is more like forrest 1-15. Ash heap 25. rest 50+.
---
Well no as scorch beasts evolved from bats were deathclaws were made by humans as a exspermental weapon in the great war.
---
According to Howard, Zenimax lent a hand with this game. Even if they didn’t, the makers of Fo76 could type a simple email to somebody who made ESO and ask what worked and what didn’t work. Did the Fo76 team play the other game or read a fuckin article about it? This doesn’t seem all that complicated in concept. 
---
It's not broken though. 
---
certainly an interesting idea; I wouldn't mind seeing it un a future fallout game. 
---
Does this work with Hardened Masses? 
---
A Pastor with no Pastor vestments? Sacrilege! /s
---
Very nice camp, the idea with that indoor pool is great. I would also like to place my camp at the Ohio but i'm afraid most nice spots there are overpopulated because many people seem to like to build there. Probably kinda annoying if your camp cant be placed 9 of out 10 times because the spot is taken. Do you experience that often?
---
Yeah I dont see anyone either unless the SBQ event is up. Ghosty roaaaaddssss...
---
Most does exist strewn across the web, with a whole bunch of individual websites all performing a different function. My goal is to have everything in one place. 
---
Flying Deathclaws with flame breath = Dragons.
---
I absolutely agree, they didn’t break any rules, so I don’t see why there should be any punishment at all.
---
They are after the Brotherhood Vendorbot. It sucks too, because he often will leave the area and you won't be able to find him at his shop as he chases down those infinitely spawning robots.
---
So my meagre kills have been 2xkilling trying to take my friends workshop and they had already killed him.  He was a lvl 12 on that character his main was a lvl 80.  They left straight after and blocked me.  No hassle.
---
Next 1xkill had killed a low levels then started on their workshop.  I had a short chase and killed them.  Leaving their scrap but the other person took it.  Then the "raider gang turns up" so I switched server.  Taking the advice of others on here.
---
Since then I have noted several trap scenarios, usually a low level wanted but higher level friends in game.  As I watch the map, I do spot where 3 or 4 players clump up then bomburst, then one goes wanted.
---
I think it's something Bethesda encourages in designing the game as is.  Then it's just a question of whether you play nice, bounty hunter or raider.  
---
Ah that makes sense was wondering if it was a server glitch when a glowing blouted ghole shows up to ruin my day. 
---
Not really, you posted a straightforward, matter-of-fact comment that isn't constructive in the slightest, bashing another game that is also well known for its disappointing release, so I'm just giving you my opinion back. 
---
Yet, because you can't think of anything else to say, you just turn on ultra-defensive mode, sprout internet buzzwords and downvote my comment instead.
---
Calmex was always rare tho wasn’t it? That’s like the rarest chem
---
Doesn't it count as heavy armour and reduce your sneak effectiveness? Not sure why we'd need it nerfed if that's the case.
---
So, what is an armored target? Robots and players in PA?
---
I go through this list ever few days and take out troll posts I see, some do get missed unfortunately. I’ll go through it again today
---
If u ever need assistance from Junior to purchase the plans on PS4.. let me know. 
---
Hey, if you didn't get it, you didn't get it. It's okay.
---
The rest were smart enough to understand what I'm saying.
---
This is one of the only quests that follow the story progression you expect of an RPG. Because of that it might be one of the best F76 quests.
---
Nah I posted my feelings about a game I don’t play anymore (subjective) and you’re posting paragraphs defending the game you like (also subjective). Not that you’ve done anything wrong, but you could take a deep breath and move on or you can stay butthurt because I said I don’t like the division
---
Vault-tec paint should include heavy leather arm.
---
haha well I havnt been known to be good at following the rules.... 
---
Actually the spot I am in now, has never had to be moved. Im near the haunted cabins and you can hear weird banshee scream from my CAMP. I did have a lakehouse before on the southside of the map and every other login it was occupied.  The only problem with this location is that there is always creatures there when I login or fast travel back. Sometimes they spawn in my pool lol...
---
happened to me 2 days ago and not too long ago i didn’t crash once, so the crashing is mainly from duper’s?
---
That’s cool would be helpful if you put which mod you used also I normally use combat armor or leather armor. 
---
Yeah 
---
"What’s the new meta guyysssss?"
---
"Is there a new method for duping yet since Beth broke the last one in the patch hyuck hyuck"
---
"Anybody found those Helvetia masks they talked about in the noclip doc?"
---
Eh, the problem here is the teammate still loses max health from the radiation gain.
---
or ppl just figured out (most of them) that they can sell duped shit for real money on ebay. 
---
I typically run my chainsaw or a vanilla heavy .50 for whiteprings nukes with a TSE on backup incase the newbies get in too deep at the golf club.
---
I tend to hang back, lob a molotov at the entrance, let the little ones chew at the pack for a little bit, and then let Ma Deuce sing a sick bass line to my murder music. 
---
Most of what I pick up is crap, I dump it in the locker room red storage box for anyone that wants it. I'm beyond caring about drops or farming or leveling at this point. The game is such a fucking shambles that my only purpose in continuing to play is to make someone elses experience a little less shitty.
---
Btw, i am aware that it should be "lovers" but i dont know how to change it now. 
---
This is how I feel as well there would be no point in having side arms in this game. 
---
More like a new Necromancy Cult...
---
Fwiw, the only thing I really hate about fighting SBs are that stupid sonic thing. It’s annoying AF.
---
 What this game needs is a quiet SB.
---
Because it is insanely imbalanced? How is this something that is beyond many people?
---
Tell me, in what games do you get to where a outer mecha shell and still are able to be a stealth assassin undetectable and fully armored? I can't think of any, more so that are multi player. It's about balance, not feels.
---
Holy crap, giving you info is not jumping down your throat no need to feel like a snowflake that has been crushed under the weight of a shoe. But you're points got debunked. Without any vulgarity and quite nicely comparred to how many others would have handled it on reddit.
---
Headlamps are in the vendors and I have found dozens. Thats an excuse that does not sit well. If you're then going to complain about vendor hoping .. have we been playing the same game? That is PART of the game and one we need to deal with atm till they can fix how vendors handle inventory.
---
I've not heard of tunnel vision from the PA. Though if these people who are ALWAYS in PA. Then they might want to jump out and use the pip boy, but they arnt .. they use the "bright" head light. But I'm not worried about a small minority vs the entire majority. Since I am not here fighting for the epileptics, deaf or mute. Players who need far more attention than the ones who get tunnel vision from a light.
---
Just travel around white springs during a nuke and even outside it. You'll see more than a few "bright" head lamps on.
---
Howl like a Deathclaw!.
---
Aaaahwuuuraaaaasgggh!!!!!!!
---
It does sound like a Deathclaw!
---
Your name is quite accurate.
---
The map gives you an orientative idea, as mentioned, scaling can add surprises.
---
Bethesda had to write the Enclave in somehow.
---
Surely you mean a trebuchet?!
---
Heck no...
---
Then we end up with "Scrap All Junk" screwing you over big time just like it does with "Hardened Mass".
---
I'm in the same boat. I want to buy some things. The new lights, the map, but until this is fixed I can't even get purified water, let alone decorate.
---
Well i hope they do. This is the last patch and if they haven't fixed the ghost weight on my character im just uninstalling and never coming back. Also ill probably get my next Bethesda games from G2A/Pirate Bay.
---
Agreed.
---
Some people just want to be able to do it all without compromises. Those people need single player games, not online games.
---
You didn't say "I don't like the division", you called it a "terrible game", which is not the same thing. Pretty much the equivalent of someone posting on this subreddit saying "game is trash lul" to a flurry of mass downvotes. Don't patronise me.
---
Yes. Why should we be stuck w/the same paint job when we can create higher level PA pieces.
---
I predict that people will claim the patch introduces an ACTUAL trade-steal glitch to validate the years of content already published on that.
---
 2 826 669 460 000 kilometers ...... Thats  70534484 trip around earth. So you want division somewhere in space so you can look at sky and think about it?
---
Don't like the op's idea? Downvote and move on. You're failing on the edgy front.
---
don’t really wanna make a whole post about a hat so might as well do it here, anyone know what kind of hat the one in the tuxedo bundle is? 
---
I thought we have "Nuke zone", well whatever.
---
The one armor that might prevent you from being one shotted ruins pvp? Right....
---
The forest region is best for like 1-15 I’d say, bottom right for 15-25, middle for like 25-35, and the mire and cranberry bog around 50. That’s how I played at least 
---
There should be a quest to get that black excavator paint that you seen the posters, like how you get the t51 Nuka Cola paint
---
If you don’t want to be patronized you should have brushed it off. Not my fault you can’t figure out that I don’t like the division when I say “that game sux”
---
Thank you for the comment 
---
.....yes?
---
Same, I solo'ed 3 scorchbeasts at the same time... 20 minutes later, I got a few non-lgendary pipe weapons and some meat.
---
I only had normal guns to fight with and it exhausted all my extensive ammo on 2 different guns and broke my melee weapon.
---
This is it. But only once unless they reconnect to the server
---
That would save me a lot of time as I have a level 51 and a level 12 
---
Hawke refugee, just disarm all the can traps in there, 2 steel 1 lead per can, perfect for making bullets 
---
Because again, liking a game and thinking it's good aren't necessarily the same thing. I like FO76, but I wouldn't call it a "good game", it has too many bugs and too many other issues to be a good game yet.
---
True I guess that dose add the hole dangers of the land in to it
---
More like don't care packages. 
---
r/fo76settlements 
---
Love it OP you should share it with the rest of us on the building sub. :)
---
Sounds like were pretty much on the same page there... I have two loadouts for crafting armor and weps, two each for both solo play and team play  (using PA and not using PA), and lastly one just for Team play using PA in nuke zones. 
---
  To me I don't think it's OP, it's just a work around to fix a F'ed up perk system and something that Bethesda should have included in the first place considering the limited number of total points, limits on points per category and the fact that there really should be a separate passive perk tree (like fallout 4) for things like crafting, lock picking, hacking (pretty much everything that isn't a direct combat related perk).
---
That place is great for farming mutations.
---
Your first and biggest mistake was taking a comment that included a number I typed randomly literally and your second mistake was taking it so seriously. Now, get down off your high horse and stop replying
---
yeah then it uses echo location and **REEE's** the shit out of you
---
The ticket prices at uncanny caverns arnt too bad, although that could be just an error.
---
They would enrage a lot of players with a wipe. The better solution is the level cap increase of gear. Just up it all by 25 levels and all the duping becomes meaningless.
---
Yeah why we have tattoos on forehead, when we could have them on our armor. **WE NEED UNICORN TATTOO FOR ARMOR!**
---
I could see it either way, but don't make it by taking away crouch. I get stuck in the terrain ALL the time, and sometimes crouching will get me out of it. 
---
For many this isnt about being sneaky. 
---
Other reasons are the fact you are not on the map, you can tell when someone is nearby in deep forest. 
---
Sure. A stealth mode would work less than a non-power armor sneak but unless the mechanics account for these differences then no. 
---
My power armor should be able to tell who is nearby BETTER than a sneak from amplified senses. 
---
Being tech it can scramble the ‘satellite’ providing my location information. 
---
The computing power carried in my power armor should provide SUPERIOR accuracy in VATs. With enhanced capabilities I should be shooting wings off gnats at 1000 yards. 
---
So - I’ll see your no crouching in power armor when power armor is what it could be ;~)
---
The Prisoner Collar adds a little bit of a Raider touch to it.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/jhkLzh2.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/jhkLzh2.jpg)
---
Only takes 45 5mm bullets for me.
---
They should have different damage outputs towards players, I agree. Then they could buff damage to mobs, and only slightly buff it to Players. So many people try to build turrets at me as I pass their C.A.M.P or Workshop. It used to work, but now that I’ve been end game for a while now it’s like kids throwing rocks. And even this late in, not many people use anything other than regular turrets anyway.
---
If you want to do that, than I shouldn’t be 1 shotted in PA by a player in PvP. Wearing it I should be able to take a massive beating. Which I can’t, so nerf the crap out of sneaky snipers instead. 
---
Nice Uppercut!
---
I think you are also a duper, reported.
---
to bad but maybe if they change that animation a Little scorchbeasts can do the same with a drop-down animation
---
You've wasted your ammo regardless
---
Sometimes its easier yes.  Sometimes not.  I remember running from 3 SB all the way south from the bottom edge of the map; where the fissure is toward middle, all the way up to Lewisville? Or whatever town that is.  The one north of that trainstation.  Prob took me 30 minutes of running north and walking while AP regens.
---
I find it easier just to kill them once you get aggro.   But like the above poster said, takes huge ammo and stims.
---
I have upped my energy resist quite a bit and seems they don't do nearly as much damage as they used to.  (500 resist).   I'm always non-PA.   I assumed it was rad-based damage, but does not seem to be the case here.  I know it does not give radiation but assumed that rad resist would help against those like helps against Gamma Guns.
---
Argh I played so much if F4 in PA.  I love my PA in F76.  I don't sneak in it but if I wanted to what's the big deal.  OMG you believe in Stealth Boys but not in silent mechanical frames.  Anyway with my Turtle Beach set up correctly I can hear them coming before I ever see some PA players.  
---
Maybe we should all be running around naked showing off ATOM bought tats.
---
I deleted the game from my ps4 already. But go ahead pls 😂😂
---
Anyone else feel lied to about the hot rod paints being limited time and now they're on the atom store? But the blackbird paint isn't? 
---
What a fucking scam, I knew they'd add paints that looked like hot rodder, and I knew they'd be on the atom store, but they're so devalued now because they're freely available any day of the week...
---
Dup item, sell item for real money or caps.  If sold for caps, sell caps for real money.  Pay your third world digital sweatshop workers pennies on the dollar, and repeat.
---
&gt;BGS knew from Fallout 4 that TSE are totally over the board OP
---
I think I know what you're getting at, but weapons could only get one legendary effect at a time in FO4. But yeah, explosive was OP then too and TS was at least very powerful, though arguably less so than in FO76.
---
It takes the Calmex.
---
It puts the dog food on it's skin.
---
It puts the dog food in the basket. 
---
IT PUTS THE DOG FOOD....IN. THE. BASKET!
---
Unfortunately we have all done this 
---
You're giving me information I already have, and being super condescending and dismissive. That's not "nicely". We have been playing the same game, I've been playing since Beta as I'm sure you have too. And debunked is a matter of opinion, because that's what all of this is, opinion. Opinion and preferences about the game elements.
---
I have Bright. My point was it's basically required because the normal one sucks. Small inconveniences do add up.
---
As for balance, if you're worried about that they should just lower the resistances for PA or up them for regular armor. Balancing it by making an entire element unviable for part of the Player base is just a poor choice if they want to attract &amp; appeal to the most people.
---
And why bring other games into it? Of course no other game has your walking around in a suit like this, **that's the appeal**, and exactly why they should be keeping it easy to use, because Players are drawn to the game in part because of the PA. Why d'you think they made parts and cores even easier to get since 4? To make it easier for people to wear PA, because that's exactly what most people wanna do.
---
Thanks captain obvious. We're talking about camps.
---
There is no such thing as not possible.  This is an assumption and nothing more.  Whether or not they do anything about it is a different story.
---
I completely agree. The problem is not the TSE weapon itself. It is that you can stack too many other perks with it (magazines, bobble heads).
---
I'm pretty sure the perk doesn't work in combat
---
ppl  that never use pacifist mode, thanks for your caps.
---
ok.. you will need to provide your lvl51 protection services.. and most importantly caps of course :)
---
PM me if interested.. I might be online 5pm gmt for an hour or so.. also maybe later after..
---
I love this idea! 
---
Well then, that's the last time Bethesda will get any money out of me.
---
Tnx! 
---
And just stay there getting my armor destroyed and spending ammo and stimpacks on something that I'll eventually give up on anyway? 
---
No thanks.
---
Yes, the current game rules punish elaborate workshop builders who have to fix up random acts of violence.
---
But, is that a good thing for the game's sustainable health in terms of active players ?
---
I love it when I find super mutants fighting a rad scorpion or ghouls fighting rad stags. It’s hilarious and a great part of the game. I wish the various scorched in a nuke zone would fight each other instead of just us. I just got enforcer level 3 and it’s a hilarious perk. Fast travel to white springs, go afk for a second and suddenly level 92 glowing death claw! Sweep the leg! Now he’s a glowing twitching mess on the floor while I beat him with a bat
---
I agree with that map except for Toxic Valley.   If you're under 25 and see a Snallygaster, GTFO.
---
I was stoked the first time I fought one, I was level 35, it circled me a few times then landed and I beat it to death fairly quickly with a 2 handed war drum and only used 2 stimpacks, got some decent loot afterwards too so I was pretty happy.
---
Saw another one in the wild over by Drop Site V9, I hid in the bunker and started getting ready to fight it and a second one arrived.  I thought 'Why not take them both on'. At this point they some how found me inside the bunker and proceeded to wreck me with splash damage attacks through the walls and floor of the bunker even with an internal door shut and me hiding up in the back corner. I went out to take them on and was spammed with sonic attacks for 2-3 minutes before they landed and I was able to melee them to death quickly. Used a tonne of stimpacks and broke my lever action trying to shoot them down.
---
Definitely need some AI and scripting work.
---
I'm glad I'm not the only one who thought that.
---
2days after implementing this: "BeThESdA fIx Ur gAmE, wHy AuTo sCraP MOnEY???"
---
The Enclave missions are pretty much what completes the game, in a sense
---
Well, yeah you still have to be careful, the map is just an overview.
---
By the way the Heavy Welded Raider compared to Heavy BoS Combat is 81 to 86 physical damage resist, so not much difference.
---
It also looks cool.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/t5NEZ0g.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/t5NEZ0g.jpg)
---
Would be more helpful if you weren't actively deleting the content.
---
right
---
Sure with TSE weapons.  But I dont like cheating.
---
How would they do it? That's a genuine question by the way, not taking a snarky tone. From what I've read on reddit it wouldn't be possible, but I'm not a developer so I wouldn't know where to begin.
---
Problem with this reasoning is that this game is not like previous Fallout games any more. For one, there's mutations, which are a big part of many builds. Problem with that is RadX suppresses them, which limits your options. There's also going into nuke zones as "endgame", which previous games didn't have, and exposes you to even more rads than normal gameplay. Which means you need tools to be able to deal with it. In short, the stuff from previous games can't hold, when they made so many changes in this game. And many of the changes are very poorly thought out, like lack of melee option to deal with flyers (whereas ranged do have an option to deal with melee, via Blocker perk, and there's no equivalent perk for melee to reduce incoming ranged damage 45%), and lack of armor that offers sufficient protection in nuke zones, without suppressing mutations, and that breaks a number of builds completely.
---
It's a game where people with weapons kill/destroy things. Why get mad when people attack no matter the level they are.  You dont like people attacking you or your camp, build better defenses, lvl up, change servers, etc.  People shouldn't have to play a certain way just to please you or others like you. I just had another player message me telling me to leave someone alone. A little advice, dont ever tell someone else how to play a game THEY bought! Tf of here with calling us toxic players. We're playing the game how it's allowing us to play and how we choose to play so get used to it!! 
---
Yeah, I dont mind when it's a higher level player. But lvl 14 vs. my 80 feels more like picking on the littlest kid on the playground.
---
weren't there also a couple excavator pa skins shown in the e3 trailer? i might be mistaken about that though.
---
It happened to me in that town with the spring flowers festival* set up. Fucker kited me (level 10-15, forgot exactly) through four more supermutant spawns. I died repeatedly but did in fact kill his ass dead in the end. 
---
*is nobody gonna question why, when the bombs fell in October, there was a town having a Spring Flowers festival?
---
He can easily apply his idea in his game, without making us edgy about it here.Different armors and setups have different sneak capabilities, learn and use.
---
Lore hasn't stopped them with a bunch of stuff already in the game, stop giving them ideas.
---
I'm only against it because I'm for the noble experiment of trying to do it. 
---
Warcraft does do it well. 
---
We could here too. We could limit it to faction vs faction PvP or many other options to try before segregating players away from each other ala trammel and felucca 
---
Hi! Thank you, but I think I'm too new it says I don't have enough Karma points for that subreddit?
---
You don't pick kids on playground???? Where are you from..... 
---
*screams externally*
---
But then they'd likely float around the sky like that at night
---
 I throw my last bomb in a closed crack, I wanted to see what happened As I supposed, nothing happened. it only collects tons of yellow flow 
---
Furious is increasing damage per hit and in 4 was the most powerful effect possible for a rapid-fire weapon ...
---
I’ll up vote just because I couldnt happen to agree more, but next time read more carefully as I did state that ESO is exclusively the only MMO I play.
---
There was a similar post to this warning against lower level people who attack your CAMP doing something similar.  Basically someone shows up and just punches a wall or something to get a small bounty, acts as a minor annoyance, the instant you the CAMP owner attack their 2-3 high level buddies show up and destroy everything they can.
---
Somewhere over the rainbow.
---
Beautiful shot, loading screen worthy.
---
The paints in the atom shop should apply to ALL armor.  At least then it would justify the cost.
---
i think the whole outfit except the gas mask is buggy. There's no reason a jacket should be so rare. And the hood shouldn't remove your facial hair and make you bald
---
Ahh bugger well let me upvote your posts here to boost ya.
---
Easy revenge kills with TSE weapons. Nobody wants to get one shotted by TSE circlejerkers.
---
This little fellow was Just stadig there doing nothing... Didnt wanna start the fight so i Just took a couple of photos. I did get bored at the end and tried to kill him, but he was still standing there, looking at me with those bih sad eyes. 
---
I’d be ok with a partial wipe : keep pc progression (levels, plans known, map discovery, atoms) and scrap all possessions to stash.
---
TSE is not needed. I posted this somewhere else yesterday but I crit-spammed a level 65 to about 1/4 health with one magazine with an simple one \* Zealots combat rifle. If they actually dropped something of value I'd be farming them.
---
Are there bugs that get around pacifist mode?  I keep pacifist mode on, but have been killed and lost caps.  I was in Whitespring, not near any camps, but was using an explosive pistol.
---
It’s not top of the world? 
---
 I didn't realize the hot rod paint was back in the attom shop, I'll have to check that one out when I get home tonight
---
Get rid of the TSE and fight them.
---
Ok let's see should be on around 7:00 ish UK time and I always play with my wife who is also level 51. so yeah if we get junk, legendary loot and caps out of it while helping someone that sounds like fun might also have a level 37 join us as the have been with us for the past day or too
---
This lowbie shows up to fight. If I'm not fighting, I'm dropping free supplies off to the ones who are fighting, then going about my business. Not all lowbies are a-holes. Js.
---
If the PvP system scales up for lower levels, we should lose caps equal to the killers level than my level. 
---
Level 49 kills a level 100 the level 100 loses 49 caps (because they just got killed by a scaled up player) 
---
Level 100 kills a level 49 the level 49 should lose 100 caps (the level 49 has been scaled up AND killed by a higher level) 
---
I'm not sure this would work but it would stop lower levels picking fights with higher levels, then being scaled up, then 2 hitting with a TSE for bare caps. It's unfair that a level 100 can't cream a level 50 when they're being aggressive. 
---
Current state : fun
---
Tbh, you dont really need a tool for that, you can do this with simply sql commands from a console/power shell, cmd. After i read some proper documentation about their db, i could probably remove a player inventory in a few minutes, unless they have some really strage db setups.
---
... it's almost as if this game is built around an engine and system for single player games 🤔
---
yeah I did some of those, do they keep going once you drop the bomb?
---
I agree with the average player part.  I use a player-made handmade with all the non-auto rifle/agility perks and some of the luck crit perks.   It takes me anywhere from 60 seconds to 10 minutes to kill those SB and tons of ammo.  For what?  a few pieces of meat and some XP.  I can get much more XP and chances of legendary from a single glowing ghoul with very little ammo.
---
I tried to understand their drops from even a lore prospective.... what is pre-war money gonna do anyone? Did they seriously believe after a nuclear Armageddon that there still be stores around that you can spend that money on?
---
Scorbeasts are the twitter of the wastelands.

It works for all ammo, but if you only craft 1 at a time then 80% extra is less than 2 so you still only craft 1.
---
Yup, but the power armour stand isn't there? Obviously I bought the paint first thinking id rather have limited paint than limted camp item, then they make the paint available and the stand limted... thanks for making that nice and clear  B 
---
Because theyre more interested in hiring rapists as community managers an helping them pay for legal fees to try getting away with rapes an murder etc an it being broadcasted and broadcasted at those rapist community managers requests.
---
Tomorrow we get a patch with over 150 bug fixes. Sooo pretty dang happy right now to see what it fixes.
---
You can do it manually yeah, but it's far more labor intensive. Especially because before they're going to be willing to restore or delete anything they're going to want to verify a person's basis for requesting such a thing.
---
That gets pretty hard to do when you're just looking at raw data without any sort of tool for interpreting it. 
---
You have to request access to edit it it seems. Also, without other groups, it's only partly helpful. Aid takes up a lot of weight in your stash box.
---
I just wish that crouching was used for more than just sneaking..  like actually being able to crouch under things, instead of hitting some invisible wall where there is clearly enough room.
---
This ^
---
It's already seriously penalized, why remove it entirely?
---
You add locks to your doors, when using turrets right?
---
I put lvl3 looks on my steel doors, and lock them when I quest. When mobs, muties and scorched attack, they get shot.
---
They can and will fire from a distance using ranged weapons, only when I’m home but I quickly fix them.
---
I have water purification as well, but I leave that unlocked for folks. Needing it.
---
Really liking this camp great work!
---
Ask again in a few hours. There is s patch today on PC that is suppose to fix 150 issues.
---
One of my characters has a camp inside the monorail pylon on the ridge just before the elevator ... not high but fun
---
It's bad in the sense that it obsoletes all other weapons, comparatively speaking. A weapon can have one of 23 prefixes, one of 7 major perks, and one of 9 minor perks. Two-Shot is one of the prefixes, Explosive is one of 7 major perks and the minor perks are to taste (like 90% weight reduction). With TSEs being what they are, they make 22 out of 23 prefixes obsolete, uncompetitive. Same with 6 out of 7 major perks. THAT'S why TSEs are bad, and need a serious review.
---
All these salty fallout fans downvoting clearly cant take a joke, that comment was reasonably humorous 
---
I've lost caps to teams of players where a high level shoots me, and I shoot back thinking - I'll get scaled because I'm a lower level. Only for a team mate I didn't know he has, half my level, to one shot me because of the level scaling system. It's really broken and makes me avoid pvp
---
So much for "The Marine armor is only surpassed by power armor".
---
Today, actually. In about an hour and a half.
---
I didn't get the armor paint because it doesn't include all the armors, and I didn't think it looked that good either. But I did get the paint for the stand
---
I just shoot them a lot until they stop moving
---
Nice thanks, now I will have time to play a real finish game...Metro is on 15th february, im really hiped. 
---
Hurts even more if someone has a TSE weapon and stacked bubble heads. I just hope it is fixed in the next patch.
---
The eel in the lamp is an ingenious idea, I love it! They should totally do that xD
---
You’re trying too hard. Literally have like 10 CHR and use hard bargain. Nothing else. You’ll hit like 3580.
---
Partly why I am tempted to get back into it when I seen that scrolling through this sub this morning. The other part is the fact that I paid near 50 quid for a game that I have hardly touched haha..
---
blabla
---
I really wish I'd got the stand, I do like the paints but I thought they'd be way more unique since they're 'limited time' obvious lie on bathesdas part 
---
hahaha thanks!!!
---
Mmm thats what a dupper would say....reported.
---
Thanks friend :)
---
There is no PVP and no PVE big challenge in Nuke Zone. The end game is really easy right now. 
---
So honestly how many times has this happened to you?  I’ve sunk hundreds of hours into the game and had my base dicked once by a dude i orbital striked for his bounty while he was in his base and then stole his loot.    Some people make it out to be some rampant epidemic when it’s really not. 
---
Ive met one, I hoped they were just a fo4 thing. That ticking noise is terrifying to hear lol.
---
There's a way in vats if you have limb targeting to target it and explode it in his hand 
---
True but if you have heaps of rad stuff it works and as a last resort it’s good 
---
That's litterally what happened, this guy hit me with maybe 6 shots max and made over 300 caps. Broken, but won't get fixed 
---
but didnt produce ESO, zeni max did.
---
Basically its a zeni max game just published by bethesda.
---
So no, they dont know shit about MMO
---
You definitely can, and should, ask for a refund, especially if you don't even have it yet.
---
Yeah no it’s a real thing. People have discussed this only. Don’t know how, but it helps on duping and people have been complaining since the beginning that it ruins the game
---
Without Legendary weapons (Including TSE)?
---
I still have a player-made handmade and I cannot deal with those easily.  Level 110 here.
---
Don't want to nitpick.. but I think that's blue, not black. :P
---
I feel like there should be more incentive to keep and hold perk cards. Increase their effectiveness over time, or otherwise decrease their effectiveness, when newly equiped. 
---
The perk card clicking system is terrible from an UX point of view, but so are almost all console-ported/shared games.
---
That's where he goes!  I was at the shop when this happened.
---
What makes you want to keep playing?  Genuinely curious.. I signed here to keep an eye out for when they fix/ finish the game so that u can buy it and have fun but I don't think that day is doing too come
---
It's a BoS quest reward. A lot of people are surprised to find out they received it.
---
I gues the coffin is thair Form of garbage disposal ore the Station is Run by sneaky dogs
---
Quest reward for B.O.S.
---
I found mine at the Watoga vendorbot.
---
Also where you can find Adv power connectors.
---
Maybe thats why the worlds of later fallout games (or earlier ones) are still so messed up, because fo76 vault dwellers are all maniacs?
---
This argument isn't just about TSE because your build can compensate for not having one. Pre level 50 I felt the same way a lot of you feel and then all of a sudden there was nothing to fear. That might actually be how they're broken.
---
For the record I can do this without PA and I'm not a bloodied build nor do I have a single perk that raises DR. It's a simple VATS crit build using a one \* non TS or E combat rifle. I actually paper bag picked it at white springs because no one wanted it.
---
That said... yes TSE is broken (and I have one). I just don't see that it matters for this topic because I don't actually use it for scorchbeasts or the queen.
---
Fallout 3 and New Vegas would be sooo much easier in the early game if we could sprint.
---
This would be so cool! Having to sneak past them would also be cool!
---
Oh i feel sorry for those who think they’re safe in power armor suits lol, non power armor builds offer far more dps. 
---
Might do can only wait and see if you don't want that to happen agein I suggest putting passive mode on in settings. while active you can not be killed by players unless you join a PvP event in the world. 
---
If you are apart of a team everyone must have this active in order to work if not you can still get killed by players attacking a friend.
---
no trash item button kek
---
Im a strong, independent Gaurdsmen who don't need no PA. 
---
*Dies after 19sec of combat*
---
From memory, the Forest is safest, then the Ash Heap. The Savage Divide can be safe, you will get weak enemies there, but also very strong ones. The Mire and Bog are the worst, any enemy you encounter there will be at least middle level plus.
---
Pacifist stops you from inflicting damage on others. So, you cannot start nor end an engagement with other players. It does not protect you from receiving the little damage others can do to you before PvP starts.  
---
Thanks for the info
---
Did you play in "Dark Zone"? The item extraction and PVP works good. It's challenging. Right now in Fallout 76 only Queen is little bit hard.
---
This is me.
---
I've completed all the silos. Yet haven't launched a single nuke.
---
Why? Because I get dropped AS SOON AS I finish launch prep.
---
It is damn annoying and the main reason I've stopped playing the past week or so.
---
I'm just looking forward to the developer comments in the patch notes, like what Zenimax Online Studios (ZOS) started doing not too long ago with Elder Scrolls Online. It's always good for a laugh. I especially liked it when they tried the "this is a buff if your stamina was below 5k"  developer notes, people had such a field day with those, and "this is a buff if" became a meme in the game.
---
I've seen a prime 50 receiver at Watoga vendor. But I can't make the ammo so passed on it. But I do miss my anti material rifle :(
---
Is this going to be like that dress? ;)
---
Too real fam
---
this would be really nice way to let players restock a bit by using prewar currency over caps 
---
I've never once bought anything from a vending machine as the prices are just to high to be a good investment - BUT if they put prewar money as a non scrapable or a misc item and let me use that I'd actually buy things from them as that would be a immersive concept as well as a nice bonus bit of resupply that would let me be a bit more specific on my restocking 
---
Except the items they’re assigning a value to are mostly items from Fallout 4 that are already in the games code, therefore no labor is required to create or add them, so how can they possibly increase the price to match their fake currencies decline in value? Their products aren’t getting any more useful at all. I still have 4000 from just playing the game and Ive only bought one item. Bethesda sucks. The only thing that will come from this exploit being brought to their attention is that they will stop giving Atom Shop refunds. And then we all lose.
---
Most of my interactions with other players so far have been... unfulfilling.  Ive honestly lost interest in playing after about 20 hours invested.  Even simple quests are so poorly concieved and implemented they are not only difficult to complete, they are tedious and boring and repetitive.  Just glad i only lost 20 bucks on the game.
---
Keep seeing Metro: Exodus clips and thinking “thats what 76 needs; some way to fix a train and get the &lt;bleep!&gt; out of this place!”
---
Its a shame, I dont really see the fun in playing that way?
---
I actually like being attacked by other players, I like hunting down wanted players, but I feel like this could be better implemented than the current system. Pvp should be like a duel system for 1v1s and team members should only join in once they are wanted 
---
I do remember doing a quest where I ran around a synced some signal boosters to find some dudes body on Monday. But I did that quest a good 5 or 6 times as I kept dying and had to start all over. Maybe it was that reward and I just didn’t notice? 
---
Love the swimming pool!
---
You can mod each power armor part but dass it.
---
If i ever went back to power armor, i would put emergency protocols for the chest with a high damage bloodied weapon. 
---
You can’t build a camp in, on, or too close to, any location you can fast travel to. It’s about the only limitation to placing a camp.
---
&gt; id
---
I hope this PVP mode works well. But We don't know how will work yet.
---
You get rewarded a "power armor frame" when you complete on of the quests but its actually a full ultracite power armor set. Same thing happened to me,  i remembered the frame reward but no armor until a buddy explained it to me because i was really confused as well. 
---
Varies on what you're doing.
---
God forbid I run a silo. That's a disconnect 100% of the time. The queen DCs me probably 25% the time and I've never seen all three nukes launched.
---
Generally if I'm just out and about with a single workshop I end up without DCs.
---
It depends on location. The more popular spots seem to get griefed more often. My base is remote, so no issues. Currently...
---
   
---
It has no final content, people are in an endless cycle of collecting materials and collecting legendary elements. besides getting the daily caps 
---
Agreed. Honestly my biggest problem with them being pairable is that it kinda made every other combination obsolete. It's just *too* good together, kinda spoiled the chance of more variety in the meta.
---
forget about TS. If you don't know, don't hip-fire. No i do not own a two shot explosive weapon. just explosive is fine. i have explosive 10mm smg and explosive combat shotgun.  
---
while 10mm is no-way OP (for example, needs a full clip to down a level50 behemoth), but shotgun is of different nature.
---
maybe for some guns, two-shot is imprtant. but not for shotguns. shotguns fire pellets (for example, combat shotgun shoots 7) and two-shot will add just a single pellet making "two shot" prefix actually quite bad for explosive shotgun. gimme bloodied or furious any day.
---
I do too on even grounds but not by over powered sweetie players.
---
I'm still using lvl 35 excavator armor at lvl 74 it works fantastic and I've only had to repair it once since I originally made it and I have zero PA perk cards. I'm not sure upgrading is really worth it at this point besides a higher DR but that's never been an issue in nuked zones or for big bosses for me. Just something to consider 
---
me too! XD it was a happy accident
---
wow great idea i have one on water too but never thought of that lol. I'm going to do that
---
Might be a stupid question, have you tried to make a new character?
---
How about having named loadout that you can save?Then quickly switch from one loadoutcto another as needed. 
---
yes yes yes yes yes to all, especially the  CAMP stuff and plan stuff
---
Everytime I sneak in power armour I remember the scene from the Family Guy Star Wars spoof, where they're creeping around in Stormtrooper outfits to the tune of Mini the Moocher.
---
I think I got so much practice dying in beta! I managed to die four or five times in Grafton alone. Two of those times was trying to retrieve the paper bag of crap I dropped the first couple of times I died. 🙄
---
Yup but it's a mass produced cheap version of t51. 
---
It's not going to handle them. The engine doesn't have the capacity, and they don't have a system set up to deal with any of it. I talked to customer support, they don't even seem to have the ability to look into  your character's inventory, or alter things within it. So when the quest broke (the one where you get unique parts to repair motors, but those parts disappear, and you can't get new parts because they're unique to the quest), they said basically delete the char and start over, because there's nothing we can do. Whereas many other companies would be able to just add missing pieces to your inventory, or advance the quest to the next step, or roll it back one step. Bethesda is unable to do either one. So if you think they are going to magically hunt down dupers, they won't. 
---
really it should be plans for items enclave has access to 
---
1 random weapon  
---
1 random piece of scout armor  
---
Plans for either a plasma gun mod / enclave outfit / enclave paint job / or scout armor
---
or maybe just a scout armor legendary item make it only way to get them   
---
I didnt think of it either, again I was trying to line up the wood floor pattern and accidentally deleted it and thats how the idea came to be.
---
Don’t want to nitpick.. but it’s probably a dark gray, to match the Garrahan Mining logo, it even has a cursive G on the knee
---
No and I don’t want to 
---
I much preferred the assault rifle and Chinese assault rifle from FO3 over 4 and 76 :/
---
Cool thanks for the comment. Mine is starting to break so instead of repairing it I might just make a new piece at high level that way it had more duribility 
---
And we need a way to pay our bounty, I would rather give a vendor my caps.
---
Amazing work!
---
Oh you want engame? Go find chicken for daily challenge for example, that is fucking engame.
---
What a mess indeed...
---
Yeah, I did. And I can tell we like Fallout for vastly different reasons. That’s ok though, nothing wrong with enjoying a challenge. Just keep it waaaaaaay over there. 
---
IMO, one can deal with the sonic blasts.  I fight them all the time with normal armor (non-PA).  But I cannot see anything.  I cannot fire at the stupid thing except with VATs and since I got non-auto, that means 2 to 3 shots and not all of those are gonna land.   So I end up jumping in buildings until the crop-dust and then jumping outside out of the area and taking a couple pot shots at it again blindly.  
---
No legendary weapon here at all.  Just a normal handmade.
---
I got adept at fighting them like this, can take 2-3 at once, but... it takes 20 minutes.   One SB can take anywhere from 60 seconds (if it lands early) or 10 minutes.  I usually waste tons of ammo as well.  The loot drop? Nada.  I always feel like I just wasted 10 minutes of my life for a supper annoying fight.
---
I wanted to wear the combat helmet with it. I want the combat helmet light to work. I want the combat helmet to provide armour. I want to be able to wear my creepy mascot hat over the face mask if can't wear helmets with it. I just want something from that list, any will do for now. 
---
Haha probably.
---
Wait so the t60 is weaker then the t51 boy us that confusing lol
---
Nah of course not, ;) why would we ever do that?
---
You could do this anywhere in both games. I do prefer having to find the appropriate work bench in this game. 
---
Yep, that's the one that earns you the suit.
---
Ha. Was thinking the same thing. The dress was clearly blue; for the record.
---
Why not? Leaving Vault 76 and getting to level 10 should take you what? 30 minutes?
---
The perk system is designed the way it is because it's meant to encourage teaming up. When you team up. you can share perks, effectively giving other team members a free perk. 
---
Making some perks passive like this, diminish that aspect of the game. And the game was designed with grouping as a first consideration.
---
Sorry you have to keep switching out perks just to pick a safe or hack a computer. But also, safes tend to not have that great of stuff. I wish harder safes did. 
---
And hacking only seems to serve as a way to bypass safe locks if you don't have the lock picking skills. Or open optional doors sometimes. Lockpicking and Hacking don't seem to have much purpose past getting access to some extra loot. 
---
I'd really like to see them make these skills more usable in the game. It would be neat if hacking could be used to open doors that require a pass key or such. I mean, generally you just have to search around the area for it, so it's not like having to find the passkey is ever that hard. 
---
Yeah I'd love to get this item, really helps with immersion having a bag on your back
---
Good call. Poster is blue though.
---
Thanks. I just decided to add all the tiers available. If there will be no big complains about the design I'll start adding the other armors
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aegqt0/i_made_a_post_last_night_about_this_and_didnt/
---
Like this?
---
honestly I find the fact I don't need a team to be great - often in mmo style games I will look and see I only have under a hour to play and can't get in a team by then and do anything so I just play something else BUT if I only have 20mins I can hop on and find a treasure map or loot some items or just tweak my camp to look nicer pretty much can do anything I want without the need to have a team
---
at same time I do love teaming with people when I do which is also great that I don't feel handicap either way 
---
Yep!  They say anyone over "125" should be able to trivialize them just like victrhugochavez said above.
---
What he meant was he "acquired" some legendary weapon that allowed it to be trivialized. 
---
I suggest he take some Rad-X and equip normal weapons and see if its still trivial.   \*That\* is playing normal against SB.  Has nothing to do with "builds" at all really if you cannot kill them easily with the build.  A build does not include "Buying a TSE".
---
We agree on both counts then!
---
they were very clear that youd have to make a new character to get old achievements once the game fully released.
---
Okay. Lets go this route then. Rather than understanding your were rather vague and because of it, wrong in your points. Which were already stated. So I am not going to repeat myself.
---
1.} Normal light sucked on PA in fallout 4. We're using the same set up. Bright is a requirement. It always has been to improve your PA's illumination of the surrounding area.
---
2.} Lowering the resistances of PA would have the same effect on others that removing sneak is having on you. They would defend tooth and nail that they are " a tank" and as such should keep their high resistances .. and too that point. They'd be right. PA should be viewed exactly as that .. a tank which is what it was designed for in the in game world. Not as a set of armor that can be used to be a stealth assassin. Regular armor works 100 times better for that.
---
Though honestly answer me this .. how many people do you think wear PA because they want too? Or more then they NEED the extra carry weight due to poor inventory management brought over from fallout 4?
---
Play styles should be a thing .. right now .. there are like 2 ... melee PA and ranged power armor with the few odd balls in hazmats, lol. Though this is also due to other variables such as TSE, but thats another subject in and of itself.
---
3.} Why? Really? Gauge and standards. It's how our minds work. You can not compare this to a single player game, for it is not. Even if you can play it alone, you're not alone, ever. Thus multiple people always need to be taken into account when theorizing balance and ideas.
---
Some people like PA .. Some don't. Just from personal experience talking with people and reading the forums. I'd say it's a pretty even split to those who do not want to have to wear PA and those that do. Most people, like I stated before only wear power armor due to nothing more than carry weight because they can not manage it very well.
---
Flexibity is cool, and like I also said. Playstyles should be encouraged. But PA is a TANK based play style period, this is based on the worlds lore.
---
Now if you wanna suggest a light weight standard of PA for those that would like the be stealth, akin to Gantz or something. Though as it stands PA are tanks and should be treated as such. I don't mind if they can crouch due to getting behind cover, but not stealth.
---
#my2cents
---
Scorchbeasts already come out of holes in the group with a cool animation, that’s spooky enough - trees could be neat but they’re too big 
---
ha ha ha! Yes. That would be hilarious! A whole set of new songs too! 
---
The other 6 achievements need a lot of time to get to annoyingly 
---
&gt;Ask again in a few hours.
---
This is the truth. It's going to be spectacular. Either a spectacular explosion to rival the biggest nuke that breaks so many things the game is unplayable, or spectacularly amazing as the playerbase revels in the actual fixes. I don't know which scenario we're going to see.
---
This community is great.
---
Agreed. They're *only* appropriate when you're alone, or at a Prime Blast Zone. I habitually put my (non-two-shot) Explosive Gatling away and pull out something tamer when there are other people to share with 🤣
---
Nah. I'm good with being hopeful. Might be a little disappointed but it's just a game. 
---
Yeah, I know it's possible to kill them pretty easily too. I'm a shotgun build (no TSE) and with enforcer I can ground them pretty quickly.
---
I'm just pointing out that people who say "oh they're so easy to kill with my TSE weapon" are contributing nothing, because we all already know that stupid overpowered crap can kill anything with ease. That's not the point. 
---
Wow that blows 
---
EVE Online did this best, IMHO.
---
You can log off, anywhere, at any time. If you are in docked, it's instant, but if you are in space, it's a 20-30 sec timer, same as WoW (at least in vanilla). BUT if you are in combat, your ship (your character) remains in the game until you are out of combat, and for 20-30 seconds after. Meaning just logging when someone catches you won't work, your ship will remain in the game, and without you controlling it will be destroyed and looted. Means players had to deal with consequences of their choices, and logging off didn't work as a reset button on a fight.
---
What water purifier bug is this?
---
There are so much issues in this game where I get the feeling 'I really want to have a look at the setup, because I can't help but feel that it's poorly programmed/set up'...
---
Like the effects from duping affecting an entire server - you'd think they'd have a buffer overflow which triggers a kick before an action can severely affect the global performerance of a server.
---
Or the fact that items can get lost from the last few minutes of playing if the server crashed/you got booted out.
---
Or how you can't easily join back to the last server you were at. Etc.
---
Ok thanks
---
Well. You can either wait to see if they fix it. Or start a new character to get after them. Or nothing.  
---
There's your three choices. /thread.
---
People were complaining earlier that we had to wait another week for fixes. So I pointed out that the fixes were actually today... and they started complaining that rushing it like that would mean less fixes lmao. Honestly I think people would be more upset if they fixed everything because they wouldn't be able to complain so much. 
---
My friend who was watching me play said "Hey cool where'd you get the Bumblebee outfit" 😂😂 too funny
---
Yeah I meant Instigating. Too early. I swear I've had at least 6 Instigation LMGs so far.
---
Ya the Demo Expert stacking is a good point, if the legendary property wasn't affected by it this might not be nearly so bad. But as it is, it's just too good of a double stack for most people to pass up.
---
And has anyone figured out why they can occasionally literally spam non-stop? I have a video of one using its Sonic blast attack for a full 2:57 without even stopping to screech. 
---
https://mobile.twitter.com/HoaWasteland?lang=en
---
You should check these guys out. They pay caps to you depending on how good your build is.
---
&gt;The previous inhabitants of the enclave vault must have had a good reason why they severed it's connection in the first place and most likely died in the process.
---
Oh boy, are you in for a surprise when you undercover the real story...
---
aren't we tho
---
Dude you can avoid them, run away from them, hide from them, and escape then indoors. What's the point if an endgame enemy that your only allowed to fight when you know you can kill it? Yeah your armor breaks some times. Fix it. If your under 50 you should be finding new better armor all the time any way.
---
Imagination half solves your problem. *imagine* when your inventory shows (springs needed 3/4), it means "springs of the correct size."
---
In real life springs, screws and gears all have a huge variety of sizes in both metric and imperial.
---
And a real life problem can be identifying, sourcing and matching these components.
---
* IMAGIN8IONs *
---
You're right. I updated the TL;DR / warning label.
---
I like the idea, but they would have to block auto-scrapping Pre-war money, like baseball or deathclaw hand
---
We are trapped here in the game, havin fun ! Halp !!!
---
Absolutely true... I posted a short version of what you just stated farther up the thread, but I didn't think about the fact that it also gives you some incentive and benefit to level up beyond just getting all your perk slots, so you can have different load outs, which includes having multiples of some perk cards at different levels to give you more loadout flexibility.
---
You've got a gatling plasma that's not broken? Shoot with it for 3seconds and it will be.
---
Joke aside, TSE are currently too powerful, and that's especially true for shotguns because each pellet is affected, which means each shot is equivalent to throwing 14 grenades. 
---
I also have a TSE plasma gatling (looted honestly), I don't really use it because that's not my build, but I've thought about building a character just for it. However, if removing it would mean "game is better", I'd happily throw it away.
---
I can get behind the fact that they are a complete waste of time and drop nothing of value to make anyone really WANT to fight them. I also agree TSE is broken as I have one and the only thing I fear when it's not in my stash is blowing myself up.
---
Because Bethdesa and inconsistent design decisions go together like Wine and Cheese.
---
So stoked for season 16. Going to roll a WD, something I've never played before!
---
Oh yeah, this is fo76 reddit...YEAH! Seasons! What would they be though? Season of the Super Mutant? Where west tek has loads more mutants and most are legendary? 
---
But maybe a downside like higher fall damage or lower energy resistance because in lore the endivia only weakness is fire, or a shit ton of bullets
---
Heres to hoping the end of month patch makes all plans and mods available on their respective vendor. I dont care if they make the jet packs and rare plans 5k caps, just put and end to the server hop!!!
---
Lucky you didnt realize it. Many, many people scrap that frame without deploying it and loss the full set of Ultracite PA.
---
It's mostly the same. Camps got a little better, but 99% of issues I had in beta are still issues.
---
Also, as a sidenote, if you bought a game, at full price, 8 weeks ago, and walked away 6 weeks ago, please learn from this lesson. And just give a new game a few weeks, and make sure it's worth buying. Because in 8 weeks, the game is likely to be down to half price or less. So not only will you get a better experience in 8 weeks (not in this case, but usually), you'll also save a considerable amount of money. And more importantly, you will discourage these and other developers from releasing unfinished games in future. 
---
Thanks! 
---
well, on the brightside, by crashing servers for other players, it makes the problem larger than just one person. Hopefully Bethesda will start taking it seriously.
---
Wow it does. I just went through and read iron fist and talons and noticed by of those say punching is increased whereas brawling says unarmed. I’ve always used weighted because it felt stronger. Weird the mod would only work when fighting without a weapon. 
---
Eh, depends on how they sorted their SQL. If they utilize one big database for everyone, yeah, it will be a pain. But if the game creates subdatabases per varying need, it should be doable. Only issues would be that you'd need to make sure CSR doesn't write to the wrong table, but that's just making the costs of proper training and proper tools.
---
Gym weights are good for lead. Amongst other places you can find gyms at the Green Country Lodge, Charleston fire department, Vault Tec University and some army installations. Paint and rat poison are also great for lead. Most toy cars and trucks have screws, as well as handcuffs and tongs. The best things are My Little Buttercups and typewriters.
---
Awesome thanks. 
---
And then they wonder why the lore says the space station will only last 50 years on its power. Too much dog food.
---
I'm assuming they did this to help people actually find power armor. If they didn't, there wouldn't be power armor anywhere because people would just be farming it to scrap.
---
Crafting energy weapons with different colored lasers etc would be pretty neat. And probably easy to code. Honestly I just really hope they buff energy weapons because they are my favorite... kinda sucks.
---
You mentioned that diablo 3 didn’t get season for many years. You are correct. By that logic we won’t get seasonal content for years on fallout76.
---
Seasonal content is “endgame” content where they are trying to add more reasons to play. This will not happen for a long time or ever for a game like fallout.
---
Seasons are geared more toward looter/shooter games.
---
That being said I also would welcome such content.
---
Never happened to me as I am not a builder. 
---
But, I get that builders are better for the long term health of the game  , in terms of investment value to the publisher, than griefers.
---
But they always said they intended the game to be just as playable solo, right? The game isn’t meant to be played as a team. It’s meant to be played as both but struggles since it tries to do both. I get what you say about nuke codes. But something as simple as perks should be viable solo.
---
This. Make pre war money useful again!
---
Ya ima have to depend on my friends to unlock stuff for me b/c I’m speccing every last point in STR for melee dmg, Endurance for hp, and Luck for better loot drops. 
---
Haha, well hopefully. Griefers at arms! All make an alt, transfer treasure maps, and then server hop till they all dead
---
I hope they never increase it just to piss little cunts like you off
---
serves them right, ppl tried to fix fo76 and get banned cuz they use mods..  
---
i really hope people are NOT spending money on the atom store cuz Bethesda does not deserve this... (maybe in a few months when they realize that its the community that fixed all their games and not them, and then they will hopefully accept the walk of shame and release console and dedicated servers so we can break out of the trash ourselves)
---
Do you teach them how to make AAA games?
---
Well played.
---
Cool,  can't wait, only just started to do the enclave missions 
---
It would be nice if a scorched beast didn't fly the whole time during combat. The whole "I'm not gonna land and just scream at you" is starting to get tiresome
---
Ouch
---
too soon
---
Honestly, I doubt they'll drop any ban hammer for something so widespread simply because their playerbase probably couldn't handle it. 
---
Uhm, if you don't have a Pip-Boy, how will you give Cyshox your maps? Because I think they've chained the trading interface to the Pip-Boy.
---
Damn. That's rough. I think it's just poor AI coupled with the game designers' lack of consideration as to how this difficulty would make the experience of battling a scorchbeast. 
---
You see, that's a very kind thing to do. However, most people aren't very kind, let alone kind!
---
End game weapons are legendary.  TSE are not "End-Game weapons".  Those specific combinations are actually very rare.  Less than 0.5% of all drops, probably even lower.   They are the result of cheaters.  So I do not include TSE in the "End Game weapons" category.   I would really like to  know exactly how many actual people got a TSE from a real drop.  Probably 5 or 10?
---
So many people would be so angry lol
---
It would also grab you and drop you from 500 meters unless you hurt it enough before that. Hope you got some PA to soften that fall
---
I run into this quite often as well, I think I still get the materials from the item but I'm not certain.
---
Happened to me again this morning, hence searching on here.
---
Even F2P MMOs have restoration services (see: LOTRO, etc). It's just Bethesda being lazy
---
Whilst I agree Fusion cores aren’t too hard to find, the fusion core makers at the power plants have gone from a core every 5 minutes to 1 an hour basically making them completely and utterly useless.
---
I've missed intellectual responses. You are my dude of the day, my dude.
---
So many people are already angry 
---
Wait till the patch drops in supposedly an hour or do and then boom give it a bell.
---
It messed me up too. :)
---
My name also goes on the list. I'm level 55 and completed Belly of the Beast last night solo and jumped straight to Whitesprings to farm a nuke.  Dumped and sold loads of stuff at the shops in Whitesprings including my ultracite power armour not realising that zero weighted frame was it!   My team were ahead (now behind) my progress so can anyone tell me that if I complete belly of the beast with them do I get the reward again?
---
Kill the smooth skins 
---
More of what’s wrong with lasers. 
---
Only if its for atom
---
Yes, radaway may cure mutations if you don't have starched genes perk level, but I was writing about Rad-X and its ability to suppress mutation effects on its duration without curing them, while diluted Rad-X just gives radiation protection.
---
There’s an even more broken build but that’s a secret.
---
bone apple
---
I like my Quad explosive 10MM pistol personally. Really fun to be sneaky and explosive!
---
99 bugs in the code, 99 bugs. You take one down, and patch it around, 123 bugs in the code!
---
I'm finished with the main story so I'm trying to stockpile enough to build the decontamination shower at my camp
---
Was very weird but as I said, I had to do that mission a few times as I kept failing. When I finally did beat it some bastard monster jumped me in the cave so I just ran. Fast traveled to my camp and called it a night. 
---
Possible I saw the reward of power armor frame and just rolled my eyes cause there’s frames all over the place. 
---
Ya it's gotten to the point where I carry a Flamer and Cryolator for when there are crowds of enemies to tag and a group of people trying to get hits in 🤣
---
Although I'll admit I also just like pelting things with Snowballs in my christmas T-51b, it's absolutely hilarious, especially around a bunch of low levels exploring Whitesprings
---
Bloodied grognaks with all bolstering? Way ahead of you 
---
A fair point. I guess some way of putting the [CAUTION] and [DANGER] indicators into PA, perhaps as an optional mod, could help. 
---
Base building and decorating was very therapeutic for me in other games like 7 Days to Die, and Empyrion, it's like my Zen Garden. I'm still learning the tools they have available, and trying to unlock all the CAMP blueprints. My latest camp is on a precipice, with a roof-top "patio". It creates such awesome views I love it, and that's what I feel makes this place work. I do wish we had a bigger budget because I'm getting level 68 ghouls attacking my base so I had to put out some turrets to defend it.
---
I'm not quite happy with how it looks right now, I made a mistake where I put the CAMP so I can't build exactly how I want so I need to improvise but that's half the fun: engineering a solution to work with what you have.
---
Yaa just got to wait for them flyin shitz to land as melee 
---
Honestly they need to ban the accounts with massive duped inventories, then remove all duped items from everyone's inventories. Yes itll suck losing that legendary weapon you paid 5k caps from some random dude for but it's in the best interest of the game in the long run. Just RIP the bandaid off Bethesda if you can anyways....
---
Agreed on every single word.
---
Question for the guys over level 100: Do you guys actually see enemies level 70-99 in the east half of the map?
---
I have a two shot dragon I don't use. What do you have to trade? I would be interested in weightless armor or plans for CAMP items that I don't have. ( I have a lot but am missing bathtubs, toilets, clean beds and other miscellaneous items.)
---
Should I put points on the luck perk on the new characters
---
Nope
---
Nuka Cola company made the vending machines for prizes. Responders repurposed them after the war. (Not sure how to explain the treasure map ones in the Ash Heap).
---
I built a cabin out there and my second log-in had a scorchbeast waiting for me so I moved.  Have you had any issues with them at that location or was my experience unusual, do you think?
---
reminds me of the Cazaclaw mod for NV. 
---
Pm bro 
---
Any idea where to get the heavy robot plans?
---
Being killed by slap damage shouldn't make me lose caps though, right?
---
there is a wonderful mod that does that
---
This is the most idiotic suggestion I've seen passed around like it's some genius idea. No faster way to kill and piss off the player base just punish everyone instead of the ones actually using the exploit. The only people that would be fine with that are the small group who keep advocating it on Reddit ignoring that 95%+ of the player base never comes here or interacts with the game or it's related media outside the game itself.
---
Ethical duping, for the greater good of vault-kind.
---
Oh yessss. Such an underrated game. 
---
If wearing PA makes you too powerful, then don't wear it 
---
I'll have a look on this sub, gauge the reaction from that. Seems like it could be a good time to try and get back into it.
---
Go around as a level 150 killing players who just got to level 5. Since it scales to your level the new player now has to pay 200 caps, but as a new player only has like 7. 
---
So now they get a 50% damage debuff for a few hours because they got killed by a high level player and what few caps they had taken away.
---
It would stop low levels picking fights, but open the door for high levels bullying low level players.
---
The cap scaling needs to just stop with the scaling at a certain point. Players who kill you should award at least the same amount of caps for being killed as they got for killing you. Like how you can get your junk back but with caps.
---
This happens if you have forbidden knowledge active,  Technical data cannot stack, so there is no benefit in attempting to collect multiple pieces before depositing them. If you have more than one document on you ,the server will auto drop those  at either a server hop or when you log in . -Thats why you all are finding technical data randomly at your bases .
---
You can turn on his "time machine". 
---
I've had 4 TSE weapons drop and I know people who have farmed a hell of a lot more than me. Any old legendary people drop on the ground because they aren't even worth giving away are not legendary. Have you ever farmed a whitespring nuke zone? You say .5% or less chance and probably 5 to 10 have dropped? Sooo only 1000-2000 Legendaries have dropped???? LOL
---
So you're saying that if you solo The Scorch Beast Queen you get a chance of getting excavator paint
---
Take the PA off then lol 
---
Airdrop Deathclaws..........interesting
---
It goes the same without it, I only really tend to wear it for travelling and against certain select enemy types (Deathclaws, Scorchbeasts, Mirelurk Queens) because of my 1 END and no natural limb damage mitigation.
---
The game has only been out two months, this means you played for a day to a week then quit...
---
Please no, I can’t stand listening to that voice. 
---
ha wow I'll check it out thanks
---
Where did you get plans for it? I know some people say Grahm but I have not found them yet.
---
Yeah the developers said that you would have to make a new character to get the beginning achievements if you played the beta. 
---
&gt; But they always said they intended the game to be just as playable solo, right?
---
And it is playable solo. You just have to juggle things more when you play solo.
---
But the game was designed to encourage team play, and they have always been very clear about that. They never said the game played solo would be the exact same experience as teaming up. In fact, before the game came out, they were pretty open about how the game works best when you are in a team, because of aspects like perk sharing, and that there are so many perks designed around group play. Radiation sponge, Team medic, Inspirational. 
---
You have perks you don't have to share to benefit other team members, and you can share perks. 
---
Clearly advantage for team play, while there's a few perks for those Lone Wander types. 
---
It's not struggling because it tries to do both. it's just more work for the person going solo. 
---
I do think they really need perk decks, which should be accessible directly from the pip boy, rather than having to go into the Perk submenu, and they could just add a tab in the Status window.
---
How it could work. You go into the perk menu, set up your perk cards. Then an option to save as deck. You name the deck. Like blueprints. Maybe we get X amount of decks as we level up. Level 1-15, one deck, 16-25 is two decks. and so on. Or maybe it's just static, you get 4 decks. 
---
Once you make a perk deck, you go into status on the pipboy, and over to Perks. There are your decks are listed. You scroll down to the deck you want, and hit apply. It switches all the perks for you.
---
Wow that is something really nice :)
---
only if you had a wanted level. I think in pacifist you can still do home damage. I had it happen to me when someone built their house on the golf green while it was nuked. I damaged their house and was then killed for caps. 
---
Yeah I hadn't thought about the debuff, it's been so long since I had it. Back to the drawing board I guess 
---
If they all dropped 3\* Legionaries we'd love them
---
Oh and they can spam shoot you through the back of their heads as they fly away WTF
---
It wasn't so much of a walking away, just a few things popped up. For the most part I enjoyed the game, pumped a little over 40 hours into it in the first two weeks. 
---
I've not really had the chance to sit down and properly get into it for a good few hours which is what I need to do with any Fallout game.
---
Why is there even level scaling? The whole point of a level system is being stronger at higher levels...
---
LoL. 
---
The ediquette on this sub is ridiculous. 
---
Dont PvP. Low levels on workshops deserve to be left alone or defended. Destroy camps if they are somewhere i dont like. But dont destroy camps or your a dick. Dont play the game that way! Play it this way!! Reeee
---
Yeah that’s one area
---
Everyone gets a TSE?? Awesome!!! 
---
Depends really on how they build up their layers. If e.g. a mountain is build up layer by layer, it can be done. If it is however just a few layers molded in shape on top of each other, with a hollow inside... It could become a massive issues.
---
It is a reference to Back To the Future. No Delorean but def a reference.
---
Its true guys, my uncle who works at nintendo told me about it
---
I'd have to agree with you on this one. Time invested should mean an advantage imo 
---
Level 80-85 often, over that more rare
---
Like that spooky ogre room in Pan’s Labyrinth?!
---
Woaw i ve heard that story too ! 
---
...
---
For many games for the past 20 years
---
Only thing I wouldn’t mind duplicating is more stash space and a bigger build budget. 
---
Or maybe Bethesda could duplicate the selling ammo aspect of ALL the other fallout games into 76. 
---
Is this not how duping works? Lol. 
---
Or people that aren't part of the asshole group of players this sub seems to get a hard-on for. "Hur dur there was a bag between 2 players so I destroyed their duper base", that's the prevailing attitude of this sub. It's so painfully obvious the average age for this game sub is lower then other games. Everything from the content to the posts to the comments paints this obvious picture and it bleeds everywhere in this sub. This sub is full of dildos being dildos and getting circlejerked to new levels of wtf
---
Got tired of seeing WhiteSprings Nuked. So far I've nuked Top of the World, Clarksburg &amp; Thunder Mountain Power Plant. All have sucked as far as spwaning enimes. 
---
Only the finest Dog Food for all your hard work.
---
I agree with you, but theres a big ol billboard at spruce knob that says its the highest elevation. I jumped (marsupial) ontop of the green roof and lined the edge of my screen up with the antenna in order to get my crosshairs parallel with the earth as best I could... they were practically the same elevation. 
---
If you add the antenna height in, spruce knob might have seneca rocks beat on a cheap technicality.
---
With the robots out front of the shopping building? Yeah. Not 100%, but almost, if you or anyone else hangs out there they just keep spawning up til the server goes kablooey.
---
Whether the ghouls are similarly broken is a topic of some debate. They're definitely a design anomaly if nothing else, because nowhere else in the game spawns enemies rapidly enough for a dozen people to run laps killing them without pause.
---
As quests go, there are of course the two sidequests at Whitesprings, one of which (the ghoul golfers that only spawn as level 9s) is basically incompletable amidst the nuke spamming. And without spoiling too much, Whitesprings is also the central hub for the 6th chapter of the main quest in much the same way that Top of the World was for the 3rd.
---
You are just too skilled
---
"When duping is fixed"
---
*Oh sweet child...*
---
Didn't quit, a few things came up. Like I've explained in another comment on this thread. Probably could've done with wording the title better. 
---
Not that I did, but I really don't see the issue with not touching a game a week after buying if you are not enjoying it..
---
well, it looks the best :D
---
🤔 I don't think you lose the parts when you scrap a frame. Did it one time early on by accident and the parts all appeared in my inventory. Not 100% sure, haven't tested it since, but it happened to me back in beta with one of my first mis-matched suits.
---
I've also seen him glitched into the store wall, just barely visible
---
Yeet
---
r/fo76bazaar
---
r/market76
---
We'll see, currently working on unlocking everything for robust robot stuff. 9 screws to craft a limb for scrapping, ouch..
---
Yes but I would like an area boss like fissure prime
---
I nuked the fissure in the Ash Heap and it was sooo meh. One SB, 8 glowing ones, a few mole-miners and a few scorched. Flux was all over the place though and some different types. 3/10 wouldn't nuke again.
---
Someone nuked the Palace of the Winding Path and that flat sucked ass. Super hilly and low minions. 
---
Fair enough, I didn't take into account the proximity of Vault 76
---
Once you level up high enough and have good gear/weapons/perks, Fallout games have always been easy - I never found it to make it less fun.
---
I loved stomping through straight murdering fools in FO4 on Very Hard.
---
Thanks I'll keep going through the quests for rose if the bugged quest triggers don't keep me from completing it 
---
They would also need a buff, deathclaws were kind of disappointing in this game in terms of challenge level.  But yeah I would totally be on board with flying deathclaws! 
---
It would be nice to get some new content that is challenging, but I'd like it to be done in a more creative way rather than just higher armour, HP, damage and same crappy AI.
---
I can't be the only one who wanted to see pictures of the hoe.  
---
10/10 would Fallout again!
---
I heard a junkie build does tons of dmg if melee ain’t your thang, but idk the #s
---
Honestly, I wouldn't be crazy about them implementing it by taking away crouch either; I just thought of the easiest way it could be done. Crouch would still be valid in PA for taking cover, and dislodging ones self from the terrain, as you say!
---
Honestly if they get rid of TSE anything I'll quit the game. I only solo play all my friends prefer playing siege. The game is so fundamentally unbalanced when you hit the wall where everything is a sponge for bullets that taking that out with basically revamping the game would be a no brainer to quit at that point. They already made most workshops pointless besides a free fast travel point, it went from something desired to something not worth the resources or time sink. 
---
Ya.. they need to first balance the weapons all around. Energy weapons are trash, pistols are only barely usable WITH TSE and all the perks, shotguns are OP with explosive. 
---
If everything we're basically equal but different and less OP, I think we would be good. I would gladly give away some damage on my shotgun if I could build a character for the TSE Gatling.
---
I think the US government as well was doing testing before the bombs, what I remember is the US creates deathclaws to use on the battlefeild against the chinese
---
Yeah that's true. I still can't shake the feeling FO4 was harder for longer on Survival though.
---
That sounds like a useless implementation of a pacifist mode. 
---
Decent glowing one spawns the one time I went there for a nuke. Not far off from White Springs nuke spawns and so wide open. 
---
If only there was a Protectron with a *soothing voice*.
---
I agree we need those fixes first for sure! My end game has now gone from nukes (which I run a few a day at least) to leveling faction mates and working on a great looking house!
---
Workshops are insanely easy. They should be way more difficult. They are supposed to be end game?????
---
There is no end game : (
---
And where would that leave the stealth mod for the X01?
---
OH, i don't know, fending off the ghouls only get mauled by a death claw many levels higher kinda \*feels\* like a boss fight haha
---
Yeah and if duping is on so huge scale as everybody say, everything will disappear, even game itself :D
---
It's not really broken though. The only real complaining I see come from this sub I haven't heard a single person bitch about it in game 
---
I will do so when I get home from work today. 
---
Yeah the whole “everyone is the same” trend in gaming is redonc these days. Im not saying let me one ahot noobs, but if I sink the time into my build and gear there should be an advantage not a disadvantage. As it stands Ill deal less damage and lose more caps per death... wut?
---
Maybe get rid of my whole character too, that would prove a point.
---
I am aware of duping, I guess I didn't know you could stack consumables like that though. 
---
It's not in the Atom shop.  Did you buy it?  If so, that's why you see it in the shop.
---
Yeah, and then it hits the shelves as one of the permanent lots for 1/4 of that price after the offer expiration.
---
Yes. I have found lots of the blue frogs in multiple places. Have yet to cook any after killing them. 
---
I *did* also find some kind of giant toad and am pretty sure I was able to cook them. 
---
I really think this is a miscommunication issue here.   The poster really meant: "TSE are broken and SB Need to be tuned" as a title.
---
That's true. Quite a few of the non PA armors need re-balancing. Mixing decent protection with a rad-suit isn't possible right now. Look at the marine armor as well. It's supposed to be one of the best non PA armors in the game, but has stats well below BOS modded combat armor. 
---
Ya, they can't get rid of it. I think we just need a good balance pass that brings other things closer to the TSE level.
---
I agree about the workshops also. Totally pointless now.
---
Been there for a nuke. It was ok but just ok. Better than when I nuked the Ash Heap fissure though.
---
Maybe it hunted you down for using glitches...
---
Headshots boyos
---
Hold up, they make Tapatio flavored Doritos?
---
Although I agree this would be pointless. Somebody else pointed out that Bethesda cheated with her AI. The only thing that has to happen is you have to be within a mile of them and he will cheat and see you. So you would literally never be able to see them upside down. They will sense you. It's b*******. However if they ever made them non cheaters I love it I love it I love it!
---
Play some Frost - relax in FO76
---
I’ve met a few lol. 
---
People would more then complain. Your average player which makes up 95% of the actual player base and will never visit Reddit or play more then a couple hours a day would probably quit playing and move on to something else. Sure folks here would be happy but I'd be shocked if this sub even made up 2% of the player base
---
A typo on my part! It has been fixed correctly to match the other 2 links in the post
---
Workshops aren’t meant to be end game. You thinking of nukes. Nukes are meant to be end game.
---
Reminds me of the morrowind area with this same type of thing! 
---
The thing is scorchbeasts are just annoying and with the right set up do next to no damage.
---
Deathclaws on the other hand can still do large amounts of damage and stagger
---
To be fair they both fall easily to enforcer perk shotguns 
---
Oh, boy. Here we go. 
---
Ahhh, so he's wprking on the switch port, eh?
---
I kept my 10 and later 100 cap bounty for a good week and it never even moved. I kept doing my quests and my things hoping it would go away.
---
I don't like the idea of having to die just to clear it. Specially if you need to go get someone to kill you so that you don't lose your junk. Feels gamey as all heck and really immersion breaking.
---
Right, but this area I could build my camp and place items down just not foundations for walls
---
I see. I usually say that because I see it so very often. People fork over the full price on release, and then sit on their hands for months until the game gets patched up to the point where it's playable. It's even worse when it's an annual or biennial affair. Like Assassin's Creed series, for example. AC Unity came out, but wasn't really a decent game for 6 months, by which time it was 60% off. And I knew people who paid full price, played for a day, and then waited 6 months to play again.
---
By the junk extractor?
---
Probably just your internet connection being wonky.
---
Everytime I've been dropped from server, all of my friends have also been booted and the world is no longer available upon trying to rejoin.
---
Have someone in the group with Rad Sponge shared.
---
That's another good point, plenty of people who play don't frequent the sub reddit or forums would be affected.
---
No, it’s off the road leading west out of watoga in south divide
---
Yep.  The world would crash from a variety of issues.
---
From broken objects to the duplicating robots at Whitespring.
---
Metal**
---
That's what I would do instead until there's a real reason to switch to another armor 
---
&gt;Frost
---
That's not really my cup of tea.  
---
I can wholeheartedly recommend Frostpunk though.  
---
The Dec 11th (somewhere around that date) update fixed the duplication of stored items in camps (remember seeing the I have 2000 corn posts?), but it created another bug madking some stored items unable to be replaced or destroyed...mainly the large industrial water purifier. It is permanently in your stored tab. This eats up varied ammounts of the camp budget. Folks report anywhere from 5% to 130%. Mine is at 83% giving 17% free to work with. Bethesda has responded saying they are aware and working on it. 
---
Eh. Personally I'm happier with Bethesda expanding the lore and introducing new things rather than just a slightly different flavour of an existing thing. While scorchbeasts are a little unsatisfying as endgame boss monsters, I still like them better than "just another of the same thing again." 
---
In a perfect world, we'd get scorchbeasts who do some more novel and interesting things and drop better loot, though. 
---
&gt;*is nobody gonna question why, when the bombs fell in October, there was a town having a Spring Flowers festival?
---
Its kinda like when you go to alabama in june and still see christmas lights up I imagine.
---
Jason!  It's a trap!  He just wants more blood money!!! Ruuuuuuun!
---
I honestly just stopped playing it, I wasted $80 on that game and I feel like I got shit on, so I started playing BO4 and I still feel like that game kinda scammed me too so, I'm just waiting for Outer Worlds or Metro Exdous
---
Dunno! Maybe transfer to a world container?
---
I have it Yeah! Is this why I can see it?
---
Hell I'd be fine with a nerf to the explosive effect even maybe make the AOE much smaller or have a sharper dmg cut off for the AOE
---
play in your bra and panties..... and a cowboy hat... wow that's hot, can we be friends?
---
Just because you are having fun in the hamster wheel doesnt make him wrong tho... the lack of endgame content has honestly killed the game for me as well
---
I am a bit of a culprit of buying games on release, but normally stick with them if I am enjoying them no matter how buggy they are. 
---
A lot of the bugs that I have seen people talking about on here I was lucky enough to have experience hardly any in that two week period after release that I was playing.
---
Make a story driven fallout with good dialogue and a fucking plot 
---
I can’t remember the location off the top of my head but there is a cave with a small pool of radiated water very close to a decontamination chamber. Save your radaway. 
---
Go get nuked, clean up in decon chamber for free. I don’t know if it removes mutations like radaway does though. So starched genes for sure. 
---
No, you need to use ultracite ammo.
---
I like it a lot! But the combat armor fits my sniper build a little better. I have a full set of heavy BOS with the BOS knight under armor.
---
Love the armor design, not a fan of blue and orange together 
---
This is why multiplayer and fallout shouldn't be mixed because both elements work against each other.
---
Hey, I was promised Scorchbeast genitalia. 
---
Other than that, phenomenal build! When I have more plans I look forward to starting over to make something nice.
---
no, it shows 0 ammo and you can't reload it with normal ammo.
---

---
Ok so the hardened receiver would be second best right? 
---
Yes.
---
Did you hear anyone bitch, in game, about the collector edition's canvas bag, or about the ghostweight glitch or the waterpump glitch ?
---
People play, they won't activate the mic just to say "man that weapon is to strong" without even knowing if they died of a TSE.
---
Every Bethesda game since Morrowind has had a test cell.
---
If you activate this poster early on, it is how you get the quest.
---
I could try it with raider armor, those are easy to find and I wouldn’t mind testing it with raider PA. 
---
Which would effect the games longevity and health for the rest of us. I think a nerf to the AOE for the explosive part would do far more good then anything else. Shooting the wall 5ft behind my target shouldn't kill my target.
---
it's more that they hyped this post up as something special beforehand. 
---
Shhh, those clean suits and upcoming pilot helmets are completely original! /s
---
You can't view your inventory without a Pip-Boy, that one I'm sure of :P
---
Yeah i need to stop having fun, i don't know what's wrong with me...
---
Same on xbone last night..for me  weird? 
---
Yep, also if you sneak and do critical damage they will run and say something like 'retreat!' If you get them good enough 
---
Prime doesn't give better damage than hardened (gun with hardened has the same damage as with prime). It just adds bonus to scorched.
---
Its a really cool franchise, even the 1st one is used for testing graphic cards nowadays, cool mature story, nice graphics and the enviroment man, Im never tired of recommend this game to everyone.
---
Mine was glitching out like that once, so I took radaway, a disease cure, drank water, ate, and it fixed it.  I can normally carry about 820-830 lbs until I hit that extra slow barrier, and 920-930-ish with power armor equipped (calibrated shocks).. so something else is wrong with your game. I carry little junk, unless I'm doing junk runs. Yes, I am most likely overloaded with ammo, fusion cores, and random crap I probably don't need. 
---
They aren't owned by Activision. Activision and Blizzard are two subsidiaries of ActivisionBlizzard.
---
Fun fact wendigos can hide in the trees
---
Happens with my right leg on both excavator and x01 suits

Pvp Is the other end game....
---
You don't really need them at the same time though. Use armorer/gunsmith/makeshift warrior or whatever when building or modding a weapon/armor. Use fix it good or weapon artisan when you want to repair a weapon/armor.
---
I would like to see a new game + where you can go back thru and get lvl 50 version of uniques and a harder challenge
---
Yes, I find the approach of getting  games you expect to enjoy on release, if they are multiplayer, is the only way. When you are part of that first wave. Beyond that, it's just not the same. Also, games of this type tend to really die down after a couple of months, so you often end up playing during the Golden Age, if it is at release. Afterwards it's either skeleton crew, or the try-hard players. It's a bit easier for single player games, there's no ticking clock, you can pick it up in 6 months after release and it will almost always be a better, more polished, more bug-free experience than on release.
---
Shiiiiiit...or take care of those turret farms at Whitesprings.
---
Lol more people crying about something busted "TSE broken makes everything else obsolete" to this i say u know nothing of other builds because ill take my bloodied explosive guns which have 10 times more damage TSE and meet you anywhere lol play the game, experiment builds and perks and u might not need to make post like this. They are meant to be end game weapons they should be OP. But they are no where near the only ones..........
---
no intel on that, sorry
---
Ya maybe just literally the next frame I find actually 🤔 not like I need more PA parts lol
---
Not today heretic, you wont trick me! My resolve is true and I hold our Emperors words well.
---
We wouldn't have even had the Horus Heresy if it wasn't for Lorgar's insistence that our beloved Emperor was a god.
---
&gt; I am not a god; rather than enslaving humanity I want to free it from ignorance and superstition

---
How did you know the shotguns all had the same mods? 🧐
---
I got lucky, when mine duplicated, I scrapped them right away. Did not leave them in the stored tab.  Seemed to work, anyway.  Did not get any stuck in there.
---
I did hear folks complain about phantom weight actually. Why would the 98% of people who didn't buy the PA edition or ever visit Reddit or other forums give a damn about a bag? Hell I visit these forums and don't give a damn about a bag because it doesn't effect me. 
---
Thank you. I´ve been looking for this.
---
&gt; improving performance and stability
---
So they are finally going to prevent ability to dupe??  &lt;lets hope&gt;
---
I think they are supposed to be enemies that you fight with a team.  With a team they are not that hard and are worth the loot that you get - alone you should probably just run until you get yourself some friends.
---
I remember the days of fallout 3 when they where a bit mysterious and where rarely found. Their power armour was menacing and the firing of plasma was something to fear. Now we're apart of it and it feels as if they're just an expensive shop that rarely sell anything useful. 
---
The scout armour is cool, the uniform is cool, plasma weapons are cool and the power armour looks okay (not a power armour type of person) but meaningful end game loot is lack luster unlike previous games. 
---
They have fallen from their little place upon high.
---
they seem to scale the same with the rest of the RNG works in this game.... barely/crappy
---
half the time i come into watoga i see lvl 14-38 robots, the other times i ONLY see lvl 50's (i am lvl 95+)
---
also, ive seen lvl 80 Scorchbeasts by the morgan airport and lvl 8 supermutants in cranberry bog.
---
there doesnt seem to be any "real" scaling going on afaik. its more a rng than a scale based on playerlevel it seems
---
Good luck with finding the recipe for Delbert's Traditional Chitlins! Thus far me and another redditer have been searching for it to no avail. It's supposed to spawn within the Spruce Knob Campgrounds, but we haven't found it yet. If you find it I'd love to know where!
---
Yes - that is the reality and risk of trading with other players though.  TBH, the vast majority of duped weapons are being obtained through real-world money transactions.
---
I almost always confused when the enemies sprint away. It’s like they bugged out and tried to return to their spawn point.
---
That's a good idea, and possibly not too much for them to change.
---
Everyone during that time used glitches. The game was a glitch on its own right. 
---
You won't get the reward again, but a lot of people who kill Scorchbeast queen regularly have all the recipes. X-01 is just as good as Ultracite if not better, which you get the schematics for from doing the Enclave quests.
---
Yeah, I had an arm doing it on my armor.
---
Problem: what if you don't have friends?
---
Perfect thanks mate 👍🏼
---
Nope. They dont add them up then take 75%, they take each on it's own case.
---
I hope this is the case! 
---
Not sure why you got down voted, you actually provided facts and a fact-based opinion-theory that was intelligently written.
---
Or, you know, find a different game.
---
I don't have that set yet, as I have T-51b that works fine, but pieces of my PA do get removed when entering them while wearing some armor pieces below it. ALso look at your Pip-Boy resist stats in your PA, exit PA take off your underarmor, and reneter your PA, then check your resists again. Do you see a difference?
---
&gt;Even if they refund you for something you bought from the atomic &gt;shop, it doesn’t get removed from your account. Because they &gt;can’t.
---
I can confirm this is not true, I've bought two floors I didn't like and they refunded atoms and removed the items from my account within an hour.
---
It's one extra pellet, but when you combine it with lots of perk cards, it can still make a big difference
---
I've bought a tse pump shotgun and tse assault rifle, I almost never use them. They drain all the fun out of the game. I have a tse the dragon that I found myself, and I sometimes use that just for fun, but with that reload animation it actually feels somewhat balanced
---
It's so weird that it's a different slot for each of us and always the same slot. I'd love to find out what the cause is.
---
It's hard to balance a game both for the min-max OP weapon players and the casual..    
---
That said its not hard to find a balance yourself.. By adjusting your playstyle..
---
I know I can one shot nearly everything, so rather than doing that j perk adjust for balance and use fun weapons like a guitar sword...
---
I could use X-01, but I love raider PA, so I'm using it instead...
---
I could use a TSE, but instead I have a 2 shot Gatling gun, powerful for more balanced..
---
I play this game solely for scorchbeast genitalia
---
As mentioned there are websites that perform some of the same functions, however this is a "Central Hub" of a website. Bringing together all aspects of the fallout community to 1 location, which is where the name was from "Central Fallout". Our primary focus is going to be build guides, quest guides, plan lists etc, while having the other functionality there for anyone to use!

A regularly go for runs to gather up about 20 bloodleaf plants and soot flowers for crafting. In the last week, an issue occurs where the bloodleaf plants will largely disappear from my inventory as I go to craft. I double checked that they were not spoiled and I definitely didn’t drop or consume them, but it has happened each time I have done the run this week. 
---
Fuck. Those. I lost like 2 hours of gameplay in New Vegas getting trapped at a save point being poised by a group of them. 
---
ususally getting 1 xp (or more ofc) will set the bar to the correct ammount, since this information is stored serverside (if i am correct),.
---
same with loading the game in a powerarmor, you often see your health bar at 0 with 100% radiation and your AP at 0 with 100% red too. after a while it seems to suddenly pop back and show the correct values (sometimes over time, sometimes i just use something to eat/drink and it will pop back).
---
Dont forget this is Bethesda, nothing works the way it was intended, just buy atoms for overpriced cosmetics and dont complain...
---
They were horrible last night. I was trying to play with a friend and everytime we would get on the same server one of us would be disconnected or get the blue screen of death. 
---
Thats a big oooof there dawg.
---
Looking at the content of your comment, I would guess you're at the lower end of that average age.  
---
Im down for this. But it wont happen in 1000000 years. 
---
unfortunately, you can't.. it's technically a "safe zone"
---
I think the cause is certain pieces of armor you are wearing under it. If you remove that particular piece of normal armor before entering your PA it should stop doing it.
---
Actual amount of issues fixed may vary***
---
A simple fix to to transform every TSE in the game into a random legendary weapon of the same type.  i.e. TSE Shotgun because same level, same number of effects but effects are all random.
---
The dev room is probably being patched too. People were accessing it for the plans and items in it
---
Ahhh it's the armour piece under it is it? I'll have to check it out next time I'm on. Thanks for info
---

---
Self regulate 
---
TSE is overpowered, so I don't use it..
---
I kill myself all the time with my exploding weapons, lol.
---
It is a shame, can't fit in unusual floor patters without stuff not matching.
---
Yanny.
---
Well PC also get mods much easier as well.  overall, being PC platform is not necessarily negative.
---
"PHUC YOU WHITESPRING FARMERS!"
---
Well either way, they have the power of Activision behind them
---
If you have problem with Scorchbeats, means your build/gear is not good enough. Considering they are one of the end-game enemies, SBQ and Scorchbeasts are  disappointingly easy to deal with them imho. In fact, FO76 itself is a very easy and casual game.
---
I can kill them so easily even without non legendary weapons (.45 auto combat rifle and 10mm auto pistol). been hunting them regularly for buff food( +AGI +END +dmg resist) since I hit level 50 and non-legandary combat rifle was my main weapon till level 145.
---
here's my short clip
---
[https://youtu.be/OHfBRwG32hI](https://youtu.be/OHfBRwG32hI)
---
my build is rifle/pistol sneak\_VATS\_crit
---
Thanks just replied to your other post. Great info!
---
Cant apply hard bargain lvl 3 perk card. Says i dont have enough points even if i remove all other cards!
---
In terms of bugs, crashes and dcs, yeah. Seldom I get dc or crash at scorchbeast queen and in random places.
---
Yes it's in the best interest of the game in the long rung to alienate everyone that every traded for an item that was possibly duped and you have no way of knowing. I'm sure that'll go along great with the B.E.T.A. timeframe, the atom shop, the nylon bag, the patch notes, the communication, the rum, the nerfs, the dox, et cetera.
---
how the heck do people do this? Every time I move my camp, I have a hell of a time finding a place where it is allowed to sit. More than once I've had to move camp multiple times before I find a place the darn thing will fit.
---
Laser Gatling, too. Ultracite Gatling Laser, too. Prime variants, too.
---
I can't tell if it has any effect on Plasma Gatling.
---
Welcome to a whole new world of heavy weapons where you actually have a useful firearm.
---
Absolutely untrue, Fallout and Multiplayer, while being hard to join right, is the ultimate goal of gaming industry.
---
Someone - believes the reward frame doesn’t completely ‘unpack’ until it is used the first time. 
---
It could be that people just really didn’t check their inventory before posting but I have seen more than a few of them here and over at the official site. 
---
Personally not going to test it. 
---
I’m going to nitpick more and say it’s a cobalt. 
---
You said it - "End Game Enemy". I'm sorry if level 50 is endgame for you, but in a Fallout game it far from is.
---
Sounds like something a commie would say. 
---
Or maybe some perks are just passive. I've spent months learning the intricacies of locks, but next time I go to a safe I just drool stupidly as I've somehow completely forgotten how to do this thing. Need that Green Thumb for flux, ya know? 
---
Maybe start with no passive card slot at first but then lvl 5 you get your first and then every 5 levels you get one more passive slot, until lvl 50 when you stop.  Idk just something I'd like to see worked into the game
---
Yeah I got juicy gatling gun with 25% firing speed buff. Love it. Sadly, melee is just so much better so I don't feel the need to keep crafting ammo to perform worse.
---
Specialization is important, you can either do one thing well or a lot of things poorly. Even game companies try to make an official website for game stuff but it still winds up getting ignored in favor of LFG sites, trading forums, and discords.
---
There are dozens, if not hundreds, of minor bugs involving spelling, missing MA_ keywords in weapons, incorrect or broken recipes and leveled list problems..
---
Just involving stuff mod authors have found and submitted to Bethesda (and dear god we hope that stop ignoring us) would be cake to have 150 fixes in one patch, and it would be a tiny download l.
---
Those who played fallout 76 in 2018 received fallout 1, 2 and tactics for free on bethesda.net... So its not free for everybody..
---
I agree, focusing on QoL is top priority. 
---
I kind of doubt that whatever the programmer is working on now will be coming out shortly. Id wager that everything thats come out the passed 3 weeks has been available since launch. Theyre dripfeeding, not coming up with new stuff weekly. At least not that were seeing yet. (Im referring to atom store stuff, not patches or bug fixes or anything)
---
I'm pretty young for an army vet with a wife and kid if that's the case buddy
---
Endgame enemies shouldn't be able to bother lower level players.
---
Agree...
---
It's the game's job to present a challenge, not the player's job to make the game challenging.
---
Lol i thought it was only me, 
---
If you have mods applied to your right leather arm it will not take the paint, if no mods then it will get blue.
---
Left are has no issue (at least for me)
---
Some very interesting ideas.  
---
Lets put the bell out for Bethesda
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
/u/LoneVaultWanderer 
---
Whatcha Think?
---
Don't forget most children toys also contain lead.
---
So look at the complaint in this thread. You either have levels, and all the advantages it brings (along with unbalanced PVP), or you have the scaling factor, which leaves PVP open to abuse. Any level of middle ground will require a compromise on either PVP or the fallout RPG elements.
---
Or you could eliminate PVP, and thus negate the whole point of having multiplayer in the first place.
---
Touche. Do what ever makes you happy I guess
---
Damage is done. They need to figure out how to remove all these TSE weapons. My only hope is in a month or so these noobs will be burnt on the game from cheating into high lvls with o.p. weapons making the game boring and pointless to them.
---
Where did i say that you needed to stop having fun?
---
Hi
---
What i can say, welcome to the club :) I have crashed so many server, because of this bug. You still can retain some stuff from your char and here is the way how:
---
1. Find PowerArmor and get inside
---
2. Please take a break (5 min) until your items that you are wearing  will be loaded (notification will be displayed on the screen if they was legendary)
---
3. Now, you can access your pip-boy and the part of your inventory.
---
4. Save everything available to the stash 1 by 1, otherwise your are risking to crash and start from the beginning.
---
DO NOT TRADE, it will lead to the server crash.
---
After this you can start to recover stacked items, like ammo, stim packs and etc. Repeat point 1 and 2,  ask your friends to drop, lets say 1 stim pack. Then you need to pickup it and if will get an access to the all the stim packs you have. Drop them or save to the stash, repeat for each items you need to save, including serums and etc.
---
If you have alot of junk on you, you can just die and ask your friend to pick it up for you.
---
I hope this help you at least to recover the items. Lets cross the fingers that today's path will fix that.
---
I will also point out that earlier this week while fighting the Queen with the stagger perk enabled I was able to keep her on the ground just by firing at her once she was on the ground. It acted like a tackle effect. While I wasn't doing a ton of damage, I was able to keep her stuck down on the ground for the Melee group to come in and melt her. Not sure if that was a bug for that session, or staggering working as intended, but it was repeatable during that fight. As soon as I stopped shooting her with my gattling gun she would take off. 
---
Well who knows how much actually currency is in each "item" of Pre-War money. The model for it does look like a sizable stack of bills. Maybe Pre-War Money (1) = $150
---
Depends on how they count those fixes. I mean if you have same bug in 100 places and you fix them just with find &amp; replace, will that count as 1 fix or 100 fixes. 
---
Hoe can it hit for a quart of the price when IT WILL RELEASE AT 50% OFF! BUY NOW!
---
Everything else is too easy with explosive lege effect and PA, except SBQ. The more stronger you get, the harder sbq gets, cuz of the scaling. Which is quite weird. 
---
Oh I hadn't even thought of that. Was gonna test in the next random frame I found, but it might not work the same for a quest reward placed directly into your inventory
---
you're welcome
---
Where's your camp? Whitesprings is kind of a no camp zone from what I understand unless you like having people break your stuff
---
I think the debuff only happens if you can’t pay a bounty. Just dying would just drop you to zero. 
---
Ive farm qhitesprings multiple times this week on XB1 had plenty of legendaries and loot everytime. Only about 1 in 30 drops are decent tho.
---
The game can be as challenging as you want to make it. It seems some would like to make it more of a challenge for everyone, when the simple solution is for them to simply change or remove their perks and use different armor and weapons if they want a hardcore experience.
---
Even worse is when you are in the Bog, get one down to 25%...and then it flies away off the map.
---
is mine....at this time
---
Not my favorite game of all time either, but I'm enjoying the hell out of it anyway..
---
Pfft, how could it compete when "busty babes 3, backyard adventures" released at the same time?!
---
This could be my favorite game tho. If they actually make some changes and fix issues. Im excites for the patch today.
---
I have heard it before people calling for a inventory wipe to reset the playing field. Would be great if it was legendary weapons exslouding the ones you get from quests like daisy cutter
---
I’m imagining a deathclaw with one of those old school leather aviator caps with goggles just floating around from victim to victim. I really want this in the game now.
---
This is what you signed up for
---
I disagree 
---
some cheater xp exploit duper at level 300+ who runs around killing low levels with his TSE whatever has no rights. 
---
I know I am re-posting this several times but...
---
A simple fix to to transform every TSE in the game into a random legendary weapon of the same type. i.e. TSE Shotgun becomes legendary shotgun of the  same level, same number of effects but effects are all random.
---
Stop the Duping then...
---
u/Cyshox
---
Aahh, is that why I crashed 4 times last night? Nothing quite like using up literally all of my Stimpacks, .50 ammo, 5.56 ammo, and 10mm ammo fighting a SBQ only to crash while she's at ~10% health.
---
I spend most of my time in my excavator suit,  so why bothet with PA paints when I would never get to enjoy it? 
---
However, if the paints did apply to the excavator suit, I would have bought at least one by now. 
---
Dang 19 nukes in a month, kinda makes me feel bad when i thought my friends and i were casual but killed queen 23 times yesterday lol.
---
not a favorite of mine, but it's still fun as hell to play 
---
It's not my favorite game of all time, but it could be if they keep working on it. It's one of the games I've put the most hours into, along with Skyrim, Mass Effect, WoW, a bunch of other MMOs etc.
---
test ps4 internet connection
---
try to log into your account on [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net)
---
rebuild ps4 database
---
Well it's mine favorite fallout game... I just enjoy playing it and meeting other players etc, i don't understand why everyone is hating it so much... I understand that they don't like the bugs but Bethesda have fixed lots of them already
---
I’ll take any junk you have. I’ll let those Chen’s and weapons go to someone that will get more use out of it
---
thx saw &amp; upvoted already :'D
---
The duped items will eventually be surpassed by 4/5 star weapons. Them being duped in such quantities just means they'll get nerfed sooner. They won't have delete anything besides certain people's accounts
---
If there was unique identifers (not primary database keys), then yes, those would be duplicated property of the database item and easy to remove.  But not sure that is in place; has to be there prior to the duplication effect.
---
When I have multiple maps, I dig the site and then wait a few seconds (normally for the animation of digging to finish and for the clouds to settle). Doing this, I've personally had no issues. It doesn't seem to be reliant on the top left bar telling you what you've looted.
---
Makeshift Batteries and Paint is the best Lead yield, specially the Blue Paint.
---
I get the idea of having the caps scale to level, but it should definitely stop increasing after level 50, as that's when you stop getting new SPECIAL points.
---
How do I put passive mode on? Is it only for pc? I couldn't find it but I will check again.
---
Haha, you on PC? Cause I'll trade you an ultracite legs and explosive vent AND this stick I just found for those two. It's a really nice stick
---
Okay, a little off topic, but I saw someone with the Hot Rod paint on a set of T-60 the other day.
---
Did I miss this in the ATOM shop or something???
---
It's the purple/yellow/orange flames on white design.
---
I’m kind of new also (FO76 is my first fallout game) I usually play around 7-10pm cst during the week and randomly throughout the weekend if you wanna play together. My ign is Blayne159
---
Go to Tanagra Town. There's one that spawns there.
---
You can find the plans at vendors, too.
---
Hopefully dupers get BANNED 
---
They could also play with one hand tied behind their back. The game is not challenging me I am challenging myself. So why do I need the game at all in this scenario?
---
Why not put the expectation on the game designers to design some challenges beyond 'Shoot this big thing a lot of times' or 'Shoot a lot of these small things a few times'.
---
Can confirm. I was mass scrapping and accidentally scrapped my excavator armor. Nearly crapped myself before I see the excavator pieces pop up in my inventory. Only the frame got scrapped.
---
Let's be honest here, the drop list for everything in this game is pretty terrible.
---
Killed a rare mob like the flatwoods monster or mouth man? Here's a toy rocket and a piece of wood armor.
---
Eh? Pipe rifles are just pipe pistols with rifle sticks. Make an automatic pistol then swap the grip for a stock.
---
Unless you mean the pipe bolt action or pipe revolver? Those don’t have automatic.
---
There is a small chance you actually get the cake.
---
There are automatic pipe rifles
---
Focus on the systems needed to support the social content that was always purported to be how the "real" story would take shape.
---
It should be obvious that bringing in, making, and keeping groups of players is essential to the financial success of this kind of game. At the simplest level, members of a group tend to stick around (nobody wants to be the first or last to leave a party). Further, groups drive the in-game cosmetic buying habits needed to sustain a service game as people want to show off and distinguish themselves from their friends.
---
The reason so many people want vendor mechanics, even amidst so many economy-breaking exploits, is because they want to have places and a reason to gather together, and better that mechanic than nothing. 
---
The social component of end-game content fits in here as well. The queen and the golf course aren't going to keep things running. That might seem obvious, but I do see people who seem to think we just need to polish that loop to keep people happy. There needs to be systems that bring players together and help them make meaningful connections by overcoming challenges.
---
Speaking of which, I accidentally sold my daisy cutter a few weeks ago, and now life is terrible forever. They need a way to mark inventory items as "not for sale or disassembly," or to re-get unique quest items.
---
Did you have your holy hand grenade?
---
For some people they just like to hate everything. Every new movie that comes out is the worst movie ever. Every new game is the worst game ever. Then there are news outlets and YouTubers who get a lot of clicks and ad revenue for being negative. Then there are players who are just really frustrated about some bug or something and want to vent.
---
If the dupers don’t think they can track this stuff....how are we able to use the recent tab to find everyone we’ve been on the last 3-4 servers with 
---
 If your luck is high enough you'll actually get that slice of cake. Its a trophy of sorts. I have one. 
---
I hope they stop the duping, and yes, that would stop the problem, but two things. One, the people who don't use reddit or forums wouldn't know why their gear changed, and the decision would alienate those people from an already dwindling player base.
---
Two, how about x01 jet packs? Serums, bobble heads, Flux ammo and mods that have also been duped, how do you fix those problems? Its nlt fair to wiped only one set of duped items when theres so many other items duped too. Complete wipe of everyone's gear seems the only option as there's so much duped gear, not just TSE weapons. And I'm ok with that, but that would be the final nail in the coffin.
---
A rushed patch so we beta test it for console i presume....
---
had that happen to me as well.  It just attacked me after I accidently went stealth and popped out.
---
Isn't explained in-game as a promo by Nuka-Cola corporation?
---
Well then, use the same data structure and have them package some paints together.
---
It seems like people keep wanting to come up with excuses or some sort of logical reasoning as to why something is one way and not the other. Chrome is available on only the minigun, because thats all Beth decided to design and release. "Blah blah theyd have to do this, blah blah itd have to be done like that." People act as if they couldnt develop this stuff, if they havent already.
---
Im sure it does take time. Ok, ill wait. Im waiting already. They could have held off releasing the chrome minigun, applied that paint to more weapons, and then released them. As a package.
---
Its really dumb that i can buy Vault Tec paint for leather, combat, and Power Armor. Thats truly absurd. I should be charged a single price for Vault tec paint, that applys to all of those things. And metal.
---
Even if they dont have everything upon release. Lets say they offer Chrome as paint, but only available on mingun AS OF NOW. You purchase the paint, the devs can now see what paint is favored, and they can start making more skins in that paint, which is then free to those who already purchased that paint.
---
Thanks! Ya seems like a smart move on devs part, stop people from losing their minds about scrapped PA. Same reason you can't scrap legendaries I'm guessing lol
---
Problems are caused by anti-griefing mechanisms that dont do their job well.
---
The fun thing about what happens when you mix PvP and PvE players in an open PvP game is that players self-organize and learn to become invisible to PvPers, if they don't want to engage.
---
Not saying lone playing is something bad, but I honestly can't wait for open PvP servers where I'll migrate for the whole purpose of roleplaying a wasteland patrol that protects the survivors from raider players. In wasteland setting, PvP and RP do not fight each other, they depend on each other.
---
If whitesprings were the only spot in map where you get automated retailation from the map if you attack other players, you would see how it becomes the meeting hub where you organise  your raids so that your group has a chance to do their job despite the predators lurking outside the gate. Immersion times thousand.
---
The game is OK, just isn't my favorite game.
---
Hmm, maybe it is a bolt action...
---
Hey, apparently I'm an idiot and still have the Barn Building Set sitting in my inventory. Would you like to trade for something?
---
That’s fair but it’s an awfully clunky feature. I doubt it was intended to be used by switching lockpicking and hacking perks every time someone wanted to hack something. That’s why I suggest removing them from the equation entirely. They still have a level requirement and are removed from needing to switch every time. Even if there was a load out switching tool. It would be annoying to have to use that tool every time you wanted to hack something too. 
---
Just saying including a weapon gained from cheating into a "build" is not a valid build.  Its just cheating.
---
Damn nice work adding to my DLs
---
You can turn cloth into gunpowder, true.
---
But you can also turn super-mutants into gunpowder, which is more amusing.

Did they say how long Bethesda net would be down? Eager to jump back in.
---
It was in the Adam shop a couple days ago
---
Not nerf, fix. I don't think they are behaving properly. I've become a sort of exterminator because of how annoying those fuckers are. 
---
Holy shit, I forgot all about Nightkin!
---
You don't need level 50 to have a complete view of the game. The game lay out is similar to previous FO and even Elder Scrolls games. It only takes a little while to see what changes were made.  This is true in any game as it only takes the first level or two to see what a game is about and if you like it.  Because nothing about game play will change after those first two levels. Story might change a bit but that is about it. 
---
People that get off on ruining other peoples enjoyment should get stuffed rectally with pineapples or cacti. 
---
Thanks for the reply.
---
Tried the first two to no avail. Unsure what you mean by rebuild PS4 database. 
---
scares me seeing this because i have a decon shower
---
Wait, the laser gatling can be made useful? Holy crap; I finally have something to do with my crapload of cores besides sprinting everywhere in power armor!
---
May just be RNG being lousey. I have found 4 weapons with tse.
---
And around 10 each of just one or thr other and im only level 112.
---
But i have only found 2 decent peices of armor that is actually worth using.
---
Im just curious i just play and enjoy the game who just sits around thinking this shit up lol i could care less if the guy running the wastelands near me has alt with 100 billlion pounds. Really who cares, enjoy the game.
---
Are you mad?!
---
I was just wondering this same thing. Because i swear i picked up a plan for a tinker station but cant build it. 
---
We are discussing a problem with the core mechanic of the game that will be present even in open PVP servers. You can't have balanced pvp and leveled RPG elements at the same time.
---

---
All they would have to do, is to put a fucking number next to the similar named items. 
---
Yes its bad.  The novelty of feeling powerful wears off and your appreciation of the struggles you and others had before are diminished. Also as you have less need to think of novel solutions to problems since you can just power through encounters that ability is diminished as well.   Humans are not mentally developed to be gods.  Some will grow bored, some will turn to darker practices to perpetuate the novelty, and a very few will try helping others, but in helping them over much they are weakening them. 
---
Skins need to be texture specific, not item specific. And if it needs to be item specific right now, at least let me know buying chrome (for minigun) now will allow me access to more chrome weapons in the future. Dont have it apply to one item, like you stated, may hardly get used.
---
I dont purchase item specific skins as they make me feel as though im stuck with that item, rather than the look im going for.
---
No, it's one of many QOL changes everybody asks Bethesda, hopefully they'll listen...
---
Perfectly Preserved Pie, people.  Not cake.
---
If you throw a bunch of explosives within a short time it immediately takes off. As a mad bomberman that makes me MAD. So explosives no go. It will stay if you let it get close and hit you but why would I do that?
---
I haven't played 1/2 yet but in 3 and NV they used to destroy me. They are honestly pretty laughable in this game.
---
There are currently three pipe guns in the game: The Pipe Bolt-Action (chambered in .308 by default), Pipe Revolver (.45 cambered) and Pipe Gun (.38). The Bolt-Action and Revolver do not have automatic versions, only the pipe gun that is (by default) chambered in .38. You have to scrap those to discover the mod. You then go to a Weapons Workbench and modify the Receiver to make it automatic.
---
To make it a rifle, you just modify the Grip to a Stock at a Workbench. If you have any specific questions just let us know!
---
You are fully responsible for your actions. Don't put a blame on anybody else. You are the villain here.
---
I have done about 20 or so whitesprings nukes.  About 6 or so Prime.
---
I would say I have seen hundreds of legendaries drop easily.
---
1% = 1 out of 100.  
---
.5% = 2 out of 100.
---
I have seen maybe 300-400 legendaries so far in game, so that percent is probably .25% if I am being realistic. 
---
This means I have been to a Whitespring nukezone and fought there for at least 30 minutes without Server-hopping.
---
Yes, was a like 20 hour sale or something over the weekend.  I got it, only noticed cuz I saw someone in it during the sale and was like "wtf" and checked

Only the strong survive...
---
Lol but I only have a single shot exploding lever I just use it to tag enemies once and let all the others do my work for me 
---
&gt;No faster way to kill and piss off the player base     
---
Man, if only I had a bottlecap for every time I've heard that one. Sounds more like like somebody is getting defensive of their real money weapon purchase, no?    
---
The fact is, in over 500 hours of play I have not seen a single TSE weapon drop, it's supposed to be uber endgame shit that ya'll just bought from a website offering *hacked* weapons for real money, you deserve to lose your shit.    
---
If that weapon wasn't cheated into the game, it'd be selling for $100+ You got scammed and you're breaking the game, I'm tired of seeing fucking TSE shotguns on every other character I meet.    
---
If it's going to make you leave the game, good, see ya! You probably aren't contributing to the actual game developer anyways. 
---
Damn... I dislike these limited time item drops. 
---
That's my favorite paint. 
---
*atom, not Adam, voice recognition fail
---
Yep. Got mine in Harper's Ferry. They cost about 400 caps if I recall, that's with rank 3 of hard bargain too.
---
The game allows you to become powerful. It allows you to get good weapons and armor, to stack perks and chems and make the game easy. You are choosing to make it easy yourself also. I would like there to be more challenges also, but it's difficult to balance with so many different builds and weapons and armors. Something might be easy for you, but a challenge for someone else. But yeah hopefully they do add some kind of dungeon or raiding systems with challenging content that doesn't just boil down to shoot a mob with massive health for 10 minutes. Though a lot of games do have that kind of thing for boss fights, and others have developed over time to have more interesting and challenging mechanics.
---
"Dark as the Dungeon"
---
An endgame quest requiring a team.  A few holotapes reveal the existence of a Scorchbeast Queen Mother, and that her destruction will begin the extinction of the scorchbeasts.
---
You are lead to an instanced abandoned mine complex, and it is a slow, punishing slog.  Flooded sections, enemies, bad air.  (Coal mines have "the damps" which refer to different types of bad air:  stink damp, fire damp, or the deadly black damp.  Namely some areas can explode if shots are fired in them, or can kill you quickly if you are unprepared.)  Not a lot of junk so you have to carry a lot in with you to keep everything repaired.  (The tapes will explicitly state that scavangers picked the area clean.)  About 3/4ths the way in there is an area for the CAMPs.  Along the way are repair stations but no Stashes.  Progress requires the standard dungeon stuff of keys, locks, and terminals.  Explosives would be required at one point.  I would put in a few different SPECIAL checks as well to simplify some of the puzzles.  (This mechanic already being present in the game.)
---
Final boss is the queen mother, hanging upside down in a cave filled with baby scorchbeasts.  The babys are not difficult but do require ammo and attention while the queen mother alternates between cave roof or floor with sonic attacks.  The sonic attacks are intended to keep players pinned while other players are forced to draw her attention.
---
I would have this make lasting changes in the world.  After a team manages to defeat her, or after x amount of times she is defeated by unique characters, scorchbeasts appear less and less often, and are weak or malformed from inbreeding.  Or, if you were part of a team that defeated her, whatever server you are on gets lower scorchbeast spawn rates. 
---
And anyone who manages to get through it stares blankly into space everytime Dark as the Dungeon comes on the radio.
---
There have been reports that the 'anti-armor' legendary affix affects ballistic DR, but not energy DR. If you use the perception perk to see DRs, they change in real time depending on perks and weapons equipped.
---
I addressed your first point on the other reply. Your second point is moot as it if wasn't in place before, there is no way to do it now. From what I've gathered on the reddit from other people's posts, it wasn't implemented so it can't be done. Though I agree, it would have been nice for them to have added it as it would have solved the duping problem by now if they can remove duplicate unique identifiers.
---
Yeah...  We really need interior wall options so that we can make rooms without one side looking like it's outdoors.  We know the walls exist because they have them in their own structures.  My house is brick, but I had to use wood for interior hallways and stuff because brick looked and behaved weird indoors.  Having a wall two sided as interior would be great!!!
---
I was out of town this weekend.
---
feelsbad
---
I agree, but I just wish they would ditch the shoddy tagging system. People having to walk on eggshells to make sure they don't violate murder etiquette by killing something too fast is tedious.
---
[Yeah that sure would be something, wouldn't it](https://i.imgur.com/PRplO8D.jpg)?

I'm leaving my wife for you.

---
I wish they continued the Fallout 2 line, where some Deathclaws were sentient and intelligent.
---
Imagine those guys e.g. plotting to take over the Enclave and going malicious.
---
OMG I saw someone pull that shit last night after I nuked whitesprings if I had a orbital strike I would of used it so instead I used my explosive shotgun to kill everything while he tried to fix his turrets 
---
It's actually a different satellite in Fallout 3. It's named: Bradley-Heracles. It has Bunker Buster's (As seem while blowing up the MBC at Adams Airforce Base) while the satellite in Fallout 3 is scheduled to fall from the sky within 25 more years. Personally I have no idea how that satellite is still functional after 200 years. Then again the NCR has control of GPS satellites as depicted in New Vegas, so I guess anything is possible.
---
i was the same till i got a tse now i hunt them whenever i see one.. go on crusade
---
Nicely put...  LOL
---
Can you MAKE a shielded BoS Officer Suit for me that I can actually pay for with caps? 
---
If you continue playing the game, it answers your questions. If the search for those answers isn't enough to make you want to play the game, then this game probably isn't for you.
---
does the pool also work as entry/exit or too shallow?
---
If you actually play the game the story will tell you what happened to the people.
---
It's because of the story. I don't want to go into spoilers but if you follow the main story line it makes sense why you can't find any people alive.
---
SPOILER: [Spoiler](/s "It's due to the Scorch Plague killing everyone. Look at those frozen green humanoid statues. It's why you have a quest to immunize yourself against it")
---
It's funny how some people have established themselves as the post apocalyptic zoning commission.  Leave people alone.  I don't even put turrets at my home.  People are free to lounge and use the facilities.
---
Its called radiation and disease. Hence the reason we now have ghouls and scorched. We also don't have NPCs because players are the replacement.
---
How do you force them to land?
---
I usually just run away and hid, or run towards someplace where I think some other players may be.  Even if you don't have a headset you can find people to team with in the game, if only on a temporary basis.  I know Todd said you can play on your own, and you can, but finding allies is still a strategically viable option, that they have, and should have, taken into account.
---
All that being said - loot could be a little better - even if it was just that the scorchmeat had a higher value, or that there was more ultracite on them.
---
I have to go back and unlock about 3 or 4 achievements for my xbox.. I almost laughed when I saw that the "total percent of players" that completed the "leaving vault 76" achievement was sitting at around 76%. lol
---
**1:** Agreed. I feel they should have seen this and had this available from the start. 
---
**2:** Agreed. I'm a little cautious buying any plan over 200 caps for this reason. I think the easiest solution is that the change the color of plans and recipes you already own. Also, the names need to match. There's a lot of camp items that what the plans are called, aren't what they are called in the menu when building. That's so frustrating. 
---
I think the easiest solution is to have plans and recipes you know, show up a different color. Maybe something in the reds? Or a big check mark at the FRONT of the name. Not at the end, where it can get cut off. 
---
**3:** Some items don't junk automatically when you scrap all junk. Beer bottles, baseballs, and such don't because you need the actual items to make things. The game needs to be consistent with that kind of set up. Twice I've scrapped Hardened Mass because oops, wasn't thinking. Totally my fault the second time I did it. I knew better. 
---
But for sure, weapons and armor needs to be marked as don't scrap or sell. If just because people tend to play by button mashing over paying attention. 
---
**4:** Yeah. 
---
**5:** I thought they said that duplicate perk cards shouldn't happen now? I think it's unavoidable after a certain level. In theory, with no level limit, you'll have every perk at max rank. Personally, I do like duplicate cards. I've got a couple perks all at ranks 1, 2 and 3. Like Pack Rat. It's so I can have more versatility in setting up my character. 
---
**6:** Yeah. I also had mine set to blue. 
---
**7:** I'm not against this. Just seems like a bit of headache in terms of coding and tracking items for the servers. Maybe once you rename something it's tied to just your character, and if you want to trade, sell or get rid of it, you can hit, un-name. This could be tied into how you could mark items not for sale/scrap?
---
**8:** Yes. 
---
**9:** Yes. Possibly having something like a radio tower in your camp? Which allows your camp to appear on the map. And you can type a short message. With naughty word filters. This could be especially useful when player vending comes to the game. Advertise what you are selling. Or advertise services. Like if you can repair items for less materials, increase durability. Or making items with better durability. 
---
**10:** I think they just need to make some things already in the game specific. For example, dressers just holding cosmetic clothing. After a while, they start to take up space in the stash box. I'm all for the fridge idea. It could be a way to increase the stash limit in a way that is server friendly. 
---
**FISHING.** Yes. And when they do add this, there better be three eyed fish. That's all I'm saying.   
---
My ideas. 
---
**11:** Color code the quests by team member when grouped. Both on the right side and ON the compass. Possibly white, yellow, orange and red? When you are trying to use the compass, and you've got all the different stars and diamonds up, it gets a little hard to tell. Colors for each team member would be a very quick visual aid.
---
**12:** Way more emotes on the wheel. Like, Wait a Second. Or , I want to give you something. There should also be a better way to know someone has a mic. I know you get the little speaker when the person is talking. But maybe it's yellow, and then turns red when talking? And maybe make changing the Audio settings accessible from the pipboy?  
---
**13:** There definitely needs to be some CAMP love. I would love quests that have the potential for plans for special items that have effects on them for camps. Like, a quest that gives you those cool laser turrets you see in the world, that go on the side of walls.
---
What if you could earn plans for craft stations that made better items? Like a topnotch stove, that when food is cooked on, lasts longer? Or increase the amount of healing, or increases the duration of bonus? Or Chemistry stations that make your chems last 10-20 even 30% longer? 
---
Imagine if you set up a workshop. You have your regular benches for free. But in the back, are the special benches. And for a low price of say 20 caps, you have access to it for an hour, to build better items?
---
The same could be with beds. The nicer the bed, the longer or better the Well Rested Bonus is. Maybe different beds did different things. Like what if one bed gave you some damage resist for a short time? Or radiation resistance? Now someone can set up a hotel if they want. 
---
There needs to be more reasons to get people to want to come to other peoples camps, other than, my stuff broke and I'm going to use your benches without even talking to you. 
---
**14:** Change some crafting. Like cooking. Some recipes are so repetitive. I'm looking at you teas. I think some could be done where you decide which ingredients you want to use. Steeped Tea. And then you decided what plant you want to use. Same infused and sweetened. The list is a lot to scroll down on. 
---
What if you could make Appalachilli with meat other than possum? And in doing so, it changes what bonus you get? 
---
**15:** Canning and Jarring food. I'd love to see an option that allows me to make canned or Jarred food, that extends the life of the food. It could work like this. You have a section in your Stove menu for Preserved food. Things like stews and soups, could be canned, and you would need besides the regular ingredients, an actual can, and 1 steel scrap. Things like teas, need a mason jar with lid. Freeze dried stuff would be steaks and such. Those need two plastics. The food then has it's shelf life increased by say, 20-40%. The weight also goes up some.
---
Toss in Food Vending machines, which when food is in it, halts the spoil timer. You stock up your Food Vending machine, and other players can stock up on your tasty treats. 
---
**16:** Robot agents. Which could give the hacker perk more use. You can set your robots to as as vendors that sell AND buy. Where as vending machines can only sell. You can pick which items the robot will buy and for how much. Let say you want players to bring your cans, for your canning business. You set the price at 1 cap per ten cans. When the player trades, they can take the sell or buy option. When they take sell, the list of items you are willing to pay for, and the amounts shows up. Once the vendor bot uses up all the caps you gave it to buy things, it can still sell.
---
So as to make it so your vendor bot doesn't go crazy and gets wanderlust, you have to set up a counter for it to stand behind. The question then, can someone kill your vendor bot, and steal some of the caps it has? I'm sure a lot of people wouldn't like that. Just that it has potential role play fun. 
---
Put a prime receiver on an Ultracite Gatling Laser. It's only one flux per core and they're 125% fusion cores in non-prime laser gatling.
---
That's the cheapest "legit" damage boost you can do with prime receivers and the ammo still works in the plain version.
---
 It's to get you to spend real money on atoms because you won't have time to save up enough in game before the sale goes away
---
Yeah I'm not sure it is for me tbh, I'll play some more becuase I love fallout and want to give it a fair chance but it seems like such a waste becuase the map is so damn cool! 
---
Don't forget to scrap the extractor before moving the camp or you'll fill your budget with useless extractors.
---
If on console wait until after Monday for the patch. PC gets the patch today.
---
Yeah I'm sure we will all miss these paints at some point.  This is something they should announce in their newsletters along with more detailed summary of future patches.
---
Keep playing and be sure to read the notes and terminals as you go through the main quests. There's a certain plague spread by a particularly nasty beastie that basically wiped out human life in Appalachia.
---
Unhappy spoiler
---
There probably won't ever be human NPCs in this game, people have datamined the vaults (where the expansions are coming from) and well...it doesn't look like they'll be anything but just dungeons to run.
---
Yeah I guess it hit a little too close to the mark.  Humoring is hard
---
I was going for more so teen from well hydrated, because dodgy eats the AP bar really fast, and I keep a pretty good bit of soup with me at all times, so the hunger And thirst meter are not an issue. And refractor was just kinda a place holder. Wasn't really sure what to put for that one point. What type of legendary effects would you suggest for armor?
---
I feel like this sort of experience is more uncommon than common though?  
---
My experiences exploring other people's bases/having them visit mine have been positive so far. Except my first day playing the game where I accidentally shot up someone's portrait because I couldn't figure out why it had a health bar. I'm like - this painting is... my enemy?
---
No. No it wasn't.  
---
Anyways, one bounty later I'd learned my lesson. 
---
Fun fact - 5mm is also weightless! :)
---
Happens with torso for me
---
Server hopping does not wipe the bounty, neight does time or death to a pve enemy. So they will have that bounty until another player kills them, preventing them from seeing any other player on the map until then and removing caps from them even if they do not have any junk on them. So, as deterrents go, it's not so bad.
---
In about 200+ hours, I have only seen one person attempt to grief a low level by smashing thier base. As I found out after I killed them for it, they were a duper and my guess is, only found fun in the game by making other miserable. For those people, I can't think of a proper deterrent other than the slap damage system which makes it very difficult for them to have fun in this game. Or am I miss understanding what you wrote boss?
---
Yes. I don’t know if it was always this way, but it is now. So no more soiling your own pants, lol.
---
I see what you’re saying...and point out that many a change they’ve made to FO76 from FO4 all seem to indicate a balancing philosophy, ehhh no that isn’t the word...priority! Their balancing priority is towards reducing player character OPness. Pronounce that word out loud for funsies btw. 
---
Damage perks are more expensive for ultimately less bonus. You can’t stack chems anymore. They unlinked secondary effects from damage perk cards. Weapons themselves are weaker. The .50 hardened receiver for the hunting rifle isn’t even in the game! Energy weapons no longer have damage boosting capacitors. Charging barrels on the Gatling laser add three damage instead of something reasonable.
---
Some of that is overbalanced to be so worthless nobody in their right mind uses it. I believe they were afraid of player character power. I mean, even legendary effects are weakened. I heard furious caps at +15% damage, and while I haven’t confirmed the exact number, I do have a few and they don’t grow in power like they once did. 
---
So knowing this...I think they want to avoid the “godly” feel. And it’s fine if they do. I would just appreciate that when they nerf explosive, they also fix the stuff that’s criminally underpowered. So we aren’t left feeling like a bunch of Glass Joes.
---
Yeah but what is “passive” and what isn’t? I know what you mean but if you go down that road technically most weapon damage perks are passive. I know you mean the non-combat situational perks, just playing devils advocate.
---
Reminds me of the movie little nicky lol
---
Kids toys in the fallout universe are all painted with lead paint, which probably explains why they think "War never changes".
---
hold the power button on the console till it beeps twice then plug in a controller through the udb and i believe its the 4th or 5th option
---
Ok I just got an instigating deathclaw gauntlet so that's awsome.
---
cuz vaults only saved ppl, and players are the only people. one of the key elements in the story.
---
Noticed this last night when redoing my camp... kind of just made me sigh. like I should've known. 
---
is from FO4 DLC. Nuka World. Your point?
---
I would like a light blue painting with Graham symbols, it should be without problems with the lore
---
We all wish.
---
Is the story any good? Feels a bit empty but I'm willing to give it a go becuase I love the game mechanics, graphics and map.
---
Where did i say you did ?
---
This, Had this happen and this was the reason. Tweaking placement should help. 
---
I personally find uncovering the story of what happened to be a compelling reason to play, and I think it's more fun to figure it out myself than to have someone tell me. It's the main point of this game, at least the way I play it -- to figure out the stories behind all of the people who died. It's different than previous games, but I enjoy it.
---
Started yesterday for me, think they stealth patched some stuff and it has happened since, but I can exit PA, stash it, put it back on and leg is missing, can repeat over and over...
---
Awesome! Needs inside pics, though!
---
Just like real-life 😣
---
According to the Fallout Cookbook it’s actually cheesecake, disappointingly
---
On a serious note. Group of 4, share rank 3 ghoulish and have someone share rank 3 rad sponge... now you have a medic gun.
---
That makes me really sad, I assumed at least the vaults would have people and it just makes sense to recolonize the world over the next year or so sort of like how fortnites map changes every season. 
---
They ruin the game for themselves by cheating and then whine that there's nothing to do. 
---
To be honest, I think anything should require prewar money. All it's good for is cloth production right now, right?
---
Sounds to me that this thread is full of folks that haven't received their TSE yet from the RNG gods and are upset at the rest of us.
---
Zzzzz this discussion every day. Unless your talking about a complete weapons and perk rebalance TSE are not that OP in a mostly PVE game.  I've made mention before, there are videos online showing fire axes doing over 9k dmg and like 3 shotting a SBQ. You guys are like rabbit dogs reverberating in an echo chamber.
---
The main complaint is it's to OP for pvp and that has been debunked.

---
im trying to share enemies. i always carrying quad tesla for that purpose.
---
My first thoughts when I started playing was it was really empty. But keep playing you will find there's a lot in the game.
---
That's an awful lot of assuming in your comment bud. I haven't spent a dollar of real money buying in game guns that's beyond idiotic when farming caps is a snap to begin with. Feel free to browse my comment history as well I use fo76bazzar when I need sething. What a child "hey this person isn't willing to play a game when it stops being fun they must of paid real money for their guns." What kind of dipshit logic is that? I'm going to assume you're probably professional window licker
---
I might get some hate here...but just bring back cazadores. Make them a special “scorched” version whose poison kills, then corrupts and reanimates victims into scorched.
---
Jk. That’s a fucking nightmare.
---
It actually is, but you just don't know it... And Lars Von Trier's Antichrist is your favourite movie... And Philip K Dick's Valis is your favourite book.
---
It's worth noting that a lot of the attached scripts for vaults have CUT in the file name, and the only Vault we know for sure failed is the one in the Mire, the other two might be fine.
---
They could also just have people migrate back into the region, etc. Ultimately it's a question of if Bethesda wants to include them, and given how popular the idea is + the fact they've responded to community concerns in the past, I would assume we'll see npc humans again. 
---
I did the same with the bunker buster really want to get it agein 
---
Yeah, rly need some top noch retorics to change how ppl play the end-game.
---
End-game goal: get better weapons
---
End-game goal achieved: team playing destroyed
---
gj bethesda  
---
Dont hate on my sneak stablized 50 cal in power armor build!
---
That's fair enough, I probs shouldn't have asked this question but I didn't know there was much of a story I assumed it'd be a short tutorial type story and then just random side missions around the world while exploring. 
---
If you have a vats build you can target/damage their wings which will bring them down at least for a while.  Keep damaging their wings.
---
Also if you aggro them in an open area at some point they will land to wing-swat you.  I have had them do this more than once during a long fight.  
---
It's because the residents of the town were trying to continue their traditions after the apocalypse to regain some sense of normalcy. The lore in and around the town explains it.
---
&gt; The only content FO76 has is exploration since of all the problems they got one thing right but thats really it. FO76 end game is literally all grind. Once you hit level 50 the only thing left to do is grind legendaries. Very specific legendaries "2 shot" "explosive shot" etc. And pretty much the only way to do that is to nuke and grind whitesprings.
---
Welcome to the MMO lite game style. GTA, RDR2, Destiny, Sea of Thieves, etc would like to welcome you new player.
---
&gt;  PvP is completely broken so thats out of the picture, its almost not even worth them putting it in the game.
---
I'm not saying your lying here I'm just saying I do not belive it is possible for a more fucked up system then GTA Online's PvP to exist in a game. From giant gaping exploits of game mechanics like going passive mode the second someone is about to kill you. So you stay in passive mode until you get a good shot in return. To killing yourself to prevent the other guy from getting a kill. To spam firing the MK.2 Marksmen while waving side to side like a fair ground shooting gallery to just spaming the shit out of RPG's because why aim when the poor physics of the game will cause explosions to pass though buildings to kill someone on the other side. To the fact on console it is all auto aim so just pull up the sights and you auto target the nearest player removing even the minor need for aiming skill when used any rifle.
---
And that is just ground combat. Getting into vehicle combat is it's own cluster fuck. 
---
&gt; While GTAO theres alot of ways to make money and have fun doing so and ALOT more to do missions, races, mini games, pvp etc.
---
Making money and having fun are two different things in GTA. No one i know really enjoys droing business work.  What we do enjoy is taking planes from LSIA and trying to crash into each other while they are driving some were.  Or you know literally anything that isn't making money. 
---
It’s in your menus. Alongside audio options etc. 
---
gief patchnotes!
---
That's good to hear and hopefully Bethesda only do good things in 2019
---
I always find a lot of bones on Super Mutants too.
---
Get your self a tesla gun there's all the tags u need and amazing xp this is coming from a lvl 315 
---
Have you seen anything from Bethesda themselves stating that it can't be fixed?  Or was this all just from Reddit?  Many of the people who claim it can't be done are the ones who don't want it done.
---
The question really is can they do it without effecting players who didn't participate in the exploit?  That would all depend on how their database is setup.  It's pretty obvious looking at player inventories who has been involved in it.  Those accounts could be wiped completely.  They could wipe any item amount over a certain number depending on the item and the difficulty to aquire.  They could nerf damage on all current TSE weapons and release new versions.  Most people who haven't used the exploit or traded with someone who has would be happy with any of those.
---
Really it comes down to which solution will help the game and lose the least amount of the player base.  Personally, I would be willing to completely start over if it meant that the issue was fixed and no one had a unfair advantage.  I believe they will lose more players if they don't fix it than if they do.  If the hardest items to achieve can be handed to you in a hour, what is left to do in the game once you have it all?  Why continue to work for anything if you gain no advantage over those who don't?
---
Until Bethesda themselves states whether they will or won't fix it then it is still up in the air but there is always a solution to a problem.
---
I would add factions with npc's that can give you missions and quests. 
---
The best stories involve conflict and emotions. Sci Fi stories that are amazing touch on and expand on the human condition, even if they don't involve humans. Star Wars, Star Trek, Dune, Enders Game, etc. The foundation for amazing story is here already!
---
 Appalachia is actually not a bad area compared to Fo3 and FoNV. Settlers, caravaners, raiders, brotherhood, enclave, scavengers, etc should be attempting to return to the area for resources. Give players something to fight for. Make my choices mean something! Each faction has goals, align yourself with a group that has values you believe in.
---
Continue adding more items, plans, weapons, and high level battles to keep people grinding and spending atoms.
---
So what... you spent the whole time interacting with npcs on other games that 99% of literally offered nothing? But you just, stood with them? 
---
Oh my gooooood, this changes everything!   
---
I assumed it was just a pathos-inspiring exercise in futility.
---
The story is quite good, but it requires investing a good deal of time reading the various terminals and notes scattered throughout Appalachia to piece it all together.
---
How much intelligence is needed to craft the highest possible resists?
---
That’s what made the game? 
---
That's nice with vats. Wish we could damage them without vats. Oh well now I know, thanks!
---
I'm a Fallout nut so I love it. It takes place before any other of the Fallout games. I think it's a good story line; not a GREAT story so far, but a good one. But Bethesda will be dropping content DLC (Free) and grow the story over time based on our input so I'm hopeful. If you're enjoying the mechanics and other stuff, just keep going.
---
Also there are lots of side areas and lore on terminals so if you want more backstory look for those. I love how they make these (dead) people feel lived with their stories and holotapes.
---
That makes sense! I'll keep playing becuase I'm still having fun just hope we eventually get some people 
---
Can confirm.
---
Why did you link wrecking ball hahaha
---
I don't understand the idea behind selling paint jobs for one weapon or one armour type. The power armour ones are at least more than one specific type, but it would be nice to see some options for excavator and raider.
---
Today they have a chrome paintjob on sale, but it only works on a minigun. Why can't I have a chrome .44?
---
The armour ones are even odder, since I never have a matching set of armour due to legendary pieces of different types, and I always wear clothes on top.
---
Yes it does 
---
The main US government was in all sense a lie, it was the shadow government ( the elements that would be later called the enclave ) that truly ran the shots behind the scenes.
---
It was the shadow government who had high ranking figures within the various companies like Poseidon, vault-tec and West-tec that carried out these experiments.
---
West-tec developed the F.E.V under the shadow's orders which evolved the first deathclaws and early experiments into creating other super soldiers ( super mutants)
---
The enclave was the true mastermind behind the various experiments carried out within the vaults too
---
Yeah I see the angle they're working. Ultimately I think they are losing a lot of sales though. I know there's probably a ton like me that would have bought it if it was still on sale. 
---
They could have it up a lot longer than just a day or whatever. Most people aren't going to be able to farm 1.5-2k atoms THAT fast. even just like a 3 day window would be fine if they still want to keep doing that BS.
---
Like give some people who might be busy that day a chance to buy. 
---
Paint is readily available everywhere, we should also be able to just simply paint our armor a single color yellow red blue green whatever. That should be maybe a level check on armorsmith perk
---
It should also come with a special melee drill gauntlet that only fits the excavator armour.
---
Can you not place them and scrap them after being placed?
---
Sounds good enough for me tbh as long as the DLC is strong, still got faith in Bethesda 
---
" i had encounters with cheaters who kill her in less than one minute" LOL thats not cheating thats called efficient builds. My group and i usually run one gunner and 3 low hp builds and and we can ususally kill her in 1 landing if noone else on server comes if 20 other people show up usually takes 10 mins. She scales substantially with the amount of people who are there. DONT call people cheaters because they know how to do things efficiently. Id welcome you to come inspect our gear and watch us kill her in 1 or 2 landings then call us cheaters. If you are struggling then your build is wrong end of story.
---
I think a color coded system would be easier to implement then trying to have the system detect whether or not individual players have a plan/recipe. I think they should do this with notes/letters as well. They seem to be there whether you have or not, kind of frustrating whether you need to read it or not. I'd be happy with stability upfront and dlc's down the line. Get the import things working with crashing and most will be happy, that includes buying duplicate plans.
---
It’s better now. It locked up on me the first time I tried to enter power armor for the first time.  
---
Second time was due to server lag.  
---
3 more times I got kicked off the server.  I fully admit this was the first time playing in over two weeks. Bethesda is doing s terrible job of telling people what they are doing. 
---
Thats a pretty dumb ass comment seeing how games used to be good when gamers made them now we get this corporate bull shit of a fuck game. 
---
Looks like the update is just under 500mb, which makes sense considering they said they were fixing a lot of things.
---
Lmao +1 points for being dramatic on the internet. Go away buddy
---
Man I don't know about that, this game is pretty far off from fortnite on a thematic level.
---
Even in the other post-bethesda buyout fallout games most of the vaults were empty of people....that being said, they also had Humans walking around. This game would do a lot better with them, but I think the idea is that the people on your server are supposed to be..well the people. Only problem? No server permanence. When you disconnect and return, you join a random server and your CAMP leaves when you log out so...you don't really have any way to have a lasting effect on the world.
---
Hell even the trailer [says we're supposed to rebuild Appalachia](https://youtu.be/M9FGaan35s0?t=117). How are you supposed to do that if all your work is only ever there when you're logged in? How can we rebuild with CAMPS being as tight restricted as they are for budget....
---
idk man I'm pretty frustrated with this game, but I hope they change it. 
---
Dont worry, this line from Bethesda's Inside the Vault is telling.....
---
"Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans Vendors have available, fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to address issues with some Perks."
---
Formal hat.
---
You can be all of those at the age of 21.  Doesn't say much.  
---
gib notes Kappa
---
Strange. They announced patch for the 14th
---
you just don't get it, do you?. the man setting up the turret is doing little work for little reward! just like a COMMIE!
---
Cool
---
I think if they made floor coverings smaller to fit in different areas it could work. I used about 10 small door mats to cover a weird section of my floor yesterday. Looks pretty good tbh.
---
The background is black and the suit isnt the same colour.
---
If I recall that’s how one of the first kills on a titan got done. I could be remembering it wrong.
---
I used to equip all my settlement guards with these in fallout 4.  Looks badass.
---
&gt;If Bethesda ommited 2 and says the notes are incomplete, within an hour there will be a thread that has 500 updoots with a list of 20 things that **definitely got stealth changed.**
---
And people will run around for the next saying they nerfed stealth. 
---
Duped treasure maps are a widely known issue and almost always cause game breaking bugs related to inventory, losing your pip boy, etc.  I know you said you traded for them, but if somebody offers you 50 of the same map they are duped.  After hundreds of hours of play time the most I've ever had of one map was like 10, and I've read multiple other comments from people to that effect.  Nobody is going to have that many maps legit, it just doesn't happen.  So whether or not you spammed them later, those maps were poison right from the start.  I'm sorry about your character, but this is one of those things where we all just have to stop and think "boy, this doesn't seem right."  And in this game that is almost sure to result in a bad time.
---
"We have fixed 149 vendor prices and that purple error texture on a rock.
---
Until next week. 
---
See you in the wasteland" 
---
I understood that reference.
---
The devs made the game so that players are able to shoot other players Camps. It's part of the game. Get over it. 
---
I just bought one yesterday from one of the "regular" vendors at a trainstation - don't really remeber which one it was exactly, sorry. But I'm seeing the plans on a regular basis, they're pretty common.
---
I mean, I don't see how it's that empty. There are NPC's they're just not human. What's the difference between reading what a terminal says or reading what a human shaped terminal says?
---
I think that's my main gripe, will I ever actually have a lasting effect on the world? I doubt it. 
---
&gt;Hell even the trailer says we're supposed to rebuild Appalachia.
---
This is what made me think that people would eventually come out of other vaults but I guess not :( 
---
They updated the post saying the update was coming early on PC.
---
I think that you have just called me a cheater so I'll just call you a person who spits out unsubstantiated insults.
---
just hop
---
Oh. Very nice
---
No doubt people mooch the event all the time making it harder. I hope they put level requirments on nuked areas to stop this its endgame content, if im killing the queen and turn to see 7 lvl18s hiding in the shed hoping for loot pisses me off lol.

---
I swear some of you folks just like to complain...
---
i took on a build site twice and each time i d/c. The second time i had two players who dropped goody bags for me but I was only able to take contents of one before the d/c. I stopped with taking on the build site and moved on. I was able to take on two other build sites with no issues until i got greedy and took a third - CRASHHHHHHHHHH!! Most times i crashed since i started this game 2 wks ago, unfortunately it was all in one day!!
---
On the flip side, come up with a way to sensibly "share".
---
I've run circles around players with a swarm of glowing ones for them to tag and the best thing that happens is someone throws a Molotov..... O.o
---
I shoot them all down with a bloodied pump and people steal all the crafting mats mashing Take All. If I used an exploding weapon for this I run the risk of killing myself and having my bag snatched in the Take All frenzy.
---
There's no way to win. :P
---
I do too, there's a lot of hate for this game but all the hate is mis-guided. I've been through several online game launches, including WOW and Diablo 3, so I've seen my fair share of shaky launches. Bethesda is trying and they appear to be learning from their mistakes, so I'm not giving up on them yet myself too
---
No matter the monster ! Just need better nechanics
---
That ain't no cheesecake!  It's a pie, dag nabbit!
---
Large supermarkets in rural France used to sell guns and ammo.  Don't know if they still do (I'm a city boy).

I mean, I really hope so too, but it doesn't fix what I was talking about in my reply to the OP's Reply to that comment. 
---

---
&gt; idk man I'm pretty frustrated with this game, but I hope they change it. 
---
I have hope, you know, but I'm also really on the fence on if Bethesda will respond the way that everyone would like them to...
---
lol
---
&gt; you literally get NOTHING for scrapping power armor pieces.
---
Ahem. You get about 1 steel and 1 plastic. Well worth the 12 lbs. needed to carry it to a workbench to scrap!
---
/s
---
Well I think it's just a preference for me, also in games with humans like FO4 you'll just meet random people along the roads and have interesting conversations. I guess I'm just able to relate to humans shaped terminals better than reading them myself. My head only has one voice and the voice acting really immerses me. 
---
Sounds great! I'm full into the idea every region should have special benefits when nuked!
---
I have my camp there too, I love that place.
---
Now they just need to give the 7 factions more than 200 caps every 20 hours. Pharma farma is a good idea
---
Blackwater Mine
---
Dunno why anyone downvoted you. This is 100% correct. Standard gamer ignorance and self-righteousness (and don't they always come hand-in-hand?), I guess.
---
If you pick up a dupe it won’t let you build again, not a solid way but it’s a way. Doesn’t let you build, drop it and pick up any and all you see. Again, not an excuse for poor decision making on their part, just a partial work around
---
Get a Tesla rifle 
---
Same here man. Same here.
---
But you know, it's not all doom and gloom. I'm not ditching any time soon because I've got hope that maybe Bethesda will realize these problems and fix them...so here's to hoping that'll be the case eventually.
---
yeah, sneaking in high tech armor that squeeks and whatnot. doesnt make much sense.
---
fusion cores should be way rarer. if they ever fix fusion core restoring to max cnd upon log out/in, that will impact a little.
---
I noticed yesterday commando and rifleman stack for automatic weapons, namely the auto combat rifle and 10mm sub. I imagine its across the board. 
---
&gt; have been used by Humans and A.I. alike in every other Fallout game.
---
Nope.  In Fallout 2 caps were not currency.  That's even an in-game joke -- at one point you can find a huge caps stash and it's worthless.
---
Patch is out, about 500MB in size. No patch notes yet, but expect them to be up by the time the servers are back online.
---
Sorry troll, I have no food for you. Try next door, maybe?
---
I found that when I log in, I usually have to go into build mode, store all of the 6 turrets, then place them again.. this somewhat helps with functionality. If I don't, half of the turrets freeze in place without rotating anymore, a quarter look like they are in a broken or shut down state (they really aren't), and the other quarter actually fire WHEN they feel like it. 
---
I also have mobs either firing from a distance (slowly killing each individual turret without getting counterattacked), mobs running directly up to the base (but not getting attacked by my turrets), or my turrets turning and firing on me/other base items. When they work, they are definitely helpful, since I constantly move my camp to use as a mobile defense/crafting base. It helps me weed through tough enemies, while saving me bullets and stim packs
---
it just works
---
Do you know your being a cunt or am i just witnessing natural skill?
---
The fact that no one has started a Youtube series called "Wastelands and Gardens" or "Lifestyles of Vault Dwellers and Irradiated" is a travesty.
---
I'm thinking they nerf it through demolition expert perk so that it no longer applies on the explosive legendary modifier.
---
I would argue that as TSE weapons/mutation farming becomes more prevalent that scorch beats need to be made more difficult.
---
They'll likely list them in the launcher once the maintenance (started about 15 minutes ago) finishes. Might need to close out the launcher and reopen it after they're done.
---
It’s be great if it was all a lie, and the place does exist, but the only thing there is a frighteningly powerful and grotesque monster that exists there to “test” its existence on the servers. It’s fully powered an animated, so woe to the player who actually discovers a way to glitch into the dev area...
---
Oh for sure I'll keep playing, it's a decent game and I'm sure I'll get a few hours out of it but I doubt without humans I'll be able to play as much as I did FO4 or skyrim. Here here! 
---
If you have a Quad ammo capacity like mine the reload is fine (one reload animation gives you 4 trigger pulls)
---
I'm on it. Jk lol that would be cool though and just feature/interview the people who create these awesome homes. 
---
Seeing as how I 3-shot Deathclaws with my explosive double barrel, you'll need to nerf that before I fear anything.
---
Every time I see one of these TSE posts I have to laugh. You do realize with a proper build you can deal well over 6-700dmg per shot with any auto and sg? The bloodied melees are more op than the TSE weapons with the proper build. My dragon non legendary was at 2.5k dmg without any buffs just running a low hp build without nerd rage kicked in. And once they need TSE what will you guys complain about next? The builds being too op because someone who isn’t using TSE is running in and killing everything? Or the melee guy who can one hit you in pvp?
---
If your camp gets wrecked just move it without repairing and you get everything put in your inventory at max health. 
---
I think death laws are mutated chameleons?
---
yeahh my excavator set drops a piece every now and then
---
Sure but power armor is expensive to craft so at least you get gears, screws, ultracite, black titanium etc when you scrap them... oh wait
---
How about I dumb it down for YOU? If you're going to complain about the game, complain about something legitimate instead of using the most minor of problems. There's plenty to choose from. I've played for almost 200 hours, so I know. Instead, you chose something that literally takes 10 seconds to fix in-game simply to shit on the game, as is popular to do on the internet nowadays. Stop nitpicking the minor shit.
---
Say the locations, nobody is going to waste their time nuking very area to find these “cool places”.  
---
What a shit post. 
---
YES! CAMP VENDORS!
---
I find it ridiculous that profanity is banned in an M rated game, but again, just having it revert to default name if dropped would work for me. I'm the only one that sees it. Unless they stream, then that is on them. Ban away.
---
I like your idea for #9 and think it should be a type of mode to see other players too. Ie in certain servers players and their CAMPs can only be seen from a certain distance away (based on perception). Maybe this would work for the PVP servers or like a "hardcore/legendary" server option? I've accepted that I can see people when I open my map and I like to know if someone is getting near to my CAMP, but it would also be nice if I could choose to adjust that or turn off their visibility entirely (without going wanted!).
---
I also like your faction bank idea. But until duplication methods are truly squashed (they didn't patch all methods) I'm imagining an MMO auction house that is exploited with too many overpowered items for sale and no sense of earning them. I had a guy a bunch of levels above me give me a quad-barreled Explosive Dragon and while it has saved me often, I can't shake the feeling that it is like the One Ring of Power and I'm slowly becoming corrupted. I pretty much only use that and an anti-armor, faster swinging, more damage for power attacks Deathclaw Gauntlet. OP for sure.
---
I'm so done with whitesprings. This place is overcrowded af. It's a nice place to farm and level, but too many players there, cause it's the ONLY place which gives that amount of XP and Loot, especially when nuked. In fact, u can end up getting nothing cause people camp the golf course an parking area and one shot everything that shows up 
---
&gt; So no, they dont know shit about MMO
---
In its current state ESO is light years ahead of Fallout 76. 
---
I see the problem, you didn't ask Todd what his definition of "quickly" was, common mistake. 
---
I dont think it could be done with the current game. just because you are already a vault dweller
---
The other day someone was dropping orbital strike grenades at a nukes Whitesprings Golf Course. 
---
I was so annoyed, literally no one ever got a chance to kill anything. 
---
I love how you mimic the aesthetic of the floating mansions in the background. GJ!
---
a few TSEs are broken, but some of the TSEs combinations should be nerfed. unless the idea is that everyone should have an explosive shotgun
---
Mutant Slayer's legendary weapons should do extra damage to Super Mutants AND players with mutations.
---
you can view some notes if you click on the game client version on the launcher next to game options
---
There is a prime receiver for every gun, you get one plan about every 10 SB, if you are lucky, and there are a lot of junk weapons in this game, so getting any one receiver is exceedingly difficult, especially because it's actually quite hard to get large number (20+) of scorchbeasts to spawn on command reliably, unless you like spending caps travelling back and forth to all the different fissures in the game constantly.
---
Where is this located on the map?
---
They just help immerse me a lot and I can relate to human characters easier than robots and terminals. Also I'm guessing there aren't many robot settlements or roaming robots but I might have just not found any. 
---
Pretty much the entire main story line is devoted to discovering what happened to different groups of people. It takes you through a bunch of different factions, and you learn what happened to those factions. It'll probably take you through at least level 40, unless you rush through it. There's a lot of content there -- you're just uncovering the story a little bit at a time. 
---
It is different though, and some people don't like it. If you're not the kind of person who pays attention to notes and holotapes, you'll probably miss a lot of the details that tie everything together. I primarily think it's the people who race through the quests and don't pay attention to the details in an attempt to level fast that complain about the lack of content and story. The content and story are there, but this time around, they require a little more care and investment on the part of the players to fully appreciate.
---
In my opinion, this game excels at environmental storytelling. Every location on the map has a story to tell you, if you're willing to take the time to uncover it.
---
You still do meet random people on the roads.   Some are robot-shaped, some are corpses, but have a holotape recording, or you can meet Grahm and Chally the Moo-Moo.
---
I’ve never agreed more with anything on Reddit in my life. EVERYONE UPVOTE THIS!!!
---
Awesome camp!
---
It could be if it wouldn’t have all these issues and would have been released more polished. 
---
With more fixed and content, it really would. 
---
I am very hopeful for 2019.
---
Just log out and back in: 1) You get out of the same lobby, and 2) it should rebuild your stuff without having to cost you. Worst case, "move" your camp and it should fully repair your stuff.
---
It's a (poorly programmed) part of the game but there are way around it. Honestly I think if you have Pacifist mode turned on people shouldn't be able to attack you or your stuff unless you're wanted or at a workshop (which was supposed to be a PVP area) or at a PVP event.
---
Fuck I die more often With my TSE than I did without it. Almost entirely user error though. Little to close to the projectiles final destination and I die.
---
Definitely a dessert type confectionery.
---
Yes I got it 
---
Wow, your extremely low level of literacy is amazing.How do you manage day to day ?
---
You know if you join their party of your bounty goes away. So if you genuinely messed up a party invite it's kind of like asking for forgiveness, it's immersion friendly because it's like they're taking you on and forgiving you.
---
They don't need a nerf, they need to fix their AI, when they get stuck in the infinite blast attack it's hard to avoid them
---
on top of which .50 is much harder to find whereas .308 is everywhere being dropped commonly by scorched and super mutants.
---
867MB on the german client, currently updating
---
I can't believe Bethesda dropped the ball on this.  Super Mutants and Human Mutants are both mutants!  They need equality!
---
I'm fairly certain that it's mentioned in the archive room that the Kovac-Muldoon team passed some type of post-development report on to the Bradley-Hercules team in hopes of preventing similar failures from occurring.
---
I'd totally watch it. 
---
There is a lot of creativity in the community, from bases in electrical towers, to nice hunting cabins, to that guys trap base yesterday.
---
When ever I getting to nuked whitesprings I attract the ghouls and let everyone tag them for a while. Then I blow it up with a shotgun
---
Those seem to be the notes from the previous patch, what is the version number ?
---
I just build towers as high as I can get them, currently 5 floors. I have that building set, but I need to save up for the neon letters plans, so I can properly label my Shit Brick House.
---
This is the shit of nightmares. Why would you wish that on us?
---
Man if I could get half the hours I got out of FO4 on this game I'll be amazed, but I'm only about a fourth of the way there at 250 right now.
---
The story is kinda bad, but there are moments that are good. I don't think they can fix that, so I don't complain about it too much. It's an online game and they're "fixing" PVP with the patch today (hopefully something to do with weapon damage and player DR) but who knows what'll be in the patch notes until they drop. 
---
If things get better after February, I'll probably keep playing it as my go to after work. If not....eeeeh I'll probably be onto the next game by then.
---
I had no issue with whatever version of leather armor, only heavy right arm is brown no matter which mod i apply
---
I have all of them , it’s a slight damage increase. Only a few points above the hardened. The scorched damage is on top of that. Not worth using the prime ammo all the time though.
---
I believe the servers are down
---
Or "fixes" lol
---
Yes they are but selectively mutated using the F.E.V by west-tec before the war.
---
Other variants are chameleons with gator DNA ie. Gatorclaws
---
here is what the client shows, but its not the full patch notes  
---

I guess I'll have to see if I like it or not, I'm semi one of those people that don't pay attention to notes but not to level I just get bored very quick so have to keep myself doing different things and I don't usually just walk around in open world games without an objective but I'll try slow down and open my eyes for this one. Who knows, maybe it'll change how I play all open world games :) 
---
Use the Woodchuck perk in luck? Doubles wood collection I believe.
---
i keep my decon shower stored when not in use.

https://twitter.com/BernfriedI/status/1083364422700154880
---
People are literally waiting for Bethesda to post on twitter so they can make these kind of comments ASAP. That's kinda hilarious and sad.
---
Personally I'm pretty hyped for updates!
---
It seems as if it’s gotten worse to me before Christmas I barely had any troubles but since Christmas I’m constantly being disconnected at least 5 times every day and I usually play about 6 hour sessions about 5 days out of the week.  It’s been getting frustrating and made me actually delete the game a couple times and then get sucked back into downloading it again by my friend.
---
If I hop servers to get a plan that I got before (but never learnt).. is this duping? Or is duping only taking advantage of bugs?
---
I feel like there is a fundamental misunderstanding that the game is supposed to be set in a post apocalyptic world.  I understand the gripe with duping, as that is literal cheating, but in a game where you are in a lawless world, are you really surprised that there are people who act like bandits?
---
I think one of the biggest problems right now is that the game is in an awkward limbo between being an RPG and a PVP game.  It has the perfect setup to be a PVP game, but the developers took it the other direction.  I feel like if they were to heavily restrict acts of violence, it would seem very unnatural.  Like if there was some sort of civilization (or even robots) that existed in the wastes to enforce law, then it would make sense for them to be punished, but if an unseen invisible force, punishes you for being lawless in a lawless world, well that just seems ridiculous.  If you want a game where there is uninterrupted base building, perhaps Fallout 4 or Minecraft are better games to play.
---
If it had been available for either the excavator or ultracite armors, I'd probably have dropped some cash for it, since those are the only two armors I use, but apparently Bethesda doesn't want my money! 
---
pretty sure that was the previous patch.
---
Not sure buying a game makes you an investor....
---
100% said that to a random I saw in excavator pavfirst time I saw it. 
---
I want a "railroad" paint scheme, that's blue, with the gas mask and light black with a grey faceplate, and red trim around the sides, perhaps a yellow one decaled on the shoulders.
---
I built a bunch of extra workbenches and equipment around the outskirts of my camp because of this.  It makes my house look like a junkyard but most of the trigger happy 12 year olds can't resist attacking the outlying stuff first, which gives me time to either fast travel back to protect the real camp, or just server hop.  It's like a crumple zone for my base.
---
Those notes are for the [December 19, 2018 patch](https://fallout.bethesda.net/article/3AEV0uXGGkyW0OAUOAisMW/fallout-76-hotfix-notes-december-19-2018).
---
[1.0.3.17](https://1.0.3.17) is the Dec 19 patch.
---
It would come closer at least. 
---
Those were from the last patch, not today's
---
Same.. I stopped playing for a bit because of this.. 
---
So eager to hear how this works out!
---
I feel ya. It does get over crowded.
---
Explosive weapon bug fix is from the previous patch notes. Isn't it?
---
What are dupers and what platform do they seem to be on the most? Just wondering, I had 4 d/c last night but it was after taking on a build site(s). 
---
Yeah if I could match the hours in these games it'd be amazing, I must have 200 hours or so on FO4 and climbing becuase I'm still replaying it thoroughly atm. 
---
I'll read more patch notes and see if it's the things I'm looking for :) 
---
xD
---
Should be aaaaaany minute now they confirm and post the notes. I have an unwarranted optimistic feeling. Well, not entirely unwarranted: I feel like if someone was able to push up the schedule to FUCKIT PATCH IT NOW, in response to the widespread ridicule of the non-update, then they were already pretty ready to go with some good stuff.
---
This to me reinforces the idea that this was the original plan all along, someone changed it last minute, it backfired, and now they're going back to Plan A.
---
Anybody wanna copy + paste?
---
I put a big artillery cannon next to my house.  It's a little warning not to break shit when you come and use the facilities.
---
Indeed. Do you think this kind of creativity is only on PC? I feel like I never see a lot of players on PS4, been thinking about rebuying the game on PC.
---
Those are from the last patch, note the korean language thing.
---
Thats [1.0.3.17](https://1.0.3.17), its the previous patch, not tonights one.
---
Check the assaultron near the vault door. She reveals a story that MODUS does not. She also unlock more secrets in the bunker once you do this.
---
You'd think with all the paint cans you find in the game, you'd actually be able to paint armor whatever colors you can find. Including Excavator and ultracite.
---
That was the previous dupe which dupers found a easy way around.
---
Hmm, so the company and their other investors might seem quickly as quarterly? Personally, I want weekly updates on what they see happening in the community and their response to what catches major traction, but not ignore the great suggestions that do not make it up to main page of amywhere they are paying attention to (assuming they care) and own up to faults through action (whatever that means).
---
Oh that's good, would you say there are many robots? As much as I don't really care about robots it's better than terminals for me. 
---
Whatever floats your boat bud. You'd be better off trolling someone else 
---
This is from the new patch. Also includes high damage items and mentions that it's only for pc atm
---
I was thinking the same thing. I'm unaware of any bug with explosive weapons currently.
---
I believe this is the dreaded "auto scrap" feature (LOL) that automatically scraps mods if you need the resources to say make ammo. :(
---
I only know because it happened to me recently.  
---
It isn't. Everything you purchase in the atom shop will now show up for you and you alone in the atom shop. 
---
Did you craft anything?
---
PC Version [1.0.3.17](https://1.0.3.17) is patch from previous year
---
I have to be like 120% use related to water purifier ...
---
Rose would be a good candidate but I have an idea that includes her, a radio ran by a unique sounding mr handy and protectron that will bring on guests like graham and rose that announces events and things that players are doing in the world.
---
My son has been griefing my builds in Minecraft &amp; Space Engineers for years, he prepared me for this.
---
Looks like previous patch notes.
---
yeah, a fix to a duping method. im hoping they made it harder to come up with new dupe methods
---
Make a copy of it.
---
That it's perfectly normal?
---
Nvm I'm a complete idiot
---
Now they have to grind like the rest of us glorious folk.
---
The stand isn't in the shop because you didn't buy it and therefore cannot see it as a purchase you've made
---
Yeah those are the idiots who just dont have friends to help them move thier junk to a mule so they're salty lol mules are essential bottom line.
---
So do I.  I have never run low on .308 and have yet to manufacture a single round.
---
Well it would be more accurate to ask for delta notes not kappa since we're talking about revisions to the softw... oh, I see.
---
That would be hysterical, because if they're planning on taking any action against dupers, doing it a lot right before maintenance would be a \*great\* way to make sure Bethesda can identify you lol
---
Alright. But make it so stealthers that aren't in PA can't one-shot us. In fact, we should be bullet sponges. If we're going for realism then let's make sure we get everyone balanced. 
---
Wife had this happen.  She took over the airport workshop and had to low levels show up and constantly shoot her and the turrets she set up.  They kept wrecking the place and got a bounty. She finally got annoyed with it, dropped her pacifist and killed them... only to have a level 100+ dude in power armor pop up out of cloak and insta-kill her.
---
Fake news. Double check your source.
---
I have exactly one - 5 luck and a hundred or more clicks! 
---
It is going to be lottery day when I get that second piece of pie!
---
I found the saddest note ever from a guy who didn't go into the vault with his girlfriend.  Instead he wait for 20 years outside fighting ghouls only to die not having seen her emerge at the 25 year mark.
---
Spray with your automatic pipe or whatever first.  Unless the TSE weapon owner is shooting from roof top they have to take out the heard closing in on them as well.
---
I’m not sure of the glitch. What I meant is just if you happen to find a plan you already found before, if you found a duplicate of a plan somewhere, and you click on it to learn it and it’s already been learned, nothing will happen and it will sit in inventory 
---
I remember getting my first LMG, shooting it and thinking, "wow this rate of fire is insane." I take it to a super mutant camp and proceed to dump 100 bullets into a Primus's face only to do like 1/3rd damage. Immediately scrapped the weapon hoping to get better mods - nothing.
---
Try server hopping, I've read that fixed it for some people since it resets the progress back to "go to the DMV"
---
It's not that I don't appreciate the advice - I do, but I'm not looking for wood, I'm looking for a map that has wood piles that you can attach extractors to when setting up a CAMP.  If you see anyone post any let me know!
---
I have an instigating dragon, a 2 shot dragon and an explosive BPR. There isn't that much difference between those two dragons, they both end up doing around 450 dmg which is more than the 400 dmg the eBPR does. Combine that with a sneak attack and there aren't many enemies you can't one shot. 
---
These dragons don't seem to be too uncommon either, I had to get rid of an extra identical instigating dragon I found. Good luck!
---
Don't worry, YongYea Inc to save the day. 
---
I would buy your waste acid
---
Ah sure ok. 
---
Equal rights for power armor!
---
Yeah i mean. In two or three months,killing your level 1000 friends will be the most efficient way of earning caps by a mile.
---
the perk that gives health when you take radiation dmg? it works in combat. 
---
Literally says he didn't craft and has been careful to keep enough resources to avoid this. I also lost 75% of my mods logging in after a few days. Just...gone. annoying feature I guess
---
With things like nukesdragons character build planner you can pick your progression before you even start the game and have everything you need by level 50 ish. After this there is no reason to unlock anything else and you end up having one big pile of unused perk points. In an instance where you have the ability to swap loadouts you end up utilizing more cards for different situations, try out more combinations and actually want to unlock more perks. Like you said it even gets to a point when I have maxed out a perk I end up needing to get a level 1 or two version of the same card just so I can use it with other combinations if there arent enough points.
---
They keep unlocking card packs throughout the game and have achievements for owning all the cards, they want us to use them all!
---
Melee don't have options for fliers? May I suggest thrown weapons, my friend? Throw that tomahawk into that scorchbeast's face.
---
Maybe I misunderstood, but do you have a quest to get the ID card?
---
Ghoulish definitely works during combat
---
Eh. I dont mind it. I am not a rabid player so 1400 a day is about right for an hour or two of play a day. 
---
At least in my experience.
---
No, the T-60 has better stats. Look at the wiki pages for them. 
---
I agree, the lack of human NPCs is both sad and troubling. 
---
Weapons: Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot. HELL YEAH 
---
Agreed.  
---
Nah, I'm fine with it. You're fine with nerfing everyone's damage against PA players right? If we're going to be strictly following our roles then we better be bullet sponges. These people sneaking and one-shotting us are gonna need to get nerfed. It's only fair since nobody should be able to do it all without compromise. 
---
Forgot to mention this but the quest isn't even in my quest log anymore. It popped up when I walked towards Camp McClintock at some point and immediately auto completed itself without giving me the ID. And it's not under finished quests, it's just gone. 
---
Must be a full moon.
---
Lol yeah fixes. Lets all try and be first to find the new game breaking bug tho, right? :) it's a race to clown on them through action lol
---
&gt; Animations: Lever-Action rile now only reloads the correct number of ammo.
---
One of my biggest pet peeves. 
---
something something 300 kg something 90 meters something
---
And explosive vents for everyone in Appalachia!
---
Too dense. Not enough clicks.
---
Back to the "lore breaking" circle jerk of hate.
---
This makes me wonder how my low-key CAMP is so close to max budget.. Must be the stupid wire glitch. 
---
Oh theres loads of voice acting, they weren't sparing that expense.
---
Short story - Zombie plague, kind of. Think cordyceps like Last of Us, but hopped up on FEV.
---
Anyhow, spoilers as all hell, so read at your peril.
---
.
---
After the war, the territory got split up basically between 4 factions. 
---
The Responder's (and their special elite version Firebreathers) formed initially out police, paramedics, firefighters and so on. They built up a fairly solid network around the forest, Grafton, and the edge of the Ash Heap. 
---
The Raiders, who controlled much of the Savage Divide arose well, as raiders do in prettymuch all Fallouts. There were several different clans or groups amongst them, and they ended up loosely unifying as the Scorched, rising Super Mutants from FEV-experiment in Huntersville, and battles with the others started taking too much of a toll on them.
---
The Free States were a bunch of doomsday preppers out in the Mire, and secessionists either before or shortly after the bombs dropped. They were also in league with Senator Sam Blackwell, who defected from the Enclave, which may explain some of their technological prowess.
---
The Brotherhood of Steel was a band of ex-military, as is usual. As the lore goes they have the name because there was still an active communications satellite that allowed them to talk to the west coast. How much that retcons of Fallout lore I'm not super-sure on, but it is what it is.
---
Anyways, the Scorched plague/parasite started emerging from an experimental research site (where Ultracite was discovered) in the southeast. The Brotherhood guys were the initial vanguard against it, and while they did some co-operation with the Free States, it was hindered by the whole bit where the Brotherhood were the army and FS were secessionist traitors and all that. They had limited contact with the Responders, and their whole exclusionist tendencies basically caused them to die off. The FS soon followed.
---
MEanwhile the Responders were locked in battle with the Raiders. They captured the leader's lovei nterest, and in retaliation he blew up the dam by Charleston. Which destroyed Charleston, effectively wiping out the command point of the Responders. Even as the now unmitigated Scorched began to expand and wiped out/took over the Raiders and what was left of the Responders.
---
Up in the Toxic Valley, the Grafton steel plant was already spewing poison unmitigated into the region, having been given freedom from regulation to speed up output for the war effort. Post-nukes it continues to do so via automation, and the whole area largely is unsuitable for human life. Super Mutants pushing up into the region appear to have driven off the Brotherhood (along with being called back to try and contain the Scorched) and any one else hoping to turn the thing off.
---
Down in the Ash Heap, the pollution and mine fires only got worse from the nuclear Fallout. Its probably the least explained (as far as any lore I've found). The main organized threat is Mole Miners, who I think are meant to be mutated miners who were trapped in the mines, but an audiolog speculates that they also aren't human.  Anyways, its also the most obvious in why no ones there, the ground itself is literally on fire and the air is frequently filled with toxic dust.
---
I think both Anthem and Division 2 are competitors for Destiny 2. 
---
Ima just sit in the corner of my camp and cry....
---
Happens with different PA armor slots all the time, only time it's an issue with the excavator armor for me.  If it's doing it to a piece it'll say my carry weight is ok to fast travel but won't let me, since it's displaying a lower carry weight than what I have.  
---
not sure how wiping duped items would alienate players any more than leaving things as they are now.  Personally, im waiting for the duped items to be wiped, or all legendarys to be nerfed, before i log back into 76.  I would feel far less alienated than i do right now if they entirely wiped everyones characters and inventorys and made everyone start fresh, and thats a pretty extreme step to take.
---
We are still specializing in Fallout, just not 1 specific portion of the game(s). With scripts being written from scratch we are taking functionality that does exist on other individual websites and making them work faster, have more functionalities and overall user friendliness being increased for ease of use.
---
I'm not American so I haven't experienced the real DMV but that bureaucracy quest  made me furious with its waiting and jerking around.
---
Nuking that place should give you a long lasting buff called "Doing God's work" or "True American Patriot" or something along those lines. And the missile reconstruction time should be halved if the nuke launched hit that target.
---
Nothing. Because even though Redditors would have you believe otherwise, directing AAA games development is harder than just having some good ideas.
---
What about raider ?
---
Scorchbeasts make me hate this game.
---
It's their ability to scream at you non-stop. It hits through walls. And then the acid attack hits through walls too.
---
You get no cover and if you try to run the Sonic attack breaks armor and limbs too easily. Every if you are successful, you will run out of AP and it will just catch you.
---
I've never hated a creature more in a game than this.
---
&gt;Power Armor: The Power Armor light has been made brighter.
---
haven't gotten past here. amazing patch already
---
That’s why there’s all those mole miners and snallygasters like in FO4. Man those things were awful in Far Harbor. They nerfed them for 76. 
---
The decontamination showers do indeed remove mutations. They seem to be able to remove them very quickly if you pass under them, as I regrettably found out.
---
Have you relaunched Fallout 76?
---
Excellent patch notes! I'm sad to see glowing ones getting the XP nerf, but it was kind of expected.  
---
The best part is the Bobby pins.  Now I can go back to hoarding them!
---
That's the only one left that I specifically know I don't have.  I should have my big post up later today.  It's mostly written up.  I just need to get the spreadsheet on Google sheets and write the final section.
---
Yea that would be pretty cool to see too. Even though it doesnt completely match with the "raider" aesthetic 
---
It is a very clunky feature. One mod solution on pc is perk card profiles. So you have one arrangement for melee combat, one arrangement for hacking and lock picking, and instead of shuffling out all the cards one by one, you switch profiles and it auto arranges. 
---
 Snallygasters are like velicoraptors; it's the ones you don't see that are the real danger. 
---
hooray, lever action rifle fix. now i'll actually use it
---
Comic book black.   Like Superman’s hair.
---
Not anymore. I have the soldiers certificate on me but the Recruitment Blues quest has auto completed itself and vanished from the quest logs. Not under finished either. 
---
Feels like good progress, more in this direction please! 
---
Mine was 496.60 MB (posted for those with exacting natures.)
---
That's good, I won't read all that becuase I've been informed there is actually a lot of story unlike I previously thought but thanks, I'm glad there's still a good amount of voice acting :) 
---
&gt; This no tool bullshit is irrelevant and a cop out.
---
&gt; Been a programmer for over a decade. It's not a difficult problem to solve.
---
You've never encountered a "solution" someone developed to cater to a small very specific need. This solution is then added onto over the years until it has snowballed into a monstrosity that is both difficult to manage, but also nearly impossible for the organization to go without? and then the person who made it moves on and now no one truly understands how it works?
---
I wouldn't be surprised if that were the case here. That the player inventory is some in-house created database-like system that no one really understands the inner workings of anymore. You know it could be some arcane mixture of xml, sql, or whatever, and the tools to deep dive on it really don't exist because no one ever created them.
---
This is some of the stupidest idea I've read here recently. So you wanna make around 25-50% of the current playerbase unable to play their characters. I'm not even just talking about dupers. That would make so many players leave this game, that it would be dead in a week or two. But whatever you want I guess. 
---
Sometimes they are great, sometimes none of turrets track targets. 
---
If they could up it enough to sell one serum which I believe  is 300-350 I’d be happier with that (I can’t sell them to vendors cause they don’t have enough caps) Yeah 1400 a day is enough to keep you going:) 
---
no new content , well . another month of grind simulator 
---
I have had this happen to me twice now that I am sure of, and it mainly appears to only affect certain mods.  I had 12 stored and it deleted all but 5 (used, scrapped, whatever...).  I collected quite a few more and again, all at once, most of the mods were gone, but those original surviving 5 were still there.  I have no idea why it chooses certain ones over others, but I solved the problem by creating a mule and transferring some over to insure safety until I want to use them.  I check every now and then and my mule has every single one given to him.  He is level 16 and does nothing but sit at Watoga checking for plans at the vendors).
---
You cant damage your team though
---
Thanks! And I agree - I would definetely embrace it.
---
Sorry, I prefer anonymity over verifiability.
---
I've done work from SNES through Xbone, mostly in engine layers, down to the metal, and usually as a lead on either the game or the cross-platform engine used for the game.
---
If that's not sufficient info, then feel free to consider me a fraud. Still, it's annoying that a person can say they work in a bank and no one challenges them, but this happens all the time to people who work in games.
---
Definitely not compared to readily available T-51b variant sets. It can really throw you for a loop. 
---
So do (some) gas stations*, many hardware stores, and most farming stores.
---
*:  Down in the Holler, you can get gas for your truck, a pound of local bologna plastic-wrapped on a styrofoam tray, a fresh pizza, a case of beer, some Ale 81 for the kiddies, and a big box of .22LR plinkers -- all at the same tiny little store.  And the ammo is sitting on the shelf right next to the front door, but yet:  Nobody steals it.  They wouldn't ever conceive of such a thing.
---
This explains the 200 cap guy with a level 100 following him around but not killing then. Didn't make sense at the time, thank you.
---
I have stopped using turrets at camp because of budget and unwanted aggro. If you place your camp close to a spot a lot of players will pass by it will keep spawning mobs. So even when you are gone they will keep coming, Only so much you can rely on them. Turrets set up properly can still clear everything or almost everything when you are gone.
---
Issue though that they seem to bug and not target or shoot you but do no dmg. Someone told me spotlight extent turret range. Don't know if its true though. Be sure to use the terminal with them though. 0 turrets in the bog is working so far for me.
---
**Bobby Pins:** Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001. 
---
Glorious 
---
Gave me a chubby.
---
You think having a handful of dupers that traded around to build an armor set that gives 75% damage reduction before armor is even factored in is good for pvp? 
---
What is Anti Ballistic Fiber? Is this something new or did Ballistic Fiber get renamed?
---
Fantastic! I love seeing these CAMPs. But you shouldn't build all these generators inside. Carbon monoxide is the silent killer.  ;)
---
If your stored account is as black box as you say. This game long term viability is really not looking good. Cause if they ever fck up an item handout or lock a quest progress this game would die
---
The mole rats with frag mines have also joined us in West Virginia. 
---
Sign me up!
---
Drop site V9, I got marine armor plans and mods there, it is inside past the security door on the right on the shelf net to the metal box, left from a hazmat suit and mininuke spawn. 
---
North from there the quarry also rarely has a plan on the shelf next to the weapons workbench, I got a ripper plan there and other weapon related ones.
---
Pylon v39? Name unsure, same general area east of bog town, there are two plan spots, one at the base next to the workstation on the metal table/shelf on the left, and one that spawns in the train.
---
I know of a few others, I need to get back on, I can probably screen shot some of them if you need the pictures, assuming they have respawned since I was last there.
---
Sure, but you still don't need to carry more than five (5) simply because they are not made of thin glass like the ones in FO4.
---
the workbenches will use your mods as scrap, before breaking down bulk steel as well
---
You will have no problems. 
---
I know this isn't about mutations, but Strange in Numbers needs fixed cuz Bird Bones + Strange In Numbers + 2-3 friends = "Guys I can fly! I CAN FLY! .... I can't get down. I CAN'T GET DOWN! HEEEEEEEELP!"
---
LOL. Exactly what problem would this cause in D3?
---
Some excellent fixes in there! Especially no more autoscrapping hardened masses, lever action rifle reload, reduced weight for bobby pins, reduced repair costs for weapons/armor and hopefully the unscrappable water purifier bug. 
---
We are  so many. So different. So interesting! &lt;3
---
Do you have "Definace Has Fallen" completed? If so try going back to Fort Defiance and read the note pinned to the board, I don't recall the exact location but I think it's right when you enter it.
---
If it's not for you, that's cool too. I think most of the problems people have are because it doesn't meet their expectations or the way they want to play, which is fine, but I think characterizing it as a game without story or content is just plain not true. It's just not the type of story or content that certain people want.
---
I'm enjoying the shit out of it though, and it really appeals my my play style of wanting to solve mysteries and explore every little nook and cranny.
---
You’re level 200 with all items and a crazy cool base; having all the items you can put in a base? 
---
You’re completely bored of taking all workshops and then going to help newbs to make up for feel bads?
---
You have all mutations on your champ? 
---
Doubt it.  Why people won’t stop bitching and just play a really fun game like they play others I don’t understand.
---
They are listening, fixing and adding a lot of stuff. 
---
That's awesome
---
 **Bobby Pins**: Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001 
---
The glowing ghouls is fine. It will also help slow down level progression a lot which this game needs.
---
So long story short, buttressed marine armor is the best non-PA armor available?
---
Didn't know that one. Good to know in the future if I end up in a similar situation.
---
Que?
---
PLEASE FIX CAMP BUG WHERE POWER LINES STORE BUT ARE NOT USEABLE AND TAKING UP BUDGET, I HAD 50% UNUSABLE BUDGET BECAUSE OF THIS, HAD TO SCRAP ENTIRE HOUSE AND MOVE TO GET IT BACK.  Otherwise, love your work, and why can't we just have object IDs to track dupes and delete both dupes, it doesn't have to check every tick, every hour would be enough to dissuade duping. 
---
Lets rwplace his boulders with either snowballs or flaming coal while we're at it. Bethesda dont disappoint us. 
---
Yeah I saw this too and was thinking... what? Maybe cloth?
---
They should be able to manually do an orbital drop from the Kovac-Muldoon right to your location.  The unique stuff that you need to complete the event, compliments of the Enclave.  And a piece of plastic and a can of dog food for everyone else.
---
Awesome! Keep up the great work guys! I know you get a lot of scuff but that's because we are passionate about the Fallout universe. Much love!
---
[b]&gt; DevNote: Glowing Ones were granting Large Boss XP rewards, making them highly exploitable when combined with Nuke Zones.[/b]
---
And whitesprings is nerfed. Oh well. There goes the end-game content, I guess. I mean what else is there? It takes me an entire day to grind out half a level otherwise.
---
Money. Check out eBay, some dupers are making bank selling tse weapons for a few bucks each.
---
That's a good idea tho to me prewar money isn't useless lol I got a minigun to feed
---
Why the fuck would you want to prevent MULEs??? Have you ever played any other MMOs at all?
---
Two nukes almost launched on each other. Little lag, but was fine. I don’t understand the constant bitching at this point.
---
Go play another game then. Jesus. 
---
Some good QoL fixes in there - especially getting rid of the duplication bugs. Nice one Beth.
---
Hopefully somewhere down the line we'll get teddy display units :o)
---
&gt; you can do this with simply sql commands from a console/power shell, cmd. 
---
Why do you assume their database is sql?
---
Yes, several times. Doesn't work.
---
The fuck did you expect? Let's fix the game first before we add expansion-worth shit.
---
Yeah I got it for £25 so I'm not too bothered about wasting my money. I hope I like it I'll binge 5 or 6 hours today and see where I get to :) 
---
I’ve never actually seen anyone wearing raider power armour. 
---
Huh the spoiler tags didn't work and yes. They aren't constant but every now and then an event is tagged as an Enclave event. 
---
Harpers Ferry Bot often has them. Cost around 400.
---
yep I got it.. a Fat Man that weighs 6 lbs, and has a MIRV attachment
---
Ooh and this one **Weapons: Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot.**
---
No. It doesn't even start when I read the note. Everything about Recruitment Blues seems to be bugged to hell for me.
---
There's a way to make a list, but it's work. 
---
You can go into a cooking station, and make a list of all the recipes that come up. By the way, did you know that if you eat something that you didn't know, you can learn the recipe that way? A friend found a bowl of Vegetable medley and ate it, and got the message he learned it. So he made me one and I ate it, and I learned it too. 
---
So then do the same for weapons and armor. If you know the mod, it will show up. If you don't, it won't be on your list. 
---
This is tedious, because each weapon has its own set of mods. If you unlock medium scope while scraping a pipe pistol, the mod you learn is only for that weapon. 
---
Camp plans, way more frustrating because what the plans name are, doesn't match up with what they are called in the game. For example. Plans: Rustic Table. But when you're in CAMP build mode, it just say end table. Not Rustic End Table. 
---
Right? Its ridiculous how people expect a perfect gem right on release, every game *especially* mmorpgs have patches and flaws
---
I have a friend that does more DPS than me against the SBQ. He uses 1 Star unyielding armor and a handy buzzsaw blade.
---
If you’re 110 and haven’t picked up legendary gear at this point, I think it’s safe to say you’re playing the game wrong
---
Looks great
---
Speaking of OP weapons, I found an explosive cryolator, with heavy gunner perks and demolitions it does a whopping 37 damage. **37 DAMAGE!**
---
Don't even get me started on the abundance of cryo cells you out in the wild. * So, so many.*
---
"They need a way to automatically fix the problem and this is a simple solution that will honestly not effect most player." 
---
And you know this based on what info?
---
Try a private server with this modification. Wait it make them unstable and the character crashes.
---
I want Todd to come read me the patch notes while i'm tucked in for bed.
---
LMG MOUNTED AND LOADED
---
Right? Time to switch back to my lever :)
---
I believe many enemies have some level of damage resistance.  A thick hide or carapace would give DR and be affected by armor piercing.  Scorched and Supermutants definitely have damage resistance.  The only things I wouldn't worry about DR for are small animals and maybe ghouls.
---
Every time I’ve crossed paths with someone it’s either been friendly or we just ignored each other - until today. Someone that was already wanted started shooting up my camp right before the server went down for the patch. There was not enough time for me to turn of pacifist and go after him. I wish pacifist mode didn’t apply to wanted players. I keep it on to make sure I don’t actually hit anyone with friendly fire. 
---
Sort by new Bethesda just posted the patch notes
---
And 95% of the players not participating in third party discussions on the state of the game don't have TSE weapons to begin with.  
---
Legit or not, they ruin the game. It can't be balanced as long as they exist. Get rid of that shit. Idgaf about whether or not your duped gun cost you a thousand caps.
---
So kinda like a scorchbeast from another mother. 
---
Never really understood that, yes the game has light PvP elements but beyond that shouldn't matter how quickly you do or don't level.  I've got 10+ unspent perks from leveling (170), exp doesn't matter much after a certain point.
---
But how will they fight in power armor? You can't use deathclaw gauntlet in power armor.
---
The current game also punishes the fuck out of people for no god damn reason.
---
Currently wandering around having to constantly look over my shoulder because I had the audacity, no, the sheer raw nerve to pick up a fucking screwdriver out of tool box that happened to be within the coverage range of someone's claimed workshop. 
---
Now I'm just mindlessly going about with a 10 cap bounty, aware that any player who runs into me is going to open fire, unable to see where any other players on the map are, unable to really do jack shit until I finally get shot in the head by someone. As far as I'm concerned, Bethesda basically put a 'kill this player without punishment' sign on me for no damn reason, and I can't wait the damn thing off because they apparently last for something like three hours.
---
On pc you may be able to make hotkeys for that card profile switching but on console there would be no such button. There would be at least one menu involved and a few button clicks every time you wanted to switch. So again, I think it’s best to remove them from the card equation entirely. Give them their own category.
---
Lol here goes the downvote train. All I’m saying is that the damage has been done. Fix the exploits so no more duped items enter the game. I spent the last four weekends farming Whitesprings trying to get one of those TSE weapons and the closest I got was a Two Shot Tesla Rifle. Which mysteriously disappeared from my stash box after a server crash. This week I was able to buy a TSE Handmade for 6K caps from some guy who didn’t look like a duper. At least that he didn’t have any suspicious items or amounts of items. If I lose that weapon over some wipe and have to go back to incredibly inferior weapons I’m done. Wipe items from people holding crazy amounts of the same item. Don’t punish people who don’t deserve it. 
---
&gt; Blueprints: Fixed an issue with the cost of wires not being factored in when storing blueprints.
---
Might be related?
---
There are at least a few games with pc/xbox crossplay that also have ps4 versions its not out of the question
---
you're a consumer. 
---
Bobby Pins no longer weight as much as missiles ? Great !
---
Looks like he wants you to scratch under his chin :) Cool shot!
---
The "player base age" could make a difference. I imagine that PC players are a bit more  *mature of age*  (No negative) and that's why you'll find less ACTION on Pc/more YOUTH GONE WILD on PS4.
---
You do know they changed the way the updates were installed so they didn't need to be so huge, right? At least on PC, Idr what effect this had on consoles.
---
Seriously they nerfed Wasteland Whisperer?!? Its already like one of the most useless perks and they knocked it back anymore. Why?
---
They nerf the XP, but they really need to buff nuke zones in general.  You want players to launch nukes, so you need to give proper incentive to do as such.
---
[I swear this sounds somewhat familiar](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/adxpf3/psa_using_the_gamma_gun_on_glowing_ones_counts_as/?st=JQQQ1EW3&amp;sh=9b623993)
---
So you think the average player has 10k weight on their character? 
---
I saw a chameleon deathclaw in fo76, he was a regular deathclaw but with blue skin. No invisibility, nothing.
---
Still no way to tell Power Armour frames apart other than putting all of your frames down and getting into the correct one, I guess.
---
I got every setting on ultra and the game doesn't look anything like that to me. Do you mind sharing your graphic settings?
---
Right? Can we stop making “Level up!” a daily challenge every single day please?
---
&gt;Trade: Fixed an exploit where the cap limit of 5000 in player-to-player trades could be removed. 
---
if you mean you've removed the functionality of the Trading Uncapped mod so that we can no longer legitimately sell things for over 5000 caps, that needs to be reverted asap, because the alternative is selling/buying junk items first and hoping you don't get ripped off
---
&gt;- Blueprints: Fixed an issue with the cost of wires not being factored in when storing blueprints.
---
- Crafting: Fixed an issue where certain objects aren't able to be scrapped through the stored tab 
---
they fixed the wire bug. says right there. try reading first?
---
It's got a lot to do with build for sure.  Initially i was using rifles a lot while wearing PA.  For a while I went 2h in PA.  Then i was heavy weapons, PA basically mandatory for the armor penetration.  In the last few days i went unarmed melee without PA.  So most of that time I spent with a PA build.  I'd say the majority of it is ranged though.  That probably has a lot to do with it.
---
Did you even read the patch notes? They fixed a good bit of bugs
---
Yep, if they cant afford their bounty, they get some lousy penalty....so you get nothing.
---
Still no legendary Chainsaws, Drills, Flare Guns, Syringers and Shovels (probably forgot about some).
---
I had someone launch three nukes and three queens spawned. First one had good loot. Second had 30 5.56 rounds. Third had nothing
---
In every Fallout game I've played, you would start weak then end up murdering everything your eyes could see. Get rid of some perks. This is why we love Fallout cause you can play so many ways. Choose a new path.
---
If it was gigs, then the cries that "oh no, they don't even have delta patching, stupid Bethesda" would be all over the place, now there are cries that the update is too small, geeez, people just cry and cry and cry
---
It was not endgame content, it was an XP piñata.
---
I’m so bad a games and play everything now on easy these days.
---
I can solo three scorched beast at a time. I can survive the queen easily - just can’t kill her in time a lot.
---
Stop being a whiny gamer - grind your level and weapons. Have power armor on.
---
These things are weak. 
---
Not only that but I bet this dude would be complaining if the updates were too big too.
---
I'm hoping they allow these skins on the other power armours one day but who knows.   It's quite annoying because I personally like the profile that ultracite shoulders have (invisible lat syndrome) lol.  I like to mix t-60 with ultracite but I can't come close to matching anything lol, tricentennial looks closest but the blue is more vibrant and I don't particularly want to be blue either.
---
Sort of has become a game for them, I guess. I guess they have a lot of time on their hands, since they they can't get past three seconds on RDRO because of the griefers.
---
make a discord just for nuke zones or lfg? 
---
theres another patch coming out next week though
---
"The patch is 612GB in size! It's way too large! Why make us re-download the entire game!!!"
---
"The patch is only 7KB! It's completely useless! Why even bother?!"
---
Power Armor: The Power Armor light has been made brighter.   
---
Praise Jesus, I can see the light!  
---
Bobby Pins: Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001.   
---
Finally.  
---
Animations: Lever-Action rile now only reloads the correct number of ammo.   
---
Praise the Lord and pass the ammunition.  
---
Crafting: Updated Bulk Acid crafting recipe to require 15 Acid.  
---
No more turning plastic into acid, will be missed.  
---
Crafting: “Hardened Mass” will no longer be scrapped when “Scrap All Junk” is selected.  
---
Can't count the number of times I lost those to scrap all.  
---
Repairing: Overall repair costs have been lowered for both weapons and armor.   
---
Just sweet.  
---
Weapons: Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot.  
---
Hear rifle use cheer.  
---
Armor: Fusion Cores will no longer replenish to full charge upon joining another world.  
---
Another bug I'm going to miss.  
---
All Night Long: All Night Long now decreases hunger and thirst growth at night.  
---
Now it's a little usable.  
---
Fireproof: Fireproof now reduces explosion and flame attack damage by 15% per rank.  
---
My new favorite perk.  
---
Come on, take one for the team, PC Masterrace, we console casuals will be rooting for you.
---
&gt; Fireproof: Fireproof now reduces explosion and flame attack damage by 15% per rank.
---
Combine this with some dense mods and you've got some nice resistance to explosive shotguns. 
---
&gt; Weapons: Fixed an issue that would sometimes cause plasma weapons, flamers and flamer mods, and weapons with explosive bullet mods to not do damage to other players and creatures.
---
Pretty eager to see if this will allow me to consistently damage Scorchbeasts, Mirelurk Queens and other big creatures since I found that a lot of the time I'd have to aim at the floor and do splash damage in order to kill them with my explosive shotgun.
---
people are idiots
---
I added a link
---
Correct.   I received three levels in one Whitesprings nuke session.   I wouldn’t care except I want to level up to materally change my build.  
---
Thank you very much. I know the pillars aren't necessary, but it really bothered me to see a "floating mansion" and it took quite some time of tinkering to get the house *high* and not *flying*.
---
Still no fix for the stored water purifier bug?
---
You and me both.
---
Nice!  Thanks :)
---
Got the same plans from Dropsite C2 (On the shelf, next to the black container)
---
It's generally puzzling to me that people switched en masses to caps. 
---
Caps certainly may be durable, but they're inconvenient to carry (weight, lack of denomination, noise, shape) and it's not as if they're backed by any kind of full faith and credit, either. 
---
There are obvious and huge disadvantages to using pre war money, of course. But not enough for anyone to expect the surviving population of the United States to totally eschew it for anything other than bedding. 
---
... Also... The idea of using paper bills as the cloth to hold together something as critical armor and pockets seems... Wildly optimistic... 
---
Where the fuck did you see this advertised as a content update? 
---
Scorched: Fixed an issue where Scorched may be using invisible weapons or not appearing to fire their weapon correctly.
---
Easily one of the most frustrating things to me glad its fixed
---
I didn't want to make any assumptions :P
---
I love using my rocket powered Zealot’s Baseball bat on them when they land. 
---
Obvious troll is obvious. 
---
Yeah i have all the mats for that what's your gt and I'll message you on live. Sorry for the late reply I fell asleep
---
What are you talking about?  You don't think they use databases?  Wow..  where is your user data stored?  I'm not trying to be a dick either but they 100% use a database server cluster for character data.
---
PVP? forget that
---
Hopefully itll stop me from killing myself constantly.
---
Over
---
and over.
---
Which song?
---
I seen someone with a video with it and they still die almost instantly from two shot explosive weapons. It has nothing to do with dupers. As if duping is the go to argument for every issue the game has. As if people don't get them from drops and trade them for items and caps. Like I said, it might be the only set that prevents being killed in one shot, and you think it ruins pvp? You know weapons can get up to thousands of damage? And you have to stand still and getting staggered breaks it? I don't think you have any idea what you're talking about.
---
To be fair, they seem to have fixed that somewhat for 76. Now when I break in a safe, I tend to get silverware, pre-war money and a weapon. Also no jet anywhere, partly because it doesn't exist yet and probably because the slow-mo effect couldn't be implemented for multiplayer
---
an error occurred (status: 503)
---
Anyone noticed Reddit flakiness today?  Are they running it on the same servers as FO76 or what?
---
I really like this update, it's only missing one thing.  
---
* Toons in excess of  5k lbs in their inventory will be stripped of all their inventory.
---
&gt; **Systems:** Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated .
---
Really hoping this holds up and no other exploits are found... Overall a great patch, great to see the game heading in a better direction.
---
It's one of the best Beach Boys song(still not that amazing), but my biggest problem with the song is, what you already mentioned, that it's from the wrong time AND "wrong" style.
---
As a band, Beach Boys is pretty bad band with full of assholes. 
---
Where the fuck did you see this advertised as a content update? They just fixed a shit load of popular bugs and exploits and all you can do is bitch. 
---
Also wooden blocks, because kids toys had a ton of lead back in the day.
---
Yay
---
Exactly! To just paint your armor, any armor, a simple, single, solid color... Just have the paint you find anywhere, and maybe armorsmith perk 2.
---
No plans needed. 
---
Still no fix for the stored water purifier bug? Dang ..
---
Frankly its the level at which all xp should be generated. Maybe we have a different tolerance level. Anyway, I guess as long as the enemies still spawn, whitesprings nuke runs may still be a thing, simply because at least a large amount of foes spawn over and over, which was the other nice part.
---
Love all these updates... But still sorely disappointed there's no fix yet for Early Warnings. I'm reluctant to keep playing because I want to follow the storyline naturally, and not "skip ahead". 
---
Well, missiles with lvl3 Ordinance Express.
---
So I went from carrying half a pound of bobby pins to one-one thousandth?
---
Not the most significant change ever, but hell, I'll take it.
---
I tend to break like 4 or 5 on a rank 3 lock 😂 for that reason I have like 50 on me
---
Hooray for bobby pin weight decrease!
---
That and the LA rifle reload has me like "PRAISE JESUS!!!"
---
It’s made out of a cotton and polyester blend. It’s practically khaki.
---
&gt; I need to buy ballistic fiber for 6x the value
---
What? Buy, then sell it for 6x more? Or you mean buy it at 6x more than it's worth? 
---
You need lvl 3 white knight. Repairing my armor went from 6-7 ballistic fiber per piece to 1 per piece. Sure, it's cheaper to craft a new piece (which is also dumb), but I have legendary ones that I can't recraft, so I have to repair. 
---
Then make a run through Fort Defiance. There's about 8 military bags in there (and 10ish straight jackets which sell for 45 caps each). 
---
anti-ballistic fiber is a typo, probably just means ballistic fiber.
---
Bug:
---
PC:
---
While placing potted plants on second floor of dev created buildings. The potted plants gets placed inside roof or unreachable areas instead. Doesn't matter if it is directly on the floor or on player tables.
---
Yeah! I recall someone finding the actual dress that was for sale and finding that it was in fact blue and black, but the problem was that the combination of the lighting and the differences in color on the various devices people were viewing it on caused it to look white and gold. Hell, I saw it both ways on different screens myself. 
---
It's the same thing with that yanny/laurel thing, someone took a recording of "laurel" from a  dictionary pronunciation and edited it until it was all fucked up, and made the thing that became the meme.
---
I think at some point we'll get another one of these things.
---
Yeah... they will be about as easy to find as a TSE gun lol.
---
Get it by scrapping military ammo bags
---
There are some amazing things in this patch. Job well done! With more work still to do.
---
I mean a Dense chest mod is already more effective than this, but depending on how the perk stacks with the mod, then maybe
---
but I'm not personally shuffling my build for this
---
Look yet another "we want you to fix all the bugs but not **THAT** bug" as expected...
---
You absolutely can die in pacifist mode to PVP action. It's very possible to stack your damage output to kill with slap damage. 
---
I have seen two X01 jetpacks, 1 X01 Stealthboy, and 2 X01 calibrated shocks in seven weeks of daily vendor runs.   Why not buy them on the secondary market?    
---
people would just bitch that its "like Skyrim" still. 
---
So plasma gatlings are still going to eat cores when you switch weapons and break way too fast? At least they're better to repair now but...
---
I want Todd to come read me the patch notes while i'm all tucked in for bed.
---
Too little too late. But this is still a good thing. Praise Atom! 
---
And you are free to your opinion
---
How long before the next duping method is found, you think?
---
Only a commie would use day month year
---
I had seen someone rocking that and figured I would come across it in game at some point. I didn’t even think to check the atom shop because I mostly ignore it. 
---
Trade: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade
---
So the trade steal thing wasnt a myth?
---
Uncle Ozzy (probably...er, possibly) approves this sentiment: Just listen to some Sabbath to wash out your ears.
---
This will begin to make things right 
---
&gt;Glowing Ones : Glowing Ones will no longer grant erroneous large amounts of XP. DevNote: Glowing Ones were granting Large Boss XP rewards, making them highly exploitable when combined with Nuke Zones.
---
Great
---
Making us grind even more. Fuck Bethesda
---
Aww. No legendary pipe revolvers?  Oh well. Maybe next time. 
---
I’m on Xbox and have the same question
---
Except the bug fixes and removal of exploits. In their "Inside the Vault" blog they stated that this patch would focus on bug fixes and game balances and from what I see in the notes they fix a large number of issues.
---
And to the nerf of the XP from glowing ones, I will miss the XP gain from them but I will admit that it was very imbalanced.
---
Legendary Hunting Rifles...oh yeah
---
Leave it to Bethesda Austin to fix a bug from fallout 4 :o
---
Well I hope its not a case of "1 down. X to go". 
---
&gt; Robots: Fixed an issue that would cause robots to respawn too frequently in Whitesprings.
---
Drat, I loved being the overload of robots. 
---
Go talk to Rose again and it should trigger. You'll lose some progress on the quest but nothing major.
---
Pencil lead, obviously
---
Now i am 100 pounds lighter!
---
Working stove at camp to boil water, uses 5 power but makes recipes not require wood.
---
I never new how much I wanted a Legendary Shovel till I read this comment.
---
&gt; Crafting: “Hardened Mass” will no longer be scrapped when “Scrap All Junk” is selected.
---
Nice
---
This fix is in the patch notes. 
---
Id appreciate the raider leathers if you dont mind!
---
&gt;Glowing Ones: Glowing Ones will no longer grant erroneous large amounts of XP. DevNote: Glowing Ones were granting Large Boss XP rewards, making them highly exploitable when combined with Nuke Zones.
---
As to be expected, but good to know if I'm going to fix my build this way I have about a week. 
---
&gt;Bobby Pins: Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001. 
---
&gt;Systems: Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated. 
---
Let's see how much good this does. 
---
&gt;Animations: Lever-Action rile now only reloads the correct number of ammo.
---
I may not be much of a semi-auto rifle person but this is still very much a good thing I've known been bugging the community for awhile. 
---
&gt;Effects: Consumed Berry Mentats now correctly show purple glowing auras around players and creatures. 
---
Pretty sure it didn't at all, nice to know this is getting fixed.
---
&gt;Crafting: “Hardened Mass” will no longer be scrapped when “Scrap All Junk” is selected.
---
Yes, just yes. 
---
&gt;Weapons: Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot. 
---
Nice, still any chance of maybe adding the enclave stuff to the legendary loot pool?
---
&gt;Weapons: The Vampire weapon mod effect now works only when hitting living targets as intended. 
---
Yet, probably still doesn't work on I believe it was the flamer weapons and "automatic melees" like the ripper it unless it's a power attack still good patch over all. 
---
Which you will dutifully downvote 😉.  
---
But if the whole point of the game is to divide the player base into those who use those weapons and those who don't, congrats I guess. You've won!
---
Very low chance to appear it seems, in fact with Deathclaws in general this go around anything other than a diseased version feels rare, or at least for me at level 92.
---
0 changes to scorchbeasts. The blinding spam will continue for at least another month
---
That’s cause raider is kind of the trash power armor, it’s the worst in all accounts but is also the easiest to get and can use at the earliest levels 
---
Disappointed laser guns still break apart just by looking at them, oh well
---
Levels and xp are not really an issue. You really level in this game too fast. 
---
yes
---
Plenty of exciting things in here!
---
...then... don't grind XP by nuking Whitesprings with the explicit intent on exploiting something you knew and understood was not intended? 
---
Was hoping for a stash increase. Oh well, maybe next patch.
---
I've never heard of that.
---
Which is precisely why XP should be toned done.
---
We can fast travel to skip the song, then we wouldn't have to wait so long for it to be over. But wouldn't it be nice to not have to hear it to begin with?
---
Oddly enough I find myself enjoying that song and I've always hated The Beach Boys.  I do admire your passion against it, though.
---
500mb for data file changes...
---
3-4gb for texture file changes...
---
Dunno man, seems fine by me considering a bunch of numbers were changed versus entire packs of textures.
---
Queen drops 3 stars more reliably than an hour at whitesprings, anyone still nuking that site is just wasting a lot of time.
---
&gt;Crafting: Updated Bulk Acid crafting recipe to require 15 Acid
---
RIP 
---
What is "anti-ballistic fiber"? Isnt it just "ballistic fiber"?
---
I bet thats being saved for the election update :P
---
Legendary Hunting Rifles...oh yeah , but they still scrap mods....
---
That's a pretty long list.
---
&gt; Crafting: Lowered chance of Power Generators of spawning fusion cores.
---
So Core replenish runs are going to be much less viable?
---
&gt; Teams: Teamed players can no longer unfairly block an attacking player when that player attempts to overtake a workshop. Your teammate will enter PVP with the attacking player.
---
Does this address the 'lock/block out anyone from Ammo factory' problem?
---
&gt; Systems: Fixed an issue that allowed armor mods to reduce carry weight past intended values.
---
Could you clarify this one? Is this reducing weightless armor to 0, or reducing x item types?
---
She's a keeper, that one! 
---
....No? I don't even have any of the sneak perks, just high agility, and half the time nothing notices me. I can't even imagine how broken the game would be if I had the 'Running doesn't affect stealth' perk and the one that raises sneaking by 25%. 
---
where did you find the plans for heavy metal? 
---
Really happy for the fixes but we genuinely need another 200 stash space. Its literally impossible to have more than 2 builds worth of equipment  at a time. Its either the 1 you are wearing and 1 you are building towards or you are maxed out.
---
It's a good fix; but most people go there to farm legendaries, though.
---
I'm not finding much in my searches, try going to boot camp, and then maybe Abbie's bunker. Might need to follow the quest line again using a guide. These are just guesses based on other suggestions I've seen on reddit so I hope they work. If not, hopefully someone else would be able to help
---
Another post suggested this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a0fpb2/recruitment_blues_quest_fix/
---
not happy about the increased need for ballistic fiber
---
 Yea but only for defensive purpose. The real gripe about using explosive is that they are super unreliable. On one throw, they go straight to Underground narnia never to be seen again. On another throw they bounce to the moon and explode in the middle of nowhere. 
---
I guess it's good for point blank explosion now? But good luck on armor repair. 
---
The rundown for what this patch isn't:
---
* Not a fix to TSE damage making PVP pretty much a lol-fest since Fireproof will only reduce a 1000 damage shot down to 415 if you also had 1000 DR, still like 90 more than health possible even with the DR calculation.
---
* Scorchbeasts still broken spam attacking, no fix to their uninteractivity, and no addition to their loot so they are still just ammo/weapon condition dumps.
---
* No change to Stairs not connecting correctly in CAMPS, and a ton of other CAMP bugs persist through this patch.
---
Upside?
---
Legendary rifles, Harden Mass doesn't get scrapped, and "server stability" I guess.
---
Literally hit my first nuke zone ever *last night*, looted these, then when I went back to convert the flux I picked up I wondered why they were gone...
---
&gt;Weapons: Fixed an issue that prevented the Gauss Rifle from being identified as a rifle. Now rifle-related perks can be applied to the Gauss Rifle.
---
Also looted my first one of these last night... damage was already pretty high, given that I have a good number of rifle-related perks this is even better.
---
Damn. Was hoping for Barbarian and Luck of the Draw fixes.
---
A lot of nice fixes here!
---
Still a good place to farm Legendaries, won't have much of an effect on the volume of Whitespring nuking 😁
---
&gt; How do I heal my radiation without radaway and keep my mutation stack?
---
1- Death - Build your camp for jumping off, or utilize enemy locations in conjunction with your mutation seeking so they can kill you. 
---
From Patch notes:
---
&gt; Systems: Rads will no longer completely be removed when by dying repeatedly.
---
You have to do it on a PC, download/install the launcher, log in, and the games should be available.
---
I have a PS4 too but I *think* I have a laptop lying around that can run it. /: 
---
Edit: your account should already be linked if you’re able to play FO76 on your PS4 
---
probably just a typo
---
Yep. XP is a sidelight. Legendary farming is why most are there. 
---
Dang. I love it. Well said. Did we just become best friends?!
---
I really like #15: Canning and jarring!
---
I also really like the different beds and items giving boosts and creating a motel, lol. I feel like that would encourage more of a community since what you had to offer would be different than me. I really want to open up a trader business or a restaraunt specializing in gourmet wasteland dishes.
---
Maybe, just maybe, one of the expansions will create hubs (faction based?). A community hub is needed. It feels like Whitesprings is the closest to that, but I'm thinking more like Destiny's hub city. But I hope its not just an area with a bunch of vendor stalls like from Fallout 4 (just ran by us, not NPCs)! I wouldn't want to stand around for that. Plus, I want it at my CAMP.
---
They could make it an independently loaded in area where only members of that faction are allowed to enter ~or~ you can be part of a different faction but have to pay caps to go there. Then if you want to party up there you can enter back into the main world together. Again, similar to Destiny. That way I can party up with my other fellow Gourmands......
---
"Some people call them Demons, I call them *BITCHES!*"
---
Must be all the nukes
---
The loss of ghoul xp is sad, but I think Whitespring farming will still be the same since spawn rates and thus legendary drops are still the same. I'm glad a bug was fixed, but it doesn't fix the actual problem which is only 2 locations are worthwhile in a nuke zone. Now things will still be the same but it wont feel as fun leveling up through this big event
---
You could have crazy paint splattered colour schemes though, like Jackson Pollock in a more violent way.
---
Bobby Pins: Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001.
---
The change we really needed.
---
Anyone else notice that some of the patch notes look like they were run through google translate? 
---
Just xp though. Hordes of glowing ghouls giving boss lvl xp is a little crazy. 
---
I already tried that but I’ll do it again🤷‍♂️
---
Re-read the notes. It's in there.
---
So nerf aren't changes? 
---
Still a good place to farm Legendaries, won't have much of an effect on the volume of Whitespring nuking 😁n
---
Very nice as someone who loves coffee the mug looks amazing! 
---
That would be cool, but annoying 
---
/r/gayfortodd 
---
Fallout 76 *IS* Whitespring Nuking ... or am I missing some content between that and Vault 76 ?
---
This is what, their 4th or 5th try? I'll believe it when I see it.
---
I did not know this was not intended. I assumed all nuke zones spawn crazy tough and lucrative enemies. It took me forever to get to where I could even survive such a run. I assumed people picked Whitesprings because of the spawn rate. Everything is suddenly "unintended" when people figure out the most efficient way to level up or progress. I understand somethings truly are unclear, but this was not obvious. I can still barely survive there, so the risk vs reward was appropriate as far as I can tell.
---
" **Repairing**: Overall repair costs have been lowered for both weapons and armor."
---
Does that apply to Power Armor too, I wonder?
---
Will repairing T-51b now actually be practical?
---
Yeah that was fun to go through the quest to get the paint scheme. 
---
Best additions: 
---
legendary hunting rifles, removal of atomic shop ads. 
---
Great patch. Didn't get everything but it's a good step forward. This one should be a good "prep" patch for the one at the end of the month supposedly adding new stuff
---
I'd be ok with the stability part rather than new content. I'm only level 22 so its easier for me to say that but I do still see a lot of players under 40's. I don't know what duping is but from the sounds of it on the boards its causing issues in game. 
---
I hope it stays fixed for at least a little while this time.
---
Brighter power armor light, fixed duping, fixed lever-action reloads, hardened mass doesn't get scrapped now, lowered repair costs across the board, fixing challenge problems, fixed the fusion core production rate with the fusion core generators... Holy crap there is too much to list in here!
---
#THANK YOU SO MUCH   
---
Think the patch is fixing it.
---
Crafting: Fixed an issue where certain objects aren't able to be scrapped through the stored tab
---
The games are available but it still tells me to buy them, I've played since the Beta.
---
Yea, I hate this change too. Apparently most players don't like dark nights so.. shrug
---
Huh. 
---
Why no buff to laser and plasma rifles...
---
Lever action rifle fix, after all this time it has finally come!
---
Yea that would be neat. Maybe one like the aesthetic of the raider gang from FO4 nuka world. Vant remember the name off the top of my head
---
Yeah that's the one. I once had my camp there, but the constant mutant attacks turned me off. 
---
I'm almost positive that this also occurs while doing events where you have to "repair" something without telling you which of your materials it's using.  For example, I believe I lost an x01 jetpack while doing the Uranium Fever event.  I repaired one of the extractors and it used my mod as part of the steel without actually telling me what it was using.
---
Those are some damn fine patch notes. Thanks bethesda! I like the changes!
---
Welp. Im boned if that means reduced weapon weight armors nolonger stack.
---
Its cool and everything dont get me wrong...
---
.. but I suspect leveractions and gauss will still outperform hunting rifles on a per shot basis.        
---
Dont hurt me :(
---
Then you can get scanned by those games too! :) 
---
One of the best patch notes I have seen in a while
---
Thank u! 
---
ultracite lasers are green, fwiw
---
That is ballistic fibre
---
Who would dupe maps for non-legendary junk that crashes your toon when you use to many. I’m pretty sure they will just stick to duping actual items.
---
All I wanted was an indication of what plans I own and to stop scrapping mods when I craft/repair things. Better luck next patch I hope.
---
My end game has become turning my team into an explosive harpoon gun gang. But srs involvement in the game economy is a decent end game, except for the part where the economy is quite broken and you can't do item for item trading without risk
---
I either die or come close to dying every time I go, so the risk vs reward seemed about right to me. I assumed people picked whiterun because of the spawn rate, I had no idea these tough ghouls post nuke were giving boss xp ... But I did think it was commensurate with the risk.
---
Looks very good
---
Yeah it's a shame.  More should just be in game as opposed to shop only.  I despise that these armor paints are not including all power armor, even raider imho.   It's not such a hard thing in the grand scheme of things to upload additional skins/textures lol.   Modding communites do it all the time for free xD
---
Except it’s impossible to solo because no matter what you do there’s gonna be 10+ people showing up 
---
Easiest to get? Man, after putting for 73 levels, I just found me first raider power armor the other day at blackwater mine of all places. I'd seen incomplete t-45 and t-51b sets pretty commonly before I could wear them.
---
But I think you are right and that was supposed to be the intention, but the RNG loot in this game is terrible unbalanced :(
---
Don’t worry I break 10 on a rank 3 lock
---
I think it gets better all the time... they're fixing and adjusting things, it's just happening slowly. This latest patch has a pile of really good stuff in it.
---
They can literally do their Sonic scream backwards. You cannot cower from them indoors even just to evaluate the situation, use stims or drugs. 
---
I don't mind a difficult boss but these things but these things take hundreds of rounds and drop next to nothing.
---
Funnily enough, the one time I was in a fight with the queen, she landed often giving everyone a chance to get a few hits in.
---
Beth is waiting a few months to charge you $20 for it. 
---
I killed her 15 times in the last week, none of the drops were good.  The last time I killed her I got a 1* scorch killer pool stick.  I get better and more reliable drops bouncing around worlds looking for AWOL.
---
&gt; **Trade**: Fixed an exploit where the cap limit of 5000 in player-to-player trades could be removed.
---
Say it with me, BGS: YOU. DO. NOT. DECIDE. PRICES. OF. ITEMS. WE. DO. These limits are so stupid.
---
It was a myth. This helps people not be sneaky in trades which WAS a thing.
---
Get good, get there first and one shot it
---
RNGesus is a cruel dude, I've just started hopping to get the shocks and got the Jetpack on my 3rd try... No shocks though and I'm now on my 15th try. The system of obtaining X01 mods is a tad silly.
---
&gt; Crafting: Fixed an issue where certain objects aren't able to be scrapped through the stored tab 
---
I'm hoping that's what this is...  I have the same issue with the water purifier.
---
no more scrapping mods and the ability to tell if you already own the plan when viewing a vendors inventory 
---
fingers crossed
---
"Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated"
---
All of issues?
---
Goddamn nice!
---
Whitesprings nerfed when it was one of the only things to do that was still fun, interesting...
---
QoL fixes are of course great, but the constant "fun detected" nerfs aren't helping the game at all. No one I know plays anymore because of them.
---
Ballistic Fibers now required for crafting above 20? Hooo boy, I don't consider that to be a good idea.
---
Big Pharma?
---
Where did you find that outfit? Thats the coolest ive seen in game yet! Looks like a magician haha. 
---
Hmm. No word of mods being scrapped though, even though they fixed hardened mass. It literally would have taken them no extra time to change mods in the same way.
---
As a heavy weapon build,  i use the cryolator to slow them down. Switch to my gatling gun. Shoot the wings. Thing lands, start huckin some hate at that head. Usually go through like 5 rounds of cryo and 45 rounds of 5mm.
---
No vats
---
It's really needed change to PvP. 45% less dmg in PA and armors. maybe now explosive shotgun can only deal 90% of your max health
---
I didn't down vote the other comment but I did this one because quite frankly none of it is remotely relevant to the discussion and adds nothing of value beyond you complaining about something 
---
No, I mean catapult. 
---
Thank you for posting.  Nice to see some of the fixes highlighted by the community were addressed as well as the others.  Good progress being made here.
---
Let's be real guys, this game is garbage. I tried to get back into it, and I was spawned underneath my camp. Oh well, I can fast travel and spawn where I'm supposed to. Then as soon as I open my stash box, the game has a fatal error. Within 5 minutes of opening the app on my xbox. 
---
I appreciate the steps being made by the dev team, but it's too little too late. I'm just glad I didn't drop a full $60 on this game.
---
I disagree. A level every other day is too slow, which is what I normally experience. I'm not the person who downvoted you, btw. I dont downvote opinions I dont agree with.
---
i wish for cross platform. Not too many of my gaming friends have PC's. My build is more around lone wonder. They really need a guild type system for this game so players can build up a base. I assume it would have to be on a specific server but be great to be able to log in and be connected to a group of people.
---
My camp is very close by. A little North of yours.
---
deal. sent u a pm
---
How recently and what platform?
---
Great patches! Some of this stuff I've even forgotten about...I kind of just accepted bobby pins weighing what they did and got used to selling anything above 10. 
---
The hunting rifles are lovely, now snipers can get a proper rifle to match. But what about pipe revolvers?
---
Wasn't the M79 counting as a shotgun already fixed in last year's patch though? I remember checking to confirm that it no longer gains the damage bonus.
---
Interesting to see that melee hitting enemies with the crossbow and  railway rifle no longer give you ammo. That seemed like one of those bugs that flew under the radar. But what about the railway rifle not getting damage bonuses from rifle perks?
---
Ok, so lets get this out of the way. 1st no fix for the duping glitch, and no nerf or removal for the Two Shot Explosives that are basically everywhere and have turn PvP into basically playing Golden Eye where everyone has the Golden gun and we all die in one shot regardless of armor, lvl, SPECIAL or Perks. 2nd; No enemy fix for the Scorchbeasts,with them basically being the most underwhelming and useless endgame bosses in existence. With their innate ability to find you from hundreds of meters away, while hiding and spam attacking you so you can't fight back, Idk how they haven't been fixed yet. 3rd; You fixed enemies in Workshops from spawning under the workshops but haven't fixed them spawning inside your camp??? This was a problem in FO4 that made putting up walls/fences essentially useless as the enemy could/would just spawn inside your settlement. Half the time when I respond to my workshop being attacked I find all my crafting benches have been destroyed and my generator eaten cause some molerats or radrats have spawned inside my camp, and of course the turrets don't actually shot anything so they are basically useless too. Oh and seriously have attacks on my workshops be something actually threatening, like super mutants, deathclaws, not rats and bugs.  4th; you fixed a bunch of perks but you left Barbarian out of the fixes, it doesn't/won't work with Class Freak, this has been known and talked about for sometime on Reddit. 5th; Some Daily quest were fixed but still nothing for "Heart of the Enemy" nobody has been able to do it past the first time, its classified under Daily Quests yet we can't redo it at all.
---
I am low on violet flux or I would, it takes 4 and I have 0 currently. So I am limited to a officer suit only. 
---
You come up with 4 violet flux and I won't charge you to make it. I never charge for services unless someone is a dick. 
---
Your last paragraph describes my first journey to Welch at a fairly low level to a T.
---
You could view a players inventory without them consenting.  You couldn't actually take items afaik. 
---
Glowing Ones : Glowing Ones will no longer grant erroneous large amounts of XP. DevNote: Glowing Ones were granting Large Boss XP rewards, making them highly exploitable when combined with Nuke Zones.
---
Kinda expected this one to come along.
---
Still no idea which plans I own and no fix for scrapping mods while fixing/crafting...these were the only fixes I was really hoping for. Maybe next patch.
---
Tesla coil in power armor works well. I’ll stand in doorway and let people tag as I’m doing a small hit on each then back out and join the fun after a few moments. 
---
Communist detected.
---
I mean, I rarely ever do nuke zones. It's not like leveling is slow outside of that. Removing the ability to hit tesla rifle 3 times and gain an instant level is good for the gameplay's health regardless of whether leveling fast or slow is justified or not. Leveling faster can come in different form but not this 
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3uOPGkEJ56Q 
---
Yeah that blew my mind when I saw how much they weighed...😂
---
Just more options to try out different things, or save a bunch to be able to respec on the fly 
---
Still scrap fucking mods though, which are 100x more valuable....
---
True true. I was being glib. 
---
How long before the next duping method is found, you think? 
---
I wish I could buy a PC for those tiny update sizes, but consoles just use wayyyyy less electricity right now. its the worst of both worlds...
---
&gt; Power Armor: The Power Armor light has been made brighter.   
---
&gt; **Animations: Lever-Action rile now only reloads the correct number of ammo.**   
---
&gt; Crafting: “Hardened Mass” will no longer be scrapped when “Scrap All Junk” is selected.   
---
&gt; Lifetime Challenges: Fixed an issue where some lifetime challenges would revert progress after logging out.   
---
&gt; Weapons: Fixed an issue that prevented the Gauss Rifle from being identified as a rifle. Now rifle-related perks can be applied to the Gauss Rifle.   
---
&gt; Fusion Cores: Fixed an issue where Fusion Core generators were producing cores at a slower rate than intended. They are now back to 8 cores/hr.   
---
&gt; **Weapons: Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot.** 
---
Some legitimately good shit in this patch!
---
&gt; Crafting: Level 25 armor and above now requires anti-ballistic fiber to craft. 
---
Well, at least now the egregious repair costs of armor make more sense.
---
Thanks for the copy/past OP.
---
really? I swear when i was aiming and shooting the wings I wouldn't get hit markers. Will have to try your strat. Thanks!
---
You're absolutely correct. I swapped my hunting/sniper rifle for a scoped, silenced lever action a while ago. Better damage, faster consecutive shots, and now that they've fixed the reload animation to match the number of bullets missing, I see little reason to go back to a hunting rifle.
---
Wonder if we’ll get a ton of server crashes on consoles until the patch hits since they pretty much gave everybody a heads up to dupe while they can.
---
Who the hell said i was male?
---
Yeah, but then I still have to sprint everywhere to make a dent in my 90+ normal fusion cores.
---
That has nothing to do with trade stealing. It says right on the line above. It's to prevent people from seeing your inventory. 
---
This is the real Christmas Present that we've all been waiting for.
---
This patch is a MAJOR PvP Balancing event.  
---
This whole list is pretty amazing, but the Fireproof is single most important thing that happened to the meta, and by extension, to the whole game.  
---
Current meta is: either you have assassin/sentinel set and you are not one-shotted by TSE guns, or you don't have the assassin/sentinel set and just as the rest of the guys, you one-shot everything with a TSE gun. Terrible, terrible meta. Now, simply Fireproof+Assassin set should be enough to render TSE weapons nonOP, and that is like ten thousand times easier to obtain. This also leaves more place for other playstyles, as sets/builds focused to negate explosive damage would probably leave openings elsewhere.
---
Fixed in the current patch for PC and consoles on the 14th, just in case you hadn’t seen it.
---
Did they take the atom shop advertisement off of the main pause screen?
---
Bethesda *- Disappointment guaranteed, and we'll prove it!*
---
we must remain vigilant
---
Honestly, they just need to bring back the brightness slider. It's been an issue for me in every Bethesda game since Oblivion but for some reason they decided to remove the slider for Fallout 76.
---
I didnt think it was a bug. I die several times when I go into whitesprings. Only been a few times. I assumed the xp was intended to be appropriate as endgame content. I assumed people pick whitesprings for the spawn rate, not because of a "bug". I consider the xp to be appropriate for the risk level I experienced. I didnt downvote you btw, that was someone else.
---
I been having such a hard time finding plans for different wall styles or infrastructure. But I don’t want to do a google search and cheat 😂 
---
Oh yeah, you're right. Thanks for telling me :)
---
Literally unplayable.
---
What about prime receivers on combat rifles using. 44?
---
Only people i've seen in it are low levels because it starts at level 14 or 15 i believe and is easy to obtain.
---
Ah okay, i have the game on PS4 and i was thinking of playing it again/streaming it, but i feel like every time i've been on the servers i'm on are kinda dead, which is fine but I can't help but feel that there's a lot of more players on PC. 
---
Well, half that amount...
---
While there are a few nice things in here, this hardly inspires me to play and certainly doesn't inspire me to recommend the game to anyone.
---
Mainly, I don't see enough being done to make the game itself better for players. Sure, bugfixes improve the game somewhat, but the game _itself_ is fundamentally broken, and I see absolutely zero effort being put towards fixing that.
---
Yeah they went over the top a fair bit. Sometimes I wonder if there is some frost troll on high hrothgar mentality. People speak really fondly of running into that thing at low levels and the battle they have with it. It makes me think Bethesda took it to heart and thinks people want every battle to be that way. When it’s just cool as a one off thing. Kinda like Fallout 4 where depending how soon you’re running into Preston Garvey and lot your getting hit with a death claw low level. If half the game is you getting reamed by some op monster it starts to not be fun. A one time rare encounter is a more memorable fun experience. 
---
"... so I like to be prepared and take things slowly"
---
Well, if you're playing smart and carefully then the game is going to be pretty easy. Most games are, I don't think they've ever built Fallout with the intention of it being like Dark Souls. I don't disagree though, I'd love if they added some kind of hardcore area that required you to have a strong character build, food buffs, chems, etc. Something that took the absolute max gear and preparation. End rewards are always so much more satisfying if you've had to bleed for them.  
---
They address that too. Trade thieft was real.
---
So that happened all of once to you.
---
Ill update the spreadsheet to add aid, ammo and mods as soon as i get the time .  
---
If there is anything else anyone would like added let me know
---
"**Repairing**: Overall repair costs have been lowered for both weapons and armor."
---
Anyone know if this applies to Power Armor too?
---
Maybe repairing T-51b is more practical now?
---
But don't worry that instigating rolling pin is god-tier weapon that will one shot a scorchedcbeast. Also that Rocket launcher does extra limb damage because you know the original explosion wasn't good enough to break some legs. 
---
Note, it does require a perk card. I have like 12% chance to break a limb with heavy weapons.
---
I nuke the hotel for the legendarys, tone down xp doesn’t affect that. Also to stick it to those robots 
---
Can we also add the 10mm to that list?
---
I've honestly seen both :/ there's been times where the meat pile will show up where the enemy died even if the body moves but I've also noticed the meat pile being under the body after it changes location. I believe it has to do with how long after they die will determine where the pile will show up.
---
Sweet! Now I may use one again! Now about that lefthand bolt....
---
Trajectory. Wherever the corpse ends up, that's where you loot it. It's for this reason that using weapons like the grenade launcher is a bad idea at Whitespring. 
---
There are good quality headsets with mic on Amazon for under $30
---
tbf, for a patch that was announced as bug fixing and balances, having legendary hunting rifles is a pretty good addiction
---
Yeah, I just saw this in the patch notes. Really, really interesting. If it stacks with the dense armor mod that could be quite potent.
---
And lever action reload fix, and explosives shots not killing fixed, and Bobby pins weighing .001, and at least one method of duping fixed, and they fixed some trade weirdness. 
---
I'm now apprehensive to move my camp, since I finally found a spot that no-one else is using. But I'll have to look around for a nice lakeside spot again.
---
Duuuude. That sucks. 
---
I can't tell from the notes, but was the issue of automatically scrapping Power Armor and weapon mods during crafting solved?
---
All I'm saying is that you don't want to put a  unit of Ballistic Fiber and a unit of Anti Ballistic Fiber in the same backpack. Trust me on this.
---
Oh so you still need the perk card to target limbs in vats but you dont need to use vats
---
I was confused by some of those things, I never really looked into how the dupe bug worked but figured it had something to do with that.
---
I have no idea why a simple value change took so damn long but I'll take it all the same.
---
Keep the day job
---
Yes, she called them one time and opened a ticket about the delay and was told the demand for products exceeded their ability to get them out in a timely way and also the entire shipment was delayed due to the shirt being on back order, which had she known she could have addressed but hey I have to say it was a pleasant surprise to get them yesterday and I am happy with the quality/condition of the items.
---
Or just drop the patches across the board on the same day. Oh well we’ll see.
---
" Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot."  
---
Okay, and now let me scrap them!
---
It applies to all the numbered power armors, not the named ones
---
Yeah it was someone who was either ignorant, griefing, or who was just farming XP and didn't care about loot or anyone else.
---
I have a Tesla Rifle now just so I can tag all the enemies quickly and efficiently. Try that or grab a Gamma Gun to tag them and heal them at the same time. 
---
Trade theft was never real. It was never proven once. It was all sneaky tactics that someone could make it seem like it.  
---
Show me any evidence of theft from a trade and I'll give you reddit gold.
---
I'm level 25 and have a couple T-45 pieces that are not painted. I was wandering around all night trying to find out how to change the colour like all of the pretty ones I've seen in the wasteland.. but just could not figure it out :( As noob I've got soo many questions so if anyone has a few moments to spare please DM to chat about PA and what to do lol. 
---
Fingers crossed!
---
Carry three and switch rapidly and you will notice that they auto reload and can load more than one round per rifle 
---
Probably a rename or just a mistake in the notes... after all, the ballistic bits are the bullets, not the fiber.
---
Wow, that's a huge list of fixes.  There's some really fantastic stuff here!
---
I can't wait to find a legendary hunting rifle...
---
There will probably be a dump glitch developed by the time the patch goes to console.  Also patching the dupe only benefits the dupers for the most part.  There inventory is now much more valuable and exclusive than it was before (if there is a significant amount without another glitch).
---
Well, in Bethesda's case it could easily turn up being a rarer modification of ballistic fiber (the recipe for which is 10 ballistic fiber + 2 anti-matter, with the latter forgotten to be placed within the world cells and also omitted from the loot tables. Purely accidentally, ofc).
---
If you click on the item in the axon store it will tell you exactly what armor is it applies to
---
No. Its a heavy weapons specific card. There is one for rifles as well. I do not run with the vats card. 
---
For repairing, yes. But before , I could craft armour at level 50 and it didn't take ballistic. This is adding it to the crafting cost .
---
Between level 1-30 I had accumulated 5 different complete sets of raider power armor.  I’m now level 65, have replaced 5 of those sets with X-01, T-45, T-51, T-60 and Ulltracite.  I also haven’t seen a single new raider set.  I think your chances of finding it are based on your level.
---
And this is why Bethesda can never win. A patch full of asked for bug fixes and removed exploits and all you bitches can do is cry that they didn't fix everything in a single patch. 
---
I dont TSE, just DemolitionExpert 5, Automatic grenade launcher, and FragMIRVs.
---
There was a post yesterday about killing all the scorched leaders that spawn under SB, forces them to land. Tried it last night, seems legit.
---
There were no notable changes to Plasma Gats, it's atrocious. They still eat cores, dont stay charged, and break as soon as you pull the trigger... but hey-- at least they can HIT things now! 
---
They decreased it though... 
---
I'll try that. Thanks.
---
I wonder if their Bug with constant Sonic Spam is somehow related to Assaultrons Sometimes Spamming their range attack.
---
Yup...but it had to happen at some time. 
---
Pretty good update, but nothing for the stash ? 
---
Ahh a metro 2033 reference, I respect that.
---
OK Bethesda, you heard the man, stop the press !
---
I've helped a lot of friends level up from 30 to 80. It usually only takes a handful of 2 hour sessions and tbh I never used whitesprings to do it. Big bend tunnel is the best place to level
---
You don't have a pile of anti-matter in your inventory? Fucking casual....
---
Ahem...
---
*capsloc*
---
WHUR DURR BURR GURR DE DUR BU DURR FURR HURR BA DUR BA DURR HURR GEE MURR GURR BA DURR BA DURR
---
Yeah? I would love to visit it! Are you on PC?  
---
Did you know that the trailer park nearby (North of me) sometimes offers power armor and plans.
---
Right?  How am I going to RP as Rick the Gravedigger without a legendary shovel?  Or a legendary Protest sign??
---
Nothing about bobble head stacking?
---
This. 
---
Indeed! Energy weapons need Some Love 
---
I have been doing that for weeks. It’s funny to see the proliferation of Tesla rifles to counter the one shot wonders who stand at the front door. 
---
I’m excited too, but isn’t that just cosmetic? I don’t lose any ammo when I reaload with a partial clip left. 
---
"Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot"
---
FUCK YES !
---
They nerf the XP, but they really need to buff nuke zones in general. You want players to launch nukes, so you need to give proper incentive to do as such.
---
Oh wow, this is fantastic! And I thought I made efficient use of space, hahaha. My little cottage feels like a warehouse now :D
---
Actually the bit about dividing the player base into have and have nots is extremely relevant.
---
Now we will be selling 200 bobby pins to vendors from time to time.
---
Yeah the main reason why I want a pc
---
Oh goodie I've not run into one of those yet.
---
I need my 'Touch Down' achievement!
---
I excused them , so they are excusable.
---
In regards to your last point, it's not even hard to add snap points. It just shows they don't care about CAMPS right now. Given the problems in this game right now, I can't blame them for having higher priorities.
---
Atleast it stops the scheer amount of items being duped so then players actually play the game more to get the items they desire. Tired of seeing everyone and their pet gerbil with a  plethora of TSE'S
---
If it matters, I don't see why you couldn't trade twice.  Setting a hard limit of 5,000 seems like a safeguard against current and future exploits more than anything else.
---
Fair enough but you shouldn't  expect you can say "I am xyz so you should listen to what I say more than what others say" without providing a modicum of proof.
---
Jesus, if we are going to need ballistic fibre for even more stuff can they PLEASE make it easier to acquire 
---
First. Fuck reddit gold.
---
Second. My wife had her weapon stolen. I seen it happen.
---
Is there an ELI5 for discords
---
Working with tech startups one will find making sustainable profit from *ANYTHING* is harder than just having some good ideas.
---
But, you gotta have some good ideas as well ...
---
How much was it before?
---
Side note, I'm disappointed that the Watoga Assaultrons have a level cap of 24 (or so it seems), and I've never seen them legendary.
---
Sweet!
---
No proof? Don't believe you.
---
It’s nice to see them fix minor annoyances, but there’s nothing here that will make me start playing again.
---
This game needs more radical changes
---
Unless i skipped passed it, did it say if the laser rifles have been fixed? As in now we can use them instead of being complete garbage
---
It’s abspultely stupid. The only reason to go 50 cal is because ammo is actually pretty cost-effective to craft. 
---
Literally, the only logical reason doesn’t even work. Looking at the 50 cal bullet in game it’s the full 50 BMG that is way more powerful than a 308. If it was another 50 caliber cartridge like 50 Beowulf or 50 AE, it could make sense, but it’s not.
---
I might just look into that idea. Thanks.
---
I am on PC. My camp isn't as impressive as yours, though.
---
I've been a bit busy with my research work lately but I'll probably log in this weekend. 
---
+1 to this idea 
---
That's a really huge list, nice!
---
But still no fix for invisible players/team members after entering or leaving a building (sometimes you just see the player name without a player model) :-(
---
Less of a reason to nuke the doo-doo out of Whitesprings daily.  I think that's a good thing.
---
Thank-you for the download, keep an eye on this post as im going to keep it updated as item weights change with any patch that gets released.
---
Where's mah TSE shovel ?!
---
In Fallout: Tactics you can recruit sentient Deathclaws into your squad after a certain prerequisite is met.
---
it was 800mb for me i am sure we got new atomic shop stuff inside the update
---
Crafting: Level 25 armor and above now requires anti-ballistic fiber to craft.
---
Crafting: Anti-ballistic Fiber becomes required for armor at level 25 instead of previously at level 20
---
Crafting: Anti-ballistic Fiber also is now required for repairing armor at level 25 and above instead of previously at level 20.
---
Thank GOD that's sorted then.
---
All I keep getting are crap low level armor legendaries.  I am disappoint.
---
I honestly do not think there are any outside of Workshops. Which I guess is why I recommended the perk. So you at least have a chance of minimizing your farming for wood.
---
25 years after the bombs, you seriously except me to believe people just stopped using real money that early? There is pre-war cash literally everywhere.
---
I think armor will take more fiber to build, but less to repair. 
---
Good to hear. I ordered Christmas presents over a month ago, yet to receive them.
---
I feel for everyone who still deals with this shitty beta they released. This game is a fucking joke, and this update is a slap in the face. It took them 3 months to fix Bobby Pins. 3 FUCKING MONTHS. I'm done supporting these morons at Bethesda 
---
We jest, but I'm sure this will come up as some major complaint
---
Dont care. Youre literally just some chode-chugger on an anonymous website.
---
Fact remains they listed fixes for both trade issues, one vlatantly being thieft, and lots of people had shit stolen.
---
Mook.
---
I like this. I am my own worst enemy.
---
**Crafting:** “Hardened Mass” will no longer be scrapped when “Scrap All Junk” is selected.
---
PRAISE BE TO TODD
---
If this happened to me, I would make a simple autohotkey macro to constantly log into the game and punch my alt account to crash the server. I would stream it live on twitch, then i would go to bed. I would probably get banned, but at least it would bring attention to it.
---
This is amazing. Glad to see some perks being altered for the better. 
---
They had it before the merger 15 years ago too
---
Oooh, sorry, I missed that. Agreed, it's not a good change at all. It makes sense I suppose, but still, it kind of stinks.
---
The explosive 10mm autopistol feels decent enough to me. 
---
I barely repair my armor now.. I don't know what I'm going to do.
---
It's happened to me before too. That wasn't it. Haven't used mats to craft things in a while.
---
&gt;They nerf the XP, but they really need to buff nuke zones in general.  You want players to launch nukes, so you need to give proper incentive to do as such.
---
Even though I feel your conclusion is right, I can't really help or answer you truly. I'm only on PC and my above post was purely made on subjective observations.
---
Right? I made a post about soloing a silo then getting dropped on the final phasea week or two ago. Now im gunshy about doing any silo at times where people are most active because that a lot of hard work and resources thatll take me days to stock back up to. 
---
No fix on auto grenade launcher counting as a heavy weapons for bear arms to apply its weight reduction and no fix on barbarian max rank displaying or giving out its proper max 80 DR. Feelsbad
---
Junior,  please help PSN RaidenXS
---
Crap I'll have to go back and get all those fusion cores I dropped 
---
Not sure what you mean. 
---
Time to get all my stored bobby pins back from my mule.
---
Can’t wait until console patch next week! Then the hunt for the hunting rifle begins..
---
No kidding right?  It is like they want us to forget they reduced their rate of generation.  Now if they revert the ammo production rate reduction then maybe, just maybe, some workshops would start to be worth it again.
---
Which part is about the duplication bugs? 
---
If you are lucky you will received a "Perfectly Preserved Pie" which you can be very proud of
---
We understand how farming works 
---
Is there an in-game way to tell?
---
I hope you get them soon!  They really need to address the store problems as well as those in their games.
---
Same, most of the time its armor I'll never use, or vats crits heavy weapons heh
---
hey man we are all trying to enjoy these patch notes, dont be a buzz kill lol. Legendary hunting rifles are now a thing tons of bugs fixed, bobby pins weigh less. Its a good day.
---
that is absolutely devastating! Things like that make the world so much richer
---
Reduced bobby pin weight is a straight up game changer. Gonna save so much room in my stash.
---
Fucking serious with the ballistic fiber? It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't literally harder for me to get than black titanium or whatever it was, can't remember off the top of my head.
---
You can join people who arent on your friendlist? How?
---
I never understood why bobby pins weighed so damn much. 
---
I love these changes, but strangely absent is a stash limit increase. Has there not been enough time to confirm that the servers survived the increase to 600? They promised they'd give us much more space in the future, and it's disappointing that did not come with this patch.
---
Like everything else Im sure, 000.0001% chance.  I still dont get crap, wait, all I do get is crap.   lol, time will tell.
---
Why do you presume this is the only time this has happened? 
---
Point is that there's a system that can pretty easily be accidentally triggered on a player without any warning through a number of ways. Picking up something you weren't aware was inside the workshop range, a grenade landing near a player structure and causing enough damage to activate a wanted level, lockpicking an owned container that has been locked by a player (Which is now a crime as of the patch just rolled out on PC today.) 
---
Actually, considering there are a number of locations you can build within premade structures, that last one could be a pretty easy way to turn the system into a low attention trolling tool. Just leave a locked container where it looks natural and wait for someone to lockpick it for the XP. 
---
If you take the Bend Tunnel (from near Lewisburg) it drops you off almost outside of Fort Defiance. Stay CLOSE but not on the railroad track into Watoga ... watch out for the Protectron Army.
---
Generally this area doesn't have SB in droves but it can have some higher level enemies at the one location between the Tunnel Exit and Watoga. 
---
Level 24 Assaultron's are all over the track area ... so watch out for them also.
---
Not sure if that is helpful or not without your level but that bypasses the passes and open areas. 
---
to see what mods you have learned for a specific weapon, you have to have that weapon in your inventory.
---
Tried for 10min, didn’t work
---
&gt; Systems: Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated.
---
That's probably good news?
---
&gt; General
---
So its ok for a level 1 to kill one ghoul and hit level 1000 and unlock everything?  It's just a balance that needs to be made.
---
I've said it before and Ill say it again. If the trade steal exploit was real, we would have video evidence of it. PS4 and Xbox both have video capture programs built in, and they aren't hard to find on PC. Yet no one has footage of this happening normally, and no one has footage of them reproducing this exploit with a friend or something.
---
Does this also affect SB blasts ?
---
What fucking part of "doesnt consent to trade" do you morons not understand?
---
It wouldn't. But then I'm not asking you to provide a list of games you've worked on.
---
I'd take the source code on an upcoming AAA title as proof though :D
---
They should really make it so that a hazmat suit goes on either over or under your regular armor, so that it's a more viable alternative to power armor in a nuke zone. 
---
I just imagine that they're crossposting from r/Fallout.
---
Not to be a Debby Downer, but most of the balance changes are small nerfs with no buffs to things we have been asking for since beta.
---
Yeah if you already bought all your legendaries off a duper
---
You’re on the queue 
---
I've soloed through big bend tunnel a few times. It was slow but fun. Is ther some event that spawns there that makes it more lucrative?
---
Well my console brother and sisters we have one week to farm glowing ones!
---
Hit Whitesprings again! Hit Whitesprings again!
---
Not to rain on the parade, but that note didn't read to me as "Fixed all duplication bugs known and unknown". Its a step in the right direction, sure, but I'd not hold my breath for that being the last dupe method we see :(
---
I think it just means legendary weightless armors fitted with Ultra Light mod wont be zero weight or negative weight.
---
Yeah I think it's bad but it may be more accurate to say that TSE is too powerful and everything else is too weak by comparison. The fact the explosive affix affects each shotgun pellet giving it an AOE explosive affect makes it the best all-round weapon in the game and you don't even have to hit an opponent directly. Most other weapons with max perks/mods and even ideal legendary affects will pale incomparison, like pretty much every energy weapon and most heavy weapons.  
---
TSE needs to be toned down for sure but most importantly I think many other weapons and affixes need to be toned up. If these other weapons/builds can't be as viable then people won't want to play them and it will hurt the overall variety in the game. It's not a problem that will be fixed by "taking something away" there is a lot they will need to add.
---
I could support that.  Even my trade mule alt is only at 3.5k.Bbulked resources, explosives, ammo, Stims.. maybe 20 weapons/armor.
---
I kill myself way more than anything else
---
&gt; Do you think this is going to become a staple perk for anyone wanting to pvp?
---
it's a discussion and I answered OP's question
---
Later this month is the patch that will have many of the player requests.
---
Slowing the spawn rate in a nuke zone sounds awful to me. I've gone in and looked around for what felt like tens of minutes for any enemies that hadn't been immediately wiped by high level explosive gank squads. Literally seen folk gathered in front of the golf club at the Whitesprings chatting and waiting for minutes on the respawns. 
---
It's still going to be the fastest way to farm xp.  this wont change anything except for how fast players gain levels.
---
Well they are common in market now if u spent those 12hrs farming caps you coulda bought one lol 
---
God I hope
---
Gotcha. Yes. Or just make a low level version of it, and then see what mods you have. 
---
Can learn mods from making and scraping weapons and armor. It just takes a lot of resources. Seems mods have different chances to learn. Some are easy others are harder. 
---
Wouldn't it be nice?
---
Those are considered energy attacks, I think.
---
Yeah I will stick to my gauss rifle that can shoot a cow shaped hole through a barn.
---
Likely to mean "Ballistic Fiber" and not a new material.
---
If they ever let drills or chainsaws have a weapon typing, that'd be nice. 
---
It might be, but it might also be all sorts of fucked up like most things in the game. I've played a shit ton but I go between two characters so my highest level is 44, lowest is 30. You found six whole sets, while I only found a partial set of raider armor per character between levels 5 and 20 and I've never seen it again. 
---
I agree.  Plus with my perks, they are helpful buggers as they heal the heck outta me with each slap...so it felt kinda bad getting massive XP from such a helpful mob.
---
&gt; **​Godrays still going through geometry:**  ​Sunrays still occasionally appear through plain ground (mountain  slopes) or building walls. Didn't seem to be an issue in Fallout 4. What  gives? 
---
I can explain this one, well I can explain why it happens in F76 and not F4. They revamped the terrain system, its now rendered via tessellation, and what I suspect is that there are cracks in the terrain further out due to whatever tessellation equation they are using, and thats how the sunrays are sneaking thru (at least on the terrain, not regular meshes)
---
&gt; 1st no fix for the duping glitch
---
- Systems: Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated.
---
Well if they nerf everything the buffs aren't needed right? 
---
Damn you're right tho D; MY LIFE IS A LIE
---
One mans junk amirite?
---
I bought a 2shot boublebarrel in watoga once.
---
I love the 2nd idea :0
---
Rare, I hope, not well done with Ketchup.
---
I know the mods exist for the DBS; for some reason I never get them when scrapping. The chance must be extremely low.
---
This is a good thing.
---
PVE builds should be weak in PvP. You should need a specialized loadout for PvP. So is this a max 45% resist (3Star)?  Im fine TSE meta so long as there is something that works well against it.
---
It will depend on whether the smoke is black or white.
---
I think u get access, but can only play on a PC (iirc), regardless of what system you play on.
---
&gt; You can do it manually yeah, but it's far more labor intensive.
---
Bethesda literally brought that on themselves. If they have to pay some database admins overtime to do basic customer support... Well it's time to step up and take responsibility.
---
No, just a lot of scorch. They have low damage resistance and basic weapons. It’s just really efficient and more manageable than other options like monster mash or whitesprings
---
Wrong flair -- you should be Enclave.
---
She sounds like an idiot 
---
I am tho :0 lets see what happens when i wake up in 2 hours
---
Yeah, well, Reddit karma is even more meaningless and look how people treat it. Clearly higher level players have genitalia of a more preferable size compared to lower level players.
---
The only legendaries I have are a 1-star executioner's lever action, and a junkie's handmade which I kept only so that I dont accidentally scrap it. I never trade with other players.
---
What is this mule you refer to? Do we have another storage option besides the stash?
---
pass the butter
---
Nuke silo quest- 100 caps
---
Scorched queen event- 200 caps
---
Getting your caps back and some loot and exp along the way- priceless
---
They nerf the XP, but they really need to buff nuke zones in general. You want players to launch nukes, so you need to give proper incentive to do as such. 
---
Well the servers are still down, so...
---
Double shot and/or explosive is going to be excellent. 
---
They've done quite a bit more than what you've described. Just because they don't immediately address your specific concerns does not mean they aren't working on it. Have some patience, please. 
---
What part of "I think you're a liar and you have no proof" does your dumbass not understand?
---
I also don't believe your "wife" lost anything. 1) I don't think she exists 2) If she does, then she most likely gave it away or scrapped it without realizing it through the means I already explained.
---
That's the most obvious answer, because there's absolutely no evidence that trade stealing was ever real...unless you've got something you'd like to share?
---
Wasn't it Sherman that burned the South? 
---
more like multiplemessagesbot
---
Fingers crossed.  Right now I just feel like I'm showing off every time I need to get into my power armour.  "Look at how many I have!"
---
Yeah the economy is quite inflated to a point where 5000 does not make sense for a 1 off trade and 25k cap doesn't really make sense either.
---
A lot of great fixes! But still no buff for energy weapons durability :(
---
Thankfully, getting caps was never an issue.
---
Probably my favorite song on the play list.
---
However there is another patch coming the week after, I presume this is where this person has gotten confused. 
---
That'd be a really poor way to do it. People legitimately store crap on their alts for that or more.
---
If you check how the recent dup works, you may think "how the hell they found that exploit in first place". I think some people may have access to the game's code or something.
---
Fair enough, the amount of time spent reloading does suck. 
---
Hunting Rifle. It's a Left handed Bolt action Rifle (To be used from the left shoulder), that's being used in the Right shoulder. Bolt action rifles can be operated when remaining in the shoulder. And not as shown, in game.
---
I know, I just dropped 17 of them last night :P
---
Looks like a badger, what with the white helmet and black eyes. 
---
I dont usualy post a lot, but im glad i did it now. Its cool to read all the diferrent interpretations of the same image.
---
Without all the lvl 150 players running around the area all the time, maybe now I can get my level 20 in there to finish some quests.
---
Who are the people buying this stuff though? Wouldn’t they rather just play the game too? Plus I thought this game was supposed to be terrible with everyone demanding refunds. Now there is some huge eBay market for in game items. Something isn’t adding up. 
---
Should be easy enough to track at least.  If you see a bunch of duped Legendary hunting rifles, you know there's another exploit.
---
Click buy now, the screen updates with "install" no extra charges.. just UI weirdness.
---
It is not in there because there has been no video evidence of it. No one seems to be able to replicate it and report it. Therefore it is just like the trade theft thing it was a rumor that got out of hand.  And the BETA first two week mod bug where it was scrapping and/or just random disappearing  was fixed in the Dec 4th patch.   
---
Want it fixed supply video to Bethesda support. 
---
i am completely on board. it was not really workingasintended. i could get 3+ levels in a single run
---
we need though more mobs and stuff inside nuke zones
---
Fixed
---
It has a very small chance of giving you perfectly preserved pie. 
---
then maybe don't attack a squad of players alone? makes sense to me, dude. 
---
Assassin armor is easily one shotted with TSE shotgun. I can bet that even with the Fireproof one shots will be possible. I can't wait to test it though.
---
How long beduped the next dorfing found is method, you think?
---
damn... fucked it up
---
haha, the only person to have ever benefitted from that bug :P
---
If this works, halle-fucking-lujah
---
Just check his youtube. 
---
At least I have skin you damned zombie
---
For real, I have contemplated going for the ammo factory for more 5.56 ammo but I know that it's just not worth the return investment from having to defend it so much because it takes forever to get a good amount of ammo
---
For me, I had to go into the Game tab, and then sort by Classic. Then downloaded each individually.
---
PSA there is an issue of Backwoodsmen that reduces the cost of moving CAMPS. Just thought that could be useful info for someone. 
---
Many fixes and none mess up my critical-centric build. Excellent.
---
I'll take a few definitely speed demon not sure what others yet I won't be on for a couple of hours GT: mcphail818
---
There is a house full of mounted creatures. In toxic valley.
---
Always wanted to a stealth sniper as .308 is probably the most if not one of the most readily available ammo
---
I've had a similar bug happen to me before, but never for this long.
---
It hasn't happened often enough for me to confirm if this actually fixes it, but last time I got it to work I switched my journal off the tab the glitched quest was in and relogged. 
---
Hope you get this sorted out!
---
Geez people. That's really a huge patch with a lot of the stuff patched that we have been complaining about and it's still not enough?
---
I understnad that you want ALL THE THINGS immediately, but the servers are not even bakc up yet and the complaining already tarted again.
---
Being in power armor and using an explosive gatling gun I would injure and even kill myself with it, now hopefully less so.
---
I can’t hear you over my constant marsupial jumping and AoE explosions upon melee strike
---
What the fuck did I just masturbate to?
---
If you aren’t confident with your pvp tactics then don’t engage...
---
&gt; Weapons: M79 Grenade Launcher is now considered an explosive weapon in perks instead of being incorrectly considered a shotgun.
---
This is good, but you guys also need to fix the Auto grenade Launcher - the last patch removed it being affected by heavy perks when the wording seemed to imply you only wanted heavy weapon damage perks to not affect it. I was kinda hoping you’d include it with a fix for the M79.
---
There will always be people that dedicate all of their time to exploiting a games mechanics and coding. Not much you can do except make sure there are no exploits worth going after if any at all
---
I believe its a combo of what your level is and how many objects are within your camp, mine is a static 40 caps at level 208.
---
If you move it too often in a short amount of time it tends to quadruple the cost for some reason, this could be a bug.
---
Yeah it's annoying.  Just remember to scrap the wire before removing items it was attached to.  That should help avoid it as best you can until they can address it.
---
How much does dense reduce explosions by?
---
if they tweak the RNG better and eliminate the rarity to an extend you wont find it even after 500 server logins it would be sufficient..
---
provided they remove the max-level cap on plans for showing up at vendors as well..
---
they dont have to make an all out list on every vendor, that would suck hard as well to be honest.
---
i do like a small random factor, but right now the RNG is obviously not working as intended, on top of a stupid "feature" that has a maximum level on a plan/recipe for it to show up to the player.
---
TLDR:
---
Dont make an complete catalogue at every vendor, this would ruin gameplay imho.
---
Instead;
---
\- improve RNG and eliminate level cap from plans/recipes
---
\- increase items visible to each vendor (expand pool too). (some only show 1 or 2 plans where other times the same ones show 15)
---
&gt; no fix for scrapping mods while fixing/crafting   
---
That is rather impressive.
---
Bethesda says; 
---
Teams: Teamed players can no longer unfairly block an attacking player when that player attempts to overtake a workshop. Your teammate will enter PVP with the attacking player.
---
Turrets: Turrets at Workshops will now attack players the Workshop owner is engaged in PvP with.
---
This hopefully should improve camps as well. Just lock stuff down and throw turrets everywhere.
---
The second idea is good. The first one not so much.
---
I'm not sure how the duplication glitch worked that they fixed, but I just accidentally discovered a method last night that involved something as simple as moving my camp. It was repeatable, which I only did to see if it was a fluke or a real glitch.
---
It duplicated my entire camp 2x and then 4x, which really sucked more than anything because I did NOT need 48 foundation pieces, 4 windchimes, 4 lamps, etc etc.
---
I hope this is fixed as well.
---
Where's the fun in that? 
---
I like to offer some balance to people playing in groups; there's no fun in attacking one player minding their business!

&gt;     Fallout 76 2 Shot Explosive Gauss Riffle Ps4
---
"sponsored items"?  People are paying to get their listings higher up?
---
YAY now my quad lever action won’t take 20 years to load 
---
Wait you are telling me my rifle perks never worked on gauss rifle?
---
or just keep an eye out on youtube for videos titled NEW DUPE GLITCH 2019 FO76 POST PATCH SUB LIKE LOOK AT MY PATREON
---
The Beach Boys were pretty divisive even back in their day, no matter how much Oldies stations try to retcon that.
---
I think explosive is getting a de-buff but Instigating + Double Shot + Sneak Bonus = &lt;3
---
Are they gonna implement this in FO:4 as well, I wonder.
---
I imagine the first few TSE hunting rifles will have their pick of the duper stashes.
---
You mean like power armor and weapon paints? When you go to the appropriate crafting bench, you can select the tricentennial paint for whichever item you're modding. For weapons, though, it only applies to the 10mm pistol, laser rifle, and hatchet I believe.
---
If you meant the costumes, like the big bobble head hat or the coat, you craft those from an armor bench.
---
If you visit the atom shop, each of those items will be visible to you in its respective category, each with either a checkmark or the word "owned" beneath it. 
---
Sounds like it's just the XP that was nerfed, so I'm betting a lot of people will still want to nuke-farm Whitesprings for legendary drops, if only because of the size of the enemy groups that spawn there, and familiarity.
---
A. Your name gives me the heebee jeebies.
---
B. You can trade with a friend, switch characters and trade again. Allowing you to have a massive storage increase.
---
I think that is definitely an easy way to track it. I am just crossing my fingers that this is totally patched up and another exploit isn't found.
---
Still waiting on the fix for my gatling laser displaying the number of total cores carried as the charge of my current core
---
Phew... Thankfully i reqched level 100 and platinum before the glowing one nerf
---
Exactly my thinking. It seems hunting rifle has no place in meta. I have one in my inventory with recon scope, just for "Distant Thunder" event. Even if that event drop no good, I just like enjoy watching enemy get blasted away with artillery. 
---
You were able to load in to the game and test it?
---
Hopefully it stacks with dense armor so I can stop FALLING IN THOSE DANG CRANBERRY VALLEYS AND KILLING MYSELF IN QUEEN FIGHTS!
---
Did you find a fix for this?
---
I'm sas about this aswell haha!
---
I am a super new player and accidentally came across a nuke zone at a super low level, came across a glowing one in whitesprings (i think its called?) Shot it once in a panic and then an army of Mr. Handy and assualtrons obliterated it giving me 700xp and leveling me up immediately whilst I ran away. 
---
Sad I won't be able to actually kill them and get that much xp when I am a higher level 
---
A useful couple of hours quest experience, well within the capability of existing CK quest mod authors. Unfortunately not repeatable for the hundreds of hours needed to keep engagement and avoid churn.
---
Hey yo, whats the method to find all plans in a single location?  
---
Can I join your community?
---
Yeah I wish I could find a good place to constantly fight medium-difficulty opponents like scorched. Most places with scorched seem all spread out and slow with low numbers of enemies. I wish there were a place like dyer chemical or west tek or etc with tons of enemies, but scorched. Ah well. :)
---
It's not $20 silly... it's 20,000 atoms. It's obviously completely different and fun! 
---
 It's a good patch but who wouldn't trade it all just to see what plans they have already learned? 
---
Say its ONLY PC today....
---
"  fixed the fusion core production rate "
---
nice.. but they fixed thr auto recharge core "feature" if u relog in power armor..
---
&gt;Fusion cores no longer reset when changing worlds
---
RIP
---
&gt;Fusion Generators now make 8/hour 
---
Noice
---
They are probably using a nosql database! It scales! It's eventually consistent! There is no schema! Lol (there are honestly good uses for nosql databases, but I like poking fun)
---
What’s that about the Gauss Rifle not being considered a rifle? The rifleman perks did seem to have an effect on the damage.
---
You’re right. My bad. 
---
You're greatly over exaggerating the amount of time that it takes to level. Or your running around in the forest. 
---
Please allow for a dead zone slide for consoles. I am begging you a. I’m using an old tv and no tv or Xbox setting can change this. I’ve had the tv for over 5 years. Please add some sort of a margin slider. I can’t see how much a new camp cost or any of my icons under my health. I love this game but this kinda sucks. 
---
Relevant user name.
---
It isn't like they announced it yesterday, right?
---
66%
---
Honestly I'd be happy with double shot if not only for ammo conservation. 
---
 decreased to repair but added ballistic fiber to craft.  
---
&gt;No word of mods being scrapped though
---
It is not in there because there has been no video evidence of it. No one seems to be able to replicate it and report it. Therefore it is just like the trade theft thing it was a rumor that got out of hand. And the BETA first two week mod bug where it was scrapping and/or just random disappearing was fixed in the Dec 4th patch.
---
Want it fixed supply video to Bethesda support.
---
They would look like that Gremlin from Gremlins two. 
---
per other peoples posts and the dense mod helping reduce the damage, they are explosive attacks.
---
The bright headlamps will now function as assaultron beam weapons, as intended.
---
So you have plenty of stuff left to do then.. i'm in the same boat.  I'll still farm ghouls for good gear/weapons.
---
yeah this and there are a couple of other spots with info like the holding cells area
---
The way they worded it it looks like all of them
---
Definitely a huge step in the right direction but I cant help but to be curious as to how all the duped items are going to be curved. These people have thousands of items and TSE weapons that will have them in the market for a very very long time. If duping is completely gone then fantastic but I wonder if the damage is already done and irreversible
---
God I hope so. 
---
Win some, lose some.   
---
But, I AM SO HYPE ABOUT THE RIFLES. 
---
Is it still a dumpster fire?
---
In a thread about patch notes, complaining about stuff that wasn’t patched just makes you look like a jerk.
---
Great stuff BUT I'm waiting for them to take a hard stance on people who have continued to exploit and ruin the game for others. Sadly it's dampened my interest and stopped me from playing. These people are crashing servers and cusijg lag for others. Unless they come down hard on these people the game will continue to suffer.
---
Oh yeah that's where I got the idea from. I mean I knew I'd seen if before but I couldn't remember from where. Were they the ones with the animals maybe?
---
You know shit like this happens to EVERY single MMO out there right? 
---
Only downside is the vendors still have a cap limit.
---
Hmmm... Then how about a fix for mods randomly disappearing from my stash then because they sure as hell went somewhere and it wasn't on any gun or armor. 
---
Ok.... so carry 2 weapons or 3 at max. You dont need armor while in power armor it just adds weight.
---
 That's where most of your weight is at. 
---
And for junk. Have 100 of each or 200 of the more used stuff like adhesive and balistic fiber. And however much of the rare stuff you want like the screws and springs. Just sell or toss out everything else. 
---
But people like fun stuff you know :P
---
Wander if any of the duper got an inventory surprise TBH. Bet it still going to take month before the economy settles.
---
Saaaaame, I was hoping they would have brought it back from New Vegas, it's my favorite gun ever in a Fallout game, followed by Hunting Rifle, then Brush Gun/Lever Action
---
This is relevant to mah interests.
---
Just run from the train station through and around Watoga. I only kill the legendary bots. 
---
Excellent fixes! Can only hope Alien Blaster pistol, Laser guns, and Plasma guns get the change in damage and durability. Alien Blaster pistol still shows in the loading screen as being labelled a powerful weapon capable of disintegrating enemies despite it having such a terrible damage output. Either fix the damage on the weapon or remove that line of text.
---
Absolutely agree 100%.
---
There are plenty of examples with dupers. Diablo 2 for example.
---
i did not know that thank you
---
Ultracite Gatling Lasers also have yet to be seen in legendary quality.
---
It seems as though they’ve corrected a fair amount in this patch. It’s a good continuation of what needs to be done. They’ll get there. 
---
True, can't really say no to the additional projectile. It does mess with your VATS tho. Also, hunting rifle is one of the most versatile as you can change the receiver to use different ammo types (.38/.50). 
---
I mean I think the answer is the harpoon gun 
---
We will see.  The TSE market flood was starting to Peter out, but now they have every plan in game.  I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t tempted by that atom cats paint.  Hopefully the vendor plans in the next patch curb that by flooding out where everyone can get them and ruining their stock values.
---
And if not pay for adequate server infrastructure
---
I see that now, the post is actively being edited and added to, and this section was there at first
---
it now makes the wording about "an exploit" seem very strange though
---
&gt; Bobby Pins: Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001.
---
&gt; Finally they weigh the same as they do in real life.
---
If only that would apply to weapons. No way a rifle weighs 20 pounds. My M16 in the army weighed approx. 8 pounds. 
---
It’s not too late, mate. Now they can introduce 4 and 5* legendaries if they indeed fixed the duping glitch
---
Only if they've fixed duping.
---
It isn't uncommon for 1-unit items to be considered more expensive than their vendor prices in MMOs. Would need a community-wide drive though, not gonna happen automatically.
---
Try harpers ferry. I actually dropped the other night and was already tired so I called it a night....but seems like it'll be good. Next drop for sure.
---
THIS ISNT IMMERSIVE! Where are npcs in post nuke area?!?!? Whaaaaaaaaaaa
---
Caaaatt
---
Why, was it a more-out-then-in situation?
---
So, does that mean fusion core ***GENERATORS*** (aka [these things](https://cdn2-www.gamerevolution.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-fusion-cores.jpg)) or fusion core ***PROCESSORS*** (meaning [these things](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/6/64/Fusion_core_processor.png/revision/latest?cb=20181205192106) you can power up at nuclear facilities workshops)? Because I didn't realize generators could spit out fusion cores at a constant rate.
---
Even if duping didn't existed in fo76 either way you would see RMT but prices would be high for longer period.
---
I kind of like this mechanic. This way if you constantly seek revenge you have to run the numbers. If I’m 250 and I’m fighting a level 150, that means in order for me to keep the engagement net positive in caps I have to kill him 1.67 times more than he kills me. 
---
Yip, agreed 
---
We need to have a unique item limit.. not a weight limit.
---
Let me stockpile resources, damnit.
---
To be fair, it's not like the artists of the 1960s didn't live through the 1950s.  I think it's fair to say that the inertia continued for a little while, instead of having a hard cut-off point.  The Atomic Age coming to fruition doesn't preclude the Beach Boys forming a band.
---
Wow...that is a long list. They've been busy.
---
Crafting has duplicate fixes listed.
---
Tell me about it. And games like Guild Wars 2 have the ability to purchase gold built into the game! You can do it legit there
---
It's good to see all the changes and fixes.
---
Too bad I didn't get to enjoy the nuked golf course for too long before the experience change on the bloated ones.
---
Keep those fixes coming Bethesda    :) 
---
Wasn't top of the world a thing before Whitesprings? Maybe try that out again.
---
And it’s a lot better quality voice acting than what’s in the other games because they had less to do overall. The tutorial stuff is still lame because well it’s a tutorial but after that it’s pretty great. 
---
Just write an essay.  Is that so hard?
---
Mirelurk Eggs: Harvesting Mirelurk Eggs will not result in two separate eggs.
---
As someone who loves making pumpkin pie, I must say thank fuck.
---
On a side note, anyone know a good place to get mirelurk eggs without having to contend with a mirelurk queen?
---
Well that certainly explains why I have so damn many cores.  They rarely ever get used up.
---
I'm sure the .50 cal receiver will receive a buff somewhere down the road, making it more of a contender. Either way, something about a bolt action gives me the tingles, it's pretty much all I use in most shooters.
---
That would explain why bulk acid weighed more than the raw acid though.
---
Ya, I'm hoping they got it for real this time. The server disconnects are by far my biggest issue with the game, and this was the biggest cause of it.
---
and here i had already gotten used to carrying around only 5-10 bobby pins..
---
You're not wrong about the stupid.
---
I just cant compete with 2-shot exploding shotties yet. Only explosive shit I've seen is .45 autos...
---
I look like a big, yellow school bus, TYVM. 
---
A first thing to do is make sure all scrap is scrapped (bottles require manual scrapping sometimes) and only bulk certain junk; lead, aluminum, fertilizer, copper, gears, oil, springs and cork. The rest of the junk weighs more bulked. I would encourage the bandolier perk to reduce ballistic ammo weight and only carrying weapons you regularly use, and the last major thing is check your misc tab, I found myself unintentionally carrying 800 gun powder. 
---
Yea fingers crossed🤞🏼 this patch is looking soo promising. But I thought the gauss did ballistic damage?
---
I wore it from level 15 to 25 when I finally got excavator.
---
I'm so excited for it. Cant wait to get my old 2 shot sniper back from fallout 4
---
OK second try, I missed one of the fixes and noticed another one that isn't fixed lol
---
1st; no nerf or removal for the Two Shot Explosives that are basically everywhere and have turn PvP into basically playing Golden Eye where everyone has the Golden gun and we all die in one shot regardless of armor, lvl, SPECIAL or Perks. 
---
2nd; No enemy fix for the Scorchbeasts,with them basically being the most underwhelming and useless endgame bosses in existence. With their innate ability to find you from hundreds of meters away, while hiding and spam attacking you so you can't fight back, Idk how they haven't been fixed yet. 
---
3rd; You fixed enemies in Workshops from spawning under the workshops but haven't fixed them spawning inside your workshop??? This was a problem in FO4 that made putting up walls/fences essentially useless as the enemy could/would just spawn inside your settlement. Half the time when I respond to my workshop being attacked I find all my crafting benches have been destroyed and my generator eaten cause some molerats or radrats have spawned inside my camp, and of course the turrets don't actually shot anything so they are basically useless too. Oh and seriously have attacks on my workshop be something actually threatening, like super mutants, deathclaws, not rats and bugs. 
---
4th; you fixed a bunch of perks but you left Barbarian out of the fixes, it doesn't/won't work with Class Freak, this has been known and talked about for sometime on Reddit. 
---
5th; Some Daily quest were fixed but still nothing for "Heart of the Enemy" nobody has been able to do it past the first time, its classified under Daily Quests yet we can't redo it at all.
---
6th; Fixing the robots at the Whitesprings is great but how about fixing the Ghouls at the Golf Club too, there are at least 15+ that spawn out of that place every couple of minutes, and this started happening at the same time the robots started duplicating. 
---
The fusion core generator is an item you can build in your camp.
---
The fusion core extractor is the one present at the power stations.
---
It's two different things.
---
What about mods being scrapped?
---
Just as Metroids\_inSpace mentioned: you gonna make a joice what you wanna achive with your armor. Heavy Robot Armor seems to have pretty nice stats overall but it weights a lot more. Then again there's a chance (i guess) you get a legendary one that rolls "90% less weight". :D
---
i think they mean the ones found in the world - like maybe we won't be finding a ton of them everyday
---
Tse flare gun just seems like it should logically exist.... Ijs
---
I don't see anything regarding level caps for crafting plans or mods being removed from scrap all.
---
See recursion.
---
I've never had less fun in a Fallout game than fighting a Scorchbeast, which is just a reskinned Skyrim dragon with unbalanced ranged attacks and the ability to spawn minions.
---
They also need a damage upgrade.
---
Once you get legendary armor, you won't be concerned with the repair-vs-recreate dilemma anyway.
---
Yea. It kinda sad that only dangerous thing is your own gun, but then again it kinda cool that you actually have to watch out for it.
---
What if GIANT CAZADORES instead?
---
I’m hoping it just kinda happens in a shadow patch.
---
I casually farmed Drop Site C2 for a week or so and found plans for the marine wetsuit, the black (officer) BoS suit, and various marine armor pieces -- possibly using the same list as the stagecoach in Watoga.
---
We don't need a full wipe. Scraping everyone's inventory to STASH would be a good middle ground.
---
HOW DARE BETHESDA EMPLOYEES GO HOME TO EAT AND SLEEP AND BE WITH FAMILIES!!!!
---
So.....
---
-mods still auto-scrap
---
-we aren't getting a stash limit increase
---
-dupers get to keep all their duped shit with no consequences
---
-SBQ still drops garbage
---
-still no way to tell what plans you already own
---
-and legendary item stars still don't correlate at all with the enemy's stars...
---
But hey, our headlamps are a little brighter and bobby pins weigh less, so yaaay!! 😐
---
The FEV virus caused most of the mutations in animals and such due to experiments by west tek, if you go into the West tek research center you can read more about it.
---
bobby pins 
---
Well you can already dupe nuka-cola and drink for caps.. 
---
So you can see the mechanism, its more "interesting" for the viewer. 
---
I didn't. [Here's](https://youtu.be/gr6p6L4Z17Q) a video of me doing 333-&gt;334 in around an hour (after the exploit was already patched). The level was solo, 5 INT only and no Nuke-zone - so far from optimal.
---
I'm over 600 hours total in, what level should I be if levels are taking me an hour each?
---
Cooler to look at, essentially.
---
It's a minigame. I call it Power Armor roulette.
---
I'd be fine with it 5 out of 7 days... less if we get rid of those level up 5 times doing X weeklies every single week... I'd be fine with that too.
---
These are issues in EVERY pvp game, EVERY GAME that has pvp has this problem. 
---
the issue is not the broken mechanic its the assholes that abuse the broken mechanics like teaming with lower level players or hiding in other players houses to flag the bounty hunters for pvp, which gets them ganked. 
---
Normal players that enjoy pvp can flat out call griefing, ganking and general unsportsmanlike conduct.  
---
I take the ammo factory, Grafton steel, Charleston and lakeside cabins to get the ammo, steel and lead. Makes a few thousand in a couple hours pfnplay
---
two shot explosive
---
Big bend tunnel has a really high density. That and if you just outfit with a full set of 1 Star legendary armor with zealot you take so little damage that you can sprint through the whole thing to get the mob on top of you so you don’t have to play the cat and mouse game
---
Hopefully it keeps the little brats who just server hop to farm XP from glowing ones out of circulation. They just buy a TSE, and go around killing ghouls with no regard to others who might want to get their hits in. Just to farm for XP... 
---
I think it took 4 or 5 tries to finally see it up there for me. Since Watoga has two vendors and one of if not the best legendary farm location I assume all power armor spots are also on constant farm.
---
Just need to fix serums not working with carnivore / Herbivore mutations and I'm happy 😊 
---
I seen him!
---
This is kinda good imo.  I never really went there for the XP... in fact, I was level 80 before I even started going to whitesprings nuke zones.  But, now it won't be full of level 20s in hazmat suits jumping in front of explosive rounds when they are mad they aren't able to leech XP off others.
---
This would be more pleasing if they had also said weapon/armor mods would no longer scrap when you run out of components.
---
Probably not a fix, but check your Xbox Privacy/settings. You might have it so you can only "play" with friends.
---
RIP Whitesprings nuke zones 2018-2019
---
https://youtu.be/oOwXwB5wf5w
---
Lol really? 
---
I only carry 6. 
---
I think so
---
of course, along with the glowing one fix, it's now a "we want you to fix every bug now!!!....NOT THAT BUG!!!!" situation.
---
I don’t think they will mess with TSE to be honest.  It is definitely king but replacing it would just cause a shift.  I think if it went away the shift would go to Anti armor/+50% limb damage.  That would just mean you aimed off center mass to get high damage.  Debuffs will just cause a new meta to rise.
---
You're in luck - today's PC update (next week for consoles) is fixing this issue!
---
Right for sure.. it'll be nice though on a rainy day to be able to empty the vendors 1400 caps with just bobby pins
---
I'm reading it as a lower chance to find fusion cores in the generators you find all over the map, but a faster production rate for the Workshop Extractors you can craft that produce them at the nuclear power plants.
---
I do the same thing but the xp doesnt seem so fast. 5 bullets per robot. About the same as super mutants. I'll give it another look. Thanks!
---
Player vendors is gonna be a pretty big change, so I don't expect that this month for sure.
---
Watoga is kinda boring
---
But you do lose the time spent on the full reload animation.
---
Funniest thing is they come all the way from Hate city just always spilling the same pointless crap that they've gathered around from Youtubers (c) and trendy "videogames articles", I'd bet 75% of them ain't even playing this game, and yet if somebody tries to defend the game they go like "LOL U DUMB FUNBoY AhaaH!111!!1"... Hilarious, or depressing?
---
&gt;Systems: Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated.
---
If this actually works, we can finally start forming an economy lmao
---
Yw!
---
Unless you know anything about guns. Then it enrages you constantly.
---
patch next week is this very same patch, its just being delayed for consoles so it can be tested on pc first
---
we wont get anything new here unless its atom shop stuff
---
Yeah for sure.  I'll reserve judgement though.  They hadn't managed to fully patch it so far.  I suspect forming an economy will require that as a first step.  Then some inflation.  Then some gear power creep.  Once vanilla gear is obsolete and sufficient inflation occurs it should be OK.  I am not an economist though =/
---
The Atom Shop description leads you to believe it covers all PA, so I was disappointed to find it doesn't.
---
My Character is a Stealth/Sniper Build, so regardless of which PA I'm using, I want a Camo Paint Job, and we should also be able to choose which Pattern/Color, regardless of the PA type.
---
But when crafting you'll need it now. 
---
It used to cost 10 acid to make and yield 15 acid
---
Left and right arms and legs have commonly had different values in Fallout. Makes sense when the armor looks different but it also happens to armor where both sides look the same.
---
I just run the hotel non nuked. I get less legendaries but I do get a few better ones than in a nuked zone. In non nuked WS a three star usually drops a three star weapon. And there's no one around to shoot all the ghouls before I get to them
---
I actually suggested this the other day to my wife.  The idea was to collect them as holotape singles and put them into a jukebox/holotape player.  As a further, albeit much less likely idea, have a small shortwave radio station we can broadcast to share our album with others or ourselves while questing!
---
Yeah, marine tactical is the wetsuit mask. Have the helm, but no plans. I’ve read that marine combat (the helm) exists, but that may be a myth.
---
No one would ever put fixed all dup bugs known and unknown.  If they don't know of a bug then it would be hard to fix that.  I hope that it fixes most other possible dup bugs.  It is a step in the right direction!
---
They're doing the lords work!
---
Same here, this and the queen fight are really the only causes of my disconnects. However I do get a rare crash here and there but it is becoming far and few in-between which is good news. Still hoping for continued general improvements to stability to the game and servers regardless if most issues are addressed as the game moves forward.
---
yeah, i did one run around the normal whitespring (no nuke) and got 5-6 legendaries including a berserker’s fat man. most ghouls arent even labeled as legendary but still drop that stuff more than anywhere else
---
I already uninstalled after reading these latest patch notes. Fuck this grind.
---
guass rifle is still a better option to kill enemies mine does like 719 damage and has exsplosive anti armour and provides 250 percent extra damage resistance when reloading 
---
Also, regarding the changes to the Fireproof perk: that is gonna wreck the effectiveness of non-legendary explosive weapons such as missile launchers and grenade launchers in PvP. I assume this change was in response to the spam of so many two shot explosive legendary weapons flooding the game right now. Please understand the issue there is with the legendary effect, and doing this to that perk is going to risk making normal explosive weapons useless in PvP. 
---
Cool, but why are the console patches always so much larger?
---
Yeah, it boggled my mind that they didn't really just copy and paste their behaviors. It'd fix like 90% of their issues.
---
But why don't bunk beds work? :\[
---
Actually I got the double ammo capacity one and it was pretty sweet. 
---
It's almost like they couldn't figure out fixes for those yet, but fuck them, right?
---
If you find a 3* explosive I will offer you my first born son. And maybe even the second born as well..
---
Track lighting comes in the assorted lighting plans which can be found at train stations.

Get over yourself sunshine, if you won 1 million dollars you would complain it wasn't 2 million dollars.... 
---
Every laser gun I’ve tried has been pretty useless anyway. You must have a really good one if it even does any damage…
---
It's not listed so I'd assume it's still an issue.
---
Excavator armor was adding an ADDITIONAL 100 carry weight when you logged out / in while in it.. I think.  Something like that.  Got my carry weight over 500 at one point.. it was stupid.  That was with calibrated shocks.. obviously.
---
there should be a craftable grenade type that spawns a friendly liberator (with non-commie paint job) and requires robotics expert rank 3 
---
it's almost like they haven't figured out a fix yet...
---
&gt;Glowing Ones: Glowing Ones will no longer grant erroneous large amounts of XP. DevNote: Glowing Ones were granting Large Boss XP rewards, making them highly exploitable when combined with Nuke Zones**.**
---
And better Legendaries?
---
All I want is for bullet sponge enemies to not spawn on top of me in an enclosed space right afterI finish killing the first wave.
---
I think this would be a great idea, and if you find a certain amount if we could build an antenna on our camp, and we could broadcast them out as a playlist with other players being able to tune into it. Levelling it up could increase the range of it.
---
The troll doesn't wish to be trolled.  Got it!  
---
Keep checking pipboy and toggle the quests on/off.
---
Roses raider quests seemed really long.
---
They need to put some time into developing tools to monitor aspects of the game and let support run canned scripts to fix issues like that as many other multiplayer games have done.  Yeats ago in an mmo I found an item missing from my inventory, and opened a ticket. WIthin an hour I was contacted by support and told the logs said I scrapped the item (which I probably did and failed to recall that as I was sleep deprived from playing the game at the time), so I thanked them and apologized for wasting their time, and the kind support person put a duplicate of the item back into my inventory.  That was real customer service that I will not forget, above and beyond.  The game was Lord of the Rings Online.
---
Once you reach a certain level and have certain perks the ghouls do little damge. I can stand there while an entire pack whomps on me for some time. Not bragging just lettting you know that higher level players-- its not commesurate for them
---
Always appreciate an intelligent response. 🙄
---
I'd be happy with Toons that have over 1million of any item are account banned!
---
Yeah, gunpowder was getting me for a while. Also random missiles, mini nukes, and 79 grenades given as rewards. At least my 16 lbs of Bobby pins are now less than a pound.
---
Awww, no more super M79 from combining shotgun and explosive perks.  :(  
---
/s - glad they fixed that, it was fun but made no sense.
---
Ultra light mods are a life saver on armor. For weapons I carry a sniper, a revolver, a stun baton, and a legendary mini nuke launcher that takes off 90% of its weight. My armor is light and sturdy with ultra light as stated before. I only carry 5 stimpacks, 5 diluted rad-x, 5 purified water and 5 diluted radaway. Only 5 Bobby pins, and only the ammo I need for my two guns and 5 mininukes which ironically weigh 6 times more than the launcher. This allows me to run high level (62) at 80 pounds. I dont need food btw cause of cannabalism. It should also be mentioned that I'm heavily invested in stealth so the lack of chems and weapons can be justified by the fact I don't get hurt much, and I one shot everything.
---
Why the f is this downvoted without comment? I'm not provoking anyone and I'm not being a troll by asking moronic questions.
---
Nope, all power armour frames are identical, but you put different pieces of power armour on the frames at crafting stations.  Right now I've got a frame with my Excavator parts, a frame with my level 40 T45/60 parts, and a frame with my Ultracite parts that I can't actually use yet, but they all show up in my inventory as "Power Armor Frame", with no way to tell which is which until you place them down.
---
From the wording in the original article, it looks like we’re getting a second patch at the end of the month and the vendor updates are in that one.
---
Not yet but heavy weapons have been buffed
---
Imagine never being happy about content being added and always asking for more.
---
Real kicker is they don't recharge when you log out. Since I noticed this I've only had two cores for weeks. Ah well I'm on XBox so a few days to go scaving. 
---
Time do knock the dust off my hazmat suit
---
Everybody hears the same songs at the same time, so skipping a song is not possible. The Radio is same for everyone.
---
Put a complete atom shop skin on your favorite suit. An icon will show next to it in the inventory.
---
Ahh, a holiday bundle full of Bethesda products? One could view this two ways:
---
She really loves you
---
or
---
She really hates you
---
Yeah, I see that too. Hopefully the glowing ones still offer more XP than the charred ones. I’m just hoping they’re not the same, wouldn’t make sense to me. 
---
If you rush to finish Rose’s quest line, you can get a full set without searching, since she gives you one after you unlock the cache. 
---
But honestly the RNG is so weird. Finally just got a full T-51 at level 43, along with a T-45, meanwhile my bf has a full T-60 at level 30... I’m a little jealous 
---
Okay as we still speak I know of 3 dupes that exist 2 of them are not on youtube 1 of them I tried and reported to bethesda including step by step break down of it so I hope it hit the patch. The other could be done on PC but not on the consoles and well I am on Xbox. When this game came out there was 10 different ways to dupe that I knew of, could have been more I was not into the scene.   
---
So we are reaching the endgame of dupes in the world. The other two I am sure will be kept close to the chest until some youtuber wanting clicks posts it then it will be solved again.  All the duping methods go back to FO4 and that is on Bethesda they knew about them for years and they just ignored them.   
---
I do hope for the sake of the game all the dupes are patched, it is no fun just getting handed shit as part of the appeal and replay is going out and scouring hoping for that certain drop you want. It defeats the game when you can just go up to someone pay them 1k caps and boom you have your gun another 5k boom you have all your armor boom 200 caps a serum for the perfect mutations you want   
---
I am sure I will be downvoted since I admitted I duped for the sake of reporting but still cheated nonetheless, thus making me a shitty human or something.  
---
Im personally sick of the explosive perks. 
---
Give me a instagating or bloodied hunting rifle and any other perks that make me an actual sniper. Hell do hunting rifles have supressor mods? 
---
&gt;patch next week
---
Not what I said, but fuck me, right?
---
For the ignorant among us, what is the issue here? What would need to be fixed? I truly don’t know.
---
My friends and I are taking a break just because of the gear right now, kept getting harassed by players that have explosive weapons. It isn't fun to get one-shot when the other player is far enough away to only be ~10 pixels on your screen.
---
If someone with an explosive weapon wants to ruin your day, you have to switch servers and give up on all your workshops. It feels like the explosive mod doesn't have any damage fall off so :(
---
They couldn't read the notes because they weren't in ALL CAPS
---
It's surprising (not really) how many perfectly-reasonable comments like this are getting about half a dozen downvotes.
---
I mean, it's almost like there are half a dozen BGS employees monitoring the forum.
---
Crazy, I know. Everyone knows astroturfing is a myth...
---
Are you positive? I believe it is a separate distinct plan set because I have purchased Assorted Lighting Plans that did not include Track Lighting, it only includes Fire Barrel, Construction Light, and Oil Lamp Post.
---
See here for the Wiki: https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Plan:_Track_Lighting
---
All I want to know is if I can get ride of my phantom water purifier when I get home from work.
---
Yeah, okay.
---
I don't live in my power armor... I use it for blast zones / fast travel while slightly over-encumbered... But I suspect people that live in theirs are about to get a dose of reality.
---
I expect complaint posts within an hour of up time...
---
I am sorry, but not my cup of tea.
---
When the change to leg drops happened my first 3 Queen kills gave me rubbish 1*'s.....Now since then I have been getting good loot again. RNG i guess
---
Your sheet doesn't count the weight added by the mod pieces, so your weight values are all completely wrong.
---
Yeah for sure. I have seen about 3-4 different ones so far and I kind of wish I grabbed them now that we are getting legendary hunting rifles today haha.
---
What's the bug that's stopping you?
---
Yeah you can make a .38 pistol into a rifle by changing the stock or grips. They’re out there, you just need gun nut or plumber perk.
---
what, 1\* tire irons and pool cues not good enough for you?
---
They meant it no longer auto-scrapped, same as bottles and baseballs.
---
I've gotten this plan at minimum 4 or 5 times just by claiming workshops. 
---
&gt;most ghouls arent even labeled as legendary but still drop that stuff more than anywhere else
---
yup. have been seeing this a lot lately. *especially* with ghouls and *especially* at whitesprings.
---
"decreased xp reward for glowing ones". While I am happy they made significant progress this patch, killing glowing ones to level up was one of the only reasons I went to nuke sites. 
---
:P
---
  No, the only thing we can think of is finding someone who hasnt done the quest yet and complete it through them with them being party leader. It fixed a glitched quest for me once.
---
Many explosive weapons still one shot almost anything in the game. Still don't know which plans I've learned and heaven't, Scorchbeasts are still the worst designed enemy of all time. You can still accidentally auto scrap mods,  Etc... Jesus fuck Bethesda. 
---
Wow 30. Living large over here. I never carried more than 10.
---
Lol why would you not want fast leveling ....
---
So many important fixes! I believed in Bethesda that they will fix several important issues, but I never imagined they would fix so many of them. Kudos!
---
Now let's hope that no new issues appear. Not that I doubt Bethesda, but as a software dev myself I very much know the validity of that joke that starts with "99 litle bugs in my code...".
---
Supposedly your 3 star antiarmor plasma is actually a 2 star - read a post earlier that AA only affects ballistic damage and not energy per the awareness perk.  Could be a visual error, I haven't done any tests.  Sounds like the sort of bug to slip through though 
---
Deathwings 
---
this is the universe telling you to spend your precious time  with something that is  worth your  time. Not a  video game that is  broken and  offers  no incentive to  play , I quit after  200 hours  I feel  sorry for everyone  playing this  game  when the  end game  is  so broken. So sad  people  defend this  pile of    crap
---
Oooh good call
---
It really made me incensed...
---
way to triple post
---
Cazaclaws
---
Auto receivers fix great I can now use combat rifles in my commando build 
---
Why ultra light over deep pockets? Deep pockets gives 10 more carry weight which tends to be more than the weight reduction from ultra light?  Also, why diluted radaway/rad-x? Weight?
---
Does that mean it's too soon to start the w: tse hunting rifle posts?
---
Man wants a hunting rifle, dag nabbit. Also, how long did it take to do whatever that is. 
---
Coming from someone who is waiting to buy this game: Is push to talk, text chat and FOV support implemented already?
---
For stealth. Sucks shooting and then getting mobbed by everything in ear shot when you’re a literal glass cannon. And I agree I’m kinda sick of blowing myself up with explosive guns. No reason to do that though with a sniper rifle lol 
---
Just reload and it will be the right amount. The 30 shots doesn't actually cost you a core.
---
TS weapons do make the game a little easier but tbh I like my TS shotgun nowhere near as powerful as a TSE but it gets the job done
---
&gt;Trade: Fixed an issue where players could view another player’s inventory before they can respond to a trade invite.
---
Not trade stealing...
---
&gt;Trade: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade.
---
As I already explained; not trade stealing. Two separate issues.
---
Dumbass. Illiterate. Liar. Whiner.
---
&gt;**Armor:** Fusion Cores will no longer replenish to full charge upon joining another world.
---
It's a sad day
---
No worries, gt O918. I got some mods unlocked too, ill update this with a link to the mods I can add here in a minute. I dont have the materials required on me.
---
My 5.56 wasn’t able to survive the winter, hopefully spring will yield a good result
---
how crappy are people at picking locks that they need more than 5 or 10 bobby pins?
---
Sniper builds were definitely pretty unrewarding in this game so I’m just happy they are finally giving us a nicer edge. Good thing I started hoarding my caps because these rifles are gonna be expensive and go fast now that duping is fixed.
---
Nah all we need is dragon rend 
---
That's coming in the end of the month patch, hopefully.
---
They cant do that because PSN and Xbox have to have their patches verified. They drop PC first in case the patch breaks more things, so any corrections can be applied to console patches before they go live.
---
The chainsaw and the drill (and I think some of the other ones too) were intended to have legendary variants but are currently broken, instead if you kill a legendary enemy you just get a regular variant.
---
Frankly it won’t nerf explosive legendaries enough! I included an edit to clarify my points regarding this.
---
They are crafting components for baseball grenades and Molotov cocktails and therefore aren't autoscrapped.
---
&gt; **Crafting:** Fixed an issue where certain objects aren't able to be scrapped through the stored tab 
---
Does this mean that the phantom water purifiers are no longer a problem? I haven't played the game for like three weeks because I can't build my camp the way i want to thanks to the phantoms.
---
We can't be "bad" because we don't have the free will to accept or decline the quest.
---
Just fixed it, I went to the Capitol like I had the objective and the quest just continued 🤦‍♂️
---
You are GOD...
---
Generally, it's bc the item can be used in a crafting recipe. For bottles, it's water.
---
Gave it a go and hasn’t changed anything for the logging in to the game. I have tried a new account on PSN and that has logged in as normal. So I’d presume it’s an issue with my bethesda account to which I put a ticket in. Only wait and see what happens next. Thanks for the suggestions though. 
---
I’m hoping *fingers crossed* that this is the kind of thing that isn’t included in their patch notes, but they’ve intentionally adjusted either this patch or the next
---
such as?
---
I just picked up two Two Shot Gatlings. Rifleman/melee build so yeah. One is a 3 star with decent secondary perks but neither are explosive. Of course they're completely unmodded and aiming them is rather odd for me. 
---
I never see plans for them and rarely mods but I have a team mate that can mod them as a Gatling is his main. 
---
How is it increased? They raised the level when it's needed - 25 from 20 - and lowered materials needed for repair. Unless you're complaining about it being needed for the initial creation now, which is pretty literally what everyone has been complaining about for the last few weeks - that it shouldn't require ballistic fiber to repair, if it doesn't require ballistic fiber to make. 
---
i see you're a man of culture
---
That's why I have like 300 in my stash.
---
Better farm then nuke zones now console guys. It’s gonna be hard to level quickly very soon!
---
Ultracite?
---
Meh, it's possible to have over 5k weight without dupes. They will need to build a tool that checks weapon code vs counts. So it would scan the whole database of user items, mainly focusing on weapons bobble heads and magazines. Then it would find ones where Item ID count = More than X, where x is their cut off amount. Then a human would have to check though the accounts to validate. That's shit ton of work.
---
Nope, they are fine, loot could be better.  I'm a lowly lvl 61 and can solo 2 at a time (have done 3 once).  Its a survival game, go out and survive.  
---
" **Armor:** Fusion Cores will no longer replenish to full charge upon joining another world. "
---
I'm sad but that's ok...
---
Got lucky with a Legendary and traded it for a gun I actually use. Dude had literally 500,000 TSE guns on him. Actual guns not ammo.
---
Stopping the dupe bug is a start but these guys have enough stock by now that they don't need the bug any longer.
---
Guh! I’m gonna need to do the same at this rate. 18 pounds combined with explosive ammo Wright’s is no bueno.
---
Until today it only cost 10 acid and some plastic. You could "generate" acid by bulking and scrapping. 
---
Whoosh
---
Anyway, maybe it's different on xbox. Every single time I fast travel, another song is playing.
---
I logged in one day when the server didn’t run,
---
picked up my rifle and looked for some fun
---
I crashed sixteen times with an error code four,
---
And the fallout fans said “well this is a bore”
---
Don't bother with server hoping, just buy it from players. It costs only few thousands.
---
I'm really confused with the edit now.
---
There are two more patches dropping this month.
---
That would be nice, but knowing Bethesda they won't. Still, releasing a new set of patches for at least Fo4 and SSE would earn them back some goodwill.
---
An explosive drill that didn't kill you when you used it would be amazing.
---
Yes, there is a perception perk called Awareness that shows DR.
---
They said that the second patch this month would have fixed to “the number of plans Vendors have available.” Maybe that’s the fix for that.
---
Is the issue that when you turn an enemy to an ash or goo pile, sometimes yields no items when searched? Because that is infuriating sometimes.
---
I forgot about molotovs, thanks.
---
Ah I misread 
---
Bethesda can't even add ladders, they're not going to mess with dynamic terrain.
---
The way I've always heard it (not in FO76) is that they (the government) were handing out bottled water and they starting running low, so they handed out bottlecaps as vouchers for a bottle of water.  
---
The thing is, most if the factories were probably destroyed in the wat and that means there is a set amount of bottlecaps in circulation and they're quite sturdy, which i guess helps the fact that something as commonplace as a cap would be used as a currency
---
Next patch they will no longer be scrapped
---
Oh there are!  They are all over the place -  I have my camp at one in the Mire now - but I’m on the lookout for a new spot and am looking to see what my options are.
---
I swear if its a PUBG game mode I may be done with this game too lol. Love this game but the PUBG style games are cancer.
---
That and a close second being that some rifles show a rack action upon reload (I believe the combat rifle especially stands out). In real life, a reload only requires you to send the bolt home on magazine fed weapons, or at least on the M16’s and AR’s upon which the combat rifle is based. The idea of course being that more often than not if you’re reloading after running empty, there is an urgency to get the next round chambered. I find it painful to watch that when fighting hordes of fast moving ghouls or other enemies that the player character moves so slowly to reload especially with the added motion of re-racking instead of hitting the bolt release seems to consume half the animation on the combat rifle.
---
The handmade rifle seems to be accurate, however. It is roughly based on the AK, which does not lock the bolt to the rear upon emptying the magazine. I have not seen the animation yet for the radium rifle. 
---
A nitpick perhaps, but those couple of extra seconds drives me crazy.
---
I found this for you on youtube. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrNu03zMZAg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UrNu03zMZAg)
---
It's not Bethesda selling the items so not really
---
You know, it seems the more we talk about it, it only makes it worse to live without it.
---
Hopefully performance for me and others, my system is plenty capable but hitches a lot ingame. These patch notes look really good for performance and gameplay, let's hope it plays out that way when servers come up. If it doesn't fix my performance issues I'm blaming Windows 1809 update, I've been having other issues with it since October despite a few reinstalls.
---
Looks like you have some issues to work out.  I don't have any problem but that's just because I don't try to farm workshops (aside from capping and the first defense for plans).  
---
The one time i engaged in PvP with someone that had an explosive shotgun, it wasn't remotely close to that kind of range.  10 pixels is a quite an exaggeration.  It could for sure 1-shot and was ridiculous.  But not at that range.
---
Put a support ticket in, heard they can reset the quest. Personally didn't have any issues with that quest line.
---
you could with a laser trip wire/pressure plate triggering a powered door to open so it shuts closed behind the person with no way to open it.
---
One of my first decent legendary pickups was an auto grenade launcher that ignores 50% of enemy armor.
---
Although, doesn't explosive damage naturally ignore a good amount of armor anyway? I've been trying to figure out how much extra damage I'm really getting out of that.
---
PASSIVE PLAYERS WILL NO LONGER REMAIN PASSIVE WHEN BLOCKING CLAIM ATTEMPTS
---
YES. YES. YES.
---
Salty cowards, your days are numbered
---
I live in a giant house on the border of the map with a decent view and good supply of water. I don't need defenses due to nothing spawns by me. Do I lock doors eh I usually lock a room or two but that's about it. Free water free food and all the crafting you want which most of it is located in my garage which is by my farm
---
Is this speculation or where you able to test?
---
I've heard Dense was &gt; 60%, but I thought I was 40%... either way, it should be identical _except_ you can obviously not use Dense with PA.
---
Not likely, as people always find a way.
---
But still a step in the right direction to address the known ways
---
Does blocking prevent them from attacking? I’ve never done that. 
---
Duped the shit out of it right before the patch, biatch!
---
because i basically scratched the mobs while others killed them... its nice and all but getting carried is boring after a while, better xp for team play is a whole other story
---
i bet you have a TSE as well huh
---
I honestly have no idea, I feel like it got it waaay early. Couldve been an event reward
---
I mentioned this video in my original post, I have gone to this Red Rocket every log/server and have not seen any plan there, much less Track Lighting!
---
And yeah it may come sooner, who knows. We can only wait! All that we know or were hinted on is that its PVP related possibly.
---
My camp is a large building with sections. Most of it is locked, but i left the entrance area unlovled with an open sign. I left a weapons crafting station, power armor station, and stash box for anyone to use freely.
---
Glad to see another fellow snake that understands my love for hunting rifles. I fully understand the damage behind the gauss rifle but nothing can beat that smooth feeling of the 50. Cal sniper rifle. Plus any non legendary gun that can one shot a super mutant primus from range does fine damage, imo
---
I so need to find me one of these Ghoul Slayer Gammas now.
---
Your price to move is not 40 caps, if you do it it will be closer to 150 if you have anything in your camp, the calculation doesn't take what you said into account until AFTER you pay for it.
---
Push to talk and FOV slider were introduced last m9nth. No text chat. 
---
Jesus, FINALLY. I know this is small potatoes compared to everything else, but that weight was always ridiculous.
---
no fun allowed!
---
Ooooh that's a nice Idea I was thing more like a floor opens up and people fall in. 
---
Blocking prevents you to put together in same server.
---
Camp, everything is unlocked including water, lead, and Copper. I have turrets due to high volume of NPCs in my area. 
---
A man can dream... T.T
---
That is one of the best camps I have seen yet.  Very well done.  I recently got the conduit plans, if I recall correctly I bought them from Gramm the traveling Super Mutant.
---
but they weigh like 6 pounds !
---
ive got one of these anti-armor, anti-ghoul, was fucking amazingin the nuke zones until the last patch, now i cant carry it and the ammo used for it--. Its worthless now. 
---
Great. I already cant find enough ballistic fiber
---
Yea, we rather spend the time figuring out ways how to kill low level players instead ;)  Trust me its more fun to force you off to a different server. than to sit there and hit a button repeatedly.
---
It was pretty crazy how much xp you could get there so probably fair that they did this.
---
 Your price to move is not 40 caps, if you do it it will be closer to 150 if you have anything in your camp and are a highish level, the calculation doesn't take into account what is stored in the camp until AFTER you pay for it. 
---
Doesn't auto scrap them, just uses them for repairs and crafting. It's a simple(?) QoL thing that needs to be, but I already have a habit that keeps me ssage from that. Not something I developed because of it, just a habit that came to be. 
---
I look at my gear and what it costs to repair all of it and always make sure I have double that quantity in materials at all times. Secondly I create a shopping list of what additional mats I need to craft something, then I gather that amount or more. You always get extra stuff from scrapping items for other mats. This keeps me immune from using mods as resources. I'm a little OCD about it. 
---
I don't think they're going to replace it. If anything, they're probably nerfing the AOE dmg.
---
i have had to save Phoenix a few times from the other bots but usually they stay friendly until i pick sides with the vendor bot
---
double? lol if you have 5*expl perk
---
If duping has actually been fixed, then this will be one extremely lucrative trading item haha.
---
But honestly, the scumbag cheaters were able to break the game so fast last time that I doubt it is fixed
---
yep, my bad: "the leg mods that add +50 carry weight to each leg" i mean
---
Kind of bummed about this one. Grindfest it is.
---
Knowing how much effort it would be to translate the designs across all power armor pieces (and how some may come out less-than-stellar on certain models due to their surface area + shape limitations in conjunction with the motifs of the specific style), I still wish the paint applied to all models if for no other reason than ease of purchasing.
---
As is, I have to think about what kind of PA I have, which model I'd be able to use this on, decide if I will really be using this model, and THEN make a decision whether it was a good value proposition to me... I could justify buying one (even at an exorbitant price!) knowing I could use it on current and all future models I collect. Would really help me pull the trigger on a purchase, especially for limited time stuff while I'm still leveling.
---
Because population dwindles on games that has more high level players, MMOs run into this all the time. One big complaint people have is that there's no end game content right now, thats partly an issue because people can rocket up though the levels to hit 100+ rather quickly. I took a few weeks to hunt around and go from 1 to 40ish, then a week from mid 40s to 100s at Whitesprings. I havn't even bothered to complete the main quest line yet, so I'm going go back and do content that should have gotten me ready for higher levels at a really over powered level. It wasn't even my intention to hit this high a level it was just too easy not to.
---
Alright time to see if my game still crashes while fast travelling or zoning
---
14 server hops yesterday and every time Camp McC was completely stripped of Ballistic Fiber.
---
So maybe upping the amount available is still a good idea.
---
Or you can go play fortnite and I’ll engage in pvp when I want to in FO76. It’s not PVP if I’m actively doing something far from my CAMP while you’re destroying it. I just keep coming back to camp wiped out while some griefer is running around like lunatic. 
---
you guys complaining about excavator armor and here I am in my Tweeked Raider set, waiting for another configuration of metal than what i've got. 
---
CMON WARRIDER PA! IM GONNA BUY YOU SO HARD WHEN YOU COME OUT. 
---
I'd love to see a way to do this without needing another person. 
---
Also legendary hunter rifles are on the loot table now. 
---
They should delete every stash which over 600 and every inventory over 400
---
Probably turrets. Pure cosmetics take up very little budget. 
---
They only seem to give me gas mask components
---
Damn on them fixing the fusion core recharge on login. Awesome that they made fusion core generators usable again though. Poseidon here I come, next week. Lol
---
Go back and re-read.  
---
And everything with the Junkie legendary. 
---
that sounds plausible, since FO was originally single player and they have to retrofit the multiplayer stuff on to the single player objects they probably are some scripts that are still firing off on everyone's instance of the world.
---
Like the duplicate keys on the main corpse in the mayor for a day quest, for everyone that joins the server
---
Rip grenades
---
Ultra-lite gives ap bonus and reduced weight.  So pocketed is not better for weight, ironically.  Deep pocket not much better.
---
You can craft 2mm with all your extra junk. ;)
---
I find sniping unsustainable because mobs spawn in packs.  :(

Once one detects you, they all do.  Silly.
---
Handmade automatic has best recoil, so you can actually hit with the third bullet.
---
i want to put corpses, leather, bones and shit all over my Raider Power Armor for intimidation! 
---
LET ME RIDE ETERNAL, SHINY AND CHROME TO VALHALLA! 
---
My camp is built like camp bastion in Afghanistan with the defensive walls, large tents with crafting , sleeping and recreational with a tv and jukebox, security doors a fusion generator artillery and turrets, complete with a locked power armour garage 2 industrial purifies and a shit tone of razor grain, couple that with pressure traps with terminal connection and 3 skill doors the only trouble I have is if you’ve got marsupial or a jp 
---
i also planned a chaotic raider character just to use the paint cuz my main is a PA build, gonna go for explosives on this one
---
Sniper? 
---
Try Rank 2 Sturdy Frame (50% less armor weight). 
---
Check you misc tab. Ore and Gun powder have weight and are stored their instead of Junk. Also, tokens have weight.
---
There is no need to carry junk unless you are using Junk Shield ... you could use Traveling Pharmacy at Rank 3 and carry all of your Chem/Stim Aid items and use that stash for junk. 
---
Chems and Stims are heavy - unless you are going to take Traveling Pharmacy you should not carry super stims (I think they come in at 1.5lbs each).
---
Additionally, you could use Thru-Hiker Rank 3 and carry all your food and water to use that stash for junk. 
---
Since you don't drop Aid when you die you don't risk your junk.
---
If you haven't used a weapon or armor piece and you are past level 50 ... get rid of it unless it is an UBER Legendary that you are perking toward otherwise you will find it or something better again. 
---
I get it, I wanted to save everything ... Teddy Bears, Cool Outfits, Armor - but the reality is aside from things you use you can find them again. 
---
If you aren't using Fuel, Energy Ammo then lose them. They are taking up weight you could use for something else.
---
BULK - Aluminum, Lead and Steel ... it actually helps.
---
Make sure EVERYTHING is scrapped. That fan weighs way more than the components.
---
I know it is hard ... but you have to let go of some things. 
---
I have a full set of every type of power armor at max level. That is my nod to hoarding.
---
Damned dupers, it's you that's been causing reddit to crash so much recently.
---
you're not looking for the power connectors right cause they fixed that I just found out last night
---
I totally agree that PvP isn't really fun in this game.  Aside from the obvious imbalances with legendary weapons.  Well.. honestly its hard to tell, because that's so pervasive, what it would be like.
---
I can't really picture that range.  Sounds like maybe it was just explosive, not two-shot.  Two-shot ruins the accuracy but without it you can get a pump action some pretty good range/accuracy.
---
im level 120 and using every perk point to respec into the build I want. I still dont have some of the perkcards I want to be able to switch to. At least levelling gives me something to do until the next patch though.
---
Ok, by why? I'm 125 right now with 20 perk points sitting there doing nothing, and I've changed between HW/2H and HW/Shotgun/rifle after level 75. I mean yeah wanting to be that level is fine, but there's 0 in game reason for it. A person at level 100 is going to be just as strong as a person at level 2000 if setup with the same equipment.
---
Omg I just kept scrolling and there was more and more. Fix after fix after fix. And peoe say they aren't doing anything lol
---
Honestly there's some bugs I hoped they would forget (fusion cores refilling) but this is a fantastic list.
---
Noooooo 😭😭😭 I missed that one I think. 
---
Same, I’d love to see more power armor and regular armor paints that aren’t just from the atomic shop.  On a side note with the atom cats paint, I have had the pleasure of seeing one and it’s not the same paint as FO4.  My favorite part of the atom cats paint was on the helm there was a cathead logo inside a nuclear symbol.  In FO76 it is missing :(
---
It was becoming a bit strange to see 30 Mister Handy gardener's at that small garden in front of the Whitesprings.
---
+ dense mod on armor
---
Yeah, there's a point where it's obvious.  I'm probably carrying 20k "pounds" of ammo, weapons, junk on my mule.  Knees buckle walking into the Morgan RR station.
---
Just bc you can pvp at workshops does not make workshops end game. They provide low ranked plans and not much else. Not endgame. The whole game has PVP and theres even the wanted radio station thats full pvp. 
---
Right, so I see there will be fewer fusion cores spawning. So another nerf to power armor, and not really anything to make up for that. I'll check back in another month.
---
The Gauss does ballistic damage.
---
And it was always affected by rifle cards, so I'm assuming the bug fix was for rare bugged characters.
---
If you want to know a downside to the Gauss, it is the fact that you cannot charge up and go into VATS, it will result in a 100% miss. Charging has to occur after entering VATS. It makes it a bit unintuitive at times.
---
I saw a legendary 24 assaultron last night... ran like the wind on my 28 with only a ballistic weapon ;)
---
I want legendary protest signs.
---
Deathwing?
---
Wow.
---
Between my bro and I, we've gained over 400 levels between 3 characters, have farmed whitesprings, the queen and good events countless times (as well as just exploring and playing the game). We have found exactly 4 explosive weapons and no TSE's. They would be incredibly rare if duping never existed.
---
Gauss rifle perk fix?  Hell yes!
---
It's probably to help with the lag when you previously loaded someone else's inventory, which is nice.
---
Yea see that comment about having your build at 50.  That means you had no farming ability at all.  And I'm level 250 could of easily be 400 by now with out any cheating.  
---
use that horrid Dpad item wheel for it.  Im sure not using it for "easy item access"
---
Daaaaaang
---
Damnit, Bobby! I sold 1000 pins!
---
Maybe the next update friend :(
---
Anyone a little pissed about all the Balistic fiber we need? It's impossible to find. Even when I server hop to try and find a military base that has some, its always been picked clean before I get there. 
---
Not sure what people would be complaining about it is pretty much nothing but fixes and buffs across the board. I think literally the only nerf was too glowing ones in nuke zones giving too much XP.
---
Looking like a good patch, I’ll probably try to give the game a second chance soon enough. 
---
Oh I see, but Vault tec has their own alterior motives for all of their experiments too right?  I didnt think everything they did was for the government and the enclave
---
There's a teddy bear fort (I call it Camp Teddy) up by Devil's Backbone. Spawns a bag and a roll of mil-grade duct tape. Made it part of my camp so i can just grab them when I log-in. With White Knight that seems to be more than enough, provided I don't get tag-teamed by scorchbeasts while trying to do Bots on Parade... SMH
---
plus server stability.
---
Ive made 3 small buildings, a house, a garage with powered door, and a raised workshop to house fusion generator all locked. With small area for passers by with a bed and unlocked water purifier and stash with work bench.
---
Those guys were stupid. I took my level 15 in there with like 60 Molotov and a hazmat suit. I was almost never in danger or in the way.
---
Lol DEATHWING don't know why but the batman theme started playing in my head reading that 
---
Yeah, okay!
---
Aww yissssss
---
I did that with the Bunker Buster and really enjoy the 20 weight worth of space I got back for what is basically a poor mans 1* Instigating/Two Shot Missile Launcher.
---
"I'll be sure to keep an eye out."
---
"YOU'LL BE DEAD...BROKE"
---
I have (multiple times), and was told that they're aware of the issue, and don't have the tools to reset quests or add items to player's inventories. 
---
it literally says it is coming in the next patch, this month.
---
While your at it give him a modified version of x-01 power armour and we'll call it done lol
---
Thanks! I guess its about the amount of initiative you take. I have been dropping loot by the vault 76 but I guess my lvl can be a tad intimidating. Are the codes part of the main story line, like does the missle silos have there own quest line? 
---
No one can find Grahm to replace him.
---
&gt;Fireproof now reduces explosion and flame attack damage by 15% per rank.
---
Sweet! Explosive bullets just got a 45% damage reduction
---
Still overpowered but...
---
I don’t even have excavator yet :-) I’m going back and doing some of the questions that I didn’t actually think were important… Thanks again man I really appreciate it.
---
Why do they keep nerfing XP related things? Fucking dumb
---
This won't be a thing as much, they just punched glowing one xp in the taint. It's back to normal ghoul xp so it's not really worth it to nuke honestly
---
I was waiting for this one, and also how fast laser weapons break or a buff at least.
---
Pip-Boy skin looks nice.
---
An issue i had jusr yesterday was that i used rhe salvaged assaultron head and it used all of my fusion cells in one shot. 
---
Weren't console getting it too? Is that still happening? 
---
Gauss ammo is energy ammo, i.e. if you use Batteries Included its weight is massively reduced along with power cores.
---
Thats great, but it sucks for me because i literally got rid of 200 of then before the maintenance lol
---
Will do! Are you far along the main quest line?
---
Another fat man skin, really?
---
You don't need mutations to be successful. You can dodge their sonic attacks sufficiently without them.
---
Thanks! Will try claiming workshops instead of jumping around vendors!
---
Thanks for doing this, lets me plan out purchases and save atoms.
---
It's a shared worksheet.  People don't want to see your values.  Make a copy and add your own values and make wahtever other edits you need.
---
Nerfs normal explosives(missile launcher, granades) too much, nerfs explosive legendaries(tse) too little
---
Agreed, tons of people have mules in mmos who’s sole purpose is to hold all the garbage that their mains need and can’t be burdened with.  They aren’t always called mules, wow had bank alts, but the concept is there.
---
No more constant running around in PA I guess :(
---
Thanks - much appreciated.
---
Ya when I read that... I was like WHAT? MY Fusion Generator in my camp sometimes can spawn a core?! WWWHHHAAATTTTT?!   
---
Glad I wasn't missing cores all this time. 
---
I'm curious cause I haven't thought about creating a mule alt:  How does one go about transferring items between characters?
---
&gt; I think some people may have access to the game's code or something.
---
Everyone on PC has access to the client side of the games code.
---
Oh, you thing it being compiled hides stuff?  Bwhahahhaaa.
---
When you're crafting the upgraded motors, if you hit craft too quickly, you'll end up with less than five upgraded motors. Since the components are also quest items, they don't respawn and you can't get more. Further, if you log out with 4/5 motors and log back in, you'll actually have 0/5 afterwards.
---
So I can't complete the quest, and can't go get more of the components. 
---
The thing is, when you’re on a team, they can do full damage and you lose caps even if you don’t want to engage, and my friends can be trigger happy. Js
---
ooooo, shiny chest!
---
But we did get legendary sniper rifles finally.
---
I've never farmed Whitesprings, I've spent 10/15 minutes here or there but never sat through an entire nuke timer in the area.  Just doesn't appeal to me, standing in one place shooting mobs as they spawn.  The XP and items I've gotten have come from Events/random encounters, and I'm still 170.  Once you get a TSE of any sort even the SB that plague lower level players just become annoying instead of any sort of difficult.  I actively hunt them to trade the prime receivers they drop and sell the Ultracite to vendors.
---
Yeah, prisoner collar is dope! I've been rocking it with the field scribe gat, bottle cap shades and the mistress of mystery veil, love the way it goes together. My main is a crit rifle build, I like to imagine the red blinking light taunts raiders and the likes by showing them to "shoot here". Definately a carlos hathcock vibe haha
---
buy the game again on a different account. I sure as hell won't but some people have apparently.
---
I thought the last one lasted less than 20 minutes?
---
Oh speculation, but a number as big as 60% reduction isn’t hard to fathom. Not to mention this can stack with Assassin’s and yes, Dense armor mods. I’ll run you real quick through some numbers.
---
Auto grenade launcher does 237 a hit with full demo expert. -60% is 94.8, then -40% for Assassin’s is 56.8, then -(Dense I dunno, maybe lowball it and call it 20%?) is 45.5, which then applies normally to DR, resulting in a bit that is less powerful than an unperked handmade rifle bullet. If I kill you with an auto grenade launcher, you were AFK. Btw at 300 DR, that 45.5 becomes something like 15. Times 12 shots is 180,  it even enough to kill with all 12 nades being direct hits.
---
Let’s put the DR first instead? Ok. 237 vs non-PA DR of let’s say 300. That works out to slightly more than 50% reduction, so 120. (Exact 300 DMG va 300 DR is 150 btw). 23.04 per hit. 12 shots in the mag, so 276 total, assuming all direct hits, which is generous cause it’s shooting grenades, not bullets. 
---
too late
---
Those are some nice changes / fixxes that were much needed.
---
Dont understand though why they didnt add the pipe revolver and enclave armor to the legendary list in the same moment.
---
Also where is the laser weapon fix...
---
I like to leave mine in a bag near the trader in Flatwoods, or by the Overseers camp
---
Good Lord the lever action rifle, it's fixed! I can't believe that day finally arrived!
---
That power armor paint has to be a joke!
---
Seems to activate when you’re not in combat or around enemies. So don’t expect it to heal you in the heat of battle. But it’s a nice recharge after a tough battle or from some fall damage in the wild.
---
I'm not sure what was off with GR. But on paper my GR has roughly 50% more damage than my Hunting Rifle. Yet in combat it didn't seem like it was damaging them 50% more. Maybe the perk that allows the GR to bypass 36% of armor was not working?
---
Yeah I had no idea it was an unintended feature. I thought it was a pretty cool reward for chewing through your ammo, durability, chems and armour. With great risk comes great reward or something. 
---
Fist patch note about charged barrels.  No mention of the charged barrels on Tesla rifles causing crashes on multiple platforms xD (search this Reddit and you'll see a suprising number of posts about it xD - that's how I discovered the source of my crashes)
---
Exactly.
---
Dude a month ago got the quest reset, not sure why they won't reset it for you now...
---

---
I don't know about the perk for stealth boys since it's really easy without them and they are kind of rare
---
I really like it
---
Closest thing we have to a full pvp play session is running around taking all the workshops. Its kinda what i do endgame. Grinding is boring. 
---
Ok so id like to see a more challenging pvp endgame, like in ESO. Thry have the sewers and the pvp castles and whatnot. Workshops can be just that. If they were more difficult wirh world bosses. The ones in higher level zones at least
---
Yeah. We should start rounding up stupid people and set them on fire.
---
There's a snake picture on the map south of Whitesprings where there's a pond on the golf course. I always set a floating C.A.M.P. over that pond, harvest the mirelurks that spawn there, and set up water purifiers as well. That location is also never in the blast zone, so it's an ideal spot.
---
I see, thanks for the correction 
---
Can we PLEASE get an update that shows us which PLANS and RECIPES we have already learned?!? How hard is this to implement???
---
Whitesprings will be a sea of orange and green for the next few days on console.  
---
Sometimes both in the same hour!
---
It is in the patch notes, dude
---
One time when trading with a friend, the "set price" menu was the first thing I saw. Essentially I had clicked space too soon so it was asking me to set a price for whatever I had clicked on. 
---
Had I hit space again, I would have set the price to something....for cheap. 
---
My guess is a few people did this and actually did lose something. 
---
Servers are back up anyways. https://twitter.com/bethesdasupport/status/1083396986999619584?s=21
---
Everytime I loaded up Fo76 I'd run right to whitesprings for the XP. Kinda Glad I can change things up a bit now.
---
If by RNG you mean buy it from dupers, then yes.
---
I know that GR does ballistic damage. My comment was about the ammo not being considered ballistic ammo, therefore unaffected by the perk that makes ballistic ammo lighter. Either that or the base weight of GR ammo is huge.
---
And I also already know that GR is considered a Rifle, I even looked it up on wiki to confirm that when I found the weapon. But it felt to me as if it didn't do proportionally more damage than my Hunting Rifle. I didn't do any tests, so it's just my feeling. But when I saw the patch notes about GR I started to believe that at least some of the Rifle perks weren't working. Maybe the perk that allows to bypass 36% of armor?
---
Those fixed things were inconsequential.
---
Hunting rifle thing was ok, but the rest of the fixes are things that should been *fixed* in the beta
---
My favorite is doing this to a supermutant who then moves on to the usual mutant superiority stuff.... While fleeing...
---
I did not think of that. More coffee 
---
If u play with friends, make a mule to transfer gear u dont use as of now.  
---
Now I regret not picking up the Hotter Rod paints - had the atoms but saved them.  Of course I still have my Blackbird!
---
You always needed to craft. They moved it from anything level 20 and up to level 25 and up. I think you skipped your coffee today.
---
The 300% number is nonsensical. You heal at zero rate without healing factor, so it would still be zero!
---
Factor just heals you out of combat, and is astonishingly fast.
---
The update was great. Duping removal(hopefully for good?) Legendary hunting rifle, tons of fixes....Also they spelled out they'd be doing a bug fixing patch then at the end of the month releasing the player trading patch. Personally I'd prefer everything to actually work before they start throwing in more stuff
---
I’m in the opposite position to you for some reason I get hundreds of screws and springs but am always running out of steel
---
Disconnect mismatches are one of the most common form of dupe glitches in online games.
---
You're using a lot of weak phrases and passive words in your replies: you'll def have a greater impact online if you focus on the logos of your arguments rather than appealing to pathos (better to be logical than pathetic, eh?)
---
Confirmed: The Enclave is run by Dogmeat.
---
Except there is not much difference past level 50 beyond being able to run more diverse builds and min/max perk setup.
---
Also no legendary scout armor
---
&gt;&gt;  Crafting: Level 25 armor and above now requires anti-ballistic fiber to craft.
---
&gt; what the fuck does this mean...
---
You didn't see the post about someone finding a linear accelerator in a caravan somewhere?  They were obviously tring to craft anti-ballistic fibre.
---
&gt;Does this mean that the phantom water purifiers are no longer a problem?
---
Apparently.
---
After picking literally thousands upon thousands of locks in Skyrim, FO 3, FO New Vegas, FO 4 and FO 76 with exactly the same stupid minigame, I just can't take it anymore. Please, make it stop!! Put an end to it before it's too late. This minigame sucks out your soul... don't throw your life away like that.
---
No... no more locks for me, ever again. Not for loot and not for experience. Don't try to tempt us by reducing the weight of bobby pins... it won't work.
---
Only out of battle. I love this one. If you take fall damage, or maybe get hit a few times by an enemy in the wild before taking them out, all of that damage is undone. It takes a few seconds to kick in but I rarely use stimpacks anymore. 
---
Isnt that the blueish/grey/colbatly color the color of a corrosion-resistant gunmetal coating?
---
Which would make sense considering its mining equipment, then the yellow/orange paint is probably the top coat like we see on CAT equipment. 
---
Glad to know I'm not wasting my time lol, thanks!
---
i tried to play last night but i was running about 5 FPS. i restarted the game, restarted my pc, tried to play for a while and then just gave up. Never seen it that bad.  
---
No, Im looking for the real barn plan. I welling to trade if someone got it!
---
This patch is actually ahead of there schedule, it was planned for Jan 14th

Last week we mentioned that we would be starting the new year with new patches. The first of those will be coming January 14.

---
If they can continue with these fix patch's quickly hopefully we can get the planned new content a bit sooner.
---
Yeah I've seen that, and several people in the comments say that support couldn't reset the quest for them. I think that guy just got lucky. 
---
Guess I'll have to look for an anti armor energy weapons.
---
That happened to me last night, as well. My budget was 185% stored. My finger hurts from scrapping...
---
Yeah, but don't forget to use it before the *spoil* causes the confinement to decay.
---
I never noticed this, but I was aware that I didn't really go through Fusion Cores much.  Damn.
---
Thanks. I mentioned in my post that I just started it and I haven't take a look into that yet.  :-)
---
If that is what's stopping you from buying the game, i think you'll have a lot more issues than those issues. I believe FOV &amp; push to talk is implemented. No text chat
---
I have the actual hard numbers for you.
---
The AP value is pulled from the game files:
---
Name | Armor Pen | Actual Damage increase*
---
---|---|----
---
Perk: Incisor | 75% | 66.1%
---
Legendary: Anti-Armor | 50%| 28.9%
---
Modification: Perforating Magazine | 40% | 20.6%
---
Perk: Tank Killer | 36% | 17.7%
---
Modification: Stinging Magazine | 20% | 8.5%
---
Modification: Any melee AP mod | 15% | 6.1%
---
The actual damage formula is:
---
FinalDamage = Damage\*MIN(0.99,(Damage/DamageResist)\*0.15)^0.365 *0.5)
---
AP is multiplicative and no matter how you stack it, it always grants the above damage increase compared to not having that perk or modification. \*The exception being if you are already dealing more than ~20x the target's resistance which effectively negates the resistance entirely.
---
I'm sure many people have, but that's not an option I'll go with. My best friend was playing until he just bought a new house, so my go-to swapper is MIA. ;(
---
I understand that. I also want a few things that are missing in the game. 
---
But this is thread a half an hour after they just fixed a lot of stuff. Some things I was hoping for and they are in the patch, for some things I'm still waiting for.
---
They can't do all at once. And 
---
They Took Our Jobs will be the new meta, I'm calling it now!
---
yep, I jumped for joy with that!
---
You need to pierce the heavens with your drill!
---
Long time fan but had to cancel my preorder due to budget constraints. Felt like I dodged a bullet at launch, but it's great to read the patch notes &amp; addressing issues that existed in FO4. I can't wait to pick this up on sale or after I'm back on my feet!
---
Why do is the update smaller on PC? 
---
Yes, just change from stock to grip. 
---
No, it was totally a hoax. After seven years on reddit I was *secretly employed* by Rockstar to start a thread moaning about a bug that apparently was reported all the way back in Beta.
---
(this is sarcasm - I'm more than a little bitter about that entire episode).
---
I suppose. I think they wanted to avoid ruining the weapons for pve. It's a crap situation to make a decision on. Dupers made all these Tse weapons the main form of pve, and you have x amount of players who spent caps they earned on these items. It's a touchy situation.
---
I was thinking that too, but that'd still mean they'd run out of fuel eventually and stop hovering. Plus, if Kerbal Space Program taught me anything, using an air intake and heating the air over a nuclear reactor provides, basically, fuel-less thrust (the concept is [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear-powered_aircraft)). Mind you it's not like Fallout *has* to be realistic
---
I will gladly make a protective BoS officer suit on XBox.  I have violet flux.  Would like technical data
---
Somebody else clarified for you, but I really need to say, I did clarify it in my post as well. I know it’s all too easy to turn your brain off and assume you know where something is going, but it’s resulted in you missing the point. I’m actually arguing for nerfing explosive legendaries and your downvotes only serve to oppose someone arguing for the same thing as you.
---
This community is as knee jerk as I’d feared.
---
I think it's the latter, since those produce at a constant rate and definitely felt slower than their advertised rate... but the line
---
&gt; **Crafting:** Lowered chance of Power Generators of spawning fusion cores. 
---
definitely sounds like the former? I had no idea it could produce them at all. I put one in my camp and walk past it multiple times per play session and never noticed one but I wasn't looking for it, either... 
---
I was being grief last night for a while. I was taking workshops and bouncing around so I can replenish my resources. A level 311 guy (in PC), name was Deimos or something like that would start to take my workshops, 1 Shot me, then leave the area to cancel the claim. I was wearing PA. He walks away, no bounty, and I couldn’t even get a shot off. It’s fucking bullshit. And because he wasn’t wanted, he watched which one I jumped too, and harassed the hell out of me. And also because he was a stealth riffle build, he wouldn’t appear on my map. Now the fact that he can do that, and not be flagged, it ridicules. That shit is what they need to fix. 
---
Lets see how many changes they "forgot" to mention this time. :P
---
I love my pipe revolver, I'm still using it at level 92 because it's solid. I'd love a nice legendary though. 
---
Ah, fair enough. Need to go to a range sometime, but never been to the states.
---
Have looked with awareness, but I believe charred feral ghouls have some DR. I noticed in the early days they'd take way less damage than other ghouls.
---
THE SACRED META!
---
Mine is like a main building with a crafting area outside. I lock up the main building and my water purifier, but leave all the crafting workbenches and stashes out for people to use.
---
You cant revive what is dead
---
Holy crap. This is exactly what I was looking for!! Headed straight there, tonight. Thanks so much for checking all the boxes! I'll let you know what I find!
---
Yeah, I suspected that to be the case. Well, my char is non-PA stealth sniper so I have little use for Batteries Included, but thanks for the suggestion. At least GR is cool as hell, so I can put up with its ammo weighting a little bit more :).
---
You don’t find Grahm. Grahm finds trade. You have trade... Grahm find you. Moo Moo there too.
---
There is a difference between a patch, and the release of new content.
---
No, you get it by scrapping anti-military ammo bags.
---
You, know, those ones with ☮ on the side.
---
"Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will hit near the end of the month."
---
20 days but still, another patch !
---
Some of the nuke bosses could be the unique monsters like king/queen snallygaster, grafton monster, flatwoods alien or even the elusive mothman etc.
---
Well I had 221 armor, and if you can trust the wiki, only a few things have 200 armor. I'm gonna do more checking today.
---
I want that PA armor lol
---
Yeah I seem to see a whole lot more negatives than positives. 
---
I understand updates but who do some of these really effect. The economy has been fucked with people duping to high heaven 
---
Other people’s camps...

some kid was screaming about there being a nerf to bal-fiber
---
perhaps inconsequential to you, but for many many others, some serious issues were fixed. We all understand that a  bunch of stuff SHOULD have been fixed after the BETA, but they are at least making progress.. they have to do a little at a time. 
---
Loving the stash and art. More decorative CAMP items please Beth!
---
Still no handmade rifle or lever action rifle skins :(
---
I have experience with the tools used on this engine and I'm not exaggerating when I say this took one person about thirty seconds to change and commit.
---
Well that's handy
---
I don't downvote everything that i don't agree with, and i read your post. I downvote things that are very inappropriate, so i wouldn't point that finger at me. I explained in my other post why i think they avoided a full nerf, however.
---
&gt;how much Bethesda is paying attention to what we say and do
---
I disagree entirely. To say legendary hunting rifles being added was due to player requests would require Bethesda to be incompetent as developers.
---
I think it's much more likely that the devs knew about the legendary hunting rifles not dropping but didn't do anything about it because they had more import bugs to work on. I'm sure there is an internal bug tracker that had legendary hunting rifles on it, with a multitude of other more critical issues above it.
---
They fixed legendary hunting rifle drops when they got to it, not because they didn't know about it. 
---
Nah, but their team can do full damage to you. It’s dumb af
---
Damn here I am guarding the Poseidon run stashes thinking not a lot of people knew about it. I really hope Beth doesn't remove the stashes like they did when everyone was farming the Whitespring stashes.
---
Yeah... that happend to us several times too (but not that often like the invisible player model bug). This bug is "fun" at the Watoga monster mash event...when nobody can steel the mask from the player who is invisible.
---
Ah, hello, troll! I'm sorry, but I don't have any food for you. Can you wait until next week? Or maybe check down at the baker, they might have some day-old bread.
---
I'm not a fanboy, or an employee, we are downvoting you because you say you're not going to play, but are in this sub complaining.  
---
Keep your opinions to yourself if you don't actually play.
---
If you are ever in New York, they have one set up in the West Point Museum just outside the US Military Academy.
---
and...idiots are people
---
“Known and unknown” I’m cackling 
---
The diseased prefix is able to override the ledgendary one. A number of diseases are actually ledgendary too. 
---
Google FO76 resource map. You can place your camp in a particular spot that has a lead and junk extractor available if you place your camp right. 
---
Why isndo we need to wait a week to get the patch on consoles. Is the pc version being used a to test the patch or is it the stupid proces of releasing updates on consoles?
---
Why? Many normal players overload an alternate account to have the storage space they need. And since they don't play on that alternate, there's no problem
---
Damn good list!
---
Your winky-face at the end is unsettling.
---
The scary part is that these are the people I need to get a decent job and pay into the social security system so I can collect and keep collecting.  I am not hopeful.
---
In a sense, having the pins heavier was helpful. I discovered I could get by only having 10 or 15 pins on me. Even with the reduced weight, I'll probably never carry more than what I'm carrying now. (Unless I'm planning on selling them)
---
I had someone drop a Troubleshooter's Explosive Pump-Action in a bin during a Whitesprings nuke run. I almost broke my keyboard mashing the E button to pick it up. (It's the only explosive weapon I've seen in the entirety of my play time and I loooove the pump-action.)
---
The 300% number seems to be tied to the amount of regen it gives you based on your max health, so it's not nonsensical, just poorly worded.
---
Nice! Thanks man.
---
Small disclaimer: I don't trust explosive damage or explosive damage calculations in Fallout titles. This has been a massive point of contention and you can still find people swearing that, all the way back in Fallout 4, explosives do 5x their listed damage plus double to the head (if in the blast). That was completely busted and absolutely untrue.
---
The explosive legendary effect is very strange. You can use the AGL you mentioned with identical damage right now and it "tickles", but a rifle with explosive affix and equal damage listed still does a good chunk of damage even through Dense (in the current state of the game).
---
When you factor in simultaneous hits (ie: shotguns, but also flechettes, etc) it makes even less sense. An explosive harpoon hurts, but an explosive flechettes harpoon kills. 100 damage - 60% = 40 and (4 x 25) - 60% = 40, or (25 - 60%) x 4 = 40. AGL/Missile launcher somehow do even less damage. It should be equal all around, give or take a small percentage of DR/scratch damage.
---
Yup. I can already hear the bandwagon haters complaining that Bethesda just ported dragons into Fallout.
---
these vendors where implemented after the nukes, i believe.
---
TSE shovel? What ammo does the shovel use?
---
PvP isnt funwhen you can spam stims and you can just one shot people.
---
They nerf'd water production at camps so you need to use a public workshop to produce water. its not fun when i dont even get teh chance to defend the workshop and just get one shotted by a TSE gauss rifle. its cool i have my tse now
---
Yeah, it was in the BETA notes that those wouldn’t carry over. You’ll have to start a new toon to get those
---
I've seen legendary scout armor at the watoga station.
---
Check your aid. Drop whatever you don't need. Carry 5 water, 5 food and some stimpacks. Make some hard choices. Sell excess. 
---
I was pretty happy just to have this and I didn't even get it farming whitepsrings for the last 15 levels.  Someone sold it to a vendor in Watoga.
---
That being said I did find an armor piercing gatling gun, so I may change this char to a heavy weapons char.
---
I'd been looking for a way to describe the ominous feeling of these code tire patches being slapped on older tire patches, and technical debt is it.  Thank you.  (Also it would be a hilarious name for the first DLC).
---
You're probably right I'm just salty because they always seem to find me LOL
---
mosaics
---
Their guns were out and shootin??, they also have a distinct look in the game 
---
Great question! Ultimately the distinction would be down to Bethesda but I'm thinking non- combat based cards would be eligible. Anything that modifies a damage, resistance, hp, ap, etc would be "active". 
---
I got a 2 shot plasma rifle last night. I was just excited it wasnt a revolutionary sword, or a black powder rifle that does more damage to bugs. Seems like i always pull from the same small pool of crap legendaries.
---
With a friend to trade or stay logged into the same sever while you switch.
---
Wish they fixed the scrapping of mods..
---
The "around enemies" is important. You might think you're out of combat, but any baddies in proximity to you will hinder healing.
---
A fucking men... VATS pistol build, I feel so freaking week even with a 3 star legendary Medic's .44
---
The vendor at harpers ferry has them usually
---
Then why wouldn’t they appear in the Capital Wasteland or Commonwealth, with both right next to the ocean but Appalachia over 100 miles inland?
---
You do have the free will to accept or decline, you chose to complete it so you can get items and nukes.
---
I've had a legendary Scout Armor Chest piece drop before. Mind you, it was shit. 
---
Could you imagine a SBQ version of Mothman or the alien? 25 foot tall mothman... that would be cool
---
I feel like if you added fiery orange accents to a flying deathclaw, then it would look like a Balrog. 
---
Yeah I get a lot of comments for being high level and using T45 and a quad broadsider when I also have jetpack t51 and an explosive minigun. People just don’t get it. 
---
&gt; **Trade:** We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade. 
---
Hmmm....
---
Some good QoL changes. Nothing gamechanging /breaking though.
---
Also appreciate several weight reducing changes 👍
---
I'm on a cliff overlooking the entire bog. First Cliffside location without a scorchbeast spawn. Originally my camp was farther east along the cliff and nothing attacked me except mutants down below to far away to do anything. Moved over to the extractor spot nearby, so now I get a few mutant visitors here and there. 
---
Agree! Im not gonna start the discution about the Atom store now... Lets just say that im not that positiv about it. But if you have to do it like that, then give people something worth buying. Deathclaw skin would be awsome! ;) 
---
They haven't touched a number of them which don't exist including the pipe revolver.
---
I'll give you a pass though since you're clearly from /fallout, but if you don't have anything constructive or reasoned to say you can leave it there.
---
It went down as your level went up, even still ,it was a great chunk of XP. At 93 I was still getting around 440 xp.
---
The problem with "grounded" bosses is that they will get melee raided down instantly. Unless they have even better DR than SBQ. But yeah we definately need more bosses
---
All it does is open up people who trade higher than 5k to getting ripped off. There should be a safe way to trade items, and there is not.
---
This kind of online market has been around for quite a bit of years nowadays. People tend to create organisations filled with cheap employees to do these kind of things.   
---
It was there during the time of Ultima Online, but there was less large-scale exploiting. (1997)
---
People don't change and prefer easy money above all. 
---
Il see if its any different today but it was very discouraging in the moment so i stopped playing
---
Porpoise the Lord and pass the ammunition! 
---
I'd prefer the things that are broken be fixed. I did not see this as broken. Are they going to make ballistic fiber easier to find now?
---
You can build 5 up and 5 down, find an elevation to build on. 
---
Nice job. I had told another person that had asked this question about "stagger locking". It definitely worked as intended. 
---
The major issue with the SBQ is will there be lag and poor network connection so bad to where you cant instantly loot items. If you cant then there is network or server congestion. My worst or not exciting games were with lag and the irritation level builds.
---
But withing the last few weeks, I have got to the SBQ fight within the first 30 seconds and by being one of the early arrivals I had 0 lag and it was a whole different experience, one of the best events ever might I say. :)
---
Very dissappointed to see a nerf to fusion cores without a fix to the carry weight bug on excavator power armor on xbox.
---
  Every time I exit my armor, when i re-enter, my carry weight drops to that of normal power armor, forcing me to server hop to fix it.
---
pfft Sod your weapons, I want legendary PA chassis, my PA fists should be legendary power fists.
---
Ah, so the mask goes invisible too? LOL good times
---
Well, it seems as though you probably don't enjoy anything anyway.  I'm one of the biggest criticizers of this game, but even I jumped back in because things *are* getting better.  
---
But, you just sit there in your echo chamber, yelling at yourself.  Because frankly, friend, nobody here is listening anymore.
---
Yeah that's what I got from this too!
---
yeah that's not pvp that is flat out murder. I don't consider Fallout 76 to have pvp. You can break this games damage system and do stuff like above so easily. "Pvp" lasts for 2 seconds. I don't think they really thought this out much but, The best way to deal with these things is just jump server or set up counter ambushes. 
---
Yup, 100%.
---
Next time I get up that way i will!   I have visited the static displays at Aberdeen Md, might still have some pictures somewhere.
---
Ahhh thank you, I just assumed it would carry over since they allowed the progress to carry over. I just noticed it said like only 76% of players have left vault 76
---
But that's the best part :(
---
My tesla shotgun does pretty well and a dump  for it
---
If you look closely, you will notice that it’s just icon of prairie dog, those animals icons are scattered all around the map just for flavor.
---
ahhh that’s hot
---
The second one. 
---
It's called being "railroaded". Choosing not to complete the game isn't a choice.
---
Thank you to the down vote bots.
---
Since it's your frist time with this mutation, the downside is chems are 50% less effective (including RadAway). You can use the Luck perk "Class Freak" to reduce the downside of this (and all mutations) by 75%, down to about 13%.
---
/u/Blake6332 did up a nice thing with all the mutations. I don't have their post, but the document is here:
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QI7BB4vaii1FlkMyuLaSb_juqfFw2tGoeZab8x5Dew0/edit#gid=0
---
Good, now players can actually use Whitespring.
---
Goodness do you have excavator armor with calibrated shocks?? 
---
No no no. Energy weapons should be the pinnacle of modern warfare and since the release of Fallout 4 they have been an absolute joke. Instigating Plasma Gatling with 48 damage? It's not good enough. In Fallout 3 I used to hoard Plasmas and loved the A3-21 unique, now I've built a melee build.
---
Protect. And. Serve.
---
thats not how truth works. You can deduce that there may be another dupe method. You don’t actually know that.
---
Well if you take Power User Rank 2 gatling lasers also benefit from it so you can get 1,000 shots per core. For boss enemies I find it useful as a sustain fire weapon.
---
I think it's only 45% (15% per star, 3 stars). But I do agree that the way they are doing it isn't exactly right. This essentially makes Fireproof, as well as Blocker, essentially mandatory. They are just too damn good to pass up. Which reduces the variety of possible builds. 
---
I’m not triggered. Just pointing out there is always going to be something to complain about. I may have misunderstood that you were talking about the stacking of magazines and bobble heads and for that I apologize. I do agree that this is an issue. Although no I don’t play a sg build. I have one melee build level 120+, a rifle build 105ish, and a heavy gunner character I’m currently working on. Sg makes the game to easy with its spread. I agree that overflow of TSE has caused issues but I had my TSE handmade before the stupid fluctuation in them appearing. I responded to pvp on your comment by accident. 
---
How do you know?
---
If you haven’t noticed the legendary drop rate for 2 &amp;3 star legendary items is almost gone at the white springs. So it’s hasn’t been viable since the holiday patch.
---
Yeah I know and I’m probably whining. I just don’t like losing stuff. 
---
There’s no reason for them to penalise us when crafting - the ballistic fibre issue. The game is not being juked from people crafting
---
Did you notice if the lever action rifle animation was fixed? 
---
With mules, the stash limit didn't stop anything.
---
Oh can't wait to see
---
Doing the Enclave's work :D
---
/r/fallout76settlements
---
Nice! I still have been meaning to try out the Bloatfly barrel! I want to kill some super mutants and see flies come out.
---
FINALLY! I’ve been wanting this since I play a sniper build. 
---
yep, that 24% of remaining people have the same issue.. me included
---
*Fixed Lever-Action Rifle animation, Player now reloads the correct amount of bullets.
---
Whelp, goodbye Quad Lever-Action Rifle. It was fun while it lasted.
---
*Legendary Hunting Rifles now drop
---
OH H e l l o
---
Nope, just a loooot of patience and Nuka Cola Cherry. 
---
I want that power armor!
---
It'd be nice if they lowered the level requirement on White Knight from 39 to 25, to match the repair requirements. I still need 4 per item, though I'm getting close, level 38.
---
If you don't fix all the things at once don't bother patching at all REEEEE
---
They put a bigger book under the table leg holding it up.
---
I'm also a bit disappointed that we need to wait a bit longer till we get the patch. Probably not Bethesda's fault but caused by that stupid update approval system of Sony and Microsoft.
---
The bacteria on the exterior eventually grow up to be dupers.
---
Hey man, you didn't see anything develop on those power armors did you. I got super excited over how they could possibly look, and been specifically saving up like 4000 atoms incase
---
I dont have to imagine, I just have to drop by r/Fallout for a few minutes. 
---
&gt; It's to cut down on RMT
---
Can't see how. RMT will occur whether or not the cap limit is 5k. People also tend to just buy the items they want, not useless caps.
---
&gt; deincentivize duping 
---
They should fix it, "deincentivize" it. Hopefully the "duping "fix"" we got today is better than the last 6 tries.
---
That's original content, my friend. At least, I think it is...
---
I'm not sure, but what platform are you on? Once you have an answer, i'd like to see if i can get your pure cobalt.
---
Very interested to see what I can do with my anti-armor gauss rifle, now.
---
now my qaud lever action is gonna take forever to reload instead of reloading five rounds and it counting as twenty
---
I've been dropping missiles and fusion cores at peoples feet when I see them.. most jump on the bag, and snatch them up before I can even leave the menu lol
---
No one on ps4 or xbox, that's for sure!
---
Yeah that wasn't necessaries, i mean now it is even more unattractive to go for non power armor builds :/
---
Still no fix for the fact that a lot of people still cannot join a team? I've been playing on ps4 since beta and I have yet to once start a team with my friend. Not once. My friend and I aren't mad, we're just sorely, sorely disappointed. Actually, we're also mad. 
---
I don't know why but, I like picking love picking locks. 
---
Yeah.. oh oops, my health is low, now i one shot everything including legendaries with a melee weapon.  Sorry no loot for you!  
---
Pretty sure the ones you use as camp generators can’t spawn them, as they’re slightly different visually. Most of the others around the world do though! For example in the basement of the ammunition factory there’s a reliable spawn!
---
Because I’ve used all varieties of the armor piercing mags. The only differences is ammo capacity and reload speed.
---
Lol, true... 
---
No Flux is a player made item that you trade for or make yourself 
---
Theres only one piece that can and it's a quest reward
---
I had a goal of getting all my power cores up to 100 before they patched it...now I am sad. But all my cores are either 99 or 100 now, about an even split...all 74 of those bastards. 
---
Fortunately, most of those are available in just a few hours play 
---
Is that why I always way 110 pounds bug ass naked???
---
Real talk. I want the plans to make my own signs.
---
I’ve been looking forward to this. 
---
I’m hoping to get an instigating twoshot sniper. All my sneak mods (2.5x on shot, 75% sneak, 40% more damage with single shot rifles ) would be killer. I’m already doing stupid amounts of damage with my legendary TSE dragon but I only use that on rare occasions since the weapon breaks so easily. 
---
Im so excited! 
---
There's one on eBay now.
---
Seems like they still haven't fixed the glitch where your power armor does not provide the carry bonus that it should sometimes on logging in.
---
"It's usink dzeh treees!"
---
The power plant workshops have been fixed so they produce 8 cores an hour (up from .8/hr). Need cores grab the workshops and get 24 in an hour.
---
Outside of any major city or town might be worth a try. 
---
I usually like doing my 'shopping' at railroads. Usually have a nice stash of caps and goods to trade. Maybe hitch a tradepost near one of the more popular ones?
---
Well.. here's an interesting thread for info on just that. 
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aedxlm/hard_numbers_on_armor_piercing_qualities_data_for/
---
I call them traits, but thank you kindly.
---
Ok! I will. Appreciate this. I may even have it but assumed it would be lame. 
---
The pvp is fairly inconsequential though. If you posse up it's quite fun.
---
where/how do you even get scout armor?
---
Yeah, it's basically part of the endgame. How much of the main quest have you done?
---
I seriously wonder how people have lag problems and disconnects. I never have crashes or DC on xbox and my internet took 4 days to download 76
---
So it's just like how a pound of feathers weighs more than a pound of rice?
---
Or you know, Microsoft and Sony require patches to be certified before pushing them out, but let's go with the whole "persecuted PC Master Race" thing. 
---
It is very real, try it with a cheap mod made with something like steel. Drop your steel in a world container by a bench while you do it. The mod will pop up in the confirmation menu to be broken down for the necessary parts. 
---
You better put defenses around that balcony or youre just looking for a lawsuit 
---
Beer...The animation is the character drinks a beer then starts swinging.
---
It will still remain nuke zone of choice due to the rate you can collect legendaries. Yes 99% of those will still suck and be vendor trash, but it’s still best drop per hour on em. 
---
Thanks for confirming that! Do you have the data from those tests? I'd love to collaborate and add it to my post:  
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aeb6gk/damage\_dr\_and\_pvp/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aeb6gk/damage_dr_and_pvp/)
---
Couldnt agree more
---
I wonder if they will patch the Fallout 4 version. 
---
No guaranteed spawns, sorry.
---
I can make them if you have the junk. (PC)
---
I'm going to upvote both of your comments because that is how right you are. 
---
Nuke Zones are kinda meh. Not enough variety in creatures outside of Cranberry Bog.
---
From a former “I will only play solo” player, accept a random team invite once in awhile. It’s usually someone looking just to run around for fun or they need help on a quest. I am very high level and get asked a ton to help people who are stuck or getting overwhelmed by the level 91 Deathclaw at Whitespring. When I began, I assumed I would always play solo. Now, I enjoy the mix. From my experience 99.99 percent of the other players are great people. Join a server, send a team invite, see what happens. It’s fun. 
---
My camp is near the thunder mountain power substation tm 02. I built a big brick cabin around the junk pile, and I was able to fit a small water purifier in it too. Only my front door is locked, so if I leave it open anyone can get any of my stuff. And I have a heavy laser turret and a rocket turret to kill the ants and death claws that spawn in the substation.
---
I saw a scorchbeast but it didn’t care about my camp. Do you recommend anywhere that I can set up a camp
---
I would love the stuff from cc to show up 8n game or in the atom shop if its cosmetic
---
Ditto
---
And also nerf both 2 shot and explosive prefixes as they are noth absolutely overpowered. They should also be in different tiers and not be compatible with each other. There is no reason everyone should be able to one shot every enemy in the game outside of SBQ.
---
Also increase the level cap on legendary weapons and increase enemy level/difficulty
---
I have this problem on pc, but I'm not stuck in power armor after I exit it. I was wondering why everyone I teamed up with would laugh at me. Also, new players I'd try to help out would run. I'm a freaking slender man monster! :) I'll try this fix tonight though. I really want to be cured.
---
A jackhammer esque melee weapon attachment would also be nice. 
---
Hording
---
@bethesdagamestudios
---
This game sucks. And I spent $60 on it. 
---
Send out a friend request to random people you are on a server with, someone will always friend you. Then you find a nice out of the way container to dump your spare items in. Log out and quickly switch characters and then use Social to log back into the server the person who just friend you is on. Quickly run to the container you dumped your loot in and then pick it back up. It's risky, but it works if none of your standard friends are around to use to hold your stuff.
---
I think it depends on how many people are in the zone. My brother and I did it with just us 2 yesterday. We dont have anything spectacular in regards to weapons either. 
---
Why would you ever need more than 5-10?  Do you really break that many picking a lock?
---
&gt; They haven't touched a number of them which don't exist including the pipe revolver.
---
So you're saying that unless we tell them about it, the developers don't know that legendary pipe revolvers are not dropping? I guess I just have more confidence in them than you.
---
&gt; since you're clearly from /fallout
---
I appreciate your attempt to gatekeep this sub, but if I'm *"from"* anywhere it would be one of the Battlefield subs since that's what I joined reddit to participate in. Fallout 76 didn't exist when I joined reddit. The Fallout sub probably existed back then though.
---
If we're playing this game you're not from r/fo76 either. I see you on the pokemon trading sub, is that where you're "from"?
---
assuming this is with the new update for pc? 
---
I assumed that the power armor headlight was weak because I didnt have any mods on my helmet, and that a higher level mod would give me brighter light... guess it just sucked that bad lol 
---
It's normal sized doors, whitewashed wooden one and the 2 red bathroom ones, they are in the regular door menu
---
So, not legitimately then.
---
What does enforcer actually do?
---
I **NEED** a gatling gun skin/black powder skin and a civil war themed skin for X-01.
---
Every character is a Quicksave file on a 5-10 minute timer ... only one. No backup. You mess up your Quicksave ... well sorry.
---
To the OP: This is tragic that it happened. Sadly this is going to happen to more people because the concept of Multiplayer and Multiplayer Online Support never entered the minds of someone.
---
I honestly not know how anyone who has spent any time in an online game environment wouldn't be aware of the fact that servers/characters need to be placed in a save state for troubleshooting, logging and error correction. 
---
Rollbacks happen - infrequent but they do. Servers crash, characters have issues and the tools to do so have been around for decades. 
---
I love Fallout and I luckily have had few issues but this issue just highlights how unready Bethesda was for the Online Multiplayer world they fumbled together.
---
Not bashing FO76 ... love the game but the way it is cobbled together is a disaster.
---
No.
---
First learn to program then pay for servers.
---
CPU power is not a solution for doing things the wrong way.
---
Hopefully that is functionality we'll see down the road. 
---
Maybe maybe not. Fallout 76 can't either. Biggest disappointment as a gamer this year by far. Normally I would be so lost in a Bethesda game. Skyrim came out I went on vacation to no-life it. Same for Oblivion fallout 3 and fallout 4. Fallout 76? I played it pretty intensely for a few days and then it fell off. I bought red dead 2 about a week after 76 came out and relative to 76 it seems like it's from the future. I felt bamboozled.
---
So you do know what he means then. FOV support = ability to change it in game, especially for console users who can’t modify the file. 
---
Doesn't sound like. 
---
Funny thing is it DID damage to me with his Poison Powder attack even though I was on her team.  
---
But we'll try the Whitespring robot assassins, thank you for that tip, mate.
---
Can confirm, also the scripting dudes adjusting item values in the creation kit are not the same as the engineering dudes that work on the engine. Different kinds of bugs between teams. 
---
Comparing their exp to other enemies, they were worth more than scorchbeasts, mirelurk queens, and super mutants, all of which are far harder to kill, not so cheezable, and can dish out realistic damage to end game level players. None of which the ghouls could really do, I have ghoulish and their melee attacks practically healed me faster than deal damage, combined with a rad sponge sharing team mate they were practically declawed kittens compared to their reward levels.
---
Ty!! I wish I new that 24hrs ago and not wasted time and Caps!!
---
Yep. There is enough wrong with the game to not bother legitimate crafters at this time. Jeeze, for the past 3 days I keep getting the "kill a wendigo while wearing a clown suit" mission even though I completed it each time. Opening up my stash when its close to full still crashes the game for me. But crafting? I really haven't had an issue. 
---
Its an equipable perk... If a player wants to put that in their build, it should make those weapons less effective against them in pvp.  I don't see what the problem is.
---
Both a life and a wife sound like XP wastes, so I'll pass. :\^)
---
Thanks for the input though, bud.
---
Ive had mod's disappear from my inventory after i quit the game and loaded up the next time i logged it. Shystie if you ask me
---
Its not intended.
---
I made an alt and are level 15 i got a hazmat suit and hopped whitesprings till i found a Nuke.
---
I was level 23 in one nuke. 
---
On the topic of atom shop, is the Old Possum sign a neon light?
---
My character looks like this all the time on pc. I hope it's fixed soon. Everyone laughs at me and it's making me sad.
---
PS4/PC, but I mostly only play on PS4 now.
---
afaik they only debuffed the Queen's damage mitigation (armor). The platform question is a good point as previous Fallout games have had some hit detection, etc, differences between platforms. I think there's also some player memory questions - you know, like the first time you did the silo was probably a nightmare but today you can solo it...
---
Scorchbeasts were a nightmare in BETA in general, and not much more fun after release, but then I learned about Dense and the semi-auto rifle cripple. Cripple both wings and the head to turn them into fluffy pinatas. Worked from release to now.
---
I am certain that most of my scorchbeast kills (normal, not queen) are in the air with Heavy Guns. They do their "air stagger" animation over and over. If I stop shooting them they'll land, but if I keep shooting they just stagger in the air constantly. That makes me really lean toward thinking you're on to something with the stagger animation preventing them from landing.
---
As for nightmare scorchbeasts, there are still plenty that get locked into "infinite scream" state. That hasn't changed at all.
---
all about style!
---
Be wary of the PA skin particularly if they don't show the full image or a close up of it in the store -- I foolishly spent like 1000 (game earned) caps on the Santa one.  Turns out the paint just kind trails off at the knees and gives the overall suit the look of drunk Santa Dan Aykyrod in Trading Places when he's stuffing salmon into his pockets.
---
Right? The plan descriptions are too vague! I never know what I'm buying! 
---
It's a 15min timer from placement. If you place it an then again in 15 min it will keep going up. Either rejoin a new server or wait 15min.
---
Excuse me it’s “praise Todd”
---
Yep pity I ain’t getting those back, that’s close to 2k caps lost right there I’d like compensation Bethesda 
---
My bad, you’re right on the ranks. And I agree with your point, even on my explosive build I’m gonna take this.
---
Still easy to get alot of it, and make alot of it thanks to Ammo Smith and Super Duper
---
*Gimme five pins for a quarter, you'd say. ^^^Now ^^^where ^^^was ^^^I... ^^^oh ^^^yeah. ^^^The ^^^important ^^^thing ^^^was ^^^that ^^^I ^^^had ^^^a ^^^Deathclaw's ^^^testicle ^^^tied ^^^to ^^^my ^^^belt, ^^^which ^^^was ^^^the ^^^style ^^^at ^^^the ^^^time.*
---
Specifically, somebody fat-fingered the change. It was supposed to go from 12 to 8, but digging into the files showed they had set 0.8 instead. The in-game display just isn't setup to handle decimals, so it rounded to 1.
---
+karma
---
Hey at least thats one more than I've ever got man lol
---
I would like there to be a bundle of different raider armors. Some that have street sign pieces, some like the ones from The Pitt and so on. 
---
Nice!
---
I've had this mutation for most of my play time and honestly I want to get rid of it, but if you want to waste 3 points in Class Freak, and also have your chems working less effectively, less damage, less stats, ultimately needing to use more Stimpacks and Rad-Aways when you need them etc.
---
The Pack
---
It is nothing like the trade theft rumor. It is a qol fix rather than a bug fix, but very much needs changed. 
---
Killing them all at once crashed the server once.
---
I tried this on xbox. Out of 30 or so workshop caps total i only ever had one person that tried to take one from me.  This game is full of PVE'ers And the pvp it does have is broken. Still does not make workshops end game when they provide no end game gear...
---
It says it is being addressed...
---
You won't have long to wait before the new DLC drops, they committed to it by the end of the month. Have fun.
---
Yeah it’s ridiculous they should just remove it from the scrap able list altogether, it’s almost like adding a weapon in there lol
---
[i like your style](https://imgur.com/a/DxQ8fZe)
---
The stash is somewhat tolerable for me at the moment, but I also have 0 weapons and 0 armor pieces in my stash because its easier for me to carry my armor and weapons on me due to weapon and armor weight reduction perks.. It should not have to be like this. 
---
As for CAMP improvements.. I have no idea where to start. I get so salty every time I am building things for my camp or redoing a camp. 
---
issues ranging from budget size to restrictions on what you can snap to what. The need of stairs to connect a floor to a wall is annoying. Also the fact that you can't choose the way a wall faces when clipped to a floor is equally annoying. 
---
you have covered a good bit already. 
---
I usually just give up on trying to make a cool design for my camp. 
---
I hope some QOL changes are coming, but I lose hope on a timely fix when I see things like bobby pin weight being a major fix in a patch 2 months after release. 
---
Even considering the Holiday season downtime, that should have been fixed a lot quicker. 
---
I hope for the timeliness of hefty updates to improve though. 
---
I find your lack of faith in raider power armor disturbing. 
---
Dont forget the pve vs pvp rift in this sub.
---
Everyday there are threads from pve'ers trying to make changes to punish pvpers even further than the ridiculous bountys we already get.
---
Hurr dur please bethesda punish people more for playing pvp
---
Junk extractor makes these things.
---
I almost always get one stars off of her, actually. 
---
It's balancing not punishment
---
They’d blast all their ap away getting to u then be basically crippled
---
I'm going to continue to wait this one out. It appears most of my immediate greviouses have been fixed, but Bethesda wasted all the good will I had for their company.   
---
PvP still doesn't make sense, PvE lacks substance, and most of all, none of my friends want to play this game after it's disastrous launch.   
---
I wanted to like you 76. I really did. 
---
Haven't played in a while but if I waited like 15 seconds before hoping it seemed to fix it.
---
&gt;as for the rest of the points, the game is designed to be grindy. its their way of prolonging the life of the game since the new content hasnt released yet.
---
But it hasn't prolonged the game, it's created a huge drop-off in the player base.
---
Then stop asking for content.
---
The bug is the extra 100 carry weight.  That isn't supposed to be there, so when you exit the PA and re-enter, it resets to the correct weight.  
---
76 is a prequel to things to come like the radstorm in 2130...
---
This happens to me constantly. We now use small cooking stations to pull ourselves out of the wall
---
Same issues with A. 
---
Agreed!
---
So currently theres a bug where if you log in wearing your excavator power armor it gives you 200 carry weight when its supposed to only give 100. Getting out and back in resets it to the proper 100
---
Enclave. 
---
 It is nice but I don't think it's worth it. You can get regenerating armor pieces and perks that do something similar, or just eat some food that is so easy to come by if you grow some at your CAMP. But yeah it works out of combat. 
---
Ppl didn't start duping bc that was a fast way to get stuff. They did it to exploit the market and earn caps and rl cash.
---
Dupe a few thousand TSE weapons and sell them for $5 - $20 each on Ebay ... do the math.  They don't give a shit about the game.
---
Why you got to bring up Ultima Online and make a guy get all nostalgic. 
---
I've experienced a DC countless times outside of a silo. its because of exploiters and glitchers. Im also on console where that shit runs rampant. It is unfortunate because I enjoy the game and want to make a nrw character but would rather not leave my first character unfinished. 
---
Fallout 4 had a few ones.  That would be awesome!
---
I don't think I've ever been able to stick around there for longer than 2 minutes at any time.
---
Or....it's part of the game. In every previous Bethesda game people would play as evil characters. Absolutely no difference here.
---
 \&gt;**Crafting:** Level 25 armor and above now requires ballistic fiber to craft.
---
\*fuck\*
---
**&gt;Repairing:** Component quantities required to repair mid to high level armor and weapons have been reduced up to 20%. **DevNote:** Repair costs scale with level, and there's room to reduce costs at higher levels.
---
\*oh ok\*
---
I see about 5-10 posts a day, usually late afternoon to evening, with people dropping nukes. They usually get between 2-10 responses 
---
One of the vaults held frozen embryos of various creatures. Something went wrong, radiation affected the embryos and now we have the variety of creatures we see. Another vault was a "seed vault" holding various plant life. 
---
Well, if you're _the_ Will Wright, that would make us "2nd"s on LinkedIn: https://i.imgur.com/NbCnLwM.png
---
(We both worked with a certain snarky-but-clever british programmer.)
---
If you're a different Will Wright, then if I ever had anything to do with your enjoyment of a game, I'm glad to hear you had a good time, and you're welcome.
---
I’m a solo player in all games but I accept and appreciate all team requests when I’m being hammered by scorched! My experience so far has just been people waving hello, sending a request and then doing our own things nearby each other. 
---
As a lowly level 9, if you see me online (UK) I’d always appreciate the help :)
---
Surely fixing the fact that we don't know which plans we have in a trade menu is an easy fix, right?
---
No bid deal.
---
Haha, blame my phone network. That's what I get for posting in a Subway. 
---
I bought the game for 60 bucks, and I would absolutely love to buy atoms if I felt Bethesda earned it and it was worth the money. 
---
For some reason I was scared to play new Vegas idk why it was when I was like 11 I just left goodsprings super jumpy and just quit. Same with 3 but i got back into NV last year but I never played 3 again cause i lost the disc but i finished nv this year.
---
Add that plus dense armor and you might be shrugging those TSE shots off?
---
"trade cap limit increased from 5000 to 25000" does that mean the standard cap limit has been increased too?
---
I have a quad single action revolver...
---
I'll see you in 5 years when I've reloaded these bullets
---
Yes this is with the new update.
---
I never said it's working, I just said why. 
---
You actually looks like a cool guy. Go on and have fun :D
---
Now I need to find a lake, or body of water, that I can build my camp completely on. As in not touching dry land at all. 
---
xbox hasn't had the patch yet. So of cause nothing has changed.
---
It would be cool to pick a central location to dump unused ammo types, so others know where to browse for it.  Like Top of the World or Whiteprings train station registers.  I've got loads of unused ammo types I need to lose.  
---
Legendary commie Wacker and protest signs would be the awesome
---
What's not legitimate about transferring all your weapons and items from your main(s) to mule alts?
---
Just invest in a backup gun that you use when you’re fighting a flying enemy
---
So much so this.
---
XP farming at WS was getting ridiculous
---
Fixes that should've been addressed and fixed before release.
---
No. Lets wait and see if duping is fixed before we add anymore legendary drops.
---
Fix of fov in scopes.
---
One of the Enclave quests I believe
---
I found one ammo bag last night!
---
I knew I was right to put all my points in LCK!
---
Cant remember whay exact one but it's from the enclave
---
It works fine now :3
---
Valid points. 
---
I do kind of think exp is a bit generous for pretty much all enemies except for scorchbeasts and mirelurk queens.
---
I have a feeling with the amount of nukes Whitesprings is about to be hit with on consoles between now and then, it will never lose the glow.
---
I also find hilarious how many of those threads are made complaining about people that complain giving them even more attention.
---
And then complain in a Edit how they get downvoted.
---
Stop crying.
---
Bountys dont stop pvp. We all have plenty of caps. Shit doesnt matter. I grind 800 caps so i can go lose them being a raider. Everyday. And i have 10k cap cushion beyond that.
---
Pvpers are bored and will be until we have some sort of arena or progression. A real pvp mechanic. Pvp currency, gear, vendors. 
---
Just dont take the bait. 
---
It took be 300 hours of game play to find the one and only x-o1 jet pack mod I have found. RnGesus is a mean sob 
---
People duped because they could. Good legendaries are supposed to be hard to get, get over it. 
---
After the patch fixing it today on PC and people still getting constant disconnects I believe that Dupers weren't the ONLY problem with DC. I think it was quite a part in it but the servers still are kicking constantly.
---
&gt; Weapons: Fixed an issue where several combat rifle automatic receiver mods were prevented from receiving automatic rifle perk bonuses.
---
Shoot, I wonder if this will "fix" the two shot combat rifle I got a couple days ago.  I noticed that the automatic receivers did almost as much damage as hardened (I think they did the same damage as the next tier down for semi-auto).  I wonder if it was using my Rifleman perks, since I had no automatic weapon perks.
---
figured as much.. on ps4 was so about to jump on and scrap those dame 30 purifiers sad day
---
food and water rates displayed on harvesters are per camp not per harvester, so 17/food/hour across the camp, if you have more than 17 plants only 17 of them will produce food in that hour. 
---
same goes with water pumps, industrial produce 60 water per hour TOTAL, so ever minute one of the pumps is randomly selected and 1 unit of water added to it. AND they have a cap of 5 units of water so they just stop producing water altogether when they hit that. 
---
HOWEVER: public workshops dont have this issue all pumps at public workshops produce water at a consistent rate and are independent of each other. If you build 3 pumps all 3 will produce the same amount of water at the same time. 
---
They still have the limit of 5. I could have swore i saw 10 water in a industrial water purifier once but that was patches ago. 
---
Hahaha, same here man. I thought I was missing out. 
---
Serious issue on PC after Jan 10 patch (had no problems whatsoever like this before):
---
My view "jumps" X degrees horizontally at random. Makes the game unplayable for me. Seems to occur more often when indoors or when moving/strafing at the same time. 
---
Let me just aim at thi- no, I'll aim 90 degress to the right in an instant instead.
---
Anyone else experience this?
---
Yeah, this also confused me.  It certainly seemed like it was an energy rifle.
---
&gt; Of course it doesn't make sense and there will alway be people playing like that which ruins it
---
Because of duping, it has actually become the norm.   Nearly every time I go to white springs, there's at least one guy with a TSE one- shot killing everything in sight and making it impossible for anyone else to get XP and loot. 
---
I also see them at the Uranium fever event nearly every time I go. 
---
Nobody one- shot kills the queen, no matter what weapon they have.  I know guys with TSE who I teamed up with against the queen who were all like "I got a TSE and can take her out solo. Don't worry we got this!" 
---
Ten minutes later, they are all like "Oh man, if more people don't show up soon we aren't gonna kill her!" 
---
SBQ is the one fight that TSE assholes can't ruin. 
---
Don't assume too much. I was playing the game until two days ago, when the _constant_ disconnects and crashes finally got to me, and I don't see them crowing about those being fixed (they say server stability is improved every single patch, so that's meaningless in the face of the constant degradation thereof), so even if I limit my complaint to that, it's still valid.
---
Imagine gauss rifle is now on another level of good. 
---
&gt; Lifetime Challenges: Fixed an issue where some lifetime challenges would revert progress after logging out
---
How's that going to work for current players that have already (e.g.) learned X plans?
---
Maybe it's because we're taking the patches with a grain of salt because of 76's release. I would be more grateful for these patches if the final product felt actually finished.
---
They actually noted a fix to that above
---
"Systems: Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated."
---
whats wrong? 
---
They've changed the fireproof perk so that not many people are going to die from explosive damage XD
---
Sorry bud, couple more days and you'll be free
---
They go together like lamb and tuna fish though...
---
There are a LOT more daily challenges with issue besides the specific ones listed.  I have many that are greyed out and can’t be completed/repeated.  For the love of Mr. Fuzzy, please fix Camden Park dailies.  I need those tokens. 
---
Meanwhile the guy with the 4 shot lever action is off crying in the corner.
---
If you’re on PS4 I could give you 300 caps and whatever plans I have that you don’t already have. 
---
events or vendors?
---
So first we bitch about updates being too big and now they are too small. I bet you’re a real joy at parties
---
You listened. Heck, you even opened my downvoted thread to come see what I had to say.
---
Have a little fun, go to a lower level area, and use all that ammo.... 
---
Usually it’s not too terrible, you’ll find it in market subs running 30-50 each on a good day. Ultracite I’ve never even seen listed, it’s super easy to get. 
---
Is there a possibility of getting a 1360x768 resolution?
---
Still no increased size for the stash :(
---
If you’re high enough level, just farm the sentry bots at Whitespring. Seems like 95% of the time they drop a fusion core between 50-90% capacity. Sometimes they straight up give you nothing though, like most of the Whitespring robots.
---
Ah yes, more atomic shop stuff! Can someone please make this a meme format? Something like:
---
“Game destroying bugs, dupe glitches, and a broken pvp system... lemme just release atomic shop stuff”
---
Exactly what I was referencing, yea.
---
&gt; Weapons: Fixed an issue that prevented the Gauss Rifle from being identified as a rifle. Now rifle-related perks can be applied to the Gauss Rifle.
---
Wow i didnt even realize, My instigating Gauss is now going to be even stronger 😁
---
Bethesda responded to some people on here about that so I’ll bet it gets into the late Jan patch. Hopefully anyway. 
---
That is actually a profound observation
---
Don't worry they'll be able to add them back in with their robust player account editing tools that don't exist.
---
Having PvP cost caps in general is asinine 
---
maximum damage boost from anti armor legendary affix is 29% by fallout systems. but it isn't maintained always.
---
if your damage has reached 4.8 times   than enemy's armor, then starting lost  benefits from anti-armor. if your damage has reached 6.8 times   than enemy's armor, then lost all of benefits from anti-armor.
---
also explosive weapons are bypasses enemy's armor. because it is special damage types like bleed or poison.
---
I like the lore related analogy.
---
&gt; It seems that all those people who idolize NV as the best thing
---
You mean all of the people that jumped into downvote and harass anyone that _liked_ NV when it first came out and now have switched sides to attack anyone who likes any other part of the franchise...
---
It's not easy being trendy.
---
I used both those weapons for a long while and I’ve never seen that issue on reload. Only when I select the weapon. 
---
Pitchforks. The setting is crying out for legendary pitchforks. 
---
Useless change. I never carry more than 20 and I never run out. Now 1000 weighs half as much as my 20 did, obliterating any value, feeling of anxiety for breaking one, or feeling of relief for finding some if you're low. At this weight, why even have them in the game? They were fine the way they were.
---
"No a person is smart, people are dumb panicky animals and you know it."
---
Will this be useful as i one shot almost anything?
---
&gt; with the fusion core gener
---
I refuse to thank them for finally fixing issues that should never have been in a released. game  Still upset that I paid $60 for the honor of doing their beta testing.
---
I used the stats from your sheet to make one that's also taking the weight into account and adds everything up ([click](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aeie14/armor_best_mod_dderrrweight_spreadsheet/)). But it's not nearly as overseeable/neat ofc. So both should be held up-to-date imho. :-)
---
If I see a low level with a bounty I don't kill them because I'm not a jerk.
---
You don’t get a bounty, but their team can do full damage to you. That’s what I’m saying. 
---
Even if they’re not red to you, you’re red to them when someone on their team is killed (aka the wanted player) therefore they can all do full damage and kill you. 
---
I think that only has to do with the time the ideas were formulated.
---
u tarded?
---
And I just dumped my extras yesterday.  :(
---
I am kind of liking the idea of police robots that have armor and weapon levels that make them difficult to kill.
---
Thanks Bethesda, very cool.
---
Aww damnit.... Now y'all are gonna force me to make lifestyle changes :/ I like my loadout the way it is.
---
I need a behemoth serum, so I can carry, like, a dump truck ;)
---
I always play energy weapons and was royally pissed off by discovering how crappy every single energy weapon was. It's like they didn't do any testing with them. My build was heavy into intelligence for the science perks and learning how bad it really was forced me to reroll.   
---
I hadn't found a guass yet but after finding out that plasma and laser gat sucked, it didn't surprise me the guass rifle was broken too. 
---
Crafting: Lowered chance of Power Generators of spawning fusion cores.
---
"sigh....."
---
Hmm, I have a feeling they’ll consider this too good.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’d like something like this too.
---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_, what will be done about the unfair advantage gained by players that have duplicated items or exploited grenade traps or crafting/scrapping walking canes for experience?
---
Tbh, yeah. at least the way the game mechanics are now, it’s so broken. 
---
This is excellent stuff.  Keep it up Bethesda.
---
I hope the entering Power Armor bug gets fixed soon.  (I am aware of the Fusion Core work around though)
---
Awesome, thanks for sharing, verified V9, and added the others to the original post still pending verification.
---
This made me chuckle. Thanks. :)
---
always wanted more bosses like the ones mention but honestly forgot about how broken melee is.. never see melee users anymore all tse weapons.but i agree they would need to buff damage or healthpool for them.. or give them an aoe knockback? 
---
Totally hear you on this.  My main is stealth sniper but now doing a melee alt.  Some things I’ve found help:
---
* go to third person, this helps orient against enemies scurrying around your feet or past you on the side
---
* figure out the width of the hit box of your swing and lead the targets a bit.  It seems to matter only what happens for hitbox detection on the server not the client, so if they are spinning around you, swing ahead of them a bit 
---
* when absolutely needed, use VATS to land a hit or teleport up to a ledge
---
* against ie ghouls and mole rats, walk slightly backwards so they run in front of you instead of past, or stand still while they run towards you and time your swing.  When we run at each other the hits don’t seem to land, like we went through or past each other.  
---
* for scorchbeast......I have no idea. Let me know if you figure something out.  I’m about to get marsupial, is that enough to jump up and land a hit?  Would bird bones help? 
---
Space station with "drop pods".
---
The army abandoned this idea IRL because sweet jesus was it cost-ineffective.
---
...and now I’m kicking myself for not making Money Pit jokes for the past month.
---
He is probably in power armor. 
---
Nerf melee too, until explosive weapons everyone that want to kill anyone or anything would use melee builds. Hell, If you want to kill the Queen in one minute you still use melee.
---
Killing in a pvp zone is not greifing 
---
What's wrong with them?
---
Honestly bud all I’m hearing is whining about a minor annoyance, especially since its a thing that should only be able to trick a person once. 
---
Awesome thanks for the post, haven't managed to verify it yet, but posted it to the original post with asterisks in the meantime.
---
With no in-universe reason it’s a bizarre addition, and screams “reused assets.”
---
Yeah, but TSE+90% WR posts are still fair game.
---
loser.
---
Oh Walter.
---
All those quest fixes are nice but i'll never get to them because i cant repair the uplinks i need. 
---
Or rather, i did, but it didnt count and the next time I logged in they werent in my inventory. And now the materials wont spawn to make them again.
---
Generators are the ones you find out in the wild you can pull a Core out of (and they do a shut down sound/lighting effect). So those are going to be harder to find now.
---
Processors are the ones we find at Power Plants and actually make Cores. So that's getting buffed back up to 8 / hr.
---
Good test of the dupe fix will be to see if there’s suddenly 300 on eBay now.
---
Ehhh honestly, since we already have the "place object" thing it seems easier to go by that. 
---
My two-shot instigating lever (with med scope) was my best weapon, even reload bugged, hands down. Now it just became so much better. I just need to obtain better mods for it. 
---
This is mostly in response to low levels griefing camps, getting huge bounties to bait PvP and then they're buddies appear and claim a big level-based non-bounty reward. But if it isn't a problem, no solution required.
---
i would. PC?
---
Nice try, but you are wrong.  This is the only game with this issue and I'm not the only person to report it.
---
I'm pretty neutral on PVP but I know what you mean. If you _mention_ killing another player there are a ton of people itching to tell you that you've murdered someone's sweet and innocent child who spent their hard earned coal miner minor's allowance to purchase the game for virtuous reasons of feeding the hungry and homeless...
---
wat. This person shot a mininuke into my decon arch when they already had a 300 cap bounty and only carry 30 caps. Great. I get 30 caps, a busted decon arch, and they have the option to revenge.
---
"Both sides" of PVP are wonky. I don't know why the "anti-PVP" side is so vicious. Maybe they should work out some angst collecting bounties. :)
---
This dude wastelands.
---
"Hardened Mass"
---
My inner thirteen-year-old snickered at that.
---
Awesome! Thanks 
---
Thanks for not fixing the bug where you can't access the pip-boy if you die while exiting power armour. You'll get to it eventually, months after release. 
---
how is this done. i would love a mule alt
---
just wondering, is this the dark laminate flooring? I was thinking about getting it but wasnt sure how it would look in game and couldnt find people who took screen shots
---
Wait what? Where did you get that last bit of info?
---
I'm aware of the limitations but fail to see the issue?  What are you doing that causes this to be a problem that you would rather attempt to defend workshops against people with TSE weapons?
---
Personally, I use less water than 3 industrial purifiers make.  Less food than 8 corn plants make.  And I have a mutation that causes it to deplete faster and use lots of chems and never cure diseases.
---
I get the feeling they nerfed glowing exp since you can force re-spawn them and gain about 10-15 levels under the hour *(and/also to funnel out players for Whitespring -- don't think that'll be a thing though)*. Nevertheless, I doubt they nerfed it enough to not be worth the time anymore *(i.e even if they brought it down from 400-700 per mob to 200-300 per it's still the most efficient way)*. 
---
Lol by the time you're done reloading the Nuke Zone has cleared
---
The one change I never knew I wanted.
---
Harper's Ferry could be fun.
---
Overkill is best kill, I guess. 
---
The answer for this is more small enemies and zone attacks so melee players need to move and avoid getting gibbed.
---
This is what I'm really curious to know about as well.  If all of their dupped items turned into salt.  
---
the vendor doesnt stock everything once your reach the level cap for instance you can only get broadsider plans from lvl 45 to 49
---
Not as many balance changes as i'd like, and still no real touches to fix energy weapons, but a decent patch none the less.
---
Because they break after one clip?
---
Sorry, should have specified. Both. 
---
Just quit the game instead of wanting to piss off people who have nothing to do with your personal issue.
---
Well you shouldn't have to worry about logging out in a specific area and/or wearing specific apparel...
---
The game could just dump you in the next closest waypoint, or just at CAMP / Vault 76 if your last location is now a nuke zone...
---
How anyone can argue against that is fucking beyond me.
---
I have over 100 (the PA FC counter doesn't update past 99) and live in my PA. I think I'm good.
---
That's legit tested in game?
---
Have you shot someone else kitted the same way?
---
I do not disagree. I’ve said before that the level requirements for god weapons are far too low considering how easy it is to level up. 
---
How in the fuck do I keep getting these illnesses through my military grade power armor?
---
How? I don't understand.
---
We don't have steel roofs... we have tin roofs.
---
I’d just buy one. I bought several for 2.5-3k and I’ve only ever found one and I check every time I sell at the bunker vendor.
---
If you initiate PvP then you obviously want to PvP. So the safety net should be removed, not just for group members but for everyone for a period of time I think. Like if you hit another player you should turn red for like 15 minutes or something at least.
---
You claim the biggest feature in the patch was the weight reduction of bobby pins, while the entire community has been outraged over duping and performance/stability issues. That has now been addressed.
---
So Idk how your logic works, but I'd say that is the most prevalent thing in the patch. 
---
We will.
---
Interesting. Any idea what the cost increase is?
---
[Step Brothers job interview, anyone?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlrHo2ItFlM)
---
the will take more of a punishment than wood, but will still break
---
The steel walls will help but if you ultimately only care for defense, then make a 1x2 camp with everything sorta stuffed &amp; surround your camp with missile turrets. 
---
They could increase it to 2k and people are still gonna ask for more.
---
There are legendary lever and combat rifles already. 
---
That, and they do so little damage. You're only means to upping the damage is too change to the sniper barrel, but every type of sniper barrel is the same damage. Only perks help, but every other rifle at least doubles that damage it can do.
---
You forgot that LEGENDARY HUNTING RIFLES ARE A THING NOW!
---
White Knight perk card... cost 1 of each mat to repair basic armor.  Only need the perk on when you're repairing.
---
I can't remember the power armor one... but it lets you repair to 200% condition... I repair my power armor about once every other week.
---
As far as fusion cores go... they are EVERYWHERE.  I give away 20 a week easy.  Use 1 int point to run Power User perk... lowers consumption by 30%.
---
Does it impact the healing/regen from cannibal, photosynthesis, regen legendary ability, or vampiric weapon legendary? 
---
Legendary Deacthclaw Boss Balgozord confirmed 
---
No. The best you've got is missile turrets that stare at the floor.
---
If you're under attack by scorchbeasts consider moving your camp. When you quick travel to it you have a chance to spawn mobs and certain areas (Cranberry Bog, for example) have a higher chance to pop a scorchbeast.
---
The idea that killing a player in a pvp dedicated worshop zone is "greifing" is widely accepted around here. 
---
Buncha powderpuff fanboys. 
---
Thanks for the response!  Figured you needed another player character in order to get back on the same server.
---
Valid point. I don't want to and do not PvP, pacifist mode ftw. 
---
It was hilarious when someone stabbed me while I was defending their workshop and their turrets opened fire on me for no damage.
---
Like I said, if it isn't a problem then downvote and carry on.
---
Ohh, that would be soo good actually. Maximum 2 of each unique legendary should be enough for legit players right?
---
300 hours here and still killing the queen every night and enjoying it. I’m with ya brother, Ad Victoriam 
---
I've already named mine. Gonna be hard to see it go.
---
I generally stay to rooftops as I'm useless for melee in a nuke zone ATM. I can use a switchblade with PA but not a Deathclaw Gauntlet? Better yet a Power Fist? Such stupidity on Bethesda's part but I digress.
---
I hang out of the roof tops as I'm in a Hazmat Suit and am very squishy. I do wait several seconds trying to let all the surrounded players get their tags before raining down on the mobs. I don't know of any other way to make it work for all involved. Hopefully I'm not seen as a douche and I welcome any and all input on doing my part to better the game play for all.
---
Of course, Bethesda could just let me use my damned Power Fist and I could run around punching mobs as Todd intended.
---
Post sure seems like crying 
---
See its the Queen that worries me. What if no one gets involved 😂😂I'm fucked! 
---
depends it wouldnt work with 2 shot exsplsoive anti armour with armour peircing mags
---
They only weigh slightly more in-game than in real life.... How heavy do you think 0.1 lb is?
---
eh, super mutants throw molotovs, and it'll let me take my asbestos lining off.. if this perk reduces explosions on myself, than I'm maxing it out! I've killed myself plenty of times with my own grenades
---
I thought this patch was gonna give us the elder scrolls 6 demo, nothing is real
---
Good to see updates.  The things that were notably missing to me:
---
Balance changes for explosive shotguns and maybe other weapon types
---
Not auto-scrapping mods
---
Otherwise it’s what was needed!  Surprised to see all the repair changes but all good - it WAS weird to see ballistic fiber needed to repair a level 20 armor.  
---
Lol rockstar has been trying to catch car duplication glitches for five years 
---
Awesome! I can wait, just on. 
---
Was waiting for this comment. Pet Sounds is beyond incredible. 
---
There will always be bugs and serve issues, but the number/frequency is going down.  Refining the game is an ongoing process that takes a long time.  If you really don't want to deal the game as it is, check out for 6 months or a year then check back in and see what has been improved.  Is it fair that games are released in the state FO76 was at launch? Hell no, and you should complain about it to Bethesda.
---
Yeah I'm gonna give Beth more time to fix important broken things before I start harassing them about a metal slug not being phys damage, lawl.
---
About the Bowie knife,  tho....
---
Was in a Whitesprings nuke zone two nights ago and got five or six legendaries in half an hour. Still worth it. 
---
&gt; and gives the overall suit the look of drunk Santa Dan Aykyrod in Trading Places when he's stuffing salmon into his pockets.
---
Now you're speaking my language, I need this.
---
I’ve fought scorchbeasts without there being additional scorched to kill, they don’t always have groups with them, killing the group not forcing them to land could always just be a glitch though 
---
Yep...this has happened to me as well. Only ever seems like PA mods as well.
---
Well, all I can say is it doesn't happen on my PS4 (pro) / Sony TV.
---
I've seen problems on some early HDMI connected TVs where they reported the wrong screen size to the PS4.
---
They are nerfing the xp gain bc they want to increase the longevity of the game, and keep ppl playing. What is the point of playing if you are lvl 100 in one week? 
---
Legendary hunting rifles! yeet
---
At least the Munitions Depot wars are mostly over...
---
After the latest patch we'll have to see if the power stations get "griefed" now.
---
I mean...I’ll take it if you don’t want it anymore. I love quads.
---
My low alt has a level 5 quad .44 that’s fun as hell. Nothing like a 24-shot 6-shooter.
---
Question: What is a griefer? 
---
I bought all three (again), this time from the GoG holiday sale, 2 days before this was announced. Not a dig, I appreciate a freebie, but certainly bad timing.
---
Plasma gatling damage is alright now that it can hit, but it breaks way too fast to be a main weapon. I'm in the same boat of designing a build around it and realizing it's kinda crap.
---
You can literally just buy a better gun than that off the market for like 1-2k caps.
---
Yeah lol it’s probably the title
---
I am on GMT+530, but I have a flexible enough schedule to make things work (usually). I'm not on very frequently, although now I expect to have a bit more free time in hand this weekend onward. Nevertheless, I have been looking for people to play with, and would love to join you sometime.
---
I don't recall weapon or armor durability in fallout 1 or 2. Come to think of it I don't think it was in issue in fallout tactics either. Could be wrong it's been a while...
---
I get them not wanting it to be 0 like in FO4 but an entire pound is utterly ridiculous 
---
and I will not think and scrap all losing my hardened mass. 
---
no, that person could have collected them. That would be alternative way to obtain them, however unlikely. 
---
I would tend to agree with you, that they probably recieved them via some duplication exploit, but you as a player cannot know that, unless you witness it. You are using deduction to deduce that duplication is happening. It may not be, although the odds are very small.
---
I listen to podcasts while I play. I've never heard the beach boys in game. 
---
Why i use an anti armor explosive shoutgun, better spread and armor negation
---
Baseless attack. They misread the code and went on a rampage instead of admitting they misread the code. 
---
So trade is in fissure site? Grahm was in one walking around. I would have joined him but you know. Why do you sound like Grahm?
---
so i can level my alts you silly goose
---
Yup... I've seen a huge uptick in the number of vendors that have this.  I ALWAYS stock up when I see that (along with bulk screws).
---
Haha yeah, I'm not sure I'm complaining, just that folks should do some due diligence to know what they're getting into.
---
Wow. I literally dump those plans because I get them so often. 
---
I drop them at the first overseers camp. 
---
(I do a lot of low level events). 
---
 Yeah but that money is everywhere and we don't know what bills are in there. Do we? 
---
Everyone that reported the issue the standard PS4, not the pro.   
---
I've even got an explosive .44 (just explosive, not twoshot) on my VATS pistol character and even with crits, it still feels **much** weaker than my melee character.
---
Brilliant feedback! I’m gonna five class freak a trial run. 
---
For real though, when are the weapons that people actually use on a regular basis going to get paint jobs?
---
Oh well suit yourself.
---
So i can shoot pointblank at those Charred Ghouls without killing myself now?
---
Unable to navigate perk menu. Perfect.
---
I wasn't aware there was a TV plan? I didn't see it on the list of plans that were submitted by the user community. Also can I ask what you have in your house to make it luxury? Screenshots or a list of items would help. I'd like to build one myself.
---
You don't mention what's in your MISC tab.  It can hold tons of bobby pins and ore, etc.. they add up a ton.  
---
Also your ammo tab.  Missiles, fusion cores, mini nukes weigh a TON.  Other ammo can add up too.
---
I'm people. I might want to see other's values.
---
who asked for a xp nerf? let me level my alts in peace
---
I’m all for nerfing Whitesprings, but damn add some content. Nuking Whitesprings is like half the endgame content at this point 
---
I don't think its just the title, I saw one of your comment chain get downvoted as well. really shows the type of people usually in this subreddit.
---
two shot and anti armor are both primary, and both cannot be on the same weapon. even then its not the armor value that is being penetrated. its the mod on the armor
---
then why is the gun held in a right handed grip
---
If you have it on xbox and a 2nd console you can just use the 2nd console to play it with the account that owns fallout76. 
---
then you can use your "home" xbox to login to as many mule accounts as you want to store all your stuff. 
---
Any silver  (free) xbox account can use a home xbox owned by a gold user as if they had gold..
---
MS will even give you free email address to create additional accounts from the console itself. 
---
You can create unlimited mules on PC with Steam also but you need two copies of the game to do the above because steam locks out the instance of the game when anyone is playing it. 
---
[Inside the Vault for Jan 9](https://bethesda.net/en/article/3wohkyIGcEOE8gayy6yCMg/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-january-9-2019)
---
&gt; Beyond Monday’s patch, we’re working on another patch that we hope will  hit near the end of the month. This patch will continue to add fixes for  issues being voiced by the community, including the number of plans  Vendors have available, fixing a few Legendary mods, and continuing to  address issues with some Perks.  
---
Did you build it with cobbled together tin cans, duct tape, and desk fans?
---
Next
---
i wonder how effective it'd be to prevent suicide from a point blank TSE shotgun blast though...i mean will it being maxed mean i'd never die from full health?  That'd be worth it to me instead of having to backpeddle and run from a radroach because i'm afraid of accidentally blowing myself up
---
This specific sub?
---
You get images in a post the same way you put that image link in this post.
---
Upload to a service like imgur, copy link, paste into your text post. Ezpz
---
I’m a numbers guy, I just wanna see the numbers for this huge drop off in player base because of the grind 
---
Because you don't understand the negative impact the removal of duping is going to have on the game as a whole.
---
I used to have my CAMP at Greg's Mining supplies, and Grahm passed that point very frequently. It was very fun listening to him mutter while I fixed my pipe revolver.
---
Good times.
---
Nope. That’s a pain in the ass to make sure everyone gets their slap in.
---
Awesome! do you have disord? also what level are you? Im also 14 that gonna be a problem. Im on for about 45 mins on schoolnighs and about 2-3 hours on weekdays. add me on discord
---
PC fix right? I don't think the consoles get the update until next week.
---
I almost feel like changing my "active" PA set at my CAMP, so I'm not looking like I'm bragging by having to take up a whole train station to find my Excavator set.  It does help that atom-store paints will put the atom logo next to the chassis that has it applied to at least one piece, but it doesn't refresh accurately for me.
---
This would solve many problems - including the inventory-related corrupted characters that have been popping up.
---
I don't see this problem (xbox) , have maxed demolition expert, but they do "Stim" up just like a normal player , no problem bringing them down again, lol
---
The removal of two shot explosive weapons? Yeah right... let's just take 40% of the players weapons from them, that'll go well.
---
Nonexistent 
---
not true. If that were the case  we  would get  items from enemies that  we  can use not breakdown and  throw away.  3  star  walking cane  ftw
---
And doing that could also be considered an exploit, nuke em all I say and 5k is being generous, I would go 800lb.
---
you mean a cazador?
---
Implying this person has bills or a job
---
PS4 :/
---
Godspeed.
---
I’ve never seen that happen because all my junk is scrapped to save weight. I know to be careful for next time at least.
---
It’s been downvoted twice lol don’t see why
---
What happened to them.
---
With Bear Arms leveled up, 30 bobby pins weighed more than my gatling laser.  SMH 
---
You aren't going to see other's values.  That's not how 200 people sharing a single spreadsheet works.  It's one set of data unless it contains a table.  It doesn't.  You might want to look in to databases or something.
---
Anti-armor actually bypasses this?
---
Since it doesn't affect energy resist I figured it would literally only affect flat DR.
---
If one can swing a super sledge 30% faster, one can crank the gatling 30% faster.
---
Just curious...why?
---
Not true, you don't need bottles to make water. You need them to make molotovs.
---
 I've been slowly building up .50 ammo from containers hoping to get a hardened .50 receiver. 
---
I've lost a handful of X-01 PA mods to this.. before I realized that I could just immediately install them w/o having flux.
---
Supermutants don't have a biological sex. It's an effect of the FEV.
---
Adios.
---
Oh, bitchin' sweet. Workshops are worth the trouble again, almost.
---
Trying to keep PC and console even remotely in tandem really chills quick hotfixing. Odd little things like that on PC-only get shoved down the steam pipe quickly, but because consoles demand everything be re-downloaded, they don't benefit from rapid response and I feel like that's honestly unkind of console makers. That said I am happy to see PC doing the stress / bug testing a few days early for our console comrad... I mean fellow patriots. No comrades here, no sir! 
---
If you stack your damage with magazines and bobble heads then it probably won’t prevent suicides. However for a base shotgun it just might. Can’t wait to try it out. 
---
oooh good to know - i might have to see about getting that torso armor
---
efficiently =/= exploiting a bug
---
nah im not exploit shaming, just saying that a patched bug is ok even if it was beneficial towards players
---
hopefully duping gets fixed as well, and ofc some will whine about it as well "because drops are iffy"
---
A game shouldn't be causing a Blue Screen, it could mean other problems on your computer. Might want to make sure your drivers are all up to date. (Videocard, Chipset, Audio, Network)
---
Usually a few hours each on Saturday and Sunday. Can't say what time though, may be day or night, by my timezone.
---
But the point of nuke zones wasn't necessarily to level faster, it's actually supposed to let you get those rare mats.
---
If I remember correctly some superutants retain some memories and she just dresses as a female since she remembers she was.
---
They have a little + sign next to stuff i can pick up if its better than what i have equipped. they can check what i have verses what i see
---
See how you're being downvoted a ton and the 500 is being upvoted? That's because the lvl 500 clearly and respectfully explained how they were that level, while you act like a absolute D-bag. They enjoy playing the game more than other things so they have spent a lot of time doing so, there's nothing wrong with that.
---
Like how you are able to make a fusion reactor in the wilderness?  Being able to make screws would make junk nodes worthless.
---
i didn't even know there were two colors - thanks for the heads up.
---
i'm always afraid to buy plans since I can't freakin tell what I do and do not already own.
---
Until you put it in your stash box...
---
You mean lilly?
---
I just them in r/fo76
---
I was right there with you as you explained the need for a table. You lost me on the last sentence there. 
---
I don't see a "vendors display an indicator next to plans the player already knows" or "crafting will confirm before scrapping stored mods" that I'd hoped to see, but this is a good list overall. (Mama Dolces Commie Generosity Bug is also not restored but hey, can't break the dodgily canned stew economy now can we) 
---
I have a bloodied explosive Tesla with faster reloads if your interested. 
---
I had about 3 but fucking Bethesda scrapped 2 of them when crafting ammo 
---
MISSED:
---
MODS:  mods will no longer be scraped for components when not enought materiales
---
Weapons:
---
Gatling plasma: No longer has a durability of wet paper,
---
That's the one
---
I never participated in duplication, and I see now its being removed, but can anyone tell me how it was done? Seriously I have no idea how anyone would discover something like this.
---
Its damaged.  You have to repair it....
---
Missiles hurt so now that it stops 15% explosion damage per rank I'm assuming it will help.  Also if you have your own explosive weapon it might reduce self killing now?
---
I like this. That seems like decent rate of spawn for the plants. With the recharge at relog bug fixed, I expect a lot of us Shellheads will spend time at the plants now. An hour for 8 cores is, I'm guessing, over a weeks worth of use time for me (With Full Charge at max) and not using melee a lot.
---
I'd actually love that, but RNG is not in my favor. I even tried to increase my chances by using the plague mutation but even then the enemies die before the tick damage can occur so I still don't get credit.
---
Definitely looking forward to finally getting a Testla rifle though, even though I have the "grounded" mutation and it won't do jack shit for damage at least it will tag everyone. 
---
I honestly don’t even know why I carry them anymore. I haven’t picked a lock in weeks (I never get anything good from locked containers and I got sick of switching cards out), but I still have 147 of them on me at this exact moment.
---
Me? Yes, I am implying I do. OP? I have no idea. Lol.
---
How many typewriters and desk fans did you carry in the army? Did you at least have deep pocketed gear and total carry weight of 300 pounds?
---
Ooooh, yeah it's important to learn it first, lol.
---
&gt; thats partly an issue because people can rocket up though the levels to hit 100+ rather quickly.
---
It has absolutely nothing to do with that. You hit level 50 and that's it, your character doesn't gain any stats at all beyond that and all that you can do is min/max perk setups. The only difference between me at 60 and me at 120 was that I could use another type of gun without gimping myself.
---
do you have any proof of that also
---
i also have a 3 star explosive guess rifle that has explosive anti armour and 250 increase in damage resistance when reloading and it also has perforating capacitors whitch grant a 40 percent armour peircing thing
---
All the paint I find becomes ammo and all that ammo becomes dead super mutants and all those dead super mutants become frag grenades and caps and all those frag grendaes become MIRV grenades and all those MIRV grenades become another ultracite explosive vents plan.
---
Doesn't seem worth it after all, does it?
---
You can get it from vendor bot phoenix in Watoga, he has 2 of them, one is on a table and one isn't
---
Hopping, in my experience, doesn't really help.
---
I literally spent almost 2 hours one night "hopping" from server to server even looking for one with a nuke and didn't find 1.
---
Same. I sometimes do the clipboard run for springs....now I need ballistic fiber and 8 out of 10 server hops McC is barren as the Gobi Desert. Looks like I’m throwing more caps at vendors for bulk....
---
It sounds like it just broke. Did you check your inventory?
---
When will Protest March be fixed?
---
1200
---
How much? Do you remember?
---
What has that got to do with the carryweight of a weapon in Fallout 76 being 20 pounds?
---
So does the perk do anything for anything other than stimpacks?
---
You must be some kind of special kakapo, thinking that the removal of duping is a negative thing.
---
Kakapo: "These flightless parrots are absolutely adorable, but because they evolved in an area with no predators and ample food, they had no reason at all to develop their brains. Without a reason to work on a defense strategy, the kakapo has defaulted to an absolutely horrible method of defense. If you scare it, it will either hold completely still, or climb up a tree and then jump out –but since it can’t fly, it merely lands in a pathetic heap on the ground. If you don’t scare it, it very well may come out to say hi and, if it is a male, it may try to have sex with you."
---
Gauss will certainly do much more damage per shot, and lever actions may be better as well, but here's the thing - TSE weapons are king. If you can get a TSE hunting rifle, with the appropriate perks it'll probably oneshot anything short of a Behemoth or Sentry Bot. For general day-to-day use outside of nuke zones, the extra damage on the Gauss is overkill, plus its ammo is much more rare whereas the hunting rifle uses an ammo type that we've been dropping tens of thousands of on a daily basis. The hunting rifle will be to snipers what the T-60 is to power armor players - the other options are statistically *better*, but the hunting rifle/T-60 is cheaper to use and maintain on a daily basis.
---
That's what it was ! Thank you !
---
People were double the soft max level in beta, before the game even came out. Right now you can hit max level (50) in a day of you had friends just grind through nukes with you. 
---
Xp needs to be nerfed.
---
Ah yes, a brat for demanding something that thousands of other players have asked for, including people like me, who have put a couple hundred hours into the game and have a very good understanding of what would be good for the game and it's players
---
Oh yea, I know it's not only the TSE, this topic was more of a light hearted joke type post due to being annoyed with players insta-killing ghouls w/TSE weapons yesterday as well as having what looked like 15 turrets sitting outside Whitespring even further reducing the ghoul count as they killed ghouls the moment they spawned.
---
.I think out of about an hour of being in Whitespring I may have actually got credit for about 7 ghouls last night.
---
True dat
---
Well there's no more chance of an economy I don't even care anymore, took them too long.
---
This could solve a ton of issues . 
---
LOL
---
As far as B, i have had that issue. I managed to fix it by unequipping the pieces of armor while I am still in the frame. Getting out and putting them back on the frame, then get back in. Haven't had an issue really since. 
---
NERF TSE.....oh wait bummer, on to find something else to complain about kappa 
---
What that idiot was doing is. That’s why I went into detail. You must be the guy , and created a new account for reddit to reply. Don’t like being called out huh?
---
It's ok..I run around with a flamethrower and molotovs when grouped with friends and I often share this perk to mitigate the damage they may take. I'm fast and loose with the molotovs. If they take too much damage I can heal them up with Friendly Fire. It's pretty situational really.  I cant think of any creatures that this perk has saved me from. 
---
Yea I've been in nuke zones like that where the owners of the high end weaponry did this as well. Probably some of the most fun I had in the game so far when people aren't insta-gibbing the enemies the moment they spawn. 
---
Someone got their extraction stolen
---
Paints should apply to ALL the Power Armor. If you buy them, especially for the price they're asking for 
---
For this game there is a plan for additional content that does not require you to start over from scratch, so any accumulations need to be limited so that players are not overly equipped or over leveled for the future planned content.  If the average level of active players is trending too high then something has to be done to clip that trend before the new content is released, which is why most games like this one tend to become grindy.
---
Still Bethesda missed a perfect time to bring her back as a traveling trader named Graham. 
---
Tse rolling pin or gtfo
---
There is also no way you could sprint while carrying 200+ pounds of junk and multiple weapons. Realism has to be suspended, even when it's a detriment.
---
Lol. 
---
You boys need a hug huh? Big bad wasteland is to unfair. 
---
or even stop having headaches from forcing my eyes
---
a gamma correction slider would be nice too, but hey i will take what i can get from BGS
---
.....what?
---
Barbarian/evasive don't work when you have herd mentality and class freak active.
---
Everyone saying super mutants don't have sex apparently never lost the arm wrestling match to Francis ;)
---
interesting...
---
Dude...no offense but get over yourself 
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects
---
Kind of expect still a bit of whining after even they pushed the update, but didn't think it will be all over the place.
---
It sucks that...the way this game is set, everyone is generally the same except if your ranged or melee focused. Everything else is meta or rp only. I've seen so many posts saying, "well if you don't take XYZ perks, you're gonna have a bad time". Unless you're rping, which I guess is the whole point of FO76.
---
Comietron (Megatron) XD
---
Ballistic fiber is such a bastard to get... I stopped even repairing armor since it was needed to repair everything. Now you need it to craft any armor? I call bs
---
PVP is garbage. It's not really good indication of over all GAME balance.
---
But I will say.
---
gets a overhaul and fixed. That stealth players should NOT be able to one shot anyone in power armor. As it is the ONLY armor in the game that covers your HEAD and adds protections to that area. Thats not to say you'll still find the stealth player, but you wouldn't be one shot.
---
Right now PA is indomitable, as it should be. I can't think of anything a person in power armor and a half decent load out can't just face tank with a few stims. 
---
Or just let you craft every quest reward legendary but give them a sell value of zero or 1 cap so people don’t abuse the shit out of them. 
---
Why not make machines that create every junk material while you're at it. That way theres no need to go anywhere or scavenge anything 
---
The same applies to every gun in the game, calm down. If you reload a revolver with 5 unspent rounds, you still dump them all on the ground and reload up to 6 without losing the extra. If you drop a magazine out of the handmade rifle with 1 shot fired, you’re still magically reloading a full one without losing any ammo. 
---
The lever action is fixed and works just like every other gun. 
---
Databases.. a table in a database can represent the type of data you're thinking of.
---
This is a joke, right? White Knight perk mitigates you from having to go find ballistic fiber. Vendors carry Ballistic Fiber now. Most quests reward Ballistic Fiber (even at workshops). Fusion cores are rewarded by events. There are mobs that carry ballistic fiber and fusion cores. There are sites that have both as in-world pickups.
---
You've played this game, right? If you're constantly at a lack of either of these materials I have questions.
---
Personally, playing the raider and attacking people's CAMPs is fun. Repair costs are cheap.
---
The wasteland is a dangerous place, wo would have thought?
---
I literally got 100 in a week.  While it's hard to pass up on good exp gains, I do believe it's better to not be able to level so fast lol.  But really you can still level quickly at white springs, I did most of my leveling there without nukes, stopping by nuke servers as they came up.  At the time I did not know how to keep the whitesprings nuke mobs respawning so I definitely could have leveled even faster if I knew.
---
batteries included is a better perk, 2 points in batteries included is better than 3 points in power user
---
this so fucking much...my god...
---
Actually I think the commenter was talking about the actual file size.
---
That being said: Beth has come out and said that they can "hotfix" better on PC. So they release their first, let PC work out any major bugs that may arrive in a patch, hotfix them on PC and then carry the update over to consoles (where hotfixes are not really a thing)
---
Not to be a Negative Nancy, but I agree.
---
My new alt is exclusively laser weapons (inspired by a several single-digit lasers my main found). Definitely feeling a power loss/imbalance.
---
They should have pvp mode set on character creation and do away with the slap crap. If you wanna pvp just have it on 24/7
---
Friend invite sent
---
Super Mutants are uni-gendered
---
I feel you man. If I have to craft, modify, and repair weapons and armor, craft and fix a camp, and craft ammo, I’ll pick up everything I see.
---
I also have heavy guns, shotguns, melee weapons, and rifles on me at all times because I run out of ammo so fast and have to switch to something I still have ammo in. 
---
Cant fix the C.A.M.P. budget issue?  Seriously?
---
2 months after release and 20+ levels and I can't add to my base..... which is a platform......
---
That's disappointing, to put it mildly.
---
The last few nights on PS4 have been horrible for me.  And it's usually the same 2 things - either I can see people in white springs and can tell people are popping out an din, or it's a group of higher level players somewhere deep in the woods where nothing and then /crash
---
Today's patch says it addressed duping.
---
You can craft fusion cores, just need 1 of each nuke zone flux, combine this with super duper perk you never run out.
---
Dragons don't hang from their feet. Alduina is not amused.
---
Xb1 but thank you for the offer
---
What build are you going for
---
Chems and stimpacks, basically.
---
Im on PS4 and you would be my hero if youd trade it. But tbh i dont know if i have anything worth trading sadly. Id give you my whole stash for a two shot dragon xD
---
I could farm some plans with workshops and give them to you.
---
I have a weightless raider armor but thats a very low level. Message me then we can figure out a fair trade :) 
---
Maybe, sounds a bit mental for first time. If I get a good team and get through the mission, then I don't really care where gets nuked. 
---
Still no indication of which plans you know?
---
I blame the poor education system. I grew up in Eastern Europe, and we were taught firearms, *in school*. To the point where we would be field-stripping AK-47s in class. And firing (live fire) small caliber rounds from breech-loading bolt rifles *on school property*, and getting bussed outside of city limits to fire full-size rifles (including AKs). You simply didn't graduate high school without knowing how guns worked. For Americans, the nation singularly obsessed with weapons, to NOT teach this stuff in school seems utterly insane to me.
---
Ill be honest ..  when I first got a TSE I was so excited to kill stuff I didn't realize how effective it was. But when playing areas with large groups (like nukezones) I use my sommerset special to tag enemies and after a good amount of people have hit all enemies or we start getting over ran, do I pull out the equalizer. I think if more people shared the xp the tears over the tse wouldn't be so salty.   Alternatively if they made XP sharing proximity based I dont think anyone would care who killed what if they got a piece of the pie.
---
It’s a lot different than giving control to mr. Vegas or blowing up the institute. There is only one outcome and you can’t finish the game unless you do it.
---
I'm sorry to break your heart. I'm on PC...
---
Maybe check your STR score before and after, could be changed by your armor
---
Hold my boiled water and watch this!!!!!!!!!!
---
They aren't sweating.
---
They are sitting on piles of duped goods.  Goods that will be worth more now that duping is (theoretically) fixed.
---
Well then he could even craft cores with super duper on. Run around a nuke zone for 20 minutes and craft 10+ cores lol
---
Bobby pins aren't an issue as of this new patch. I have a few pounds of gunpowder (more because I can't store it in my CAMP), but not much ore.
---
Good point. Thr combo is what makes it strong. I used a neat mod to get my guns two legendary effects in fo4. Good ole times. 
---
I know, but I'm hoping they add one. Saving up what I find in the wild costs nothing, so epithet they do add one or I give up waiting and someone finds 500 rounds in the right register at Phoenix in Watoga. 
---
I do. I only played this game after 3 weeks in for the market. I was already level 175 before most even hit 75. So MY replay value was trading. That fun doesnt exist anymore, solely because of those people. 
---
&gt; LOL where is the 100% damage buff to energy weapons???
---
That's really too much.
---
The idea is that there's a limited amount of clean clothing.  Once it's stock runs out, it can only replenish with dirty clothing.  So it would end up with dirty clothing that it sold for pre-war money ultimately.
---
Now you could imagine some unlimited source of these bots.. each one with clean clothing.  They are found wandering out in the wilderness confused.  Sort of like the responder bot already implemented.
---
It happened to me like 2 nights ago. Someone in power armor with a shotgun.
---
Not if you start of at your camp and eat up and drink before going out. Just like in RL ^^, 
---
This was my interpretation as well
---
That would be nice, too recharge dead fusion cores. 
---
With the new update I managed to remove that water purifier which was the only thing left to delete and I am still unable to build anything. As for relocating my base ive been doing it non stop since the problem has happened ( wasted 12k caps doing so ).
---
Agreed. :) Ultracite cores, even.
---
It's not about needing it's about WANTING. It's very difficult to get rid of a bobby pin collection. Once you start you can't stop.
---
I noticed this, they just drop back down to the card store bottom of screen.
---
I don't have one. Just be aware that TSE Tesla doesn't behave like a Tesla any more. It no longer will arc to hit nearby enemies. The "beam" will be replaced with grenade-projectiles instead.
---
I just started using this rifle yesterday and the reload animation was my only problem with it. It’s good to hear that us console users are getting a fix for that next week. The points you laid out above are spot-on. 
---
I knew it xD
---
I never have luck lol
---
But i very much appreciate your kind offer :) 
---
Grafton and Clarksburg are above Morgantown. Extra fact, the Grafton mayor refers to Clarksburg as Clarksville at one point
---
Correct, PC is essentially beta testing the patch for console since hotfixes can be deployed quicker on PC and rolled into the patch for console.
---
You forgot to add the /s at the end.  
---
Just so you know I don't think people think that teaching firearms to kids in high school is a normal thing. Just getting that out there.
---
Well since we’re going for realism here, let’s assume all the ammunition in fallout is steel casing with lead bullets since those are the materials required to craft. And yet most actual lever actions cannot fire a steel casing and eject it properly. 
---
By that logic .45 should require copper instead of steel.
---
And mini guns should jam if we single shot them
---
And AK-47’s should shoot 7.62 as well at LMG’s
---
Maybe just be happy you’re only visually wasting one unspent round instead of jamming 5 more in on top of the 4 in there. 
---
No it's ok, i just wish that it worked out because I really enjoy it and the benefits but it is really buggy for me, and annoying about Scorchbeasts. I really want to kill one.
---
I mean, they can be crafted too. You on PC?
---
On point lol. Ignores the problem, then ignores his own argument. Classic
---
Didn't search for this until 10.01.18 because I was hoping for a patch to fix it. Patch didn't fix it but this method works. 
---
Yeah, I should have mentioned, this is rifles and shotguns, and on PC.
---
Does the icon pop-up for you too? Like when Luck of the Draw procs?
---
There should be an achievement after you eat 100 cans of dog food.  You get breath that does 1pt ambient damage to anything near you.
---
TIL only I have pet peeves. Everyone else is perfect. 
---
Doesn’t pacifist mode completely eliminate friendly fire on your friends?
---
Well, I've run into a ton of player who dont have them. It's mostly the reddit community that has them, players who dont go on reddit are often confused when I talk about all the stuff I have.
---
Any armors equipped outside of PA (Leather, Metal ect.) will automatically unequip when you enter PA. So, any stats from those armors wont apply.
---
Rifle weight reduction perk at some point? Currently my hand made sniper rifle weighs as much as my fat man. :( 
---
Maybe that’s the problem. The entire point of PA is that it supposed to offer superior protection and in essence, making people who wear them a walking tank. This isn’t the case. So arguing to remove something that PA can do (and not well, but well enough) is kinda ridicules. So a solution should be one of 3 things. Allow PA legendary affixes as well, buff PA to all hell and remove obvious things that don’t make sense with it, like stealth, and sniper builds, or nerf everything else to make PA do what it’s supposed to, be a walking tank. No matter what happens, it will piss everyone off. You can’t only concentrate on taking away something without a counter, that’s how Balance works. 
---
After you cripple the wings with the above perk with 3-4 shots, you can then go up to it and kill it with melee. It doesn't fly back up.
---
So I wil need to create a new sub for raiders? /s
---
They’re angry because they can’t troll partners or groups anymore. That’s literally the only way someone could complain about this. 
---
The protesters are robots not scorched. I got it to work one time. Don't know how. It might require a minimum amount of people over 2 or something.
---
Well, the supply will eventually run out so it really doesn't matter.
---
Honest question, though, do you really trade stimpaks? I don't have a "shop", per se, but I would assume we would eventually get to a point where (for example) Berry, Grape, etc, Mentats (slightly less accessible than stimpaks) would be more useful to players.
---
technicaliy you could just attach perforating mags to an TSE weapon and you would get some what close to it
---
I keep finding plans and good loot behind locks at places like Camp Venture, and then there's the caps stash at Whitesprings behind that lvl.3 locked door that's almost always there.
---
r/fo76creations
---
I just want to see what recipes/plans I know....
---
Anyone know if they added the option to put standard receivers back onto prime receiver .50 cals? Im tired of the headache that is repairing prime guns and crafting prime ammo. 
---
You just need to get rid of all that bullshit you don’t need. 
---
I just started maining my double BPR. Relied on a standard hunting rifle till yesterday. I have Marsupial and Bird Bones and jumping around Vatsing enemies with a BPR while almost flying is the most fun ive ever had. Plus. 50 cal balls are cheaper and need no gunpowder. 
---
Having double tse dragons is probably the highest damage output you get with a rifle. My BPR does 224 dmg x4 (dragon) = 896 x2 (double BPR) =1792 x2 with twoshot = 3584. Thats without Explosive. 
---
But tbh finding two TSE dragons legit is like wining in the lottery. Never gonna happen.
---
Dou know if theres any perk making me reload quicker? 
---
"The'll do fookin Nuttin"
---
&gt; The best part is the Bobby pins. Now I can go back to hoarding them!
---
Why do you even need that many?  Are you that bad at lock picking?  You shouldn't really need to carry more than 5.  
---
How many fusion cores do you carry?  I have about 25-30 but i use the batteries included perk.  Without it i'm overweight.  It's about an 80lb difference.
---
Yeah. One thing that I'm actually really enjoying about this game is that it's made so that I have to balance out my hording versus my crafting needs. My first character (from beta) was all about crafting. She's now around level 105 and can basically craft anything, lol. 
---
You and your friends all have the same shotgun? 🤔
---
I have 1 tse and 3 explosives I had one explosive before reddit but definitely most reddit (on the 76 subreddits) have tse or explosive 
---
You guys need to work on your methods. I'm not trying to say some kind of obnoxious "git gud" crap here, just that you shouldn't be breaking more than 1, maybe occasionally 2, picks on a level 3 lock, if you're experienced with their use. It takes time to get the hang of it, but you can definitely get there.
---
If nothing else, get in tune with rapidly recognizing the difference between the rattle of the wrong spot and the smooth grind of being near the right spot, and try to generate those sounds with as little and as brief a pressure as you can. Being super-quick with your tests makes a big difference in breakage.
---
Very similar to a troll... I’m sure you’re familiar with that at least
---
They delay console patches to evaluate the PC release first. It gives them a chance to make changes before locking in the console patch.
---
Because I find so many I just don't really care about being gentle with them. So this is going to take me down from carrying 10 pounds of bobby pins to .1 pounds. This is a good day
---
This is the way it works. Damage until they start healing, then wait til they full heal, then kill again.
---
I want to thank all pc players for testing the latest patch ~ a PS4 player.
---
Just to the North West of the Sunshine Meadows farm, is a junk pile, as shown in the link.  This is a great place as it has a junk pile, right next to water, and a little off the path so I get attacked very little.  This is great spot for new players and it gives you a half way point, between the bottom of the map and Vault 76 for fast travel.
---
Also the junk is on a downward angle from the rest of the road, so most people will miss it when walking by.  Currently, I have the junk extractor and 2 small water purifiers, with a large industry out the back.  Lots of bloodleaf for healing salves, and close to Sunshine to pick up soot flowers.
---
Planted 4 of each of tato, mutfruit, and corn to take care of adhesive.  4 standard machine gun turrets with a light(Seems to help with accuracy on the turrets).
---
I tried the junk pile south of the Poesiden Power Plant across the water, but got hammered by attacks constantly.
---
then thats a glitch it avoids 50 percent of armour meaning if you do 600 damage with anti armour and exsplosive then you should be doing around 300 damage per shot
---
I tested with an anti armor Explosive weapon. It seemed to do nothing to the armor Mod "Dense" 
---
You can see stuff in your CAMP placement menu. If you hit the right arrow on some items you can go through them to see all the different things. I guess those are the things in those plans. I just got a nice blue vault tec bed from the Whitespring vendor. It's so nice not having that bare mattress bed. The plan was called modern bed by the way, not the valt tec beds, if anyone is interested and doesn't want to waste caps.
---
Upvote for excellent movie reference!
---
That could be the sound bite for the loading/reloading
---
I live right across the road of the train station at "The top of the world". I have a giant metal cabin, with signs pointing inside towards my crafting room, that is freely available to use.
---
I also have some water purifiers unlocked, in case anyone is in need. I always drop unneeded legendaries and materials on the porch outside so its the first thing people find when they visit.
---
It's perfect for the 20-30 level player needing a break from the high level monsters spawning at the ski resorts. I don't have any defenses, as they take too much budget. I only build turrets at workshops. 
---
Also, if I sit on the porch long enough, Grahm will come by. It might take 5 minutes, it could take an hour, but he will stop by at some point.
---
Yes, they heal. If you one shot them, they dont heal, but they usually dont drop legendaries. For some reason the regeneration and the drop are linked. At about half health, they regenerate. You CAN outpace this healing, but i dont advise it because im not sure if it will also prevent the drop
---
Well now...i may have to retool my build.
---
I like the game(180 hours), but everyone should agree that it was released and is still in a pretty buggy state. 
---
Shotgun power armor run n gun
---
You mean like this? https://m.imgur.com/HJu16sQ,jt3yV9Y,o4F8Cwl,7fQUJA0
---
Technically, the BoS are rebels and inciting a military coup. The Enclave are the "good guys" in FO76.
---
But really, The Free States are where it's at in-game and irl.
---
What system are you on? If XB1, I have better sitting in my STASH I've been trying to figure out what to do with. 
---
Good to see new patch coming 
---
Charleston Fire department and the nearby motel in Flatwoods both have gyms with lead weights.  Roughly 100 lead easy peasy.  :) 
---
Yes, clearly ALL complaints about this game are completely and utterly false.
---
.................
---
I did a quick look, was unable to find anything. 
---
I remember a thread where a guy lost a quest item(not a reward) and there was no way for him to get the item back, and bethesda said they couldnt give it back to him due to not having the tools.
---
I personally could not find that thread, maybe things have changed.
---
For a while I did. Around release and a month or so after my friends and "randoms" always gauked at the fact I had over 250 while most struggled to maintain any while fighting. Of course that died quick when Super Duper + Chemist was found out and you could turn 1 to 8. But even then they still had value(about 10c per stim) Now I See people selling em 1000 for 100c. So stims arent the biggest deal like you say, but nonetheless im sure you see what I mean. 
---
Then by that logic it isn't finding a solution, but claiming the entire game to just be a glitch and not programming. 
---
EX: The scorch didnt spawn. Glitch. The SB doesnt land. Glitch. Stacking 10000000 bobbleheads glitch. Stuck in power armor. Glitch. Logging in and the entire account is gone. Glitch. Walking outside Vault 76 and gaining 9999999999 exp and attaining level 999. Priceless.
---
That is important. That is also insane.
---
Imagine flying Frank Horrigans in fallout 76
---
Praise atom!
---
Its not about leveling so much as the fact that with an entire map at our disposal, only two areas are ever nuked. Makes it incredibly dull.   
---
Honestly the best nuke zone I have encountered was Morgantown. With Marsupial and Jets it was 100 times more fun hunting from rooftops and the monorail than running the same circuit in WS for an hour.   
---
Also - IMO the game needs an hardlevel cap. It would encourage people to have multiple characters and keeping all areas of the map more alive then every time i log in seeing half the server in WS running laps.  A respec option with a level cap of 100 would have been a better option...
---
Will “start losing players”? Have you been living in a cave these last couple of months? It already lost a massive part of its fan base, people aren’t stupid, they know an unfinished product when they see one. All my friends stopped playing it, my YouTube feed is constantly recommending me videos of “this is how bad FO76 is” variety. People who are paid to play the game to review, or stream it, refuse to play it. This game is an absolute pile of shit, and a cash grab. A skin for a power armour costs almost as much as 3 DLCs for Spider-Man PS4. Just thought I’d see what is going on in the subreddit for such a pathetic excuse for a game, and everybody seems to be deaf and blind around here. But don’t worry denial is only the first step of the grieving process, ya’ll move on soon enough. Until then, downvote away.
---
If only ppl used those weapons. 
---
You're making up a problem that doesn't exist
---
But I want my gauss rifle to do 400 damage!
---
OP your opinion has been noted and I’m filing it (in the trash)
---
Have dog companions been added yet?  
---
I would love for them to add a dead zone adjuster for the controller in the options, other than that these patch notes are absolutely fantastic!
---
Just nuke wherever you want and have fun with it.  We nuked a friends camp, found he left a nice Ash pile behind when he died!
---
Where did you find that blueprint?
---
He wanted to make people that like the game mad. And you got mad, so who is the stupid one tho?
---
Also look up what free speech means im not sure you understand the meaning of it.
---
I guess i could've used a better word for it, im sorry. I don't trink that changes the fact that complaining will not help but spreading good vibes will do.
---
Tbh, I want a bigger build budget for my camp, personally, but I know some will use the increase to fill their floating bases with even more turrets. I just want more decorations. 
---
&gt;That's the ~~Fallout universe~~ 1950s for you. So insanely stupid regarding certain fundamental health practices that it's amazing they didn't go Idiocracy. 
---
FTFY
---
That's open for debate. For the location, and the time (many decades ago), it was sensible. The likelihood of the kid having to use a gun in their lifetime, especially male, were pretty much 100%. Not to mention that many countries in the region use conscription. Meaning, you turn 18, and you do a 1-3 years of mandatory military service. So teaching kids guns a year or two before they'll be carrying one, mandatory, on a daily basis, in a region where wars happen every few decades, isn't abnormal. It's disturbingly sensible, and certainly pragmatic.
---
As far as the comment about Americans go, they have highest guns per capita in the world, produce most in the world, spend the most in the world on their military. The odds of an American kid coming into contact with a firearm is significant. So NOT teaching your kids basic firearm safety seems weird. 
---
very good for +3 to all stats on low health.
---
The healing is a mutation sparked by damage on legendary creatures... they randomly gain 1 mutation and full health. This RNG mechanic also determines loot RNG and value. Try NOT to 1 shot them because you are destroying your loot when you do. Hit, heal, THEN kill.
---
Ah gotcha. Appreciate the effort though. It would be nice to get the community behind getting a concrete answer out of them. My group I play with most "about 7 of us) all quit when the dupe glitch happened. Only log on very sparingly and we all agreed when the duped items were removed we'd come back. If thats a pipe dream I wish I could just know and take it for what it is. 
---
This happened to me BEFORE the patch, after I moved my camp to a certain location.
---
Is your camp near a monster spawn? Mine is next to some frogs' spawn, I think the game bugged into thinking they are my tamed animals for some reason.
---
When a legendary gets to ~50% they heal for around 5-10 seconds sometimes longer but I think that's from server lag.
---
Maybe the unruly ghoul golfers will finally start spawning
---
I will investigate this potentially game breaking Fix soon today when I get to work and will report back
---
This is hilarious
---
Nty
---
Great fixes, but why not also fix autoscrapping mods while they were at it?
---
Damn.... I loved that one. First time I figured that out I went from lvl 24-33
---
\*facepalm\* if that's what they actually did lmfao...
---
I just don't get the stimpak thing. Without Super Duper and Chemist I've always ended up selling stimpaks to vendors... The game throws them at you.
---
I could be wrong, but I think the Super Duper/Chemist combo is still only 1 extra for 3 normal stimpaks and 2 extra for 6 diluted stimpaks. It only duplicates the base rate not counting Chemist. I could be confused, though, and it really isn't that big of a difference.
---
Personally, I see people selling stimpaks and even shotgun shells and question why you would even need to buy that from a player.
---
The point in all this being - why aren't you trading something a bit more exotic?
---
If PC we can test this later, but still, this 45% of explosive damage reduction makes survivability attainable much easier
---
You can still see the items that you don't have to plans for in the build menu.
---
I need hardened masses, fam. 
---
AH, THAT MAKES SENSE. They should tell you that instead of just saying it says 40 caps when its not  that at all. Like there was no indication that bringing stuff makes it cost more.
---
 Very frustrating. Not that it matters but if i was hard on caps i would be kind of pissed.
---
do they leave radiation mist as well lol 
---
If it helps the paint job was goofy. It looked different on each power armor type, and not in a “cool variety” way, but a “those colors do not belong together aesthetically, that looks weird or terrible” way.
---
They must have hired the idiot in charge of shader decisions over at Bungie.
---
I got it from Leader of the Pack.  I was pissed for a minute because I became overweight, and thought, did they give me plans, or just shove a bear proof can in my inventory.  Thankfully it was plans, and the wood arm armor caused me to go overweight.
---
Sent you a request on Discord.
---
wait so i have question off topic kinda i had a ghoul slaying super sledge that did like 200 damage and and super mutaunt slaying super sledge that i had but that did 179 damage both are same level and both have same mods and i was using same perks both times ad both times where in the same power armour
---
Some good changes. Shame the Trade Cap Limit was increased but the actual cap limit is still 25000.
---
Also, no fix yet for the broken since BETA Heart of the Enemy quest? Submitted, with video the issue preventing the quest from starting and no news on what's going on with it. This should just purge/reset during the daily Vendor Cap reset, or if you are logged in at the time, reset when you log out.
---
Honestly don't understand why there are no systems in place to reset quests...
---
Same kind of people that live in they're moms basement waiting for the "perfect girl to come along" and sweep them off there feat. Constructive criticism, fine.. baby cries, c'mon bro.
---
Most players spend the majority of their time ungrouped.  I think that's fair to say?  Making any focus on sharing perk cards less important when compared to other more relevant choices.
---
Not sure how many people went with high CHA.  Personally I have 3 points which allows me to share one card.  And I team up a LOT.  Me and one buddy are constantly teamed up and sharing perks.
---
Even with that, we don't share junk like lockpicking or hacking.  It's things like rad sponge.
---
LMAO bro your gun broke. Go repair it. Have you played any fallout ever? 
---
Yes only low level though.
---
Haha oh god, other game promotion inside a Fallout game. If thats true, 76 is ROCK BOTTOM.
---
I got one shot yesterday by a guy with some energy weapon.. Was a bit pissed about that. 
---
Trading with your self to store additional items isn't an intended game mechanic.  Your bypassing your stash limit by using another character, so yes it's very loosely an exploit.  Not something I think people should be punished but you are bypassing game mechanics by doing it, so yes it's an exploit.
---
Bobbleheads effect stack it they are the same type, so a duper with a hundred of explosive bobblehead equipped... you can imagine.
---
Considering you get +5% damage to melee with each point of strength, +3 x 5 = 15 15 x 5% = 75% extra damage.
---
150 fixes delivered!
---
Great, thanks for the info, I'll test it. None of my melee chars use VATS, so I haven't been paying attention. But my shotgunner just finally got around to unlocking it, and I realized it's not doing anything.
---
i wouldnt be surprised if anti armour is negated by the effects of exsplosive effect
---
Why would you make fusion cores harder to acquire? Isn’t there already a problem with acquiring good stuff? 
---
If i get one without the explosive effect would it arc with the two shot
---
A lot of the people that use it do low-health builds. They take advantage of Unyielding armor and Perks like Nerd Rage. Then they take Rad Damage until their health bar reaches a point where they're KEPT in that range. Then the fun begins. They get the all the SPECIAL bonuses of being at low health, the Perks kick in, defense and damage rates go through the roof, but the risk is they've got a VERY limited amount of HP to work with and they can die pretty easily to do much Rad damage.
---
The Lag gives and the Lag takes away.
---
check other vendors. He isn't the only one who sells it.
---
Bloodied build is great and that gear is a part of it
---
With all the items for sale on Ebay, which that alone is a breach of the user agreement, for which you could be banned, it would not be difficult for Bethesda to go after those players, confirm their accounts and ban them completely including their Xbox Live account, PSL account, etc..
---
Duping is ruining the game, Bethesda knows this, and I'm holding out hope they will come up with a solution that does not affect those of us that acquired stuff legitimately, and properly punishes those that cheat.
---
I feel like that applies to many things people want fixed. 
---
Many of the best perks don't even become available until lvl 40-50. Nobody is maxing their build at lvl 50
---
Wait, there’s actual positive comments in here. Am I actually in the 76 sub right now??
---
Coming to gripe about such a particular aspect of a thing immediately after they fix it when people have been asking for it for weeks if not months makes you look *super* petty.
---
Not tryna talk shit. That's why the downvotes though.
---
You’re acting pretty pretentious over a video game 
---
anywhere between 3 and 12, but once I can get out of power armor, I can't imagine carrying more than one or two.
---
Sweet I will be able to farm "Legendary Bloated Snowbirds".. at least until Bethesda patches it. 
---
We'll have to see, but seems like this changes the perk dramativally from nearly worthless to nearly required.
---
Is 45% enough tho?  Exploding weapons can do 10k+ damage, so still seems like you would still get 1shot.
---
Will see about porting the PA skin into Fallout 4 for a better look tonight.
---
"very loosely"
---
Yea, as loose as it gets. If you made this definition more loose it'd vanish.
---
Those are supposed to be powerful.  They are the rarest legendaries in the game.  The problem is the dupers.  Don't ruin the gun and the fun of getting one cause people cheated.
---
Im level 31 now.  Am I too high for them to spawn?  
---
it is 100% not a matter of encryption, not sure where  you pulled that from.
---
They have the files yes, they dont have the tools to easily view or edit those files. The files are probably stored across many different servers which makes it a little more difficult than just analyzing a single database for all the players inventories.
---
They could choose to write those tools, which would take time and money, which they dont want to do. There is always a way to do something, it just comes down to whether its worth it to do that thing or not. 
---
They need more behavior variety in general and this would be great. I’d also love to see them FALL out of the sky once being damaged enough or one of their wings being crippled. They should also be able to toss a nearby player, kinda how deathclaws can pick up and flip a player in power armor (at least they did in 4, haven’t seen that yet in 76). 
---
Pure sex
---
I used to do that with other games but I find I enjoy each thing less when I do that without this game.
---
Yeah rumor has it... you need to be like below 15 or something.
---
I find loose screws on them as well.
---
Well, maybe they were supposed to explode in the first place but were bugged since beta.
---
I wouldn't be suprised either way.
---
It needs to stop you taking damage.
---
Feel free to add me too... I'm lvl 104 and have yet to launch my own nuke. GT: SonicRun83 .... I also have a lvl 8 alt I created the other night. I've played mostly solo, but enjoy the few occasions of joining randoms and doing whatever.
---
Currently at work so I can’t test myself, I’ll check back later to see if anyone had any input. If not I have a few guns I can play around with.
---
That's awesome lol
---
&gt; And you got mad, so who is the stupid one tho? 
---
"Stupid is who stupid does."
---
And I see you got all of this completely wrong, but I believe that's due to your personal opinions. You see, I may have gotten "free speech" meaning wrong, as english is not my first language but, I was playing the game and enjoying it, and I didn't want to waste too much time with you. But I can assure you I am not mad at all, on the other hand I'm completely amused by them, and by people like you, who defend them.
---
Have a nice evening sir, I'm gonna be in the game. You should find something fun to do as well, as you seem pretty tensed.
---
I wouldn't be either to be honest.
---
The power fist should so be able to be used on power armor. Same with the mole miner gauntlet. I would even be okay with these being separate plans. While we're at it, why not strap deathclaw claws to the arms as well? In all reality, isnt the power armor hand the same size as a normal hand? I demand satisfaction! Or not whatever.
---
Well you certainly found a nice creepy place to test the lights out
---
While I agree with you, the "two shot" affix should not exist regardless of any duping. It makes no sense to have an affix that strong. It would take 15 damage perks to reach the same result. 
---
Once they fix that they need to actaully make them usable as a main weapon. 
---
With one of my builds being a melee only build im saddened not only by the chainsaw doing almost no damage but slugger doesnt affect it either…
---
A shredder does way more damage than a chainsaw  and i actually use one as a melee weapon some times)
---
Not sure where the tipping point is but by the time I felt safe roaming whitesprings it was too late, I'd just spawn level 42 &amp; up.
---
Then I found a level 9 ghoul &amp; immediately ran to the club house to finally finish this damned thing.
---
If a low level player makes it there &amp; kicks the spawn off, you may be in luck.
---
Bug:  
---
1) PC: i5-4690k, GTX 1080, 20GB Ram, Win10
---
2) IGN: GoldenDusky Character: GoldenDusky

3) [Picture 1](https://gc-p.co/Golden/2fce62e5.png) [Picture 2](https://gc-p.co/Golden/65371433.png) [Picture 3](https://gc-p.co/Golden/a6fee5f7.png) ( Ill probably make a video on this since its easier to understand )
---
4) Unable to build a camp since my budget is exceeded even though only 0% is stored. Issue started when I moved my base and wanted to remake the whole base out of another material and proceeded to delete everything I had in stored. After everything was deleted my budget was stilled maxed. I have tried everything to fix the issue but nothing is working.
---
5) 190107-003881
---
Thanks re-boober I totally forgot that faction but yes that is a great idea &lt;3 
---
I too drop stims daily. You get so many it's just a waste of weight 
---
i might get the name wrong, but pretty sure it’s called the Last Bastion and adds like 5% gun accuracy or something? it’s an enclave quest reward for sure. 
---
This is a video game with creatures that don't exist in real life but you want guns to act  just like they do in real life? Maybe you should play a more realistic shooter if you want that.
---
Just get rid of the stupid tag mechanic and let everyone that is in the immediate area loot the fucking corpse. I can already eat corpses i didn't kill and i can search corpse of animals other people kill, People want to play with each other not against each other. 
---
Fusion Cores are a dime a dozen in any given area. Check the Ash Heap  or any area with robots. Generators are everywhere and even with the reduced chance of cores spawning in, I'm sure you'll have plenty to keep you going.
---
This mission took me a ridiculously long time to complete. You have to really hunt around for them. 
---
&gt;  Because nothing about game play will change after those first two levels.
---
Thats true for Fallout 76 since the endgame was... ehh... and getting to lvl 50 doesn't really take that long. You can go from 30 to 50 in like 3 nukes.
---
I only pick them in hopes of random plans.
---
I felt a bit disappointed as well. 
---
Yesterday I watched the Making of Fallout 76 that Noclip did back in June on YouTube. What I found striking now is that they expected the launch to go like this. They knew they were going to go live with the game in a state where there would be problems that they as an organization could not see and wanted the player community to reveal. Todd Howard seems excited by the idea. It probably explains why they don’t see it as a disaster.  It’s not a disaster to land in the pit if you knew you were jumping into it. 
---
It makes the launch feel less money grab and more like the Grand Experiment that made me become interested despite it not being Fallout 5. 
---
Would it be difficult if they made the basement instanced like in Hearthfire?
---
Well now you will notice where you killed a legendary
---
Looks like the vampire costume from the atom shop. 
---
In 4 I found a pretty heavily modified legendary pistol in early game. I went through probably 20,000 rounds in that thing it was my go to... I scrapped every 10mm in this game I've come across. I loved them before but they are trash now.
---
Ha, I love that deathclaw. When it spawns as a legendary, does it run away from you too most of the time??
---
That one I don't know. Two-shot is weird with some guns. On shotguns for example it just adds an extra pellet, not a full shell. So I don't know what it will do to the Tesla beam.
---
Bethesda: "We're fixing that duping problem and giving y'all legendary rifles. Enjoy."
---
This guy: "What a stupid update, literally worthless."
---
Seriously, the game has been out for less than two months! Give it time. Stability is the number one issue right now. If they *did* rush player vending and the game kept crashing, y'all would be complaining that they focused on dumb shit like vending. You can't have both, get over it.
---
There's more than one? Well, any of the Beach Boys ones. That all sound the same. It's a bit like Rob Zombie. Many of the songs sound very similar but at least if you like the one song that's okay. I don't like "the one" Beach Boys song so it's not okay (for me)
---
I only ever break one when I'm being lazy. Feel like 10 is more than sufficient between STASH visits
---
i love the chest hope it not looks ugly ingame
---
Have a good one yourself! 
---
All i wanted to say is stop caring about trolls. Guess im tense since I have been hoping for hours for a jetpack mod rip.
---
Got it, didn't notice that.  Read over it pretty well too, guess I need to brush up on my reading comprehension :/ 
---
Oh, I know. I have 21 in my inventory and another 15 in my stash. It just let me be lazy. 
---
You get 8 an hour from power plants now, which is not a whole lot less than the 12 an hour at launch. Take all 3 power plants in a session and get 24 100% an hour..... how much do you really use? 
---
I should add that getting rid of the system that presently makes grouping a negative and replacing it with the basic setup present in, without much exaggeration, every other social game would be the easiest change to make. Shared experience and loot in teams should have been in place at launch, and it's seriously baffling that we are playing a game that doesn't have that.
---
I have no armor, I’m wearing a swimsuit and a beer helmet.
---
On xbox I buy hundreds of flux a week for 25 caps a piece (for my serum shop) but I see a lot of people selling 50-100
---
True, realism should be suspended a bit, but making a somewhat light gun in real life easily weigh as much as heavy weapons on the game, but giving virtually every other weapon class the opportunity to reduce weight is unbalanced.
---
But why would damage go up outside of pa?
---
Recursion timed out. Lack of system resources.
---
The xp nerf pissed  me off pretty bad when they did it initially, but it still didnt matter because I've got 3 chars well over level 50, have played all the popular builds and have some decent tse guns so I don't even play anymore because everything has been so easy and fast to do.  The game has absolutely no longevity at this point, and it saddens me, but I'll just wait another 6 months or something and see if they actually add an endgame or a reason to keep getting on.
---
Thanks x949Mafiax that means a lot to me &lt;3
---
I agree,  but at this time there are people that actually think it functions that way when it doesn't. 
---
IMO  it should probably be like WoW where you have to flag for it and after doing so you have to wait on a cooldown to un flag if you caused any damage so you can't flag and unflag repeatedly to abuse it
---
Oh, that's some cool thinking-outside-the-box! I'll give it a shot, thank you!
---
u/norgan696
---
Only ones that hasnt released that was already in the files is the Brown and Yellow Vault Tech paint and WV Ranger PA paint. [Here are the Paints](https://imgur.com/a/nvne4dU) i pulled out and ported in Fallout 4 during the Beta
---
Nothing to do with encryption and everything to do with each item not having a unique key. If they did, Bethesda could just delete all of the duplicate keys as a fix. But also if there was a unique key, it’s possible the dupe would be be possible because of unique key insert constraints.
---
About half of them are. Like dwarves you just can't tell them apart.
---
"Greetings, member. We have a new set of...tools...we would like you to test for effectiveness. We apologize for the lack of forewarning, but this is a matter of immediate importance. A certain lab experiment has...expedited itself to field-test stage. Very close to your location. We hope you prove effective in testing our new equipment. We'll be watching."
---
Event Started:
---
DEATHCLAWS FROM ABOVE
---
- Survive the flying death claw horde until MODUS can get them under control.
---
damn, and i just cleared 80 to free up some space for some junk and ammo
---
What does AP have to do with the damage reduction...?
---
Hanging out with female dwarves. 
---
both are 1 stared and same level same perks same mods
---
How did you get that?
---
I think it's a bug tied to attack speed. started to see when I reached 3* martial artist with blade of Bastet. also see it with a ski-sword with 40% speed increase. didn't try that one with martial artist tho. Slower weapons doesn't miss registering hits as much.
---
Fusion Cores are pretty easy to come by, especially in Ash Heap. Before this patch I had a quick 2 minute run that would net me 5-7 cores and I'd only need to do that once every few times I play.
---
Hey, I was browsing Beth's support forums and found [this topic](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/310621/main-quest-early-warnings/2), wherein a moderator says to open a ticket and they can fix it for you. It's the 2nd reply to that topic. This was posted about 17 hours ago, so maybe they now have the ability to fix it. Hope it helps! 
---
The server hasn't been stable with 600. Or 400 it was before that. I think they need to fix stability to where it stops disconnecting people and crashing servers before they up it again. 
---
Very good START.
---
Do you have the pink asylum uniform and hat?
---
Looks great! You gave me an idea with the garage doors 
---
For a mid level player with only the weapons I’ve picked up from playing w/out exploits they are very hard to take down and deal with rads.. once your level 150 w/ a two shot explosive 50 it’s easy but then so is everything else and what are those players really gaining from the XP anyhow. 
---
Nice. From my experience you don't need lead belly and cannibal. I have 3 END and I usually use one or the other, depending on what I'm getting myself into. Also you probably know this but you don't need to reserve 3 INT slots for hacker or 3 PER slots for lock picking. You can easily swap those 3 cards in when you need them, and remove them when you don't, freeing up room for less situational cards.
---
That too. Just threw that out in case someone starts complaining about it being broken.
---
I seriously have no idea what the reasonable defense of the current tagging system would be. Heck, there's not even shared experience and loot in teams! That's not how it works in practically every other social game.
---
There should be tons of paint for all PA types. Any survivor can find paint in the world and are free to paint their PA. So continiuity complaints are stupid.
---
If I can craft a Gauss Rifle with mods, I should be able to paint some armor.  
---
Also by making paint universal for all PA types, you may see some unique mixed sets.
---
Start with the basics. Pure colors...white, green red  yellow blue. Just plain color no markings no skulls or flurishes. Leave the fancy stiff gor later.
---
I would love a full red PA with the Fire breathers helmet wielding a fire axe.  Maybe in the future a fire hose skin for the flamer...then I can go full robo Fire fighter!
---
Or pure white X01 with blue eyes mod. Epic.
---
Mole miners dude. Go clear out the mine near white springs a few times. Their kit breaks down into black titanium, ballistic find re and think... But don't quote me... Screws
---
Then I'm not sure. I know some PA glitches happen because you signed out in the PA. Try relogging with your PA NOT equipped and see what happens when you jump in.
---
same
---
Maybe your under armor or armor increases strength or something like that
---
Early 80s, never saw combat. Just talking about the M16s we used to qualify in the Nat Guard. Still, how much does an M4 weigh
---
The regen from armor pieces is so ridiculously slow that it's virtually useless. Healing factor will bring you back up to full health immediately after combat 
---
I found my by completing an event to take over a workshop, so you can get them there too!
---
Right, so 80% is a bit high. Maybe 60 but who cares that point is they aren't going anywhere 
---
People Making assets for the game are not the same ones fixing bugs it also likely they dont have the skillset to know how to. Making Atom Items isn't taking resource or time away from the Bug Fixes. Also making reskins is very simple work and likely a few hours work each at most.
---
So you're fine with a rifle weighing 20 pounds? That's cool
---
You should check out imgur! People specifically search the 76 tag just to downvote everything and talk about things they clearly know nothing about. If you say anything positive they'll screech "this is a user sub! Reeeeee" even though it's literally a category dedicated to 76 lol
---
TSE wouldn't be the problem for the queen going down to fast, they were probably stacking crazy damage buffs like overdrive combined with unyeilding and bobble heads. 4 level 100s with just TSE weapons should still take a while to bring her down.
---
Yeah you can see the stuff. You can't know for sure but it's probably those fancy tables and stuff. Somehow I got the plans for fancy black furniture. I don't know where from but I use a few of the tables.
---
Do you really think the dupers go through the process of choosing what to dupe? Look at some of the posts here about them, they even dupe bobbleheads... 
---
Tank buster from perception for more armor penetration. 
---
Is serum still bugged?
---
Yes slap damage should be disabled if this happens I do agree with that. 
---
TSE's Nerf
---
50% reduced damage for PvP 
---
25% reduced damage for PvE  
---
Once you crack level 50 the XP becomes sort of meaningless, so I would assume people are still going to farm WS for the legendaries. 
---
i dont pay attension much but when i do i noticed that like i just figured out in the latest update apparentliy guass rifles had an issues where they werent effects by rifleman perks whitch i never noticed becauce i was already doing some much damage with my 2 shot guass rifle i used to have that i fought it was normal damage but it makes me wonder if that damage plus perks i was using to increase damage on all weapons was the true reason i was doing 600 damage
---
sometimes you;'ll get lucky enough for a low level player to walk through there before you, and spawn the lower enemies. Sometimes log off/in
---
Okay, that's actually a fair point, but if they _knew_ it would be so broken ahead of time, why does there seem to be so little staffing to support fixing it?
---
I mean, I've run teams of engineers, notably during game crunches and post-launch scrambles, and I know what a decently-sized team should be capable of doing. This feels like two genuine engineers, maybe three at the most, and maybe one or two people working at the Creation Kit level. This is a skeleton team's work, not the work of a studio that knows, let alone knew, it has a lot of work to do to make its grand experiment stable and fun.
---
It you're in xb1, I can help out if you need (or jump on my alt lvl7 and run around as well)
---
reintroduction of the no spawn locations when overweight in PA is back. so that's fun
---
And why so? Many many other games does it. Blizzard do it, Activion do it, Ubisoft do it.
---
Why doing cross-product promo means its rock bottom?
---
I agree
---
It was part of the holiday bundle.
---
I dont know if this was said, but the live underground buddy. The whole reason they burst out of the ground is the "noise" above ground calls them out.
---
Cool idea if there was more then glass cavern that had SB's inside, or actual caves we can explore
---
Thought broadsider was 35-39? From levels 40-50 I spent a lot of time in HF. Every time I went to the vendor, it was a radium rifle plan. Every. Damn. Time.
---
I’m level 61 now and have never seen broadsider plans there or anywhere else.
---
honestly, this is the approach you need to take with the devs of a game you love. The more we ask the more they build.
---
You can save a copy 
---
Nope. Only thing i can think of is I had to repair it after a random nuke (camp is not in a common nuke area) and it was kind of buggy.
---
That's how left handed guns are, even that way was in the ARMY, the hand grip is universal amd the bolt or round extractor is what makes a left handed weapon
---
Like 80 missiles and 20 fusion cores? 
---
Oho! I bet I missed it.
---
Aaxxo thanks for the comment and I do agree it would make the game play different cause right now Fallout 76 does not have that dynamic game play at least am aware of.
---
Banning them into Oblivion would make me feel bad for the scamps and daedra. :c
---
7 pounds or so iirc, not a huge difference. Bit shorter barrel and adjustable stock on all of them is nice though
---
You should. You get EXP, nice plans and items. Def worth the time and perks. 
---
Patched today, new exploit video tonight. 
---
Yes, but it's literally a single value change in the editor. It's not like they need to release one patch every 1-2 months. Hotfixes are a thing.
---
I'm in PA 99% of the time
---
Second account...  my wife mules for me
---
This glitch is how I ended up with x200 adhesive. I didn't even realize what was happening at first, but it being my 2nd play through I was happy to have it. My first play through i was running around naked unable to afford repairing my armor haha.
---
I dont know then. I know luck can affect base condition of a looted item. Maybe it can affect dmg too? Or a glitch where one of the mods isnt applying? Try swapping it out then back on maybe.
---
Yes! I’m surprised this isn’t concerning to more people. I’ve been getting around the ballistic fibre shortage by always building new (except for legendary armour) rather than repairing.
---
Sooo are the phantom water purifiers taking up half of my Camp budget gonna be fixed??
---
I just finished up at the DMV getting the ID card. Would have gone farther but I was stuck at McClintock for awhile, game would crash when i ran the obstacle course 
---
Cannibal alone leads to you receiving rads. It is nice to have full lead belly and at least one cannibal. 
---
I had one poof into my base and fight me while I was repairing my gear lol. I fought it off didn't get the kill because it poofed away. But a little bit later this lvl 8 adds me to there team randomly we're talking and he fast travels to my base I make him some weapons and what not. Then bam the same mothman comes back and starts wrecking him since it was lvl 50. Ik it was the same because it had the same amount of health as when it ran away.
---
Yes Human NPC's to talk to would be very nice and they can give you new quests. Good idea you give me thanks Essensia &lt;3
---
Not really if you think about the reasons why people feel the way they do about this game. It's like we got the worst of both worlds.
---
It works that way in Destiny IIRC. I can see it abused that way though.  Just park on the wall and come back later to a maxed character and gear everywhere. 
---
You would just have to babysit a bit due to rads
---
I had no idea about this. I have a lobbing Tesla rifle, I'm gonna check this out later today. How do you get out of the bug?
---
I'm curious how this will work with my quad LAR &gt;.&lt;
---
Yeah I know I have had it for most of my play time in the game. And I also have to use more Stimpacks in a fight, more Rad-Aways to cure rads, chems that boost defense and stats are weaker, etc. For something I can just eat a few food that I get for free at my CAMP while in a non pressuring situation like out of combat.
---
In the past you could walk up to someone and start a trade window with no Yes/No
---
&gt;The problem is some issues have been known for years (lever action reload) and Bethesda never fixed them in previous games or engine updates.
---
Yeah I agree with that
---
&gt;2 months on a full priced online game is a unacceptable to fix even basics like weapon degradation or welcome mats. With the amount of feedback this forum alone has given, even from the beta, there is no excuse for the state this game is in.
---
Well yeah they absolutely shouldn't have released it without doing a real, extensive beta. It was fucking stupid. It should've gone through months of play testing. But, come on, the state the game was at release takes way longer to fix than two months. They just released an [extensive patch today covering tons of glitches I've never even heard of](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/aejlcj/fallout_76_january_10_patch_notes). There's so many bugs in this game that most people in the circlejerk don't realize.
---
Also the welcome mats aren't a glitch but removed on purpose. You may not agree with it, but that doesn't make it "broken". I don't really agree with it either, but I see where they're coming from with that decision.
---
Yeah, of course the game is still in a terrible state right now, but nobody should've expected it to be completely fixed in less than two months. That's ridiculous.
---
I'm usually on during the day because I work as a bartender. I have two characters, one level 56 and one level 11. Feel free to add me celeste_strange.

Lemme grab my popcorn

What about trophies alot of my ps4 one have not  unlocked. Like leaving the vault or being lvl 10 when I'm lvl 111
---
Yeah you're right the dremora don't deserve that punishment. But perhaps the Ideal Masters could find use for their souls. They clearly aren't using them anyway. 
---
Hi there,
---
you can add me as a friend dj5150009
---
Im usually trolling for supplies or searching for 3 star legionaries, but feel free to hop to where im at if you need something (protection/supplies/workbenches etc..) 
---
see u in the wasteland.
---
🤨🤨🤨
---
I also would prefer they not be sent to my plane of existence. 
---
I keep getting ghoulslayer. Pointless.
---
Bethesda doesn’t care enough to actually go and ban people so that’s not gonna happen. 
---
I would suspect that as people’s interest in the game scales down, that we will see a number of the current TSE stock taken out of the market by people who have gone onto different games and their TSE staying on their accounts.  And as others have suggested, we could see an update that brings out 4* items effectively reducing the duped 3* items to the forgotten pile. 
---
Big if true.
---
Has to be one of the funnier glitches, though.
---
I never really got where NoSQL would make sense, except maybe for file uploads.
---
Hmm, or SAVE file uploads...
---
But yeah. Save states, which should have a very clearly defined structure, are be the last thing you should use NoSQL for.
---
Check in the stored section. My base has been duplicating itself every now and then. 
---
More depth and immersion to the game.  More story, more personal attachments to npcs and their plights 
---
This is what happens when everyone complains " it doesn't make sense to need ballistic fiber to repair when it isn't needed to craft it!"
---
ohhh, i guess i took that as you can stay logged in to a server and be able to have 2 characters load into the same server....its been a long week. 
---
No arguing with that but it would also hardly be the first project to be optimistic about the amount of post-launch issues and which underestimated the cost of loss of institutional knowledge. The game is now Austin’s baby and they are more limited in experience with the engine. Either they’ll decide to baptize by fire, which seems likely or pull people off the new IP which seems less likely. 
---
My favorite part is the death threats and reporting threats 
---
For me it happen all the time. I also lose my  Ultracite Power Armor and had no chance to try it out. Then I lose Т60 and X01 PA  because of disconnection. Finally I lose T60 with all mods ,because I painted it with Hotter Rod paint from shops.
---
Do you know anything about actual guns, left handed rifles bolts and extractors are on the left, hand grips are mostly universal, when I was in the military I shot a left handed m16 and I'm right handed just saying
---
afaik its not level locked just need to keep hopping unfortantely. i dont think other vendors have a better chance of haivng combat shotgun plans than pheonix.
---
You’re right, but my camp is right next to a generator and I rely on one daily from it. Also anytime you run a silo you get one or two. But that just doesn’t seem like something that should be a concern considering how hard it is to get anything besides a nocturnal rolling pin. What are you pulling cores from in ash heap?

I started playing Legends of Aria yesterday because I was intrigued in playing a "modern" UO. It's not that bad, obviously needs some work, but I'm enjoying it.
---
Give the black soul gems to novices at the Arcane University to dabble with basic enchantments. (Just paint the soul gems blue, they'll never think to look).
---
They banned some people who modded their games so no. You're wrong. 
---
I got a twoshot 308 pipe rifle that'll tide me over for now but this is splendid news
---
I didn't even know the Hardened Mass got autoscrapped by the Scrap All option. Exp,ains why I never had any after I got back from a nuke zone after knowing I picked some up since I always scrap all my junk as soon as I get to my C.A.M.P...
---
I use them. I’ve seen many other people here talk about auto grenade launchers.
---
“Nobody uses that” isn’t a good reason to not balance a game properly. You’re simply trying to dismiss an issue, and not discuss it. I’d thank you to not add comments if you aren’t here to be a part of the discussion.
---
This makes me happy, I am glad despite all the rage they haven't given up.
---
But i will think twice before buying a 60 EA game, but then again. It was my choice.
---
Cheers lads!
---
I don't think fog crawlers came from crayfish due to the existence of mirelurk hunters.
---
Yes. It’s awful. I have been avoiding the nukes there. It’s a feeding frenzy 
---
As I expected.
---
Username checks out.
---
Eh.. You don't need humans to do that. Perfectly possible with robots or animals lol.

As far as I’m aware, a level 15 BPR does 145 base damage. Wikia doesn’t state the level of the Dragon at a base damage of 200. However, I believe the Dragon does more damage than the BPR per bullet. IE - four rounds from the Dragon would be 800 damage, whereas the BPR is still only 145 (assuming both are the same level? Again, Wikia doesn’t say). 
---
If we’re going based off that - a TSE BPR would have an overall damage of 320 (calculating in both bullets without any perks or chems).
---
Here’s my math, but I could be wrong. This includes the Explosive effect, which adds 15 damage per pullet.
---
TSE BPR;
---
145+15=160x2 = 320
---
TSE Dragon;
---
200+15=215x8 = 1,720
---
Quad Explosive Dragon;
---
200+15=215x16 = 3,440
---
However, this still assumes that a standard Dragon does more damage than a standard BPR at the same base level. 
---
The difference between a TSE and quad explosive Dragon is that a TSE Dragon will fire eight rounds at the cost of 4 bullets, while seemingly firing only 4 bullets. A quad capacity Dragon will indeed fire 16 bullets, at the cost of 16 bullets while playing the firing animation four times as long. 
---
It’s more damage over a longer period of time, but the difference in time is *almost* negligible. 
---
Brilliant. 
---
giveth\* taketh\*
---
I hope it works for you as well. Good luck!
---
This... when my wife Mules for me I troll her by doing this. Pisses her off hahah
---
It is very real.  I'm over level 100 and almost died to a guy who was spamming a TSE shotgun during the Uranium Fever event, even though we were not in PvP and he wasn't even aiming at me, just blasting molemen too close to me.  Oh, and he was level 20.
---
I think an increase as you level up would be great, with no cap. If you can level, you can get 5-10lbs more space. That's not a huge thing because as you are leveling you shouldn't have anything huge but when you have the option to build bigger things then the storage budget and stash capacity should change.
---
Nice! I tried the pipe for a little bit but wound up using the lever action, *which also just got patched praise Todd*
---
that'd be funny
---
The camp glitch only duplicates camp items... not sure what you experience. Wasn't this though.
---
WSR?
---
What plane is that? 
---
Have you actually tried testing this though?
---
Like, have you personally used an anti-armor energy gun?
---
Because while I agree that it should work like that, it does not seem to.
---
We do roam in here to and I'm here to say you are right you got me stranger. You weren't downvoted because you sound a whiny, sniveling child who cant see that it is fine to like a game  but also that the game they like is panned by a majority of people so you are bound to get this response. No, it's because I the kingpin of FO76 hate has found it necessary for you to be downvoted. 
---
You made a post it didn't land with much of an impact you aren't being targeted by haters you made a shit post friend.
---
Lol you owe me 20 missiles and 8 super mutants their lives for the tests I ran. Jk.
---
You get dressed in your Bethesda pajamas... trickled with sweet rolls, stimpacks, elder scrolls, vault doors, dragons, tunnel snakes, and the like. You brush your teeth with a toothbrush shaped like a bobby pin, and you head to your room. As you enter, posters of their games adorn the walls. The Lone Wanderer, The Courier, The Dragonborn, even a strange Sexy Moira holding the Wasteland Survival Guide that you worked oh so hard on. Bookshelves filled with copies of The Lusty Argonian Maid, actual burned books, and DIY Nuka Cola make the room into your haven. You hop into bed, plug in your phone so the Pip Boy background can charge over night, and pull the soft Vault Boy sheets over your body.
---
In comes Todd, sitting beside your bed and smiling at you like a mother to her child. He brushes his hand through your hair, and you smile feeling safe and cozy in your bed. He sits back and opens his blue story book. You shut your eyes and open your ears, and take a deep breath. He begins, from page 1, just the way you like it.
---
*Patch Notes - January 10th, 2019. 
---
Systems: PC, Xbox, Playstation
---
Changes: lever action rifle reload glitch fixed, bobby pin weight decreased, ...*
---
and hundreds more while a smile creeps across your hushed face. You begin to see images of mini nukes, 10mm pistols, mole miners, and robo brains slide across your view as the list goes on. His soothing voice lulls you closer to sleep as you try to hold on to hearing each and every fix, but knowing that even if you doze off, Todd will make the game what you had always dreamed of.
---
As you fall into that peaceful deep sleep and Todd's voice begins to fade, the patch notes and the dream world begin to blend. The visuals get clearer and form a magical landscape. One where you can almost hear the sounds of the world around you. You can smell the fresh air, the trees, the wildlife. Then you hear it, the sound you could not mistake and that you knew you should have expected in this dreamland of Todd...
---
*Hey, you. You're finally awake.*
---
Todd stands up, knowing that he has done his duty. He kisses you on your calm sleeping head, turns off the Nuka Cola lamp, and heads for the door.
---
The End.
---
Does it give the error that stacked stairwells do where it can't trace a path to foundation and doesn't let you remove any placed flooring?
---
Played the game for 50+ hours and still haven’t ran into this guy for some reason. 
---
or better yet, a furiously endless missle launcher.....mmmmmm yes
---
Replace sql with whaever you want, is still true.
---
Just so you all know I deleted 76 yesterday ..... So we would all get the beautiful patch the next day .
---
......  Obviously.
---
How do you feel about having that second account? , thought about making a new one the other day but I finally found a weapon worth having a Quad Handmade rifle and I can’t see myself parting away. Especially since my second best legendary is a Junkie Heated Pitchfork.  
---
If they add more content before they fix the bugs we have, there will just be more bugs on top of old bugs and do you really want that?
---
How is endgame drawn out when you can literally hit lvl 100 in a week or less? 
---
No one is going to take that perk because of grenade launchers and you know it.
---
yea I noticed that too and no more fusion core refills when leaving and coming back to a server. 
---
That’s why I run full trapper gear. Doesn’t cost any ballistic fiber to repair, no matter the level. 
---
It’s not the best armor in the world, but it’s decent enough and that’s a huge plus
---
Imo Dodgy isnt really worth it. 30% damage reduction to basically not have AP is bad when VATS is so good for melee and unarmed because the perk from Fallout 4 that allows you to attack from further away and basically teleport to your target is active by default.
---
As for legendary effects, the usual that people look for (especially considering it looks like you are going for a bloodied build based on Nerd Rage and Serendipity) would be Unyielding (+3 to all SPECIAL except endurance when health is low) and sentinels as a third effect (+15% damage reduction when standing still). Not sure how good sentinels would be for you but unyielding for sure. Take a look at the fo76 wiki legendary effects page to see what you could have.
---
Depends on what teir locks your picking, sometimes t-3 locks can be a bit....finicky
---
ROFL!!
---
Being under 20 percent health scares me.
---
Common mobs were never supposed to drop legendaries
---
Oblivion lol.
---
I understand and respect your opinion but here is why I have the opposite view point. Everytime I come across a guy with a TSE a little voice in the back of my head says "probably a dupe". I try to fight it by saying "no there are good people who worked hard for that stuff" but the thought is always looming. When I eventually get myself a godly 3 star weapon I don't want people to the minimize the work I put in for it. Other than that, I would gladly sacrifice thousands of caps for a level playing field and better economy. Granted, I never sought out TSE weps because I felt there was a good chance they could be duped. So I'm bias, no denying that
---
Yeah I wasn’t even intentionally grinding for levels but I’m gaining perk points faster than I’m able to decode what to do with them just off of looking for nuked flowers and killing the hordes that protect those flowers
---
Someone on here made a visual guide to the different plans. I'll add it here if I find it.
---
Yes, that's the one. I had found it dropped in a bag at whitesprings.
---
eh I just go up to someone and say - kill me and they usually oblige once I assure them 3 or 4 times that I will not attack them back
---
I knowww, I was in the Grand Canyon with family on that day so when I got home I had the sad
---
If it was they would've done it. The robot and computer aspects of it have failed. There is a huge lack of depth, releasing a vault allowing human npcs, that can change they entire way someone plays. Say they bring in a faction system. Raiders, bos, enclave, etc, heath they players already are rping these factions. But it would be nice to have some sort of rpg feel to it, so that it doesnt seem so boring. I'm level 100, and in tired of farming plans, and killing sbq. 
---
Nah, I just think your really unlucky, but I'm not really sure ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
---
Lucky. When I went to a nuke zone as a low level with a PA chassis I insta died.
---
I think this is that: 
---
Armor: Addressed several issues that would prevent players from exiting power armor and at times cause the Pip-Boy to become unavailable.
---
I've found a two shot flare gun
---
Who the fuck throw grenades in PVP? You're just complaining for the sake of complaining. Even a crippled ghoul can outrun grenade let alone actual human players. 
---
If I knew it made a creepy laugh I would have bought it. 
---
*facepalms*
---
excavator armor is only a beginner thing, youre not supposed to wear it forever
---
if it bugs you, fine. but do you really need to take that to reddit? i mean does it bug you THAT MUCH that you only consider it HALF fixed? Then it must also bug you how you never have to clean your gun? That it never misfires?  IT IS A GAME!
---
The patch notes also stated that they LOWERED the amount of materials needed to repair armors. Besides, there are perk cards that reduce the damage that armor takes, AND perk cards to let you repair things at a higher durability. You'll be ok!
---
That's actually really good to know. Now the matter of finding a plan for it.
---
For REAL ! Im Like Why Am I Still Reloading The H*ll Lmaoo
---
Been pretty much confirmed from terminal entries founs by people who glitched into the Vaults that everyone in the Vaults died
---
Again, to make screws would require an input, and almost everything from a junk pile is useful.  
---
I dont really see what your trying to achieve by saying screws should be super hard to get, all being able to craft them with a machine would do would be to lower the value of these super high value items and raise the value of steel
---
It definitely heals *at* a set amount, but I don't believe it heals *for* a set amount, besides "until full.". I probably did ~700% of it's hp while it was healing up.
---
So, the best way to fight any legendary with an automatic weapon is to... Stop shooting and let them heal, then start over.
---
I think that's really dumb.
---
If you have the heavy barrel unlocked you can put that on, worst case scenario just scrap a few .50s or find someone who can craft it on for you
---
You've never done a cycle and got nothing?
---
This is the first I’ve heard that they gain a mutation as well, interesting!  Do you know if the mutation is from the same pool as player mutations, or something different? Also, do you have a source for this? 
---
Empty and disappointing? I feel like we are playing 2 different games. 
---
Wishful thinking I guess
---
Ye I meant OP, my bad lol
---
They will come back eventually.
---
Upvote for great metaphor title 
---
The dodgy perk.  You take 30% less damage at the cost of 30 AP/hit
---
Ghouls were giving boss xp, maybe their amazing amount of legendary loot was also tied to this issue. Probably wasn't a nerf though, was likely a bug fix. I would wait until we have a much larger data set before crying wolf though. Bad runs happen. 
---
Neat, I never knew that... I just knew that they barrowed the fat man name from the bombs dropped on Japan in ww2... Fat man and little boy. 
---
Oh that stash looks nice !
---
Wouldnt it be nice...
---
Hate them. The fucking disconnects are so annoying. But the duping thing seems to be a problem with the engine itself. Hope they fixed it. But this engine has been out there for ages.
---
FO is a resource gathering and scavenging game.  If things are too easy to come by, the game loop becomes too simplified and thereby boring.  Scarcity is an essential part of the survival/gameplay loop and has to be balanced between too easy and too hard.  I'm overslowing in fusion cores, so it sure seems like it's been too easy.
---
I like it!  And this sub also has the same hive mind that Maxson's brotherhood has!  Ad Victoriam!
---
They ruin the game for themselves AND others. It's complete nonsense.
---
...what do you do after you hit 100?
---
That's the endgame.
---
Don't understand what you're even arguing.
---
I'm saying once you have all the perks you want, all there really is left to do to progress your character is bash your face into legendary enemies and prey they drop something that isn't trash. And right now it's not even fun legendary enemies, it's just fat melee ghouls.
---
Drawn out. Stale.
---
you can have other PA with calibrated shocks, unless you put CS on excavator it just sucks
---
I really dont get why we didnt get any special weaponry. Plasma gattling is ok but man where is the caster.
---
I'd say by level 25 someone isn't a newcomer to the game.
---

Do you have source to back up this claim?
---
How is this fair to people who start farming recently
---
Paper bags aren't the easiest to spot, if you've pilfered some duped items from people actively duping you can just drop them in some bushes. Server hop beforehand if you don't want them looking the bag.
---
And +1 for every 100 cans after!
---
According to my achievements I’m a lvl 98 that never left the vault or leveled up. 
---
Yes, it's undoubtedly a very simple fix, but it's also an extremely low priority, so it didn't get fixed right away.
---
Seems weird to me to calculate the effectiveness of dense mod and fireproof perk assuming having dodgy as a baseline.
---
I guess I didn't realize that was "standard"
---
That’s my point, they’ll take it for explosive weapons which are far more common, but surprise, what you take a perk for doesn’t determine what it will effect. So again you don’t have a point that makes sense. You’re just trying to stir up some shit with your comments now so I’m ignoring you from here.
---
I'm all with you on the level playing field and better economy bit. The only issue I have with possibly losing this weapon is that I lost the only other weapon I had that was decent due to some server problem. And that took a mind numbing amount of repetitively closing Fallout 76, joining a friend at the golf clubhouse, mowing everything down, looting everything, scrapping everything for more 10mm ammo, and repeating that whole process for probably twenty hours of my free time. If there was a better system in place to acquire better legendary weaponry instead of four or five ghoul slayer's rolling pins and thirty chameleon's leather right arms... I'd probably be okay with losing it.  
---
edit for grammar. I'm sleepy.
---
 I don’t think the fans went into as much of a breakdown over 4 than they did for 76
---
they’re punishing us for playing the game i see 
---
Worth every upvote. Looks great!
---
Easier solution: Throw any unwanted item in a random dumpster. I don't really care what happens to it after I left it there and the chances are small that someone else picks it up if I dump it at a less frequented location.
---
Don't know, need more data to confirm
---
Hey, IF it works then any legendary hunting rifles will be unduped.
---
Greetings,
---
That's directly from the e-mail I received. It's the same for everyone.
---
That place is really dark, figured it was a good place to test lights
---
The mass correcting is the issue, and maybe they have so much on their plate that they would overlook something small like that.
---
Things on reddit are rarely a conversation, it's "You're wrong" "No you're wrong" etc, with so much spite behind it all the time
---
If i go to a vendor and sell them a stack of junk, slide the arrow all the way to the left to Set Quantity to 1...the slider resets to the max amount instead of stopping at 1. You cant be at max price and hit right to roll it over to 1, only bugs left to right.
---
This was removed in the first patch.
---
I guess someone looked at Counter-Strike, PUBG, et al, saw them doing it and thought it would be a good idea to follow suit.
---
In title: Missile Launchers and Grenade Launchers. Unless you can outrun a missile, your point doesn’t make sense.
---
yep. haven’t played since release because of how many problems i keep hearing about. 
---
We're taking paint and cosmetics, not which armor is better 
---
Ammo doesn't need to be sellable but we should be able to break it down to components so we can craft ammo we actually use.
---
You can bank all your perks until 50 and use them all once you get there. 
---
I too have seen threads with a Bethesda response to the effect they don’t have a way to track or restore inventory. 
---
Yeah I've played Fallout 4.
---
No just a dick...next time just quit out load a new game before ur camp is destroyed 
---
You’re completely missing the point. *THEY DON’T CARE IF THEY GET BANNED, BECAUSE THEY’RE JUST STRIPMINING THE GAME FOR REAL MONEY SALES.*
---
Once patched out, they’ll just walk away laughing and counting their cash. You’re presuming they have an actual interest in staying with the game to play it. They don’t.
---
No, it's an old one that has been patched. It no longer works.
---
Thanks for the info. I’ll be sure to use this feature. 
---
True, but at least doing it this way guarantees that no one finds it.Theoretically it should also help with server stability 
---
The barrel does not replace the receiver. That's two different slots.
---
Seem to have fixed it. Deleted everything in stored section (wasn’t anything before patch) and then I had to restart the game. I can now build a few small items again
---
Seek the service of the Deathgivers!
---
Exactly! Pre-war money is all over the place in this game and all it's good for cloth. Can't even sell the stuff to vendors.
---
Maybe they've got plans for it that simply weren't ready at launch. I better create an alt account to start hoarding it just in case! When Bethesda finally creates a need for it, I'll be ready to launch the BCB, the Bobhatch55 Central Bank.
---
1* NOCTURNAL WOOD LEGS FOREVER!!! AWE YISS
---
oof, I hope not lol, that is pretty much all the endgame there is. I've farmed a fair bit and I'm certain I've thrown out at least a hundred garbage legendaries. Nerfing the drop rate would take farming from tedious to self-inflicted torture.
---
Diluting your product by cross promoting with things in a world you're attempting to immerse players in breaks immersion. It's also really fucking cheap. As you can see, if this turns out to be a rage promo item, all quality was sacraficed to make it so. Enjoy your 12-18 dollar couple coloured power armor though? I guess.
---
Demand more from your games dude, especially since its your money. Or open your mouth wide enough for them to fit their chocolate starfish in your gob, and squeeze another deuce down your throat. up to you brah,
---
You would think so, right? But no, it wasn't a priority for them, apparently.
---
Even when I just run into friendly robots it makes the game better for me. After hours of wandering alone ita nice to hear something other than super mutant grunting and scorched yelling. I just wanna feel that with engaging characters
---
you did not
---
I don't think it's meant to be end game. Bolt action fans will have something to work with at least.
---
After all the stealth perks, I’d be looking for chameleon mutation and a set of weightless armor. And any damage perks, the higher your base the higher that sneak attack damage will be. Things like bloody mess and adrenaline
---
I believe the xp fix was for glowing ghouls, not regular ones.
---
I don’t sadly. I’m a rad rage low health build so literally all of my points are in agility perception and luck. I have 8 in intelligence but I need those for nerd rage and gun Smith. I rarely ever use power armor anyway unless I’m in a nuke zone. 
---
no they shouldnt. at least not this soon. year 2, maybe...and that's a solid MAYBE. anyone who thinks this game NEEDS to have human NPC's hasnt paid attention to literally any information about this game since the day it was announced.
---
I had the same problem. Then I added the foundation and thought that would do it. It didn't... Because then the pillars wouldn't connect with the top floor. After messing around with it, swapping between floors, walls and roof combinations, I finally succeeded. Unfortunately I can't give you the exact recipe, because the building procedure would act differently every time I had to do an exit/enter-build-mode due to wierd bugs. It was tiresome but possible.
---
Give it another try, you'll eventually catch up ;)
---
Same list as players except if i remember right. Data miners posted an article about it during beta testing. It's hard to notice because they die so quickly, but you can see it does something to them if you are patient enough to kill them slowly. You will notice one that all the sudden moves faster (speed demon) all the sudden they are hitting harder in melee (talons, etc).
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm not asking for players to sit there till everyone gets a slap,  but do you really have to open up on one legendary ghoul with 6 shots of a TSE shotgun like you are panic firing a hoarde? You can't wait like 3~4 seconds? 
---
My first one was the instigating which I got at about lvl 30. It was a lvl 35 two star which I got so randomly, I was near the national satellite array, basically in the forest, and out of nowhere a legendary protectron and a bunch of bodyguards spawned there and came after me. The two shot and BPR I think I got at whitesprings or wendigo cave.
---
I mean, while that’s technically true, there’s still plenty. 
---
Brb accidentally scrapping mods to repair my CAMP. 
---
I'd love to ... They in the phone book?
---
I've lost so damn many mods for the x01 from scrapping. The patch came a little effing late. I just want plans for everything. Just give me plans. Weight is a constant issue, I don't care what it is, I want to be able to break it down when I'm not using it and when I want to later just craft it use it and drop it when I'm done. Doesn't work that way with x01 mods or legendaries though. I get why, I don't care, that's how I want it. I think it would make the game better.
---
Its smarter to release the less popular skin first to empty your points. Then when good/popular skins gets released you will have to buy atomic point for your favorite handmade skin. 
---
Whack-a-Commie
---
Hmm I will have to check when I get on again, I was pretty sure that I did something to override it, disregard the other thing then
---
You two are ridiculous...
---
I had this the other day. Nobody wanted my bounty, lower levels just waved at me. In the end a person asked if I would like to be killed very politely. It was all very civil. He even protected my dropped junk. Even though I intentionally just left a empty beer bottle. 
---
There are typically 4 or more legendary mobs hanging out int that golf clubhouse, even without a nuke.
---
i have a simple mutants deathclaw fist and a basic build with nothing special. a shitload of vanguards armor pieces and some tanky perks. not a lot of dmg perks but i do have both melee/fist mutations. my fist weapon lists dmg at 500+ and i've basically solod the SBQ in less than 3 ground phases. 
---
was one of those times where the only people who showed up were a handful of people who couldnt withstand the dmg and just tagged and hid so i went to down on all the adds then chipped about 30% of her health both times she landed and finished her off with my random handmade rifle i had in inventory. took almost no dmg
---
What you said and also the fact that if they didn’t defend the duped items, prices for weapons will increase to astronomic proportions and people selling duped weapons will make a killing.
---
Too little, too late.
---
I don’t think this game can be fixed.
---
I just don't really see the need for human NPCs. I feel like people have this romanticized idea of NPCs. Sure the first time you meet them they have lots of personality, but it does take long before they become just as robotic as the vendors we have now.
---
I would rather them give us the ability to form factions. We've been out of the vault for awhile. It stands to reason 76ers would have started to form communities, gangs, cults, etc. Let us start to shape Appalachia. 
---
HAHA thats what I like to hear... errr...
---
I had that happen a lot. I bet you hold spacebar when you jump instead of tapping it, don't you?
---
I noticed that if I held space on a jump, if I landed next to someone it'd prompt trade immediately. If I just tapped it, no prompt for trade. 
---
What was happening, in my view, was the game calculated that "you must hold down space for X time to initiate trade" but didn't specify that WHEN YOU STARTED holding space mattered, when it should have only mattered AFTER you get the dialog prompt.
---
High bounty, on that note a lvl 191 in my server last night had a 640 c bounty so my lvl  45 ass  went to go kill him with a fat man and he let his buddy kill him
---
Sneak, Mister Sandman for night stealth bonus, Adrenaline for increase damage per kill, etc.
---
Also make sure you have all weightless with chameleon or cloaking armor to remain unseen for as long as possible as well as escape perk.
---
Was this on PC? I think I wandered through your camp last night. It looked fantastic and I ended up rebuilding my camp in brick.
---
Hopefully the robot dialogue transfers too.  I'd pay to see people get chased around Whitesprings by packs of naked ghouls screaming "Time to hit the showers!"
---
Yesterday I decided to go after a wanted player I saw and I went in fully ready to go 1-on-1. Think he had the same issue lol. Ah well, I got 20 caps and 2 achievements out of them so I can't complain😆
---
I don't personally see how that is easier. When I pilfer dupers I'm so over encumbered I couldn't even begin to think slow walking to the nearest container. This method you don't need to leave the spot, and the bag disappears before you put anything 'inside'
---
I have experience in the software world too. Extremely low priority shit gets pushed aside. 
---
Besides, this bug was fixed less than 2 months after release. In the software world, that's pretty quick all things considered.
---
Eastern Europe many decades ago was a powder keg. and you mentioned everyone was required to enlist in the military so that makes sense they would provide weapons training, but it's not normal. The only countries where that happens are countries with mandatory military service or if they under constant threat of invasion. Neither of those things apply to the US. 
---
And i know it's a popular impression but firearms are not nearly as omnipresent in the US as you, or most europeans, seem to think.  i'm an adult in New York and i don't own a gun. None of my friends own guns. I have some family that own guns but they are shotguns or hunting rifles used for hunting. I don't hunt and have no intention of hunting so the likelihood that will encounter a gun at any point is slim (unless i decide to seek it out). My children have never seen guns (aside from law enforcement) and since i'm not a hunter and don't plan on teaching them to hunt, i assume they will have no contact with guns. 
---
So why should we teach guns in school? 
---
Odd. I've honestly been pretty lucky but I also play on PC.
---
I will say after eatching my friend play, exploits seem like a WAY bigger strain on the servers for console.
---
It’s really nice for trading to vendors (charisma) and crafting armor/weapons (intelligence) if you’re not using it for a melee build
---
No, one cycle means I run tho the whole area which covered all 3 locations, roughly 30 ish * level 62 and maybe 5 or 6 level 42.
---
It's rare to get nothing but today I have run like 8 times in one session, and got DCed.
---
Probably because if you have that mode on then you aren't interested in PVP at all so it should make it so you can't hurt them and they can't hurt you. 
---
Paging u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
yeah you have to be really careful about lights and defenses, Also it seems the higher level you get the larger the camp budget is. Im lvl 135.
---
I have a Quad... gonna hate watching 20 rounds get loaded into it. Was nice to reload 20 rounds with the animation of 5. Felt truly legendary. Lol
---
Best melee weapons in the game are going to be vampire weapons because when paired with the right build your health will not move I have a really good 2h power armor build I have paired it with a vampires poll hook at lvl 60 I fought a deathclaw matriarch lvl 90 and my health did not move from full and as a added bonus the vampire weapons are still broke if you swing it in the air it still heals you.  Here is my spec Strength 15, 3 in each slugger, m slugger, e slugger, incisor, martial artist  perception only 1 here glow sight 1  Endurance 10 ghoulish 3 sun kissed 2 photosynthetic 2 solar powered 3  Charisma 10  lone wanderer 4 tenderizer 3 suppressor 3  Intelligence  8   makeshift warrior 5 power smith 3 also in intel when your fixing your power armor have fix it good maxed out at 5 and trade it out with make shift warrior Agility 4 action boy 3 adrenaline 1  Luck 8 bloody mess 3 class freak 3 starched genes 2.    
---
Don't get jaded by mentions of 20% health. It's _up to_ 3 with steps in between.
---
Worst case scenario it's pretty convenient to drink some water/eat foods to get you around 80% for a single point bump (stacks with multiple pieces) for extra melee damage or carry weight.
---
I'm level 98 and easily got up to level 50 during the B.E.T.A. (the game was more exciting for me when it had limited times I guess) but that's still a lot to go back and redo 
---
I've recieved nothing multiple times over.
---
No legendary mobs, no legendaries from none legendary enemy's.
---
There was no nerf if someone got the same luck i have
---
Don’t understand what your saying. I’m saying I’ve fought SB without them having additional groups, also never noticed them spawning more then the one group they start with. I’m saying it’s possible my experience is simply due to glitches. The way you phrased it sounded like the claim of killing adds forcing SB is a glitch rather then intended 
---
“Oh yeah, and green stuff for Moo Moo.”
---
“*Moooooo.*”
---
But it had to get to that person through the correct channels. 30 seconds at the keyboard but minutes and hours in a meeting to approve it.
---
I'll dig and see if I can find the original source - but thanks for the info!  I'll keep an eye out for this from now on.
---
Thanks! Building CAMPS is my endgame.
---
It’s because of the fucking dupers 
---
This some real shit.
---
I killed like 4 or 5 scorched with a Furious Laser Rifle with weapon artisan and lose 1/4 of an entire CND bar, and it only does 60 damage.
---
I use a handmade and I'd be playing for hours before any real noticeable change in condition, and it also does like 80 damage per shot.
---
Hell, even my perfect storm is better than my laser rifle. Does like 60 damage per shot, burns em, 10mm ammo is piss easy to find, plentiful on craft with super duper, and CND is a nonissue.
---
As an energy weapon roleplayer, even with this update I can't bring myself to play it because energy weapons are just so uninteresting to use.
---
I was never able to repair my armor pieces until I got White Knight. Now I'm actually accumulating ballistic fibre instead of constantly looking for it
---
so youre asking for flippers to be added to the game?
---
It's been another month now and the team making issue hasn't been addressed in today's patch either. Can you please give me a status report? 
---
They should have an atom store skin for Holy Hand Grenades. Or just implement it in the base game as well.
---
This was the one thing I was looking for while reading through. Seems like a solid patch, but was still saddened to see this change was missing.
---
Vampire Outfit, Bottlecap Sunglasses, Civil War Era Top Hat, Prison Collar
---
I am on Xbox and that’d be great thank you! I was feeling braver after dealing with the scorched but I’ve read what enemies are to come and would like to employ a bodyguard(s) :-)
---
Lul
---
I still see the same bugs in mine from the little played. The vendor still shows 0 caps sometimes when they have 200. There's others but they benefit me so stay quiet xd
---
Well only east coast ones. So yeah, that's true here, just not true in general.
---
Just don't awaken the Elder Ones
---
Take. It. Slow. 
---
Claim workshops!
---
I'm built on a lake too! I really wish I had the open sign and neon letters, that caps cost though! :(
---
I run a stealth build with either melee or gun setups.  In all things I do It's  in stealth. I get in kill the Perp loot their bag and fast travel home.  Good luck finding me in stealth.
---
A few times I've run across a CAMP that didn't look like a CAMP--until I saw the actual CAMP device, it looked like part of the native game. Is it possible the other players thought your CAMP was something else? 
---
It basically is because I know of a potential way to do it without making 300 wooden boards.
---
I even PMed /u/lonevaultwanderer about it with details but I haven’t heard back.
---
I think that we can chalk this up to inexperience with a MP title though honestly. I legitimately think they just didn't realize it was something they needed to do.
---
Although why in gods name they didn't bring in some outside consultants with experience with online titles is beyond me. 
---
No one cares about fo4
---
to be fair, lucky break is very hard to have for people managing mutations with starched/class freak (5 pts combined).  5 pts for that plus 3 points for luck of the draw is 8... that's my whole luck.  no room for lucky break.
---
I agree 100%!! I wouldn't care that they stay airborne if I could actually see them!
---
amen!  I'm right there with ya
---
I've been told the way patches work on consoles is more structured, forcing them to send over full-files to replace what exists rather than just making changes to the existing files themselves.
---
They certainly wouldn't do it unless necessary as they have to pay for the bandwidth and larger files=more bandwidth.
---
I found a PvP 30 all rise in watcha train station vendor the other day I mainly use it when spotted, up close or fighting deathclaws up close
---
I’m so happy about the Bobby pin changes and the lever action fix. The lever action is one of my favorite weapons but I hate that bug 
---
Sounds like you just need to exit the game and hard reset. Happened to me once and that fixed it. 
---
Yeah. I know how it works with barrels. But unfortunately the receiver is different. If the .50 cal has the prime one on it. It's impossible to remove it.
---
Well it seems even though they can make fusion generators and power armor, they still don't know how to repair a motorcycle or car engine either. Who knows 
---
I agree on the Gauss, but vs Lever action, the hunting rifles do have the ability to be modded for armor piercing, whereas lever actions don’t. Vs higher DR enemies they’ll come out a bit ahead.
---
he wants you to fire back so he can kill you and take you caps, then if you seek revenge he does it again, more caps
---
I've had this happen with most enemy types. I think only Sentry's are supposed to explode, maybe the other robots much more rarely. They're supposed to give a warning alarm, too. 
---
But Legendary's from Watoga always explode for me, and sometimes Ghouls, Mole Miners and even other enemies. I thought it was a known bug, but here it is.
---
Apparently east coast and west coast Super Mutants are different (separate variants of FEV I guess). West Coast ones can have females (the Master straight up mentions them at the end of FO1).
---
nope :(
---
BGS...
---
Except when someone makes a post complaining about getting 'griefed' (ie. Getting PvP'd) then this sub will rally around them and...WTF why play a PvP game when you hate PvP? GO PLAY SOMETHING ELSE.
---
Right?
---
Mommy is hiding her credit card so you couldn't buy. Vent it out, were listening.
---
Yeah, i logged into my camp, started taking DMG, a lot of it, after a about 5-10 seconds i could suddenly see a SB flying over me, it had already taken out half my camp before it was visible... it didn't end well for the SB, lol
---
I got lucky that no one seems to use this spot either. Its also not that bad now with the new mechanics of just relogging. half the game is server hopping anyway.
---
Those were all confirmed to be fake. This addresses a different issue.
---
They do not have tools created for accessing and playing around with character's inventories.
---
Nobody said "it's not possible at all".
---
Bethesda Game Studios in Maryland did not program a utility, a piece of software, a tool, or sanction SQL scripts of any sort to tackle the issue. And probably have a dozen other things I could write here. Stop coming back with witty remarks. They (Bethesda) won't right now (in the present) do anything (take action against duped items) because they have no way of telling if it was duped (due to a lack of time, resources, logs, foresight). 
---
Jesus dude. You really want to punish people who would give you every item in the game for free in seconds. Shucks. What mean jerks. 
---
Early 20s is still good I think. My second character got them around that level.
---
But this is fallout 76, and ppl have farmed here for month due to the high legendary drop rate.
---
I have roughly 1500 hours in fallout 4, doesn't make me a fallout 76 pro
---
I am sorry but you are just a bit dumb.
---
It could be a gift for people ordering a premium version of the game. It does not "dilute" your game quality. How does it breaks immersion? Seriously, someone running in a clown costume while being chased by an army of ghouls is fine, but a guy with a pink suit OMG THE END OF THE WORLD.
---
Also, its not because they put something in the store that you HAVE to buy it. For instance, I am not buying anything as I find the price too steep.
---
The time it took them to do this piece of suits is not stopping them from improving the game. At the moment the bulk of the stuff they need to fix is engineering and designer time, not artist time.
---
East coast? Eh?
---
Mariposa?
---
Well... its a mothman sleeping bag! Ill take the guest room if they are upset and they can have the master.
---
Fuck that noise!
---
Does having different pieces stack the effect? I currently use one unyielding light weight leather arm for the INT bonus when I craft.
---
The cost increases while you have the camp drop menu open. 
---
1. Open camp drop.
---
2. Find the spot you like.
---
3. Close camp drop.
---
4. Open camp drop and place it without moving your character.
---
You should now get the quoted price. 
---
60 caps each for cobalt and 80 for violet. GT MadDogMolina 
---
Lvl 140 here, thanks, wasn’t aware of how the game worked. 
---
I made ~800 caps today defending myself from people after my 50 caps bounty lol
---
I love this change because I’ve always liked using the hunting rifle and I was disappointed learning they could not drop as legendaries. Now it will give hunting rifle users something else to look forward to finding.
---
Deal but I won’t be on for about 30 mins.
---
Fallout players
---
&gt;complain about realism of bobby pins
---
&gt;carry 500 lbs of weapons in pants pockets
---
No, and it will be in FO5 again.
---
That’s fine. Send me a message when you’re online. 
---
M79 fix w00t.
---
Now if only they could refix the Auto Launcher to be a big weapon again...
---
PC
---
Bethesda.net ID: resident\_vamp
---
I completed the quest "Kill a Wendigo while wearing a clown costume" about a month ago. On completing the quest, I received XP and rewards. However, the game *still* lists it as an active quest. 
---
And here I am sitting on a hill with a cache chest and nothing else.
---
Awesome work!
---
When are you releasing a patch that will make this an actual Fallout game and not just a cash grab??
---
Only the PC servers were offline today
---
They also lowered the spawn rate of cores in power generators.
---
Yea except now you can find plenty of extremely positive FO4 posts in r/Fallout. I am not complaining, but it is very funny how things change over time. 
---
You're right about explosive affix having no falloff.  I can one-shot enemies from across the map with my shotgun because of it.
---
I bumped into an eyebot, and it lost its mind. Don't know why those guys even try to fight though, been 1 shotting them since FO3. Just float away, live to snoop another day.
---
They farm there for the xp and the 3 star legendaries, the common enemies (wrongly) only ever dropped 1 star legendaries anywho. This was not a feature, it was a bug.
---
Bethesda isn't punishing you, it's fixing the game everyone keeps saying is so broken
---
I get what you’re saying, but isn’t this kinda complaining about something after it’s already done and done? What’s the end goal here?
---
Make a mule character to store everything
---
They're not going to push out a hotfix just to make Bobby Pins more lightweight. Hotfixes are for *urgent* problems, like nukes breaking. 
---
Exactly! I was gonna use a lever action for my sniper because hunting rifles couldn't be dropped as legendary but now I can finally be able to obtain a legendary hunting rifle. The hunter/sniper in my heart is having a happy heart attack with this change lol
---
And the goalposts have moved again then. Quality of games decreases by a further 5%.
---
I would love a legend syringer. The endanderol is pretty legendary but no one seems to carry one but players who know.
---
*Spoiler*
---
I think the other vaults are dead mate. You read about this in the lore as you go on, so Idk how much sense that would make. 
---
and they say there are no NPC's.... but this cat had an "official name" and was the first I saw in the game. There are a couple more black ones roaming near the woods outside the mothman museum area.
---
Stupid is as stupid does.
---
I have a quad double barrel shot gun and I hope they don't change that.  It fires insanely fast too so those 8 round go quick 
---
Sad to see no fix for the Gatling Gun sights, the gun is still unusable unless in third person.
---
Sure made the quad lever action nice. Got 20 rounds by reloading 5. 
---
Camp items including my adhesive farm, once duplicated and scrapped = starch.
---
As said in other comments, super mutants lose all primary and secondary sexual traits (yes, genitals included) and are now... I guess non-binary? Agendered? I’m not sure on terminology these days. Anyway, they’re neither male nor female, are sterile, and have no forms of reproduction beyond forcing FEV mutations on humans. 
---
That said, many super mutants retain memory of their human lives and remember their original human gender, and live on that way despite the physical deformations. Basically, you could say “female” super mutants do exist, but in a mental capacity rather than physical. For instance, in New Vegas, Lily and Tabitha are clearly female, Marcus is clearly male, but the majority of others are never clarified. 
---
Or drop it in fissure site
---
I was shocked at first...but after I got used to it, I realized they are the next genetic leap forward.
---
Or this could happen to you by accident...Start by saving up 6000k of ammo you dont need for a friend while hes out of town for holidays and stuff for three weeks. Then do this...
---
1. drop a single piece of ammo into a bag, check to make sure bag is created.
---
2. 'Hey man i have tons of ammo for you come grab it'
---
3. microseconds before you drop all 6k ammo into bag, he picks up the 1 ammo
---
4. 'what is this a joke?' I look down, no bag, no ammo. cool game.
---
Are you thick?
---
Im sure there will be plenty of Troubleshooter's Hunting Rifles.  
---
Hes not confused hes connected to an invisible tether. 
---
Hey man, 50 bobby pins shouldn't weigh as much as my fully modded and loaded pistol.
---
Well I put the bar downstairs hoping that was enough...
---
Im on xbox. I sell flux 10 caps a piece. Ultra-cite is super easy to get though and i always have to much. I usually will make a huge deal on it when someone asks. 
---
Oddly....I still have one of those in my inventory after having completed that quest.
---
*shrug*
---
Okay, I will survive I guess. Thanks for your feedback!
---
Now you can get back to your cave.
---
haha awesome
---
YES. BOBBY PINS WEIGHT REDUCED AND HARDENED MASS NO LONGER SCRAPS WHEN SCARP ALL!!!!!
---
Weapon disappeared out of my hands, basically standing still.  Was not "special", duped, traded, etc.
---
Also just now I had a HARD freeze in the game that required a reboot to exit.  Before this hard freeze bug was only upon exiting the game.
---
East coast like DC/Boston/WV.
---
West Coast being the California region and such. Yeah, the ones that originate from Mariposa. Maybe the Master tinkered with the FEV to make sure female ones could exist.
---
Or another way is "By the actual Fallout creators" -&gt; female Super Mutants exists. "By Bethesda" -&gt; Only ungendered Super Mutants exist.
---
Finally got it. 900 caps :)
---
Once more, you make no sense, and just want to bash without real statement. If you want to troll go elsewhere. Your attitude is not needed.
---
It's ok mommy will tuck you in at night, you'll feel better baby boy
---
As long as they have that audio settings allowing them to receive voice chat. I've walked right up to people with bounties in the past and asked them if they wanted me to kill them to clear it, and they've just ignored me until I used the emote wheel to say: PVP, YES, NO, QUESTIONMARKS. 
---
My main issue with depositing my junk is that my stash is full atm, lol. I can't get rid of my crap. The hardest part is letting go. 
---
But, I see what you mean. I honestly didnt think too hard about it, I just thought the event sucked and thought a way to make it more fun(admittedly, more fun for myself). I'm just not seeing all the allure of killing dudes for their junk. The only 2 junk items i cant reliably find exploring are ballistic fiber and black titianium, and even then... 
---
No big deal, Ive had bad ideas before. Now I have at least one other point of view.
---
But, I still would like to see more pvp events added to the game. When the TDM rumour were going around, I thought it could be fun to add a TDM arena, separate from the lore, just for fun and with special rewards. 
---
That many bugs shouldnt even be there in a game developed by a AAA studio. You cant say they never experienced at least ONE of these bugs while testing the game. 
---
Can confirm its  Wonderful tactic
---
If they cross breed the flying deathbat with the deathclaw....we're really fucked.
---
They just add them to your account at least they did with me, open the bethesda app and click all games icon &gt;&gt; you can download them there
---
i thought it was just for repairing?
---
when. can. we. showcase. our. power. armor. in. our. camps.
---
Yep I'm definitely going down the white Knight route, can't believe I'm lvl 68 and didn't know it exists 
---
"The Fallout 76 game client and servers have received additional stability improvements".
---
I crushed LITERALLY 10 seconds after I first logged in after the patch today. This game will never be stable.
---
I feel like "core" part of the game is an exaggeration and to longtime fans of fallout who want a similar experience with 76 despite it being multiplayer it seems like a fair request
---
Didn't read the notes?
---
forget fallout 76, who the fuck uses imgur as anything other than an image hosting site for other, more important websites?
---
Its caused by: A willing suspension of belief for the purpose of the narrative. 
---
Not on this one, but new content should be out this month.
---
&gt; Ad Victorium
---
It's Ad Victori**a**m you filthy synth
---
No mention of fixing the Berserker perk working with Class Freak and Mutations, can anyone confirm?
---
No increase to stash size? Guess I'll continue to not play. Thanks for the free time, Bethesda.
---
How hard is it to ban anyone that has 20+ of the same legendary item?, Or 5000+ in carry? 
---
It's more of a problem with how they mangled a SP engine to be MP. They can fix it, but at this pace I'm not optimistic about how long it's gonna take to iron out the multitudinous wrinkles.
---
So they should leave them available, but do daily sales to get people to check every day.
---
But farming here is basically the end game content tbh. I don't have the patient to nuke prime in order to farm the queen and got disconnected before I try to loot something not dropped hundreds times.
---
I have 17 red arch.
---
If that's true, it's not bug fixing, its self cutting content. Or punishment for the players.
---
Maybe I've played too much, it's my fault
---
I spent about 50 caps to fast travel to the overseer's camp and just moved my camp just past there
---
Sad you can't drop or dupe them, I'd give you every cap I have for 5 of them lol
---
That's awesome 
---
&gt; Nobody wanted PvP
---
I did
---
Aight.
---
It would be nice if there was actually some type of company memo addressing the issue and what has, is or will be done to correct the issue.
---
It is not out of the ballpark to expect some sort of official communication from a company in regards to issues like this.
---
Either they really do not care.
---
Or they are completely incapable of identifying people who have done this. In which case this shows an astonishing lack of planning for a multiplayer online game.
---
When experienced programmers also enjoy playing videos games, they tend to have an idea of places to poke  / prod and look for bad code.  Also you have programmers that don't actively look for it, but they notice a bad timing / bad behavior and so they have to break it apart of play with it to see just how far it goes.   
---
I'm an okay programmer... not as uber skilled as some, and I notice weak points all the time.  Unfortunately, I can crash a session any time I want to.  I've tried reporting it to Bethesda multiple ways and to date I have seen zero progress in them fixing it.  Because their patch notes leave out so much information, I am yet again hoping that this patch fixes this bug because the more people that realize it is there, the more it is going to happen.  The fewer people that realize that this bug I'm not explaining out loud is there, the more server crashes are going to happen, too.... because people can be doing it without realizing the impact of what they are doing.  I literally did something and wondered to myself, "Did I do that?".  So I did it one more time.  Damn it.  Sure enough, I caused it and the realization made me sad because it didn't just disconnect me.  It disconnected everyone on that session.  :(  The whole session / game world crashed for everyone in that shared session. 
---
it was a group of 4 or 5 and then some random challengers at the golf resort, I kept telling them it wasn't worth it for how little they would get...
---
one guy did something smart though, he intentionally hit a nearby base with one shot so that he could attack me and only risk losing 5 caps
---
Possibly, like 1%.  99% chance he just encountered a bored asshole.
---
Yeah same here but I have the Patriot paint job on my T-60 and nothing on my excavator so it's easy to tell apart for now. 
---
LOL. Good point.  I forgot that's how we got them to land in Skyrim.  I guess we need to find the Dovahkiin perk card.....
---
Ya between my buddy and myself 1 hour of game play we crashed 5 times after today's patch. 
---
Damn well that would be evil from you.Harrassing the poor new guy like that.
---
Also , anyone selling Ghoul Slayer's Gamma Guns and gamma rounds??Asking for a friend.
---
They are all the same.
---
Lead, I eat lead. About 300.
---
I tried making an energy gun build, but it seemed like the only viable energy weapons were the Gauss Rifle and the Tesla Gun. But the Gauss Rifle had an issue where it didn't benefit from rifle perks (apparently fixed in todays update) and is also pretty slow due to the charging mechanic, and the Tesla Gun only does slightly better damage than a standard laser rifle (Unless you put a charging barrel on it, but then it's just a worse gauss rifle, and if you're playing on consoles it has a chance to crash your game after a few uses)
---
This community is amazing. Happy you've encountered some of it already. Feel free to add me on xb1, I'd love to help out or just randomly run around. GT: SonicRun83
---
Is there a purpose to crafting weapons and armor in the late-game, or is it mostly a leveling thing?  
---
Since legendaries cannot be crafted, it seems rather redundant.
---
If you farm WS for a while you’ll eventually find a server with them. I’m 135 and I see them once every 5-7 servers or so.
---
They be hard to find but yes, and they are muy delicioso.
---
This is how Bethesda nerf the melee build players. Genius!
---
Gary!
---
And this would be absolutely perfect if it still Fed the People!
---
&gt;No light  
---
&gt;New normal light  
---
&gt;Bright mod
---
PSHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM
---
Cool ty
---
"Do I look like I have time for idle chit chat??"
---
then just win the fight lol
---
ALL complaints regarding FO76 are invalid? Well then that means this complaint of yours is invalid too!
---
You can’t Wheatley out of this one.
---
Dont forget Legenday pipe revolvers
---
Thank you for these fixes! Definitely some good ones in here. Reduced bobby pin weight and legendary hunting rifle drops have me so excited for next week!
---
What do you mean I can't solo the boss I solo the boss all the time granted all these weird named npc's are around assisting me but I'm still soloing it lol
---
how are they free? from what I can see it's a minimum of $7.00 per game. Not trying to calling you out, I would love to get the original games for free!
---
Why would you buy a game you didn't want to play?
---
Learned the hard way. 2 bastards in x-01 fucked me up after Feed The People in my early days. Used super sledges. Damn near killed me.
---
Yeah once you get the hang of it, other people will think you have ESP or something when it comes to the lockpick mini game.
---
When I do a level 3 lockpick I tap W with the bobby pin in the middle, and when there is resistance, I move 45 degrees left, and tap W a few degrees left and right from there.  If it’s full resistance I then move halfway to the RHS and try again.
---
If I mess up badly I’d lose 1 or 2 bobby pins at most; the high level locks really only punish you for being heavy-handed, nothing more.
---
Now I just need a bug fix for the invisible grenades taking up all my inventory space
---
So, does this mean the next week will be hell as the dupers get in last gasps (and bring servers down willy-nilly in the process)?
---
I truly hope there's something in the works to deal with the existing dupers (and the duped materials). I agree that it doesn't need to be part of patch information (it's more a "police action"), but cleaning up the existing mess seems a necessary step. Only patching the hole seems like fixing fences after the cows have left.
---
End of this month i believe 
---
It took them 2 months to fix the lever rifle [animation.Do](https://animation.Do) you  really think they care enough to ban cheaters?
---
&gt;lay
---
Yeah duping obviously wasn't the cause of server instability.
---
I'm always amazed with these updates how many problems I didn't even know were problems.
---
I always thought the grenade launcher on my explosive build was so lame with damage.
---
On console, I have just the one large purifier taking up 1% of the budget, so not a big deal but still annoys me. Excited to see it leave next week. 
---
I think that killing the scorched minions is the mechanic to make them drop down or at least to start a timer or to open a window for them to come down. 
---
I have also fought many in Cranberry bog without their minions and those do stay up in the air. But the one thing that always makes them drop is "claiming" or attacking and running out of the area. They lose aggro and respawn their minions. Kill the minions and they come down. 
---
I apologize for coming across as hostile, but I have been bombarded with people just claiming that everything to do with them is a glitch or I'm using an exploit to get them to come down that no one else can confirm. Many people said this worked and thanked me in chat. I'm just trying to help people be able to have an easier experience without going crazy with these things.
---
ya know, it's free to fast travel to vault 76 and it's like a 2 minute walk to the overseer's camp from there...
---
So when they patch a dupe glitch it's unfair to everyone who didn't get to dupe? 
---
When they patch the infinite xp grenade glitch it was unfair to those who didn't use it? 
---
All of the legendary enemies are still there, which is why people farmed there. It has the highest density of legendary enemies besides farming uranium fever, but uranium fever only gives level 35/40 items
---
Except there's only an infinitesimal chance of finding two three star weapons that stack and are not duplicated.  They would need to have the same legendary affixes, mods, condition, base damage, etc.
---
No, i play the game and ignore the bs from fanboys and haters alike. I used to give a shit a month ago. It was pointless. People will always believe what they want. Do you, ignore the rest, its noise. 
---
Thick or Thicc lol 🤣
---
SPRINGS. OH GOD THE SPRINGS
---
They stated they fixed an FOV issue, maybe it wasn't zooming as much as they intended?
---
Got you for karma. GT CHOWTIME247 
---
I can.
---
"Early Warnings" quest still broken. Still stuck at the 'Find the Missing Uplink' step even after I already found and repaired the uplinks. \*sigh\*
---
Repairs a’plenty
---
Word for the wise, the watoga cars are your best friend for dealing with the bots at low levels. Often will fully cripple assaultrons :) 
---
It makes stims and meds less effective . It kicks in when out of combat.  I personally got all the mutations minus vegetarian i tried it but carnivore was way better for me lol . 
---
Could you drop it on Watoga? I wonder how it would affect the robots there.
---
or pipe revolvers :(
---
What happens if you nuke watoga 
---
springs! cant get enough...lead too, but its much easier to find...most robots drop lead.
---
Just call me &gt;!Danse!&lt;.
---
What does it matter?
---
I like the Bog, all those trenches for my Stealthy Sniper character to hide and snipe from, but I hate the Mire, it's too dark, and every time I shoot something, or turn on my light, a SB spots me, the place is infested with those ammo eating, crap dropping things.
---
Does OP really think it's progressive to like a game that is far less advanced in almost every aspect except graphics than a several years old predecessor?
---
I tried to farm a decent 3 star legendary this week. All i got was the ghoul slayers gamma gun with 25% rate of fire and 50% limb damage...
---
Honestly it just means the best time to level all your toons is no before they make level a grind. 
---
Leveling was fun in previous fallouts where it would jsut happen, but in order to protect the cash cow they are going to nerf the game into a long haul grind. 
---
PSA: get your level 10s to white springs this weekend and hit 20 in an afternoon. 
---
There is no way to tell if an item is duped. If he has a bunch of the same item, it probably is but there is no way to tell 
---
what are the stats? usually dupers wont bother unless it's god roll
---
sure but im saying i would like them to focus on good PA than to spend resources on beginner PA that most people only use for a short time
---
Can’t I still get in trouble for buying it?
---
I’m thinking the logo is of the Garrahan mining co. 
---
Maybe it was all done on a condensed server. All on the same WiFi, if any, instead of adding in a lot of different variables like other internet delay, good and bad internet, and 1,000 more. Most things are discovered by players than testers.
---
That’s your telling sign. He’s a level 7 - if he has many overpowered weapons, they’re likely duped items and he’s on an alt character. 
---
This NOT greifing. This is PvP baiting. 
---
People can be clever. Remember that when you are trying to kill them and take their caps. 
---
Harper's Ferry, the W. V. Lumber company, the big maw, mount Blair, west tek, the top of the world and thunder mountain.
---
0.1 lb is one tenth of a pound. 10 bobby pins do not weigh a pound in real life.
---
Careful you’ll get wendigo mouth 
---
Yeah totally 
---
EXTREME CLOSE UP!
---
Welp, I might need it that one day...
---
"RRRBLAHHHHHHH!!!!"

---
As much as I would like PVP to be a core part of the game. It is decidedly not a core feature currently. It's barely a feature at all.
---
The current implementation of PvP is confused at best. I'm really not sure what the devs envisioned pvp to be like given how it work and what you get from it.
---
Again as I stated below, they've already banned people for other reasons. So yes I think they care enough. 
---
Aw
---
yeah but I was dodging missiles and trying to save my camp at the time
---
" **Repairing:** Component quantities required to repair mid to high level armor and weapons have been reduced up to 20%. **DevNote:** Repair costs scale with level, and there's room to reduce costs at higher levels. "
---
Bethesda, what are you thinking?    20% reduction is a joke.  It is simple:  It should NOT take MORE materials to repair an item than to make it brand new.   It takes vastly more items to repair something than it does to craft a brand new one.  ALSO, Something that is at 90% full condition shouldn't take as many materials to fix as something that is broken.    It sure doesn't have to be linear if you want to reward people who repair less often as being more efficient, but please give us a break when we want to repair something that is somewhere in between.
---
Ideally:  Initial crafting costs should be increased, repair costs should be decreased across the board.  Repair costs should be lessened based on the condition of the item and then rounded up OR if it is above 25% condition, maybe it costs an extra material here and there to repair than it would have otherwise.   Then perks can take effect on top of that.   Why do I get a huge list of materials when I want to repair something, but when I craft it, it's just a few things?    That is so silly.
---
I think you're the first one with that indoor pool that I've seen here.. gotta say that looks dope :D
---
To be fair, it does take a 200 IQ to appreciate the sound of Wallace's *soothing voice.*
---
Thank you for the quick reply
---
that's true, I haven't committed to the perk for t-3 yet
---
90% every one I have isn't and I'm sure there's alot more people out there like me. 
---
You are right, maybe even 99.5
---
Well....they could be removed if bethesda made two shot and explosive mutually exclusive of each other and items that didn't follow this were auto deleted on login.  Sure some people that got them legitimately would be punished, but it would fix the problem.  Sometimes ya gotta cut away healthy tissue to remove a tumor.
---
Why would you take my comment seriously?
---
Is this just for PC? I’m on Xbox and I’ve been playing since the B.E.T.A.
---
This really helps alleviate my fears there's some super awesome set coming - knowing what is available.
---
Several tons of super mutants.
---
But it’s not tse all though he has a few tse gatlings
---
&gt; Especially in a game like this where different stats have a huge effect on power levels
---
Except stats don't mean shit in 'PvP' you just get one shot regardless of how much End or DR you may have.
---
That's a made up statistic... 
---
I found three in a run right now for PS4. They are all left legs. 
---
Lvl. 45 unyielding robot left leg
---
Lvl. 50 unyielding robot left leg
---
Lvl. 50 unyielding, +1 INT leather left leg (I’m keeping this one) 
---
Are you telling people how to get it?
---
Torgue would be proud would he not?
---
What did y'all expect, they were blow-ted after all.
---
I've never really liked NPCs, they just get in the way
---
I cant speak for playstation because I play 76 on xbox but on the bethesda forums like 8/10 posts about bugs or glitches come from PC users and half of them are stuff I havent even seen or heard of happening on console
---
Thank you for this, I will try it.  
---
Hopefully the quest can still be fixed for others though.
---
Paint in game either dont exist yet or are very, VERY rare. Most of the ones you see have to be bought on the Atom shop for Atoms (Digital Currency). You can earn Atoms in game from completing challenges or from spending real money to buy them. Most paints apply to T-45, T-51, T-60 and X-01 power armors but currently there is no paints for the Excavator, Ultracite, or Raider Power Armor.
---
Someone had built a camp nearby, you get a popup every time. 
---
If you join a server and your camp isn't there, someone else has a border touching your camp area. Next time you login to a server without anyone there, it will place automatically.
---
If you're at whitesprings or something, I'd just recommend moving somewhere else
---
I tried both using the Terminal and picking up the Mission 099-01 Orders (normally the second step of the Daily) and neither one trigger the daily. :(
---
If your camp gets moved find a new server and it will auto place trouble free. It's the best work around ive found so far.
---
I guess the price just went up on exploding radium rifles
---
That's not always the case... 
---
It’s baiting and griefing. A base was still destroyed. Even just for shits and giggles.
---
just switch servers, i think it should fix it. 
---
Okay. So my TSE gauss rifle is duped right? 
---
I bought it on PS4 last year when it came out and when I open the Bethesda launcher it tries to charge me for each of the games. How is it supposed to know I've already got the game, when it doesn't have access to my Playstation account?
---
Of course! Terrible normally but might be a good experience to use it for a while
---
There is absolutely nobody near me, i checked...
---
There's no conspiracy, they are just individually incompetent.
---
A few good things, but wow a whole lot of useful and shitty nerfs, along with again, no content added. 
---
these updates coming out at diffrent time is very annoying 
---
Your right it’s probably higher
---
They clearly envisioned it to be always-on so requests to remove it merit the same response as the early reviews which criticised the content of the game. 'Go and play something else because it was clearly stated before release that this was how it would be'.
---
Relog
---
The person built there probably logged off.
---
I bet your built in a high traffic area
---
I dont think its glitched, it takes 5 total perks to get it set up. So it's not super cheap to do. The class freak perk looks at each mutation separately, rather than looking at all negative effects then takes the multiple of 75%. I'm sure in hind sight, it's not how beth wanted mutations to work, but a mutation build is completely viable with few issues. 
---
It would open the trade menu before the other player accepted, but you couldn't see their inventory 
---
Quad .44? Nah. Quad single action revolver? Perfection.
---
I'm going to be the stick in the mud and say they all suck balls. Because they do. Prices on this junk needs to come down, it's largely just lazy low effort crap and the paints/styles are worth maybe $5 at best when you look at other titles selling aesthetics. 
---
That's the Flatwoods Monster
---
How about the vendors with level locked items?
---
I briefly used a quad pump action shotgun but man, that thing took so long to reload. At least you could interrupt the loading animation to fire again at any point.
---
sorry forgot to mention i am on PC
---
get the fusion core perk...slows down the drain...you'll only need two or three, and then you'll just find them...
---
They are way to heavy for storing a bunch.
---
FUCK me! I scraped mine because i needed the space... im sad now :(
---
I've thought about nuking somewhere in ash heap and toxic valley. If it's worth it I'll let peeps know
---
It lights up like a christmastree on steroids
---
I’ve tried that, but eventually I have to leave servers. Thanks though. 
---
No i'm on the top of the map, I never seen any camp at or near my spot. 
---
Had a nice run of this about 3 times (different hops) in between my x01 armor mod vendor checking.
---
Picked up maybe a dozen legendaries.  Mostly all 1 star crap tho.
---
I see they're nerfing the xp tho, so console guys we'll have a few more days to enjoy it before its patched out.
---
Those are rookie numbers! You gotta bump those numbers up!!! (I'm sitting on a fat stack of 56 atm) :) 
---
He could have been there when you logged onto the server and left the server before you looked around. 
---
If someone in your spot leaves, it won't place your camp. As the popup says, if you want your camp there, just server hop.
---
If you're at a high traffic area, expect this to happen a lot
---
I'm pissed I missed the flames. It looked a little naff in the shop so I didn't buy it, and I met someone rocking it last night in a Queen battle. Damn it looked good on the X01.
---
I didn't buy the stand because I use the compact one in my base. 
---
Yup. I love my 2-Shot Gatling Plasma, but even with rank 3 Luck of the Draw, I'm lucky if I can get through 2-3 cores before it breaking.
---
You have probably killed a few. Much like dwarves they look a lot like their male counter parts. 
---
 Go back to fort defiance and see if you can access the computer outside by the front door. 
---
After I followed the quest line and got my ID I checked that computer on my way back and it gave me the brotherhood recon rifle plans, but my ID vanished. I didn't notice at the time and went upstairs to find I still couldn't enter the upper floor. Reloading worked for me. 
---
Just got the brick plan do I'm hunting concrete, and have 295 caps. 
---
Darn, I thought it was for everyone! 😂
---
Your artwork is excellent. Thank you for sharing. 
---
Explosive 2 shot pump sg here! Ill never get rid of it! 
---
Horde events...drawn out over distances but worth it!
---
it's almost as dumb as people who are obsessed with them and post about them nonstop
---
Yeah, I guess that is more of a PC term. Only things I play on PC right now are the old Unreal Tournaments lol
---
Do a powering poseidon/thunder mountain event to earn different and larger capacity power generator plans to save space. Fusion generator gives 100 power and doesn't look half bad either.
---
it's actually the Flatwoods Monster and pretty common and super annoying .. as bad as the Mothman with their spamming .. shows up randomly all over the map. I have enchanted it at least twice and died at least twice, I finally killed it the other day, but it wasn't easy for me as it keeps moving and disappearing ...
---
[http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Flatwoods\_monster](http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/Flatwoods_monster)
---
Im looking as well 
---
PSN StarsTheAgonizer
---
Serverhop til you see players on claimed workshops. Kill them
---
Figure out where frequent player CAMP  locations are. Look for players not moving in those "good spots". Pay them a visit at home.
---
Get a little bounty then play normally. 
---
Tell people in voice chat why Trump is the best.
---
Maybe you’re the special snowflake.
---
Regardless of secondary or not, do you think the OP is looking in their pants or at secondary sexual characteristics and/or gender behaviors? :P
---
I don't, but I'm sure a quick Google will solve the question. There's the old Fallout Bible if you want to go way back to intelligent deathclaw and such. Super Mutants are sterile, can't reproduce (so clearly they're missing bits), and most aren't intelligent enough to identify as anything. I guess you could grope one to see if they're an "innie or outtie" but it's pointless.
---
Lilly and Marcus are special.
---
Also, wooden blocks.
---
Ah! Knew it was something woods, thank you.
---
First time I've seen or heard about it in 157 hours! 
---
Agreed. Even with rank 3 of Luck of the Draw, I can barely get through 2-3 cores without them breaking.
---
You can upgrade it to level 50 which matches the other PA. It is far from a beginner outfit. It's level 25 in the basic configuration, same at T45. 
---
It happen when i'm already on a game, not when i join a server
---
I recently had a 440 bounty from leveling someone's Whitespring clubhouse camp, and I could only find a lv10 player who took a hundred years to slap me to death with his machete.
---
He was very grateful for the payout.
---
Yea yea they already said it, stand in the queue for your upvote.
---
In the mire?
---
The spot i see ppl on all the time?
---
Or the one in toxic valley that i see ppl on all the time too?
---
You're not wrong about the TSE weapons, but the point still stands if/when they get nerfed for pvp.
---
great, it was definatly all those bobby pins wieghing me down &gt;&lt;
---
If you are on a console you also qualify - but the games are OC only, you can’t play them on the console.
---
Yup this is what I usually do, quicker than trading too.
---
Probably just PS4, im on xbox and there are tons of adult players on there.
---
It sucks because now there is NO way to farm experience and the ONLY way to *sort of* respec is this asinine level up system. 
---
Fuck Bethesda makes such shit decisions...over and over and over 
---
Thanks for another patch. All of the changes besides another nerf to experience gain are very good.
---
What I'd really like to see in immediate future:
---
* fix for Laser/Plasma Heavy Weapon durability, ammo use and general damage output
---
* Stabilized Perk actually working with these Laser/Plasma Heavy Weapons - *currently armor reduction does nothing to energy resistance*
---
* Heavy Weapon and Amunition Weight being reduced - *carrying 3-4 of these weapons  to have a back up since they break so often means I'm carrying 120+ extra*
---
* Changes to how experience gain and loot rules work while playing in a group - *group mates have to compete for XP and loot on corpses often doesn't load when many people are around*
---
Please, keep working on the game!
---
Bethesda devs?
---
You sure? I have never had a issue placing my 1x1 anywhere, it pretty versatile .. I have only recently decided to finally move from my 1x1 and build a normal house, so far I have ran it the message about someone been in my spot and everytime it was able to put it back so far.
---
Where is your camp at ?
---
you haven't lived until you've made love to a deathclaw.  
---
Sorry I'll have to back done to area and have a look and take a map shot and upload it.
---
I only took 2 pictures and a little vidoe of deciding which wire to cut and it exploding.
---
I'll try and find it again tonight as I'll be going on soon 
---
Thanks for the note - unfortunately I tried that and it didn't work.
---
1. Enter frame
---
2. Remove excavator
---
3. Exit frame
---
4. trade to frame and put back on excavator
---
5. Enter frame
---
still not boosted weight
---
I havent even done the quest, where do I start it?
---
I have the nuka cola plans already, a kind should gave them to be but I didnt know there was a quest to start it
---
Great more Park Ranger outfits that I must own...
---
Pins, not Roode.
---
But, yes, still fantastic.
---
I used a mod in 4 that fixed this. And also one for the Lever Action reload, so fingers crossed if they fixed one...
---
Looks more like a "Toy" theme to me with the painted on screws.
---
Okey. I've had 5 and every one was earned. I'm sure there's alot more out there. 
---
Ok thank I'll have a check tonight when I log in 
---
Hahaha no. I dont watch youtube. You think people actually find that many 2shot explosive and god roll melees. You obviously must not be in any of the trading markets
---
Combat shotgun + enforcer rank 3. It's hilarious. 
---
Come see me when you’re ready for nukes

Ad Victoriam
---
They are beasts. I tried to fight one with my melee build and while a lvl 50 Scorchbeast currently needs around 12 hits from me (still not in my final form) and not seriously damaging me the lvl 50 mirelurk queen has lost like 1 pixel of health per punch and with one hit on me i lost almost half my life.
---
My Laser I can usually squeeze a fair amount of usage out of, Plasma is like 2 cores and done.
---
thanks for heads up. prolly not good idea to team up at SBQ even after today's patch
---
Nevermind, it works just equiping/unequiping in frame while in it. It seems for whatever reason, reloging in is doing double the bonus - probably a bug
---
I think BF is the rarest material for me; I'd have to go double check. But I'm closing on 400 screws but I think I have under 50 fiber. 
---
I can show you if you want,i know it sound crazy and you can think i lie, I understand that, but i swear it's true
---
Top of the map on the cliff, the only time i have see a CAMP near me it was at more than 100 meters
---
Someone on this sub r/FO76 was giving me crap for having posted on /r/Fallout, so maybe someone on that sub saw you post here and simply downvoted you because "you're *from* r/FO76".
---
People can be petty.
---
Okay but that 1% is the lucky ones like you in my 200+ hours of play I haven’t found a single TSE
---
I had one thought when I saw your indoor pool. And that was youd give Samuel L Jackson some ptsd flashbacks. 
---
Since I'm a disabled, recently single dude I have probably dropped at least 12 hours a day since the start. I have a level 74, 52, and 20 on xbox and a level 30 on ps4.... I dont know how much that adds up to but there ya go.
---
I've given up on my excavator armor. I'm just rocking around in my blackbird motion assisted dual calibrated shocks t60. 
---
Carrys the same as my excavator but looks waaay cooler.
---
That is until I find the excavator calibrated shocks....
---
Hahaha SO NIAVE!
---
Anytime I really need lead I just put my excavator on and go to Charleston fire department 
---
Dammit! If I knew it laughed like that I’d have bought it.
---
And made a camp filled with them.
---
Exactly
---
He is nothing but nice, just as annoying as this  guy, shoots this rings of something at you, I always run away as it is so annoying .. just like the scorchbeast, you can't get near it and disappears when you do, you will see what I mean when you run into him.
---
I attended that event as well where he wss nice, must be his brother :)
---
Looks fine if you do helmet in patriotic instead of the default hotter rod
---
Makes me remember some one calling the SB attack 'Sonic Boom' now I want a Rocket Launcher that quotes Torgue when fired/reloaded, and SB to have huge blonde flat top hair cuts, for it to play the theme that goes with everything when fighting them, and them to shout 'Sonic Boom' when they use that screech....it'd be fuggin great.
---
God speed you magnificent bastards, god speed.
---
Same here
---
It’s more on your end, MOST LIKELY. I’ve been having connection issues with my WiFi in general, and have seen an increased amount of my controls being disabled.However, it could quite possibly be a completely unrelated issue stemming on your end though. 
---
They could at least do the the Raider Paints from Nuka World. Judging by the Tricentennial Paints though they would split each faction paint to individual items and split them again for each weapon.
---
I've started bulking and selling it.
---
Events in the Cranberry Bog, probably. Lots of pickups around those areas, too. And mothman drops it plus the wings scrap to it, I think.
---
theres a mod for total weight values. it also sorts aid and ammo better. worth looking into
---
As someone who spends more time capped out than not. Losing my level in caps isn't a huge problem. If losing 300 caps is a lot  to you it sounds like you need to start some trading lol
---
If it didn’t drop for you then i would say theres a very very high chance it is
---
I just verified this.
---
On log in 470 weight limit
---
Getting out of frame, 370 and/or swapping
---
No excavator armor in the 200's
---
It's a 90% damage reduction. Utilizing enough exploits to stack really high damage can still make "slap" damage dangerous.
---
They should have made passive mode disabled by default. The idea that you can only engage people in combat if you both agree to it goes against what fallout is completely. 
---
I hate to break it to you my friend but that is incorrect. Ultracite has the highest DR. X-01 has the highest energy resist. No power armor will help you specifically with melee but expect to take more damage closing the distance, ultracite is probably your best bet.
---
Yeah because nerfing the glowing one xp was such a high fucking priority. Gotta get you guys to grind harder on this shit game 
---
Oh no. Not just petty. r/Fallout hates anything that's not New Vegas. Sone guy posted photos from the Fallout cookbook that his wife got him, and got downvoted to oblivion. How do you explain degeneracy like this?
---
My bad, on battery...sorry Todd. :-)
---
No. Because those people are duping. I'm saying I have had 5 TSE lmg, radium, gauss rifle, shotgun, and 50cal. I have also had a 3* bloodied super sledge, a 3* bloodied assultron blade, 3* anti armor assultron blade... 
---
Thanks for the tips! Just wanted to see if the processor would behave as expected after the patch. I also wanted a few cores to commemorate that I had just fixed Thunder mount.
---
Fat man with leg perk that weighs 2lb.... nah your 20 lb rifle is okay 
---
Pretty much is. Just because they have one on person doesnt mean anything 
---
...Complaintsion
---
the BGS community rep posted in some thread recently she knows it's a real problem and will fix.  so I expect they'll get it in next patch, or at least I hope.
---
Sad it has existed this long (really sad), but at least she knows it's a real deal.
---
You can go point for point with 76 and previous games, but 76 will come up short. That doesn't mean it's a bad game.
---
Saying that it's a lie paints you as being blind to flaws and deaf to criticism.
---

Hey I need those for my quad-barrel bunker buster!
---
&gt; Super Mutants are sterile, can't reproduce (so clearly they're missing bits), and most aren't intelligent enough to identify as anything.
---
That's wrong. Fallout 1 says why they're sterile and it's a completely different reason.
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/ZAX.MSG
---
"Additionally, as the gametes of the reproductive system consist of 'half-cells' using split DNA, they could be perceived as 'damage' by FEV, which would 'repair' them, rendering the subject sterile."
---
FEV "fixes" the sperm/eggs of the Super Mutant which renders them sterile. Plus plenty of mutants are smart.
---
Also here's the thing I was referencing.
---
http://fallout.wikia.com/wiki/MASTER.MSG
---
" {133}{}{I happen to know that your mutants are sterile.}"
---
" {135}{Mast11}{Preposterous! The FEV-2 virus doesn't destroy the reproductive organs of those it mutates.}"
---
" {156}{}{Did you think to ask a female mutant?}"
---
"{162}{Mast25}{Reasonable. One moment. Are you sure? What about the other females? It cannot be. Be.}"
---
So again, West Coast Super Mutants are just sterile. East Coast ones are asexual.
---
That’s likely because of dupers duping all those shotguns, not the stash size. To dupe correctly, they have to cause server instability, which can crash it for everyone. Js 
---
people break bobby pins?
---
Pretty cool, pretty cool... but i always struggled with ballistic fiber and this just made that harder. Is there some secret i don't know? All the military places i check are picked clean of bags...

Check your internet ?

It's probably the game servers, but check bandwidth and latency like any other online game.
---
X6-88, prepare the Penetrating Plasma Rifle.
---
You got those all dropped?
---
What have I whined about? I’m just stating facts about two shot explosive weapons. If anything   people would call me a homer about this game.  You seem like a child  who thinks his duped toys are going to be taken away.  Congrats on your legit tse, nobody gives af.
---
Pulled from a straw poll I've seen 80% statistics made up. 
---
They asked $14 for this one? For $14 I expect better than "fine" especially if the recommendation is to use part of a paint from another $18 skin.
---
You fucking scrub, you sold me the wrong magazine!
---
Ok where is my 2SE, i planned to read something about boys life in the woods while sitting on the toilet, not some freak show about a Supermutant with 2 heads..
---
Hooray for Berry mentats!!
---
I looked forward to FO76 like crazy, multiplayer Fallout was all I ever wanted in the recent years. Played FO76 until I reached level 66 or 67, uninstalled it some days ago.
---
It's not the good game some of you guys try to make it look like. And it's not helpful that you defend it with every breath. Because we need to force Bethesda to make better games again, not to signalise them "hey, everything is okay".
---
A lot of bug fixes which is good. Some of them seem very vague and describe fixes to things which I never would have considered broken to begin with (Party Boy/Girl worked correctly for me, and is easily one of my favourite perks).  
---
However, dropping the XP that Glowing One’s give makes sense but does feel like a slap in the face. That was the only reason I participated in Nuke Zones. I’ve already got my Bloodied DCG, some decent Bolstering Armor and an Furious Explosive Minigun so...  
---
Guess there’s no reason to participate in nukes any more? At least until some bosses or reworks happen.
---
I didnt say it was hard, but it would make sense to be able to make it, what reason do you have to NOT have this in the game as an option?
---
My server just crashed after taking a few workshops. Of course. So I’ll try to join you. 
---
GT wonderpuddle25 
---
best part of the patch for me
---
It regens you to your available maximum.  What would that be 300% of?  I don’t see how 300% of max health makes any sense either.
---
Maybe it means three times as fast as food would heal you?
---
But the magic part is that it doesn’t require any food, so it is still literally infinitely better, and automatic.
---
I agree that it is indeed poorly worded.  Extremely.  :)
---
Yeah, met some guy in blackwater mine, and after what seemed like a pretty chill event we go outside and he says "*sigh* this game really fucking sucks doesn't it?"... hes a level 200 something mind you. If you hate it so much, why are you playing it!? 
---
I've dropped so many games after I stopped enjoying them and I never looked back, why play something that you don't enjoy and constantly bitch and rage? I can't wrap my head around that.
---
I never understood the appeal. Special stats besides Strength are hot garbage for the most part. Neat to increase but you're not going to notice a big difference. However Adrenal Reaction + Bloodied IS really amazing, damage can scale to double or triple at low health. I suppose if you're using those, then you could do worse, though I'd still rather have the one that increases DR/ER at low health instead.
---
So, did they fix the Bobble Head/Magazine stacking bug?  
---
Because even if duping is fixed, if they don't take those away from inventory, there is potential for a lot of griefing.
---
Thanks for pointing it out, I'll remove that one. I guess I got lucky with a bug for my fusion cores then.
---
Blackbird is the best anyway. That on an x01 with the red eyes is incredibly sleek an intimidating
---
they just need to steal the Void storage idea from world of Warcraft
---
They can dup on any platform, honestly i would expect it to be on pc more than console because not a lot of console gamers use youtube 
---
Is that an Inception joke? Cause if so I like it.
---
No, I believe you, I am just puzzled if it is a 1x1 why it wouldn't place, did you have any thing else on the ground around it that could be causing a issue ?
---
Are you trying to place the item on the stored tab or one from the blueprint tab ?
---
You should also be able to break down your blueprints in separate items so you don't lose any resources.
---
Also what I did, was make a blueprint of my house without any furniture when I did my 1x1, this save me so much work when I ran into wierd  resource or placement issues and required little resources since it was just mostly wood.
---
I am assuming it is too late as you probably moved your camp since your issue, but next time just server hop so you don't have to rebuild.
---
LMG is listed as MG42, I’ve seen it more frequently than most other weapon plans 
---
Overall a very good patch, lots of overdue bug and exploit fixes. Now let's wait for the exploiters to find a workaround to duping and glitch it ASAP. 
---
They mean fusion generators in the world...you can pull the cores out and use them.  They typically only have a half charge, though.
---
I still haven't seen the brown flight helmet.  I've been waiting since launch!
---
Yep that combo is great, I'll tank the glowing ones with it and can just stand there taking 0 damage since each hit heals me back up.
---
Why do you say that? It looks like a tennis court to me:
---
https://cdn.tenniscompanion.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/tennis-court-dimensions-and-layout.jpg
---
Yes but 29% of statistics are not made up
---
Ahah so original.
---
Agreed with the OP. I specifically never used Ultracite due to the fact that it doesn’t have any paint schemes.
---
One thing I still wish we could do is trade armor and weapons with Atom Shop paints to other players.
---
That said, I’m honestly not sure how people would react to that. On one hand, that would let us get copies of certain items without having to pay for it. On the other, you could argue that it would indirectly give players that are willing to pay money an unfair advantage in terms of trading.
---
I laughed my ass off seeing it in the store. Anything but X01 looks like a total mess
---
You can compare 76 to other games and point out things that are different. Calling them *shortcomings* is due to your own subjectivity. Calling them inferior is just plain rubbish. 
---
ammocrafting in general is really really bad you blow between 1 and 3k ammo per sbq kill...at least with duping you could have gotten cheap ammo 
---

Explosive Tesla Rifle doesn't get affected by Demolition Expert. Explosive energy weapons does not show bullets when shooting.
---
 Not gonna lie I was disappointed to see it wasn’t fixed in today’s patch.
---
*Those* are rookie numbers, I've got just shy of 150 on me right now. "Batteries Included" is a great perk.
---
The hell you say
---
&gt;and hopefully the unscrappable water purifier bug.
---
It's such a minor nuisance but I will be so very, very happy to see this go.
---
The vendor in Studio 58? (Or something close to that) in whitesprings can carry those plans IIRC. 
---
I think new vegas, honestly.
---
this game should have more meaningfull choices, npcs and story, not more things to kill / attack you. but that is only my opinion. 
---
Just wanted to clarify something in your post:
---
&gt;Enabling Pacifict mode makes it so that if you accidently hit a fellow player/his base with a few stray shots ***it doesn't suddenly flag you as "wanted"***
---
Damaging another player does not make you wanted, it just initiates two-way pvp if they reciprocate. You will only be wanted if you either kill them while they're in pacifist mode or attack some camp/workshop structure they own.
---
I have had 5. All of them were from drops. 
---
can someone test out melee weapons that do 50% reflect damage while blocking with this setup? does it do full damage or 50% of the mitigated damage?
---
Ok nice community, i just post a bullshit post just for the pleasure. I ask for help all the time on this sub, check my account, and today, for the pleasure, i post something fake just for the pleasure of getting downvote and insult. Make sense 
---
You’re a brave, brave vault dweller
---
Pro tip: If you can find x-01 teslas, you're golden. I was going to get a jetpack, but I have found that the teslas are far far too useful. The tesla DoT tags everything around you but only affects things that are hostile to you.
---
It was a drop. All of my weapons have been drops. The only thing I've bought on fo76 market were serums. 
---
If that bright headlamp didn't wake him up, nothing will.
---
I don’t believe that at all
---
two xbox accounts with 6 characters my self.
---
That's so funny. I wonder if I can do that to the jerks who use those weapons in Whitesprings.
---
Guass is meh. Sure damage might be better but with the charging up, the God awful ammo I rather stick to ole reliable. Plus I've never been one to use energy weapons. But if you use gauss all the power too you! 
---
Mine crashed within 20 minutes of logging in.
---
I have cabled ethernet (rather than wifi).
---
Speedtest shows robust fibre speeds and reasonable latency.
---
With so many people reporting this, I suspect this is growing pain for Bethesda.  This is not the ESO engine, and the beta was very limited.
---
No one said everything is ok. We actively keep screaming at Bethesda to fix ir change stuff. We actively call them out for all the things that are wrong. We lightly praise them for the things that we feel they got right.
---
What we do despise are the hoards of trolls who keep badmouthing people who enjoy the game. They keep saying things like "oh you like this shit gane you are fucking stupid". We dislike the trolls who keep writing under every Bethesda post "shut down this game and remake Fallout New Vegas!" That is the very definition of being against progress. These people are objectively toxic and tgey actively strice to ruin other people's enjoyment. 
---
And a shocking 13% of all statistics stole my bike.
---
My ultracite has over 600 from the brotherhood quests at 200%. Maybe yours is crafted with low int?
---
Lol, I never said I could tell the legendary effect, but you said “the same shotgun”. Which is already suspicious af. Then on another thread you talked about all the disconnects on a server like it wasn’t primarily caused by dupers. 
---
When did they say "we will give you new content 2 months after release" Hint:they didn't
---
I would of moved, I would of just quit the game App asap and loaded a new world, you always going to get douche bags who are bored, block, report and move on, that's all you can do. Don't give up your spot because of some dumb asses especially if you have already had some pleasant encounters.
---
Lol this is end game for us till they add more content 
---
So I'm naive &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; for having all of mine from actual drops? 
---
There's nothing to gain. If I knew it was so rare I would have clipped it. I was in pacifist mode in white spring so I wouldn't hit any players. Ghouls had all been cleared. Person kills me through slap damage and takes loot.
---
well if thats the case it should stop with this update right ? lol 
---
Why are you nurfing the bring for EXP? When there is no issues to begin with!
---
No the servers are still highly unstable.
---
You told me you werent even on the market
---
Dolly sods, Monongah overlook, middle mountain cabins
---
Message me then. Psn is piotr1896 we'll see if we can work something out. I've been enjoying my TSE lever gun more anyway 
---
&gt; Trade: We no longer let trades occur before the requested player has consented to trade.
---
Is that confirmation where was a trade exploit?
---
Fair enough. I’m running Starched Genes to keep marsupial but no class freak as of yet. But my luck is 12 so I’ve got a little more wiggle room for certain perks. 
---
The low hanging fruit are the horders... it MUST be possible to know when a player has more of something than they could ever reasonably get. A level 50 player with 1000 bobblehead? Duper. A level 100 with 25 TSE Weapons? Duper.
---
Hell - just spanking anybody with more than, say, 100 of any "rare" item would probably handle the bulk of the problem.
---
I play on Xbox with the same name as here, i have a 2nd xbox account i just started up for my trader/crafter so i can actually make the stuff my mains need. 
---
Its possible their internet connection may be an issue but multiple users are reporting the same level of instability as before the patch.
---
&gt; At least the Munitions Depot wars are mostly over
---
lol I remember being called a toxic loser once for attacking the factory and taking it from someone. I don't make the rules, the devs do, and the devs say workshops being taken by force is a feature not a bug.
---
No, I'm calling bullshit on your camp being there while in a server then you getting a message that it's been removed...
---
You joke, but ive seen Vault Dweller on deathclaw porn.
---
That too! God that 5 bullet reload for 1 bullet used was God awful
---
It's rumoured because unless they were exploiting some glitch or the player was already almost dead it didn't happen.
---
No problem. Once I got the recipe I was only able to make two serums. I've played for over 200 hours ans only had 7 coal. So I hunted for all the coal nodes and picked the one I liked the location of best. Built a sick as camp and threw a harvester on it. Now I have all the precious coal I need. 
---
Ya, 3 servers have DC'ed in the last 30 minutes. Now we're on a server where the ghouls don't stand up, they are stuck laying on their bellies trying to swipe at us.
---
"Fixed: The lever action rifle now reloads the correct amount of ammunition"
---
Holy shit you guys, we complained enough and they finally fixed it!! After what, literal years?
---
(Im not complaining BGS, thank you!!)
---
I've been surviving on 5 fusion cores and using this exploit as a way to keep my weight down. Oh well.

---
The sad part is that they brought in the two lead developers from Star Wars Galaxies to helm the project. I'd be interested to see what kind of internal conflict they ran into trying to put the online together.
---
Yeah the stealth Assaultron in the nuke silo almost got me last night too, survived it with about 10% health. It’s not a bug that the enemy is invisible or can chase you all over the bunker. The crash was obviously the root of your issue, but I am surprised you crashed within an instanced dungeon, normally if I crash it’s outside of the dungeon in a nuke area.
---
Ok what the fucking point of lying on this ? Please explain to me
---
Okay.. I mean they were but I guess that's up to you to believe. Want to point out I've put in 150hours and have done maybe 3 actual missions. I just explore and kill stuff. 
---
Same here! Started a new character focusing on stealth. It's a lot of fun. Sad that pistols are not really viable at the moment. But there are quite a few perk cards for it.
---
Springs for PA repair and Wood (surprisingly) for my melee repairs and camp building and meat cooking.
---
All my issues were fixed by this! The only thing I wish we had was inter-character storage instead of having to nag our buddies to hold our things for us
---
Underrated comment.
---
That's the only trade-off that had me using a .50 receiver for a while, 180 rounds a pop crafting .50 ammo with perks, vs. 21 rounds a pop of .308. It cost me a minor amount in the stats dept., but ammo for .50 is easy. 
---
It might be my imagination, but I swear that the lever-action rifle reloads a wee bit quicker. I like it.
---
Daaam thats why my weight went from 672 to 310
---
Why would they?
---
Jesus man I want to love this game so much but this kind of thing is just... fucked. 
---
"One of us!!!!"
---
xbox. But when you do test it please let me know. If so i get that perk ASAP lol
---
Oh 100%, already got all the mods for it, just need an instigating/two-shot with 10% damage while aiming/explosive and maybe some reduced weight to top it off, gonna be hunting that for months
---
I still have to finish the i am become death quest, and I've already killed the queen a few times so i was looking for an interesting place to launch my first nuke.
---
Not for guns. Because they are duped 90% of the time.. 
---
Yeah its a bit unlikely that every user on PC who is using the new patch is experiencing internet configuration problems and a lot more likely the servers are still unstable.
---
Adhesive, screws, ballistic fiber. I'm doing pretty well on the first two myself.   
---
I float around 3,000 caps at all times - I tend to spend a bit before I get any higher, but rarely have any less.
---
You know some recon based binoculars would actually be great for scouting. I love my Binos as they are but that would be useful. 
---
It was a glitch that anyone in a Nuke zone could repeat, you could make yourself completely unkillable. It was curable yourself, despite what the person claimed.
---
It was patched some time ago thankfully.
---
already moved and had to use most of my scrap to repair everything
---
Plastic
---
7k
---
FYI the Power armor skin is visible in the chrome paint for the minigun.
---
What console do you play it on? I'm on XBOX, here is my gametag: (TedMaester) if you ever wanna team up.
---
Yea it's not just you a lot of people have this problem 
---
150 aint nothing. I don’t believe a word you say about getting your guns dropped
---
They should then make Scorchbeast actually worth the effort then. 
---
Especially after you claim a workshop and spend over an hour decking it out with resource extractors, generators and defences. 
---
It’s okay you get your resources refunded, but sorry you just wasted your time tho
---
Luck doesnt affect the drop rate unfortunately 
---
Good question.  I've rewritten this 3 times now.  The answer is really convoluted and requires a bit more information than is palpable in a forum post.  It takes a little bit of programming knowledge and general understanding of object oriented languages.
---
I'll attempt to explain why in laymen's, and hopefully it will make sense; but if not and you still want to know why I would suggest creating a simple game with an in game object that you later remove references from in the software development environment.  That will really reinforce the issue well.
---
Basically, under common circumstances they should in fact be able to delete Atom Shop purchases.  I am fairly confident that they can do this.  By the very nature of what is required to verify that an account has made a purchase.  Bethesda would have to check on login, before the main menu; which is why the Atom Shop does not populate as an option immediately, it needs to check your purchases before populating the shop to avoid duplicate purchases.
---
However, the Atom Shop does not behave the same as inventory.  There is no object given to the player after purchase.  It's only a database entry that confirms access to the shop purchase.  For skins and craftable items, this is essentially treated the same way as learning a plan in game.  Once you know it it's available to craft.  It's not actually an in game item, but rather kind of like a light switch.  Either on or off.
---
For clothing (NYE tux for example), this is easy.  Just remove said item ID's from all the accounts inventories.  For skins however it becomes more difficult.  You would have to remove the item and then give the base item back to the player.  Meaning, CSR would have to manually delete items from an account and then make sure to create the base item in return.  Think of the Blackbird PA skin.  It's a unique item that when you craft it deletes the item you are applying it to and gives you a different item with the skin applied.  If they just delete the item, that PA piece will be empty.
---
For things like Power Armor and weapons, loading a character that doesn't have it anymore is easy.  The player just doesn't have it, it's not ever needed to be called upon.  But what if the account bought a hairstyle?  If CSR does not assign a hairstyle to the character, it would likely return a value of null.  That's bad.  That's really bad.  This is the type of issue that corrupts entire builds and causes crashes to desktop and hardlocks on loading.
---
Now imagine you were a player that experienced this.  Or worse yet, imagine that in the servers attempt to find the hairstyle "null" it just keep searching the hard drives for the asset.  Forever.  Until it crashes, everytime any character with hairstyle "null" logs in and not just our example account.
---
It's a mess.  One that you don't want to really embark in unless you really have to.  Which is the exact reason that Bethesda doesn't just delete someone's inventory.  Because a simple mistake could cause horrendous server issues.
---
But that is an entirely different thing than "We can't do it.". Which was my point, saying they can't do it is just what they tell CSR to say in lieu of "We could do it, but we won't cause it's honestly way more work than your 60 dollars that we already have is worth."
---
I hope that explains it, I really enjoyed having to break down how shop items function because honestly, I hadn't thought about it.  It's rather interesting to me that for the most part, shop items are just plans you are buying to know rather than a plan in game.
---
I assume you've already closed out the game and rebooted at least once. At the very worst you'd have to reinstall :(
---
I really like your art (particularly the car ones) and wish I could use some of these on console.  My best loadscreen is still the one of my noob level 1 Vault ID card from day one -- instead of my character, I turned the camera around and zoomed in on the vault boy sign on the bedroom wall so my ID is just a cheerful, possibly incarcerated vault boy giving a thumbs up as he greets the new world.  Those were happier times.
---
I just wanna use my plasma rifle and be the beautiful Enclave prince I was meant to be! ;_;
---
Why can't lever action rifles not properly eject a steel casing? As far as I know every eject mechanism relies on the shape of the casing not that is made out of brass, which would also require zinc.
---
I could get behind that. Grafton Steel workshop doesn't do anything special beyond produce a lot of steel.
---
There could be a machine there like the munition factory has which can be set to produce specific "rare" materials like gear spring screw et al.
---
Oml I feel you. But I don't doubt once a good one hits the market, dupers are gonna have a field day
---
As if that's a good thing. Rip anyone w/o tse. 
---
New Vegas + Meltdown Perk + Flamer = Win (particularly against Cazadors)
---
Well I had played since beta when almost all enemies dropped 12 .308 or .38 bullets each, so I have thousands still (never did use an lmg, that probably would have ran me out of .308)
---
Sure I don't agree with duping but dupers shouldn't be banned imo.Its Bethesda's fault they have made a glitchy game and the dupers are just players who exploit that.They shouldn't be banned and nothing should happen to em at all.
---
They probably jay walk too, mother f*ck^rs. 
---
Yea that's the whole point of my post. It was maybe hilarious for a while, now it's stale.
---
I really hope this got fixed I've been stuck on that mission for awhile now 
---
Havent even noticed that since I have never messed with flamers. 
---
Wow thats bad. Especially for that gun. 
---
So now we stand a chance against higher levels who abuse TSE for 1 shot kills?
---
I have had the same case where I have built my base close to a 'defined area' that is considered out of bounds for player bases. 
---
If I build right up to the boundary - it seems that some servers have slightly different boundaries than others - and it fails upon login.
---
Normally re-logging fixes the issue.... but in the OP's case its a strange one since it is just a 1x1 base.
---
Let’s not
---
That Bright light may do small amounts of energy damage. Damn. 
---
You misspelled terrifying 
---
" I shouldn't be punished for cheating because the game shouldn't let me cheat!" Is not a valid argument.
---
The rules say don't cheat. You break the rules you get punished.
---
Just as you said, "Semantics". 
---
Finally some good and understandable patch notes. Sad to see the power core refilling when joining a new world go. But it makes sense ofcourse.
---
And wow. The Bobby pins. FINALLY.
---
When you can invest into the charisma perk of Animal Friends,  base defense gets EZ mode.
---
That "lucky" molerat that manages to chew a hole into my camp gets to play with Dogmeat.
---
Dogmeat is a lvl 91 albino mythic Deathclaw that followed me home one day.
---
He is a very good boi.
---
Ok I think I figured out what was causing this.
---
        
---
https://fallout76.wiki.fextralife.com/Scaly+skin 
---
         
---
Scaly Skin Mutation also reduces AP by 50 but may not display that on the UI if your AP are already limited.
---
The fact remains that player weapon's damage are tuned for enemy health and not the player's so even if/when TSE's are nerfed there will still be a great many setups that will let you just inatagib another player as soon as the slap damage comes off. So it'd take far more work than just nerfing TSE's to make PvP anything more than a boring, aggravating cheese fest.
---
ill let you in on something, legendary armor outpaces legendary weapons. with the right build you can tank many hits from a TSE shotgun
---
even if you dont have that, TSE weapons dont make you invincible, just shoot them with your own.... first
---
I don't mind the carry weight. I know I can decrease it. What I mean is the difficulty finding it. Yes I know I can craft it but I rather not waste my resources for that ammo. And I like to press the button and immediately fire. 
---
Is it legendary effect only or you tested Missile Launcher damage and Grenades as well?
---
Would be abit broken, when Grenades and Missile Launcher become complete useless just because of broken legendaries.
---
I have a Swing Speed, Anti Armor, Reduced Weight Power Fist and I love it. Fisting deathclaws and scorchbeasts with a badass mechanical fist is so cool
---
 I too have a Lever Action and am pleased it will replace the right amount of bullets but I really don't give a fuck.
---
 Fix the fucking disconnects. That's the biggest problem the game has now.
---
What is dead may never die.
---
doubly so when you realize it takes 10 acid and 10 oil to make the ammo for it.
---
Honestly they could fix this if flamer fuel was crafted in a manner similar to fusion cores
---
Because sometimes games make choices that are for the health of the game, rather than trying to annoy people.
---
The idea is you go out and scrounge up/salvage the parts you need to make things. What you are asking is to be able to turn one easy to obtain resource, and turn it into another resource that isn't as common. 
---
Which would quickly make having to get those items pointless.
---
So while it makes sense to some. It doesn't in terms of the game and balance. 
---
That's why it's doesn't make sense to have this option in the game. 
---
Necratom?
---
Because I actually play it.
---
You know what is funny.
---
I've had this happen a few times. Prior to the system we have now for camps. While you think you could have searched everywhere for the camp impeding yours.
---
Theres a camp, just the little machine. Hidden in tree roots, a bush or even some rocks. With nothing else being built, just that, lol.
---
I'm happy for you. Now we just need a Legendary Syringer and a Legendary Alien Blaster.
---
The instability isn’t from a couple hundred more pounds per player, it’s from duper’s that has as much as literally hundreds of thousands of various chems, nuka colas, bobble heads, weapons, armor, etc.
---
Those people aren’t merely overencumbered, they’re a friggen black hole - and “real” reality even gets wonky around black holes :p
---
Thank you, i needed a laugh
---
What's a bigger threat? Scorched or The Enclave?
---
The Scorched are an indiscriminate evil, whereas The Enclave are a discriminate evil. In this case discrimination is a good thing because The Enclave isn't going to exterminate humanity.
---
I have console, so I cannot reliable tell of the issue to the same extent. I can check when console gets updated next week and compare the results then.  
---
You can't prove he didn't grind for 45 TSE shotguns!!! He's not a cheater, I swear! /s
---
Nice!  Do you mod for puncturing?  And then any points in incisor or does that max it?
---
True, but knowing the little rats as soon as it gets fixed there's a new method 2 minutes later 
---
Actually lv50 T51b has the highest energy and ballistic damage resistance. Already been proven.
---
I do, all of my pieces are random legendaries that I found that give me a good combination of perks for my melee build, such as +1 strength, etc. I keep them and keep repairing them until I find something better. 
---
Most of the time, I wear power armor, but sometimes I just want to goof around without it, and end up running into a mob that attacks me.
---
I have level 3 of whatever perk it is that's supposed to randomly repair your armor when it gets hit, but it doesn't always repair it before it breaks.
---
It will pop up if someone else had a camp on/next to yours when you logged in (and will continue to until you find a server without someone there)
---
If you're seeing this very often, chances are you may want to move because you're in a common spot (like whitesprings golf course).
---
When you relog onto a server without anyone there it'll place just fine
---
Lima Charlie. Are you a spender or saver?
---
Well I never said Morgantown but that's both scorched and ghouls. Just depends where you are.
---
Ah there it is :D the stats of mine is with 100%. At 200% it has 643 I think at both. 
---
Or you just 200% Lv50 T51b And it’s better in every category besides rad resistance.
---
You're good, common mistake it seems.
---
Are all your characters a specific build! And I thought two would be two many haha
---
Thank you!!
---
The one that make food expire slower? Yes. (Been a week since I e played) my group tosses all their flux to me when we cross paths so it doesn’t spoil since I run a lot of support perks
---
 Its not us. I have had the connection state running on my second screen for quite a while.
---
Yep
---
That’s ignoring people who want multiple weapons and armors to switch things up. If it wasn’t for Bear Arms I’d be stuck only using 2-4 big guns total between my person and stash instead having the ability to use all of them.
---
And that’s what we have now, in the future when they add new weapons and armor things get worse.
---
And that’s not talking about people who want to trade or set up player shops. They’ll need a lot of storage space for that.
---
And yes, I keep all junk scrapped and roughly 100 units sans steel because I consume so much for ammo.
---
Im not a duper first of all and neither are my friends, do you know theres a whole community of trading? its not hard to get anything in this game lol You said they had the same shotguns with the same mods. If it was the same how could you tell? I'm calling bullshit bc you are lying. You are assuming there guns are exactly them same. 
---
Yep... just tried to give the game another shot on patch day, lasted about 10 minutes before it booted me back to the main menu. This game is a fuckin dumpster fire lol. Almost 2 months in and it's more broken than ever. 
---
No. I want them to fix the bugs and add more endgame content so that we could enjoy the game’s full potential 
---
What blows me away more than people duping are the people paying **real money** for exploding shotguns and such.
---
How are people that desperate for an OP weapon?
---
Had a player try do one shot me but I fast traveled to the mine, and he followed me down during the quest. I had enough time to block him and fast travel to the blast zone in Watoba. Give me a break, I am a level 84 and I intentionally carry no junk during a blast event. LEAVE ME ALONE, I just want to play the game.
---
for what its worth, lilly is currently 23 and living in good health in vault 17, where she will spend the next 52 years of her life in the comforts of the underground bunker. 
---
until the master drags her out and turns her into a nightkin.  
---
Hmmm legendary alien blaster would have to come in a dlc against zetans I think, otherwise it'd be odd to have in the loot table.
---
Legendary pipe revolver, syringer, bone club, bone hammer, and I think I'm forgetting another thing or two should definitely be added though
---
South of the Crevasse Dam. There's also another random event spawn at a small camp a little southwest of the National Radio Astronomy Research Center.
---
Rich boi
---
I love the game but it has some serious flaws in it. Unable to complete some missions, constant CTD in places, long neck glitches, unable to damage mobs and I'm sure I saw some Tposing recently.
---
So you're guessing 
---
Even the mail system would be nice.
---
In UO you dropped your entire inventory in death and you couldn't just respawn. You became a ghost and you either ran around randomly looking for a wandering healer NPC to rez you or looked for a player to rez you,  IF they had the skill to do it. Then you had to navigate your way back to your bag and there wasn't a marker for it. 
---
Good news is the top gear in the game was along the lines of a mace with +1 to damage liches. Nothing else in the game had bonus stats or mods than those super powerful weapons. They were rare, too.
---
Still, the penalty was harsh and I loved it. The fear of dying was real and it made everything more enjoyable. 
---
Sad but true. 
---
I'm thinking it's right at the low end of the sweet spot for me. I wouldn't mind if another increase was a little ways out,  assuming additional content will bring more stuff we will want to stash. Just realized last night i had more bulked junk than i realized, or even needed. Sold some and freed up 100 weight.
---
Not saying it wasn't (had no idea if it was or wasn't), I just meant it's accepted that it's normal practice to let people know at least a week in advanced; outside of certain circumstances that is. Emergency maintenance, etc. And it should also be done *in game* or at least the launcher where you can't miss it. 
---
PvP is barely a part of this game at all. Definately not a "core" component 
---
Plastic....1k
---
For now, at *some* point they will run out of methods though and I can't wait for that time, since it will be when the game's economy will develop in a healthy way
---
its resistances do not match other PA
---
Excavator/45 /300 /300 /426 
---
X-01 /50 /458 /513 /513
---
Ultricite/50/513/453/453
---
even T-45 BTFO's it
---
T-45 /45 /420 /420 /420
---
Saw it and killed one in the more a few days back haven't found one since
---
"Look ma itsa' trashnado!"
---
One word? Physics.
---
Armor piercing anything over 100% is a waste, and I definitely prefer the death claw gauntlet. Idk is it’s my talons or its own effect, but bleed damage it causes is intense and great if you’re not 1 shotting enemies.
---
Yea, I have puncturing, then I have Iron Fist, Incisor, and Martial Artist. Iron fist gives me 20% more damage, Incisor for the 75% armor penetration, and because I have anti armor im ignoring 125% armor which means armor is useless, and I have Martial Artist for that 30% swing speed, and because my power fist has the 40% swing speed I'm swinging 70% faster. So I'm doing 320 damage, ignoring 125% armor, and im swinging very very fast
---
lol that is steeeep. I mean they're easy to farm but still. 10 resources for 5 fuel? wtf
---
It's a ballistic rifle and all perks associated work with it. *However*, the *ammo* is classified as energy. So the Batteries perk works with it. Reducing ammo weight. 
---
Both, I Raid whitesprings and limp over to vendors where I can usually make 1400 a day
---
Im not talking about every duped item, I mean banning obvious dupers. If someone has 10,000 marsupial recipies, thats probably a flag to ban someone. All it takes is to make a program that A) Scans these files for B) A list of flags and C) Make those flags the obvious things, targeting serums, healing, recipies, nuka colas etc... first. Collect data over a month then do a massive banwave of people who have 1m nuka colas, 10,000 marsupial serums, etc...
---
I dont mean finding every single duped item in the game and removing it. Thats probably not at easy like you say and also kind of unfair if someone has something that is duped and they really didnt know. The biggest issue right now is that there are people with like 10k sets of the highest end legendary gear selling it for a pittance through RMT services and its completely deflated the value of everything in the game. Other issues are that things that should be rare and easily marketable, like being able to craft serums, instead are so common that people are selling serums for 100-500 caps a pop.
---
Anyways if they never do anything then the only fix will be a server wipe because the dupers have so much stuff that for example many of them could afford to take a new serum every hour and never have negative side effects and do this for the rest of the time they play Fallout 76 even if they play for 7600 hours... Stuff like that is game breaking on a number of levels.
---
Wouldn’t that just be a really OP cliffracer?
---
A follow up question, what sort of benefit, number wise if possible, would the hydraulic bracers provide, or is this a wasted effort as well?
---
I don’t know how I have 1052 Gauss rifle damage if my rifle perks weren’t working. If this really was the case I’m expecting a ridiculous 1600+ damage after the patch. 
---
As in same model: Pump action. How is that suspicious? So me saying that means i duped? lol SMH All i know is the servers crashed since beta. No way duping was as rampant in beta as it is now. 
---
In OPs defense, there is nothing for them to reciprocate as you will not be initiating a potential pvp situation
---
If you’re on at team  it’s not too hard. You find a secure location with a container like a duffle bag. Load it up. Log out. Login to the Dane server and boom pick it up. That’s how one of my buddies does it. 
---
Does it affect minguns? I have a shredder build that would benefit greatly from this.
---
Disconnecting... how is this a thing 2 months into release? Every time i read "server stability improved" i cringe. 
---
We need patches that actually make a difference in the games performance and stability, because every time people come back on patch day to give the game another go... they instantly fucking regret it. 
---
See ya next patch... i guess. 
---
Well, now i have to do it. Should i bring some med-x?
---
This is not true. I have tested with a hunting rifle and a 10mm pistol. Perforating and piercing have different values (perf did more damage).
---
I was testing it against a character on my second account, so I could see actual HP value changes.
---
What stash limit would you consider acceptable? At what amount would you stop thinking the limit should be increased?
---
I posted about this just last week where caps weigh twice as much as a bobby pin. An average bobby pin weighs 1 gram where a cap weighs 2 grams. Good to see some realism now. 
---
&gt; ...what do you do after you hit 100?
---
This is reason they lowered it. There is not much to do after hitting 100 as of now so they want to slow you down from getting there so quickly. Until the Vault raids come out.
---
As a fellow gun nut who owns a Winchester 1894 (levergun) I haven’t been this excited about a patch since... forever!
---
I can only dream.
---
Drop your GamerTag! (US Eastern Time) I welcome all levels of companions. My favorite part of the game was the Campions you were able to encounter, but I bet RL companions are alot more interesting lol
---
So would you rather them not release a patch for months at a time? They’re releasing bugfixes as they figure them out. So you’d rather have them not push any patches forward until ALL of them are done?
---
It has created tension in the forums. Thats about it.
---
That's exactly what I'm saying. PvP and fallout PvE are just not compatible with each other. There's nothing you can do for one that won't ruin the other. Hence the dichotomy in the player base.
---
The game needs to decide what it wants to be otherwise both sides of the base are going to be alienated. Better we piss off one side than both.
---
I know, kinda bugs me that they aren't part of the CAMP system already.
---
Indeed
---
40/30% sounds roughly right based on my testing with the hunting rifle and 10mm pistol against an alt in a naked power armor frame. Perf did more damage.
---
Has Bethesda ever said duping caused server instability? I seen them say something about stash sizes but never duping.  Or is this just Reddit comment knowledge that you have?
---
Really?  And you tested this with your lvl 1000 character??
---
I like the idea of a split budget, one for defense/offence, and one for aesthetics/structures. Limit the turret spamming but let me build my ridiculous wasteland palace 😁
---
In the screenshot the service line extends all the way to the edge of the court. It's supposed to stop at the singles sideline. It's very minor, but funny to me that somebody messed it up. 
---
I was around 70-75% health and was instantly killed while in power armor during a Nuke run in White Springs.  Jack-hole did that to everyone around the clubhouse in an apparent attempt to let everyone what a douche he is.   Didn't think it was possible either until then.  I don't agree with being able to stack damage so high that people who want to play in pacifist mode have any protection negated. 
---
Im level 82 and usually only get crap melee and leather legendarys 
---
Pre-war money is everywhere. I don’t think we would have a problem acquiring a “fair bit” of it. 
---
Honestly who has ever used the vending machines as they are in the game so far?
---
Bro I freed up like 25 pounds, I had a whole bunch of plasma cores that I'd never use just sitting there
---
I had this issue with the veil from the sisters of mystery desk. 
---
Why do you think they keep patching this shit with hotfixes? To stop dupers like you, but you always find a way. Even traders on here don’t want dupers duping shit and causing crashes and further instability. 
---
Wow. Just picked up my first Tesla rifle last night. Good to know. 
---
nope but with a level 250. Killed him. He had over 250. I received 60 caps. I used 1000 because he used it as an example. 
---
Oh fuck me. The only time. I was asking what kind they were. Because I was personally looking for a Tse Gatlin gun. You have officially derailed your entire argument anyway. The guy never got back to me anyway. 
---
Preach!  I actually dropped all my cores under 25% charge the other day and I still had like 160 left.
---
Leveling normally is fun but I also don't mind doing the quests after using the supplies to boost so I can get better level-scaling quest rewards.
---
Lead and Plastic - insane need to make more 5.56 even though I have never ran out
---
8K+
---
Playing as a No-Power-Armor character and rp'ing as a sheriff/cowboy. I've been using a TSE Lever Action for a while now. So glad I no longer have to load 5 round every time XD
---
The Power fist has the benefit of being easier to repair. Farming bones for the gauntlet can get pretty anoying if it is your main weapon.
---
Yes, and they'll typically get quite pissed about it as well.
---
We could just skip it.
---
We would be happy. 
---
Let's just say that in nine months that place is going to be littered with little tin cans.
---
I noticed that, too. Hoping it's not a permanent "feature." 
---
Me too friend. Me too. 
---
Make it a perk card to unlock at high levels then, gives more reason to invest in camp building perk cards, and make it like level 50+ it unlocks so you would already know you are capable of going to get springs without havibg to grind sugar grove repeatedly.  
---
This is also an RPG (despite what people want to say) so you shouldnt have to be a scavenger, it should have other options.  
---
Spings gears and most of all screws absolutely should not be rare materials anyway, try and find real lufe objects that dont have screws in them, this would also just give more value to steel.  
---
And lastly you can already build on junk extractors that give you these resources absolutely for free, being able to turn steel into them would be less OP than the already exiating extractors
---
Good man, I make hand mades and drop them randomly for players
---
There were explosions when I was insta-murdered.. makes sense now.
---
Well, that was exciting.
---
I think you misread my response, I was clarifying what makes you wanted when pacifist isn't enabled
---
I would hope at least one of our "best and brightest" would be an engineer who understands manufacturing. Especially if the stated goal of rebuilding America is real.
---
Whatever dude,your opinion.have fun.
---
This - 50 last week and still holding close to 20 as I was shedding them to lose the weight. I'll hold them now. haha
---
Its Talons, although the Deathclaw Gauntlet does do more damage, the Power Fist has armor penetration which is better in the long run imo 
---
That could work, set workshops that produce that particuar resource
---
I fail to see the concept of ones's toxicity having an effect on another's gameplay.
---
Just play the games you like and ignore all of the extraneous crap.
---
Most of the ones I've found were from pre big patch and the others were about a week ago. 
---
For real, if they released the game in October 2020 they would actually have a finished game and have made a ton more money but they rushed it for 2019. I guess we will see in their next release if they learned any lessons from this.
---
No word on removing the duped items huh? I mean I've read things about it how it may be hard - even impossible - to do, but I supposed I still somewhat hoped.
---
For those farming Blast Zones - this is an easy one.
---
What legendary armour might be key for surviving such an encounter because I am 100% willing to farm for such things 
---
When I come across other camps I will go in and look around, maybe barrow crafting stations and stash box. But I'm scared the owner will come and get mad.
---
I was quoting what Bethesda said about stash size. Do you not remember them saying they couldn't up it because of server instability?  And i did and you misunderstood it. I said same model as in pump action. 
---
Liberals trying to change the narrative to get a win lmao
---
I’ll join
---
I’m sniper/shotgun so I don’t really need it but the plans would be nice to increase my building for others
---
TSE and melee are fine if you ask me. It's when you start stacking things that bolster damage at low HP to incredible amounts that is creating the problem.
---
It's almost like there's different groups of people with different opinions! Nah, that would be crazy, it must all be the same people.
---
You just said their stuff was questionable and you are directly trying to be disrespectful to me. 
---
 See, I see stuff like this and remember what I went through and what was accepted as the norm when playing UO. It makes me shake my head. I get it. You grind these events and get nothing, then when you do, it's not what you want or need. That used to be the norm, whay everyone accepted. Because when you did finally get what you're looking for, you feel like an 8 year old on Christmas morning. 
---
Since the nuke zones can be solo'd, I'm not sure I they really 'fix' it. Now if we were talking about a raid situation like what the vaults are theorized to be, then hell yeah. Make sure good stuff drops from that. Nobody wants to go through that and get garbage. 
---
Shit you can solo... on the fence here. I want it to be a little rough especially after all this duping BS.
---
LMAO I can legitimately carry over 400 lbs with a high strength build and double calibrated shocks. Man... some of these suggestions people come up with when thinking with their hate boners instead of their head...
---
You said you dont even go on there. That was me scrolling down for 2 secs on your comments. You have no arguments. You lied once about even going on there and i send proof of you inquiring about a gun from someone who is constantly selling the same guns. You lied once im sure you’d lie again. Your word aint shit
---
Precisely! Let me have all the lamps and tiny plants I can stuff into my budget, but let me have like one small turret for those pesky mole rats that keep squatting in my lawn.
---
In body: hand-thrown grenades. Did you even read what you wrote before hitting 'Post'?
---
Still haven't released a lot of the shop items that were in the last data mines.
---
It’s core for the developers too.
---
the TV plan is in white springs and/or watoga (both of them) and harpers ferry. 
---
Im all for more legendaries, but arent the combat rifle and lever action (now that loading is fixed) better dps weapons for sniping than the hunting rifle? I can get a couple sneak shots off for the 2.5x damage buff (if you have rhat perk maxed) vs the hunting rifle taking its sweet time with every round to get chambered. Started out with hunting rifles until I got far enough for those two weapons which I find work better. 
---
How? Now your just reaching
---
I don't disagree with you on that. I just am stating that if they nerf TSE then all we'll see is melee since people are going to gravitate to the next OP thing anyways.
---
The best form of balance would be having those guns/melee do the same PVE damage but reduced PVP damage.
---
LMFAO ! That is so funny. 
---
What in gods name are you storing in there?
---
I’m just going off of what was explicitly said before release about PvP in the game.
---
You just made my day! I've got a bloodied gatling with increased fire rate, as well as the speed demon mutation, and 3 perk points unallocated, now I know where they are going
---
With the way Bethesda is going, next ting is crippled Scorched on Griffon monster porn... Everything for caps. 
---
Opinion? lol bro thats not an opinion, you dont have enough testing if you think thats how it works.  Find any person without a bounty, kill them and let me know what you get. Its super easy to test. 
---
If you disable the patrol bots by shooting out their arms, they usually go into self destruct mode and you'll hear it. 
---
However, I've had robots blow up while looting without any alarm. At least one I could hear. It's possible that it was just so low I couldn't hear it; however, the one like the patrol one is near impossible to miss. 
---
I thought they said there would be player vendors in this update. Or is that next update 
---
As much as I'd like to, I certainly cannot point out things that are different between my Enclave questline and yours.
---
We both received the same dialogue from modus, we both completed the same quests with the same outcomes. The weapons we used might have been different though.
---
Blaster could come from killing the Fabled or whatever the level 50 version of the Flatwoods Monster is.
---
While I agree a zetan DLC would be sweet. The problem is the alien blaster is 100% useless at the moment. Only with legendary affixes is it going to be remotely useful, and even then a crappy laser pistol will still out perform it as far as energy weapons are concerned.
---
You were inquiring just the other day about tse’s on the market. I don’t believe you “found” all those weapons. Gg
---
Yes, The game world.... you need to find a cave or tunnel and build in side the terrain basically. 
---
They do; got the mod plans from scrapping hunting rifles.
---
Bro the rules dont say nothn bout glitches that are in the game.The cheats and aimbots and mod menus are external programs that the user uses to give him an edge in the game.The glitches is stuff in the game.
---
Don't get me wrong , I dont agree to duping , cheating , hacking or exploiting but Bethesda simply can't ban the users who duped.The glitch was IN the game made by Bethesda.As long as no external program was used I don't think they should be punished in any shape or form.
---
On the other hand , selling items for real money definetly should be punished , but as I said ,if they do it with no external program and they gain no real life currency /material benefit , I think they shouldn't be banned.
---
and rad resistance is the one you want,since if you use mutations (which if he is going melee more than likely he will use twisted muscles) you are down to spamming rad away cause rad x supresses mutations,glowing pustules are also a very real threat in radiation zones ,meanwhile x01 has lower DR but acn be mitigated via med x blocker and ifx it good 200% 
---
This (supposedly) doesn't work anymore, but you store items in an artillery gun, which apparently you can for some reason, then initiate a server disconnect. Upon loading back in, the items appear both in your inventory and in the artillery gun.
---
That might not be exactly accurate, but that's the basic idea.
---
What is the point of unscrapped hardened mass?
---
Not if you don't shot them? They can run at you with every mutation but if you don't hit them. It's moot.
---
But that way of thinking is horribly wrong "Because my thing gets fixed, nerf this thing to make it fair for ME."
---
At the moment you don't need a build for TSE just 5 int and 1 perception, you at the very least need to invest into melee or you'll fall behind too either in DPS or just dying a lot.
---
Hell yeah, no more duping!
---
What can I even use a fat man for though
---
They barely do anything 
---
So you’re piggybacking on to make another non-point with nasty language? Reported.
---
I don’t get what are you saying by making them as easy to get as boiled water.
---
Requiring you to run a specific build to do PvE content because of possible PvP is *not* a good thing. 
---
PvP isn't good in this game due to the imbalance of weapons and their shitty pvp system. They need to segregate the servers already. 
---
What the what? Groups are capped at 4? Shoot. I invited 7 friends to play this weekend. What a mess I'm in for. 
---
Well even I play it and enjoy it , but that doesn't ignore the sheer fristration that i get every 5 minutes from playing this game.I play it only cus its a Bethesda game and it's a Fallout game.
---
Yes, apparently Grahm is a fan of vampire movies
---
With rank 3 Ghoul Sight and an instigating melee weapon I can knock em out in one power attack or two regular attacks. Compared to Cancer Bats and other "boss level" enemies they were stupidly easy to kill.
---
Oh yes, that does make sense.
---
When you hear dialogue from a source other than an NPC (through an intercom, holotape, eyebot etc.) the game applies a filter to that dialogue so that it sounds like it is coming from that source and not just from a human. The things I listed are missing these so they sound very odd in context (an entirely human voice coming from an eyebot for example)
---
The game doesn't do this automatically based on source though, the dialogue/audio in question has to have the filter set manually so that it plays correctly. 
---
&gt;We should probably put a step on it as they plan to review Legendary Mods at the end of the month. If Explosive mods are still gibbing people, we will likely see nerfs. If they are not, we need to let people know to stop any nerfs from overdoing it.
---
i don't really agree with this because thanks to duping and the general perception that TSE weapons are *the* end game and nearly everyone has one or more at this point, if it takes a set of endurance perks just to not die instantly i still think TSE weapons should get a nerf, we shouldn't have to have something like that equipped at all times just to not get insta-gibbed by TSE weapons; even if this perk decreases their damage by a considerable amount i still think TSE weapons need to be looked at and readjusted 
---
Same. I'd like a sign that insures they have no prob with you being there provided you behave yourself. PS- Can someone tell me how to edit my title? I know how to edit the post but the missing quote marks is bugging me. lol 
---
Yes. You need to be careful.
---
1000 Bobby pins? That's what, 1 pound now?
---
If its real high yes
---
Dude, you’re all over the place. Duping causes server instability for EVERYONE. Think about that the next time you’re duping a shotgun for a buddy. 
---
... Did you actually just bring politics into an irrelevant game discussion?
---
Yeahhh, it seems like energy weapons are the poopoo at the moment (Except gauss which I think is still considered energy? Havent looking into it much).
---
It's neat that you can make it use fusion cells with the mod from the TNT dome though
---
Oh no...my quad lever action rifle just became useless. I have to sit there and watch it reload *20 shots*
---
Ammo most definitely needs to be sellable. It’s AMMO. 
---
If I can BUY ammo then uh,, well, you get the point. 
---
Even the most costly PA for springs is only like 10-13 for the chest piece with max Power Patcher which honestly is basically nothing since PA breaks like 10x slower than normal armor to begin with.
---
Servers crashing is caused by duping itself.
---
Having shit tons of items that don’t stack causes excessive databasing that lags and destabilizes the servers in general. By stacking I mean things like ammo or scrapped junk, there’s no data difference between 1 missile or 99,999 missiles.
---
Nasty language? What are you even talking about?
---
Workshops are PvP content. It tells you that when you claim them.
---
Luck has nothing to do with loot drops. It is a factor on their durability though.
---
I got a two shot laser pistol with an automatic receiver that fucking breaks after I go through 5-6 clips. Fucking absurd. 
---
You sure do, lol. Bird bones and/or the falling perk in agility can help with that. There's no fall damage with power armour.
---
I have my doors locked to my house but my crafting and food and 1 purifier are unlocked.  Look for the tetris on my roof.
---
You can also jump in PA, where you won't take any damage. Also there is a perk for falling damage you can equip.
---
Wait, so you're saying that you had a bounty on you, and when someone else attacks you to try to claim that bounty, a bounty is placed on them too? But it's different if they are already wanted?
---
I was under the impression if you attack someone who is wanted, no bounty is placed on you. Is that wrong?
---
or just try playing the game as it was designed, rather than wanting them to put in stuff to allow you to bypass the game design.
---
You don't have to grind sugar grove for springs.
---
The thing is, Spring and gears and screws are not rare materials. They drop from certain creatures. There's 8-10 different items that you can get either one of those or sometimes two of those items from. 
---
Seems to me, you read what other people say to do, and then don't bother exploring the world. I say that because everytime someone starts talking about needing springs, gears and screws, they always mention having to grind mention sugar grove and camp mcclintock. 
---
They are not the only place to get those things. 
---
If you don't want to take advantage of what the game has to offer, and just focus on a narrow amount of content, that's your choice. 
---
a bounty isn't placed on them, they just lose the same amount of caps (their level) if they die to you as they would in normal pvp.
---
What are you talking about? It almost always is a horde...and if you don't shoot quickly they will swarm you and beat the hell out of you, high level or not.
---
They can cover a lot of ground in a very short amount of time.
---
The Henry rifle is and probably always will be my favorite lever action rifle. It's just a beautiful work of art. 
---
This is actually why I started carrying my Hunting Rifle again, too, but I'm not still not sure if it really makes *enough* of a difference. I think that's *supposed* to be the trade-off, but it doesn't feel like it's enough to balance them out - the Lever Action has higher base damage, fires faster, takes about the same amount of time to reload (and probably less, now that it'll finally only reload how many shells have been fired), and ammo is more plentiful. Compared to that, the only "pro" the Hunting Rifle really seems to have is the potential for slightly better armor penetration, which is fairly situational and so doesn't always apply.
---
...it just seems like the Lever Action is the better overall choice, which... kinda sucks, really. I use the Lever Action because it has good stats, but I don't *like* it - I *like* the Hunting Rifle because it looks like a proper modern-ish sniper rifle, not something from the mid 1800s.
---
**Weapons**: Legendary Hunting Rifles will now drop as loot.

LETS GOOOOOO

Bird bones and healing factor with Class Freak perks, you wouldn't even notice.

If you played fo76 at all in 2018, on PC or console, download the Bethesda launcher on your PC, and log in with the same account you play fo76 with. They'll be in the Games section automatically. 
---
Had the exact SAME situation a few days ago!
---
I would have this issue, my turrets would attack my base when i log in and id have to store and replace turrets on login. 
---
You sound just like my gf yelling at me....
---
Yeah - love it. I don’t get mutants though - mostly animal spawns (bugs, mole rats) and the occasional Death Claw
---
I have my ladder leading up to the platform set back JUST A FEW virtual feet - you have to jump the gap. I think this helps keep the destruction limited.
---
I WISH I could put the CAMP up in the tower, but then you’re too far from the junk...

 [u/BethesdaGameStudios\_](https://www.reddit.com/user/BethesdaGameStudios_), can we PLEASE get **proper** 21:9 UI support? Stretching the 16:9 HUD elements to 21:9 looks terrible.

I am good with 600. Please put your energy into requesting something more meaningful. 
---
Dude the slap damage is pretty intense if you ha a group of 2-3 people on you with OP melee builds. I had to log off a server entirely because I had a few dudes dressed as chimpmunks stalking me. CHUNKING ME IN POWER ARMOR with pacifist mode on. I hadn't touched them
---
The fact their splash damage was enough to destroy me is telling enough
---
They were running multiple mutations allowing them to keep up with me.
---
But no lengendary bobby pins that is unbreakable and opens locks like a master lockpicker?

One more. Didnt wanna show this one cuz its a bad tv screen shot (i play on xbox) but here it is.

I just noticed that I wasn't getting anything too great. I've since moved more special back into luck, so maybe you're right.
---
Two handed weapons are wielded one-hand in PA. Whether this affects damage from the perks..IDK.
---
For example, you have perks boosting 2H weapons. When in PA, that 2H weapon is now technically 1H..Does that mean the perks don't apply anymore? I wonder if anyone has clarified that.
---
Also, not sure if there are any perks that increase STR or damage outside of PA. They usually are specific, either say no Power armor, or will strictly include it

If you're on ps4 hit me up. Sitting on a set of excavator shocks, 1k each.

I'd like an increase myself. 600 is enough for some (according to posts/comments I've seen) but not for everyone, like me.
---
I see what you did there!
---
It was not what I'd like to say, I mean they maybe could delete all the negatives inventories
---
Because they create lags
---
Because they destroy the economy of the game 
---
I think it's considered a rifle, not a heavy gun..?
---
No, they're not and it doesn't. It says they *can* be contested in PvP. That doesn't mean they're PvP content. By your logic, literally, everything is PvP content.
---
Claiming the workshop, defending it, building on it, repairing it, are all PvE and balanced towards it. 
---
Again, just segregate the servers already. 
---
Yes. I have fallen to my death because of marsupial. If you wear power armor, you'll be ok though.
---
you only need 2 turrets 
---
Ooohhh me likey
---
Idc about the downvotes they can’t put a dent in my karma lol
---
Tested it myself. Dont take a single point of hp! But it still injures me, like cripples my leg or arm and I have to use a stimpack to heal that up. Not bad though, not bad.
---
Phones. Pick up all the phones. 
---
I have no doors. It's like an open faced country store. 
---
Silos for me 
---
Wow
---
On the day open modding comes 🤞
---
The cause of this for me was having two armor pieces of the same type in my inventory.
---
For example: you have vanguard’s combat armor left leg x2 in your inventory, it doesnt matter if they are identical, then your power armor left leg will start to unequip itself randomly.
---
If that doesn’t help you, then good luck
---
Degenerates like them belong on a cross. 
---
that is very ok my guy... TSE weapons were (and liekly still are, they haven't changed them yet, only changed this perk which may not even has a very big impact considering how much damage they do) insanely overpowered, and seriously, not everyone is going to have this perk equipped, this was not an effective nerf to TSE weapons in PvP but even if it was, good! They badly need to be nerfed, and it's still ridiculous that you might have to have a specific perk equipped at all times just to avoid getting insta-gibbed by someone with a TSE weapon
---
You're just mad they might have taken away your "I WIN" button (even though in all likelihood, they haven't)
---
If you find PA parts unequipping after entering, the bug seems to be because you have multiple normal pieces of the same body slot in your inventory. Say you have two leather left legs in your inventory, one equipped. You get in PA, your PA left leg fails to equip. Just stash one of the normal left legs and the bug will go away.
---
I do too. It’s more fun with a group. 
---
The only trash mob that has guaranteed ballistic fiber drops you can loot/scrap are mothmen which are pretty much at least top 3 among the most scarce and unreliable/inconsistently spawning enemy type in the game.
---
Move along, duper. This isn’t a politics discussion. I’m not going to give you a rage boner to jerk to. 
---
It literally crashes the server for the individual when people dupe. It’s common knowledge by now. Everyone knows this. People create shit, drop shit, create more, server crashes. The rest of the server suffers too for it. 
---
I can’t tell if you’re being willfully dense or you’re just naturally this ignorant. 
---
I brought them in to show how even though i don't dupe and have told you i didn't that you keep saying i do. Just like the democrats. Like it or not thats what you are doing. Just to win you going to start saying i dupe lol   You have proof of this ? im not asking for much. Just proof. Sorry but your word isn't proof. 
---
basically you build a tower where your "base" is up 2-3 stories and there is only a single foundation that everything is sitting on. 
---
surround that with plants since that seems to be what everything attacks with turrets inside of that (to shoot the things attacking plants).
---
ill take a picture of my tower bases that seem to work. 
---
Bug fix Patches, free dlc and ongoing communication with the community.....let's just complain and say Bethesda never does anything!
---
You could just look for armor pieces with the 50% reduced falling damage and get two of them.
---
*at least we get something good out of 76*
---
As someone mentioned you have to re-log until your camp is properly placed.
---
PC latest update (1/10/19) game randomly hard freezes and closes to desktop. Never had issue until after this patch. Happens completely random. When i combat, standing still, loading, not loading. Been happening every 5-15 mins sense new patch.
---
Bro take class freak lvl 3 in Luck and be a super human. youll only have -1 STR
---
As if you ever needed to carry more than 10 of them....
---
Have you seen anyone respond? It was just one. At this point you are talking out your ass because you believe 99% of weapons that are better than yours are duped. I also have a ts missile launcher. Was that duped? 
---
Wait caps have weight? But then how will I become rich if I can't move? (it's a joke. but seriously do caps have weight?)
---
If they're a melee build then they will have incisor, ignoring 75% of armor.
---
Griefers will probably always exist unless they overhaul pacifist mode to be 0 damage both ways, and 0 damage to player camps. Just gotta hop. Same thing happened on WoW back in the day, whether it's people griefing on RP servers or just following you and killing all mobs so you can't progress.
---
That to me is why you need legendaries. Without something like a zetan DLC which would introduce an ammo source/surplus, there's no using the actual AB rounds. 
---
A two-shot fusion modded AB is still just going to barely scratch the damage of a laser pistol. Without having access to the fire DoT, or other good mods in general.
---
It is ironic how the people say the players should roleplay more to enrich not only their own gameplay but also others.
---
Until someone starts roleplaying a raider, killing indiscriminately and destroying stuff. Now they're not roleplaying they're a bad person, shame on them. 
---
It does make you wonder, if NPC raiders were added today that would kill you, and attack your camp, would people be on here tomorrow demanding their removal?
---
Duping? For real? 😂 get Ammosmith perk Max lvl and Super Duper perk max lvl. Together activ you produce tons of ammo 
---
Ultracite is the best power armor (highest physical resistance), though X-01 is a close second and has more easily attained mods.
---
I also signed up for an evolving game since they intend to support this game for in perpetuity... so suggestions are welcomed which is why I made this post. 
---
Well when you start by saying im a duper you lose all credibility. Maybe i would know more about it if i did it huh? Dumbass lol
---
What they really should do is separate what enemies have a better chance of dropping certain legendaries. Not just a huge pot of RNG. Like if you want a death claw gauntlet then farm for legendary deathclaws, if you want heavy weapons then farm super mutants, unarmed head for ghouls etc. The way it is now is just ridiculous. 
---
It's a farming frame, not a battle frame. Take it looting, take it mining. Slap an emergency protocols or a medic pump on and you won't die. But for arguments sake, if you one shot everything, do resists really matter? 
---
I'll only get mad if your in a party with a Wanted so it's obvious grief is coming.  In fact I have virtually all the plans so my CAMP is a clean house with separate bedroom, kitchen and workshop.  I also have a sit down room with juke box and piano as well as a porch with okay view.  Also there plenty of wood and a couple of Firecaps less than a minute away.  Oh and I have 5x2 water purifiers on the go.  Sweet home West Virginia, although I am from Scotland and the Tide were beaten (sigh).
---
Because "He got two left hands"
---
You can see additions to the visuals on the gun.

But what you said was you all had the same shotgun, then tried to change it multiple times.

Hey, where did you find that blue dress?
---
Yea same for me too

What platform are you on ? Is this a new PC bug with the update ?
---
wat

Nope nope and nope-
---
Don’t try and defend these terrible ass RNG loops-
---
I killed queen 4 times recently 3 no loot and my most recent.... 1* wood life saving leg...lvl 40?
---
Nuked whitesprings last night DCd 10 seconds after launch. Hi! 
---
These new patch notes look like garbage.
---
even so if you use automatic you blow through a lot of ammo i use ultracite ammo btw which is even ahrder to farm
---
Post patch the servers are more stable than I have seen them... since ever? Or maybe beta before anyone knew how to dupe. Its so weird to walk to up a vendor, press "interact with vendor", and watch the vendors inventory appear IMMEDIATELY. I forgot it was supposed to work like that lol.
---
I believe it does.
---
Yea, well not in game. http://imgur.com/a/H3dthgH
---
I picked up a laser pistol two nights ago. I have Weapon Artisan 3 and Gunsmith 5 and Luck of the Draw 3.
---
Weapon broke in about 100 shots from double durability. Three minutes of combat. It's absurd.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/9uvdyy/comment/eaz6zj2
---
It’s just a belief I’ll stick too, plus luck has good perks anyways.
---
Many veteran players since beta use drugs for luck near the end of the scorchbeast queen. 
---
However, you can still get good loot w/o luck.  This guy had less luck than me, around 10-15 i think.  A 2 shot explosive gatling gun dropped for him. 
---
Better than mine? You have no idea what my inventory is. Your little tse have not my collection. Good try tho man. Have a good day
---
What platform are you on btw, wondering if this is a bug related to the new patch PC people got.
---
You can! When you place your camp down do it so the green ring is halfway through the junk pile. Should be enough room. I had  my base in the tower for a while and built a platform around it 
---
Whitesprnigs has a fair number of telephones and hot plates in the main structure and the out buildings among other places.
---
This right here is a good suggestion. relay towers also.
---
Ha you’re wrong! Take a look at the first weapon change on today’s update. 
---
in the town flatwoods there are some holotapes that talk about it
---
Had some issue with close combat but it might be me.
---
I  said same gun. Like base gun. I did not change it multiple times wtf Im starting to think you are the duper. 
---
I am 100% convinced that it is supposed to be 50 fuel per craft and someone just forgot to put a 0 there.
---
And as Bethesda does, even though it's been pointed out multiple times, nothing has been done about it.
---
Even ignoring the ammo, Flamers break so fast they're basically useless. Burning through 10 oil and acid worth of ammo (even with ammosmith and superduper perks) in .25 seconds is just the crap icing on the shit cake.
---
Oh thank god they have done something about the charging barrels. What they really need though is to do something about duping. It needs to be stopped, and all duped items need to disappear.  I don't care if you paid caps for it, and I don't care if you were not the one who duped it. If you have a duped item, you are a beneficiary of a practice that has broken the in game economy and I have no sympathy for you if you lose anything.
---
Tbh, just do hotfixes - like you don't need to wait 2 months after release to make the bobby pins have less weight.. 
---
I got controls disabled 3 times and then disconnected.
---
They're probably waiting to see if fixing the dupe glitch actually stabilizes the server before adding any more load. 
---
Ok I'll keep that in mind thanks
---
Some people pay for Candy Crush.
---
Wait, what? In what universe have I entered that now the deathclaw gauntlet no longer has inherent armor piercing capabilities? That was the main hallmark of the damn thing back in Fallout 3!
---
Apparently it's been like this since Fallout 4 and I missed the memo.  
---
Man, unarmed really has fallen off a damn cliff, and that makes me sad.

Sugar grove I believe has a lot of phones as well.

As a sort of museum, the price of admission was probably "by donation" before the hyperinflation hit.

---
Even two shot explosive laser rifles fully modded are pretty garbage, I think my TSE gatling laser does something like 31 damage... which is weaker than a vanilla .50 cal (though explosive may not be working right on them).
---
Even if energy weapons (besides gauss) had their damage doubled, I'm not sure that they could stack up against a handmade or .50 cal
---
Theyre busy helping a rapist get away with rapes an murder etc. 
---
I like to think that in story terms the only nuke launched was at site prime. That said I would also hit top of the world to nip that raider problem in the bud before it could start again.
---
One that requires you to not be in power armor until they make a dense equivelient for it. 
---
PC already got it today
---
The last patch expanded the stock of bulk material at most vendors to include bulk ballistic fiber, so at the very least you can buy it. It's not like there's much else to spend money on.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQlujXWP-5c
---
Yeah because you buy stuff from dupers and most likely are one. 
---
Nah I benefitted from it too, quad lever actions for life. That gun is easily the best use of .45 in the game
---
I have a hard time believing people even *play* Candy Crush. I got tired of that shit before it even came out, when it was called Bejweled.
---
You forgot a few: "Shit game/dumpster fire", and "Glad I never played I'm so smart" 
---
and you should get a personality that doesn't make most people say "this guy sucks".
---
You’re supported to shoot their propellers 
---
Oh sweet. Must’ve read about it yesterday then. Been a loooooooooong day
---
I've heard it sucks to nuke there. But I also heard a glowing Mirelurk queen will spawn near there. So... 
---
I buy in bulk. No rules against that is there?
---
Oh my god and you have to go through the animation on all of them? You poor soul
---
It's the best way to help answer questions from new players who just got the game for Christmas, also neat to see some of the posts that don't make it to the first few scrolls of the front page

You have the mentality of a fortnite teen. And I triggered you by calling you out even. Then you throw politics in for no reason. All because you’re defensive.

Huh, that's cool, I'll try to replicate that tonight! I usually shoot out their legs instead.
---
I have no problems with buying from dupers
---
This another one of those posts where everyone gets upset about other peoples opinions again?
---
Hmm wonder how the MIRV mod affects that
---
People are mad that 76 was rushed out garbage with no play testing and no endgame content.  If you were completely satisfied with the game then why do you care what other people say?
---
Bless you
---
Watch them put it on the creation club, it’s $10 to fix the animation XD
---
Imagine if your recent friend ,Billy , who gave you your TSE Handmade , Gauss and Lever just because he likes to share loot and make people happy would get banned for duping.How does that sound?Not all dupers are bad imo.Some just dupe so they can give away items to other players.
---
So does that mean your explosive bullets won't blow you up anymore if you're to close?  Or just won't do group damage when there are multiple enemies? 
---
Now these are some great patch notes. Lengthy and detailed and also some very good fixes in here we’ve been requesting for a long time. 
---
Can’t wait for more patches in the future tbh if they keep this same level of detail and focus going.

Sorry for the screenshot but it's the only way i have found since i can't fucking put it anywhere (Yeah i said that i have found a spot where i can, but even if the house is in green i can't put it.)
---
You have it right: they do not break down into ballistic fiber scrap but you can actually find ballistic fiber at the Whitesprings: on top of the secondary bunker entrance with the hand print scan and security door there is a military grade duct tape spawn right by the screwdriver and knocked over toolbox and you can sometimes find ammo bags and military duct tape inside the actual bunker's lootable containers and desks (along with technical data).
---
I use them for blowing up people's houses. Pretty fun to nuke people.
---
So what was Benny's fate in your game? There's only 1 thing that can ever happen to Benny right?
---
In Fallout 76 launching a nuke is an Enclave quest. The Enclave want this to happen. But what if the Brotherhood of Steel didn't want it to happen anymore? What if the Brotherhood terminal at Ft. Defiance offered its own quest that rewarded a different type of silo keycard, one that you could use to disable the silo for a period of time. Or a quest to beef up their defenses, upgrade the defence bots, increase their production rates, etc. 
---
What if there was more to do with the silo's than just nuke west virginia? What if there was choice?
---
I can’t find anything about explosive weapons glitch?
---
Oh what?? Can't back yourself up now that we are back on track? All you do is buy copy and paste weapons and charge stupid  people for stuff they can get from anywhere else for a fraction of the price. You keep on ripping people off and wasting people's time. The only reason you haven't deleted this thread is because Noone has downvoted you yet. 
---
Well you cant mass collect steel from any source so thats 1 way its harder than boiled water, also steel has many other uses that you might prefer over having screws, gears or springs like making ammo, .50 cal rounds for instance use 40 steel and 0 springs gears or screws.  
---
What I would like to know if why people are dead set against the idea? How would it negatively affect you to have some people decide to build a machine in their camp thats converts steel to springs as opposed to sitting on a junk pile getting them for free?
---
The Fallout fanbase has always had major rifts like this since FO2 came out decades ago and people started taking sides as to which game had more validity to exist. This is nothing new.
---
The real question about this is would it create a separate cell from the overworld?
---
I didnt see the issue for moving a base and it saying the base is floating when it clearly has all foundation posts in the ground. I hate the moving base mechanic, IT DOES NOT WORK

Well quad is nerfed to hell now so it’s far from the best legendary. It used to be awesome you could fire forever and only have to load 5 rounds
---
lol where's the pity gold at?
---
Please. What constitutes griefing is a subjective call to make, and would require that every player be monitored by bethesda at all times in order for them to ban for it. That's not an even close to reasonable idea to put out there, and I'm pretty sure you know that.
---
The people who abuse XP and Duping bugs have obvious tells though. Server logs can identify them, as can their own inventory most of the time.  It's easy for Bethesda to identify them and punish them appropriately.
---
It's a PVP game, you might not like how the PVP is being handled, but I've been griefed while playing, and people have exploited bugs to be able to one-shot pacifist players.  Those are the kind of actions that should incur a full out ban.
---
Specific numbers are fluid - but there IS a number sufficiently high enough to spare nearly all "lawful" players while catching a significant number of dupers.
---
Heck, pick a reasonable number then double it and use that. We've got @#$%^ running around with 10,000 bobbleheads.  ;^)
---
Other than you being trash without people that break the game and then charging stupid amounts to people. Can't handle someone actually earning their stuff. Go back to your basement bud. 
---
How much does the pawn shop offer? Definitely not the price you paid for it, or the price they will sell it for. There's a perk called Hard Bargain that increases the rates to buy and sell, and Grape Mentats also.
---
I have walked every inch of the place and cant get them.  Just going to unmark it so I dont see the marker for the quest.  Driving me insane.
---
I’m glad to see my mini gun/laser Gatling/ plasma Gatling break in 500 shots.
---
Some people don't have time to grind 10 hours to maybe get a drop and would rather spend $3 on it. I don't agree with it but I understand why someone might do it.
---
It’s for trading/selling to other players. “To buy this item from a vendor it would cost you ‘x’ amount of caps. I’ll sell it to you for ‘y’ amount which is a saving for you”. And as there are no markets or anything in game and trying to find a specific weapon from a vendor is a pain in the ass, it’s meant to show how much it would cost them. So that you have a basis to negotiate from. 
---
New Vegas was the best game aside from the classics to be an E wep user in. Plasma hit hard, especially with bigger things like the Plasma Caster and Defender (AKA FO1's plasma rifle and pistol respecitvely). Not to mention laser weps were very great for crit builds. Add on to fun things like the Holorifle from Dead Money and 
---
revamped Tesla Cannon from Broken Steel (Tesla Beaton was notable in being able to fire 3 shots before a reload) and energy users had a grand old time. Stuff like a different way to make ammo and freely converting cells and amping them also helped to differentiate them from guns characters.
---
Sadly since FO4 Energy weapons feel way too homogenized compared to guns aside from looks. There's no real reason to use them really.
---
Just use the mod that fixes it if you're on PC or Xbox One.
---
and from which range do they teleport at you?
---
Gauss rifle ammo is really easy to craft, only downside is weight. That gun and it’s ammo both are absurdly heavy
---
&gt;Still overpowered but...
---
...Now you don't suicide from your own overpowered-ness as much!
---
I just started using PA and accidentally discovered this glitch. When I relogged, I'd always put my lowest core back in because I wanted it gone from my inventory first, but now I went from 6 cores sub-50% to 8 full ones all trying to chase that damn wandering responder bot!
---
What yeah i buy stuff and sell stuff to people for a reasonable charge. Idk how they are stupid for wanting better things. That is what America was built on
---
That might be due to the massive level difference. I’m thinking that a low level player with a low level explosive shotgun (I’ve heard that PVP damage might take the weapon level into account) could potentially one-shot another player. 
---
But I’m just guessing. It’s hard to say without the actual formula that Bethesda uses.
---
Yeah, seen this suggested by someone before, would be cool to also have some other vision modes like night vision or for the recon modifier have the marked enemies receive a bit more damage or have better accuracy when targeting them in VATS.
---
There is a rebel in your army on the second pic! Bastard is trying to raise dissidence by pointing the wrong way!
---
I actually don't enjoy using power armor, so that's good I suppose.  But I also love scavenging and usually wait till armor breaks before I repair it, so I'm not too too worried. 
---
The servers are just SQL servers? No wonder they had performance issues 
---
How about the perk + dense mod + assasins legendary effect in armour?
---
Sure I am fine with that .. PA is already ridiculously durable and is the only armor that covers every single piece of the body. The trade off being you'll likely never find the person in stealth shooting you till it's too late anyway, lol.
---
Chameleon is a hell of an effect.
---
What did i over charge on?
---
A for effort
---
I’m not on either of those, and mods disable achievements. Mods are not the answer to everything. 
---
ahhh this explains a lot, thanks.
---
And the flickering chests are abug i guess?
---
Yes and no, We will likely see a reduced usage of explosive weapons as they can be negated entirely now.
---
As that happens people will want power armor again.
---
Which will bring back explosive weapons. 
---
Thats a meta. =)
---
Great, so now their clan/guild/clique of friends has an unfair advantage.  That still ruins the game for legitimate players.
---
The duper should be banned, recipients of duped items should have them deleted.
---
Because you can't earn them on your own? Way to point fingers. People like you are the whole reason this conversation is even happening. Hope it gets patched and you can't handle the game withouht the help of those people. Everything you have is worthless and you get ripped off. Good job. 
---
As a shotgun user... Plastic! (Why is other ammo so cheap to make?)

8.5k is where I like to hover for my caps. I have at least 25k worth of stuff on my mule.

Serums.

Harpers Ferry Free States vendor bots always has them. It’s like 700 caps.

I ran out once and was like /never again. I may swap back but honestly I want to switch to using Levert actions as my sniper and my handmade as my battle rifle. I just dont have all the mods I want yet so I'm stuck using my hunting rifle

Unacceptable...thank you for notifying me

Except for how it was designed is broken. I had a guy 1 shot me in while I was in full Ultracite with an x-cell buff after he had taken my workshop and I came to contest. It’s not a give and take, it’s completely based on what weapon someone has.
---
So they wanted to set up an online economy for players, and there is no auction house or have I not found it yet?
---
You never said “model”.  If I have to go through the effort of sharing it via imagur, I will, but something tells me you won’t be having much to say anymore, “deleted”
---
(Btw, I had nothing to do with that - I’m so new to reddit I haven’t even figured out how to report people yet, lol)
---
It would be nice if they made junk weigh nothing in the stash box, that way I can hoard all my junk and actually be able to fit a few extra power armor frames or weapons.
---
Because at least I know what I am talking about.
---
I don't pretend to know why people do the shit they do.   
---
I think you spawned into a server, your camp spot wasn't available and you got pissy because there wasn't anyone nearby - which has been explained as a possibility by earlier replies.
---
I do NOT think you were in a server that your CAMP was established and you received a message that your CAMP has now been removed.    
---
I do think you need to learn CAMP spawn mechanics better.
---
normal mirv +1 i believe
---
While that's all well and good, it's still not much. I don't particularly enjoy having to go on an hour long excursion just to repair my armour. 
---
Um, what? Tapers off at the knees? The black and white parts are the boots. Have you never seen [Santa Claus](https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn%3AANd9GcQwqOHIBoitwJAZv6zaMpOv5Sz7QQGvXDwxes19ggJIOOCNo-P8) ? 
---
4000 caps for a serum? That's stupid. Oh shit. Hahahaha you are something else. Bye buddy, have fun buying from dupers and being one yourself. 
---
SHOVEL KNIGHT
---
Interesting that should work just fine, mine is exactly like that with stairs as well, I actually have two houses in the same way and no issues. I have 1 house close to morgan town under some trees and another on a cliff, both work fine. I am on XB as well. 
---
NPC's aren't the sole building block for making a game a "Bethesda" game. You're missing out bro
---
But they also dont pay 1/10 the value 
---
If it works like in FO4 it's not good. I remember buying Big Boy from Arturo and giving it MIRV. Let's just say I died with every shot lol
---
Currently reported as, Fireproof with Dense negates ALL explosive damage.
---
How many do you need?
---
[https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png](https://i.imgur.com/9Rccgzd.png)
---
Yep. Ive only just managed to load the first 4. Its already been a month. Seems to be going a bit quicker now I have a few perks applied, but it's gonna take me another 5 months to finish loading.
---
It is super handy having the gun when it's loaded though. Its good for the smaller enemies
---
Awesome, I'll count that as confirmation for C2. Thank you.
---
My fo4 was a sneak gauss rifle that could one hit almost everything. Loved that rifle, I'd use it now if everything didn't break so easily
---
Agreed. Literally got into a gang fight 3 days ago because of this. Some high level player like 121 said that's how real PvP works in the game
---
Hey, where is the second screenshot location? Never came accross is
---
Serum recipe you mean? People message me non-stop about those
---
Why? Because it still works out financially.
---
They're still the top tier firearms for PvE... but they're know to cause cancer in the state of California.
---
Where are the camo weapon skins from before?
---
Gatling is the only heavy ballistic I use. I like the Tesla though, great for mobs. Haven't found a missile launcher worth my time either.
---
I have had one follow me from berkely springs in the mire TO THE FUCKING FOREST.  1/4 a way across the map.  The only reason I didn’t server hop is that i owned a workshop i didnt want to lose.
---
You only need half? Hmmm put it up on the first floor against the wall. 
---
I’ll have to try that later. I find I’m spending far too much time in my camp now ;-)
---
That said, I think that’s a level progression thing. 
---
1-10 mostly just bombing around
---
11-20 starting to specialize, getting better at a few things but still struggle
---
31-40 weight is hardest here, as you don’t have perks that boost everything so you end up over-carrying ... and you’re really not set on any particular gear, etc. You may be moving your camp often here to either scrap/store or toss up some turrets to help kill a messy foe
---
50 you get your last special but your baseline build isn’t finished yet
---
60-75 you finish your baseline build and start working on swaps
---
76+ every perk swap you can add on (Junk Rat 3) may be optional, but they all lead to quality of life ... you can start tuning your equipment, ditching gear and junk you don’t need ... and then you start playing in a more static camp
---
..... but everyone was using TSE for PVE....
---
O.o
---
I know how they're used and their purposes. A larger majority does not.
---
Want to play stealth? Hop out of the massive battle tank and put on a proper armor set up. One designed and utilized for sneaking around and being stealthy.
---
This only applies to PvP. PvE is still necessary to be taken into account along with the fact the the two shot effect still makes them incredibly useful.
---
They may drop in price a bit but nowhere near a "tank" in the value
---
Even after the update? Ouch. I feel like their priority should definitely be to make sure people aren't losing the stuff they've spent hours to earn. I'm going to try to keep my hopes up that they'll fix it eventually...
---
It's a good tactic. I was ambushed yesterday by two guys with TSEs, they surrounded from each side and started firing while I was in a little cabin. Of course, I could have simply ran away, but instead I jumped right infront of the one to my right, which instantly killed him thanks to the explosive damage, and proceeded to VATS lock the other before he could react.
---
Then I camped the place with Chameleon and killed one of them two more times while he was running to recover his junk. I never saw them again.
---
With the improved brightness headlamps I might actually try out the red one.
---
haha cool nice work :).
---
Good luck to you hope all goes well. Dont let the Mutants win hehe :).
---
It's a business for some people, and the only reason they're playing FO76 in the first place. Fun has little to do with it.
---
Like people that run [click farms](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsCJU9djdIc). Whatever pays the bills.
---
I have plenty of caps. I don't buy from trash so okay buddy. Unlike some people I can earn my own stuff. You are taking this way too personal. Have a good day buddy. Hope you have fun buying from dupers and being one yourself. See how you are doing come Monday. 
---
Enough range to sit there with sentinel armor till they are close enough.
---
Just log out and log back in (as intended)
---
Wishful thinking
---
All your trying to do is slander and it doesnt bother me
---
this is why i never became a tycoon at neopets
---
anyway, something i noticed is that you get diminishing returns, i used to make pre-war era suits and sell them for big bucks (50 caps) each, now i get about 15 per, it slowly went down
---
Well why are they going to tell you how they stopped it? That’d be like saying “I’ve hidden all my money in this room, and this is a list of all the traps/security I’ve placed to keep it save. I hope you don’t use this information to specifically target the exact things I’ve done so you can get past it and steal my money”
---
I tried this, but it doesn't always work. Occasionally the person on the server you were just on doesnt accept your request, or even if you were on a server were you added someone, in the seconds it takes to quit and swap characters, they ended up logging out or at the main menu and you've no way to get back to that server. Again i know this can be solved by using a friend you know, but no friends = no help.
---
I heard that the reason the first dupe fix didnt stop duping was because there was another method. Hopefully they'll close all methods of duping and do purging of obvious dupes (3+ of the exact same legendary in the same inventory, or whatever is reasonable).
---
None of them had any kind of explosive weapon I take it? :p
---
Look, not my intent to belittle anyone's experience. Usually competition drives market prices. 
---
If the game was like a "Who can clear X Zombies faster" then obviously the demand would be high. 
---
Currently, we have no motivating factor except human impulse.
---
In shooter games, that's usually shooting other players.
---
If i wanna pvp only at end game. I may spend 4 hours a night pvping. I would expect to die alot. 300 caps on every death? How many hours can i get from 3000 caps? I can only make 1400 caps a day... I could burn that in a half hour..
---
Hahahaha. You need me to post the images again?
---
Maybe he'll respond, but I worked in psychology for 10 years, and compulsive liars have a tendency to accuse others of doing precisely what they are doing. The fact that he insists repeatedly that I'm lying about relatively modest things like being able to make ammo leads me to believe he's probably full of it.  
---
However, if he's not, I sincerely wish you all the best in getting into his community. Tried messaging a developer to see if they really 'intended' for players to be able to get 'all' plans from any one location, regardless of the level. The only place I can even remotely think of that would seem reasonable for that sort of thing is farming the Scorchbeast Queen, and her and her mobs don't drop 'all' the plans.   
---
If it sounds too good to be true (Legitimately getting every single plan in the game from the same location in a way that the developers intended it to be done, yet the majority of the community has no clue about), it probably is. If there is a way to get all the plans in one location, rest assured, it's not an intentional part of the design of the game.
---
&gt;in my 250+ hours, I've never seen a normal honeybeast
---
I've seen one at the Seneca Rocks visitor center. Other than that they've all been glowing ones.
---
Are you on ps4? I found most of them by the locked doors with a hand scanner.
---
Same haha. Honestly it's kinda shit of them to not add a way to combine cores now that they've nerfed the shit out of them.
---
If the duping was actually fixed this time, prices will go up.
---
Would I like it? No, not particularly. But I WOULD understand the neccessity of it.
---
Certain items, particularly the TSE guns, have been duped and spread around to the point that they've ruined the balance of the game. IF Bethesda allows the dupers, OR the duplicated items to remain in game, it ruins the game balance. There isn't any way to restore the game balance without taking those items out of circulation.
---
And hey, it's just like real life. You buy stolen merchandise from someone, the cops will show up and take it away as evidence, and nobody pays you back for that.  As the saying goes, buyer beware.
---
yes it will work
---
i'm sorry but the TSE meta game ruined this game for me... it's the one and only weapon type anyone wants and it seems like nearly everyone has, it's extremely overpowered, and it puts any player without one at an extreme disadvantage, in both PvE and PvP thanks to the tagging mechanic, it's basically the only thing to shoot for at "end game" and even if you're just casually doing other things, other players that do have a TSE weapon can come along and ruin your day like this, whether it's one-shotting you or one-shotting all the nearby enemies before you get a chance to tag anything
---
I know a lot of people still enjoy this game and that's fine, i don't care what ya'll do and don't play, i just really wanted to like this game, i kept playing long after all my friends had quit because of all the bugs and annoyances and i really wanted to give it a chance but for me, it died really quickly 
---
the idea of a multiplayer fallout is a fantastic idea, and the game has great bones in that regard, but as time went on, as the meta game aspect arose and more and more people quit, seemingly leaving only cheaters, dupers and assholes behind, i began to dread running into other players, it became essentially a single player game with the added chance of a random asshole being able to ruin it for you, coming along and destroying your base or one-shotting you with a bullshit TSE weapon before you even know he's there or bullying you out of your workshop.. just all of it keeps adding up to "no thanks", i may come back and try again in a few months and see how it's doing, but right now i have to stay away for my own sanity
---
If you want to use power armor but don't want to need to farm fusion cores, just take Full Charge (rank 2) perk, and don't use VATS. See my [observations on fusion core drain](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7he9s/some_observations_on_fusion_core_drain/) from a while back for details of what drains fusion core capacity. If you're a casual player and avoid actions which drain fusion core capacity, a single 100% fusion core can probably last you weeks.
---
Besides Poseidon Power Plant, there are two other workshops where you can get fusion cores from: Monongah Power Plant in Savage Divide, and Thunder Mountain Power Plant in The Mire. You can just capture the workshop, build a Fusion Generator to power the Fusion Core Processor, and fast travel away without waiting for the defense event; enemies remain inactive if no players are around, so no damage will be done to your workshop objects. Then just check back sometime later to pick up your fusion cores.
---
Also sneak as much as possible, as being in "hidden" status while sneaking will also hide you from the world map.
---
Well, hopefully the number of disconnects will be massively reduced now.
---
ive shot down 3 and all of them had cards, sorry man
---
If you are on PS4 I can show you where it works best later today 
---
you can do that
---
Oh I feel your pain as Im in the exact same situation. 
---
u/lonevaultwanderer perhaps you can get this added to the next patch list, please?
---
those don't really bother me
---
Think theyre trying to tell me to go my right.
---
Pacifist =/= Passive
---
They can still do demolition work on a player's C.A.M.P. just fine. 
---
Not greifing. 
---
New Vegas ultimately railroads you towards the battle of Hoover dam. Cry as you might, it's an illusion of choice that every RPG does, so it's neither to NV's fault nor to its credit.
---
In a single player game, your choices matter because the world literally revolves around you. You are the only one who gets to see the consequences, so there's no limit to what you can be made to see. In a world where people are actually playing, illusion of choice is meaningless. So you wanna stop the nukes, and I want to launch them. What happens? Clearly both cannot do them at the same time? So do we fight? That'd not add anything fun to the game. What you said is absolutely valid if you were doing the quest alone. In New Vegas, you chose Benny's fate. You chose which faction lived. Here, your choice is no more important than mine or anyone else's, so giving you a believable choice is a hard trick to pull off here.
---
That all said, Fallout 76 was always marketed as a spinoff. So there is no reason to cry when this game plays differently from the previous titles. Given that, comparing it to other games of the series and calling it inferior is like comparing apples and...apple-like fruits, at best. Quite similar, but not quite the same. 76 is not replacing Fallout 5.
---
Nice posting those pics!  Was looking forward to seeing what it looked like.
---
LOL TSE ghouls!
---
Tough request considering theyre busy helping a rapist get away with rapes an murder an being a pedophile
---
Well it's happened twice to you - the first case I think since launch that we've seen on this subreddit - I think the odds are in your favor
---
Hmmmmm
---
&gt; If you haven’t noticed the legendary drop rate for 2 &amp;3 star legendary items is almost gone at the white springs.
---
Yeah and that was across the board too and not just a nerf to Whitesprings drops either. So it's not like it gave anyone an incentive to look elsewhere to drop a nuke since they wouldn't look anymore competitive being nerfed all the same.
---
This isn't Call of Duty or GTA, so keep that in mind. People wanted the guns so they could farm whitesprings or scorchbeast queen for the most part, but now with fireproof + dense you can point blank shoot a TSE shotty without dying
---
Awesome thank you.  Is it +100 cary weight?
---
If only there were some perks (or bonus from CHR, Berry Mentats, etc.) that would make a character invested in bartering better off then just someone feeling entitled to it...
---
Upvote applied.
---
Most useful item in this patch: Bobby pins
---
Least useful item in that patch: dup glitch fix
---
No, I never used the glitch. I don't agree with it's use. I also know that it's pointless to fix it now, the damage has already been done. Adding in player vendors soon will benefit the exploiters greatly, and legit players won't sell a damn thing. Just another way of showing Bethesda didn't actually care about this game or it's player base.
---
But the thing is WE CANT POSSIBLY KNOW WICH WEAPONS WERE DUPED AND WICH WERE NOT.Do you want it to be like a slot machine with 50 50 chances you buy a good item and you keep it , or a duped item and your caps are gone down the drain??!?
---
All in all, I'm very happy to read this. Lots of bug fixes, some QoL improvements, quashing the current duping, and best yet, another patch at the end of the month.
---
I've only been playing since christmas, and despite the fact this game was *not* finished at release, I've been having a lot of fun.
---
Marsupial, Bird Bones and Healing Hands combined with Class Freak rank 3 makes it fun to just jump off of whatever because the small damage you do take heals immediately. Or just put on PA I guess.
---
Just had to say OP.... Love that username!!
---
Yeah I noticed this too, good stuff.  
---
The rebuttal to the .50 doing more damage has always been "but the ammo is cheap to craft" because you get a lot more .50 ammo than .308 from the same mats in crafting.  Personally though I don't see this as a problem, because really ammo isn't some precious resource in fo76 in the first place.    
---
You can easily farm up the mats to make an overabundance of ammo no matter what weapon you use so I don't see a problem with just letting .50 sniper be the alpha strike ballistic weapon.  It's at least partially balanced by the fact you need to scrap a metric fuckton of guns to unlock the receivers.
---
I bet those  -2s bother you. Have a good life. You are a duper. You are trash. See you Monday when the patch hits console.
---
That was all from me. Noone else. It seems my opinion counts a little more in this community than yours. 
---
Hopefully internally they had some of their testers try to find as many ways as possible to dupe items and then fixed all those loopholes. We'll see I guess. 
---
Getting rid of Skeet Shooter as soon as I can and using those points for Fireproof
---
I am, though not sure when I’ll be on. My PSN name is the same as here.
---
My other higher-level character I have set up not someplace high, but in the information booth by Huntersville and the Freak Show. Got a working Nuka Cola machine and a bunch of cans, which is great for light farming for Nuka grenade materials.
---
PLANS... not the armor pieces
---
the plans
---
Did they fix the auto grenade launcher not listing as a heavy weapon yet?
---
Yeah, that's cool... but have you tried leveling up with the *stolen possessions of a complete douchebag*?
---
"Bro" the rules specifically say don't exploit.
---
This was actually one of the first things I noticed, that you seem to eject a round after putting in one, despite there being no need to do so. This isn't really a "haha they still fucked up complaint", but just a careful observation.  I'm glad they made it individually reload, since the pump-action was reloading individually.
---
It's not game-ruining, but for weapon realism, it's one of those details that is appreciated.  The thing I noticed is that a lot of video games do this, they have one reload animation instead of two for when you're making a tactical reload when there is still ammunition in the magazine, and the dry reload.  Only a few games really go that extra mile and offer that variance.
---
Most games only have the dry reload as the catch-all reload, and it causes few realism bumps, but it's not something I'd drop a game over.
---
I've never not one-shot killed someone with an explosive shotgun so I was just curious how you would kill so many people while wanted since they get full damage on the first shot.
---
In the first two a weapon would randomly break and hurt you but you couldn't fix it. The gun that exploded was gone.
---
wow, just sit there, patient people
---
It’s what I do ... X01 everywhere but legs. 
---
How do you know that guy was duping? He wasn't selling anything good and Ive sold recepies and my TSE guns before. You don't know shit bud. 
---
&gt;**Bobby Pins**: Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001.
---
About damn time! 
---
Cause every player have Reddit and post when there is a bug, I forgot about that part sorry.
---
Plus maybe it's my spot, since it's the same, that bug ? 
---
We can agree to disagree. 
---
What a legend. 
---
Shoot the engines, with 2 damages they stop moving and hove in one place and you can shoot the other 2 in order to get it to the ground.
---
Yeah the ammo availability shouldn't really be a thing, otherwise add a new .50 AP ammo or something.
---
They can always add some downsides (More recoil, smaller magazines when .50, etc)
---
The missing zero would explain a lot
---
I'm sad I missed out on those mosaic floors :( wish they'd return soon. I usually check shop then social before jumping into a game for the first time of the day now.
---
Sorry for off-topic, but I have a question.  
---
I'm a pretty casual player, but in my over 100h playthrough I have never encountered a serum recipe, even with some "server-hopping" and few Schorchedbeast Queens killed. Is there any particular secret or ancient technique that you use to get them, or just switch servers in Enclave and pray for recipe to come up?
---
Unfortunately it's almost impossible to mitigate the rads in a nuke zone without using PA or a hazmat suit, both of which prevent you from receiving the benefits of your "regular armor."
---
I've said it multiple times, but the best change they could make to improve build diversity is to treat the hazmat suit like every other piece of clothing that can be worn over your armor.
---
It makes no fucking sense that I can wear a slinky red dress over my suit of combat armor, but I can't climb into a big bulky hazmat suit without taking everything off.
---
Yeah have a good one man...stay salty my friend. Its people like you who make this game enjoyable for people like me
---
I also like when I hit the stimpack button 10 times and it does nothing. And also how the stimpack button unbinds itself if you ever run out of stimpacks and then add more. 
---
Did they playtest this game at all before the beta?
---
I'm level 45, and I don't even know what a "TSE" gun is. Can someone fill me in?
---
So should I give it a go again and try playing it...
---
Nice, I like that area, I’m over by the crashed plane in the mire
---
True 😂
---
Two shot explosive. 
---
Looks like a lot of great fixes. I guess Console players will have to endure disconnects till next week. Really hope it will be more stable cause right now it’s just too much
---
Yes, the difficulty of the process is why they evaluate the PC patch release first. They can easily update a PC patch that goes wrong, but they have to make sure console patches work the first time.
---
I know. Instead of putting on my hazmat and pinging a bunch of things in the nuke zone, I get to try a whole new server!
---
Just buy some? Other than plans, what else are you going to spend the caps on?
---
The thing about plans is they can literally spawn everywhere in pretty much every container. I dont think rarity is a factor of spawns (excluding vendors) so you can get an insanly rare plan out of a idk suitcase.
---
You also often find locked rooms at Pois that have some good loot in them.
---
In fo4 lot of strong items were set to spawn. Fo76 randomness made me look behind every corner and it works. 
---
So Cazadores? No thanks.
---
Irl or in fo76?
---
If you are On PS4 hit me up I am holding an extra plan. Username Beto21310
---
Put away your weapon as you land, skips that animation. Game changer. 
---
Two-Shot Explosive
---
Unless I'm out running errands, I'm online. Add me: TheGreatBatrus.🙂 
---
I just want the Alien Blaster to be at the very least a decent side arm. Make it stronger than a Laser Pistol with the downside being that it isn't in the legendary pool and I'd be good. Energy weapons with high critical damage would also help offset the minuscule initial damage and promote a more VATS heavy play-style.
---
They are pathetic, neckbearded, basement-dwelling, mouthbreathing malcontents. They are the living embodiment of the the comic book guy from the simpsons. Nothing will ever be good enough for them or satisfy that emptiness they feel in their soul, for they are garbage people. Fuck. Them. 
---
Thats like half the damage of my TSE Gauss rifle that droped from a legendary ghoul close to a nuke launching site, cant remember if it was A, B or C but it was in a Red Rocket.
---
It hits close to 1.900 with the prime receiver that dropped to me THAT FUCKING SAME DAY! I don't expect to get anything good again in 1.000 hours playing, but I'm more than happy.
---
Also the rifle has a much bettet fire rate, aiming and range.
---
Cores? Lol
---
Or level 15 armor? xD
---
Lever for ammo purposes - I find FAR more .45
---
I love how far we transitioned from it.
---
In fallout 1 your best option was either a turbo plasma rifle or alien blaster for eye crits. You would demolish even the end game enemies and could kill the final bosses in one turn with them. In fallout 2, the spotlight got somewhat taken away by the vindicator and gauss rifle (back when that was actually a ballistic weapon lol) that made other builds equally viable, but the new perks and pulse rifle in that game made energy weapons still a great way to wreck everything. F3 and NV has some pretty good energy weapons but the variety was rather limited compared to other weapons, and I think only the YCS/186 and Vengeance from NV and 3 respectively really had any claims to being top-tier. In fallout 4 energy weapons became doodoo when you had alternatives like the handmade rifle. The damage on them was just not good enough to justify using. The gatling laser was pretty good but the armor system in f4 really put down its potential. And here we are in f76, when most of them suck and some are too broken to even use.
---
Highly doubt the Atomic Shop would get its own subreddit.  A google search found a couple of promising links that appear to list the current contents, a wiki and a potential official link, but I cannot open them on my work laptop.
---
A two shot plasma weapon in FO4 with associated damage perks could waste most things in one shot.
---
There is a way to fight it. Just spin around and swing your weapon. I never needed to log out when being attacked by an invisible enemy. Just turn in a circle swinging a melee weapon, or shooting if you use guns. Backpeddle so they will follow you and be in front of you.
---
Ah, yeah, typo.
---
But it _does_ generate fusion cores in this game and they can be collected by players, so 50/50...
---
So what I'm hearing is, we need scorchbeast babies!!!!
---
You just destroy the guns? Thats what you’re telling me? Hahaha ok 👌 have a good one man. Keep it salty!
---
I've been using a 2 star Tesla rifle with 30% dmg on scorched &amp; 10% dmg on aim on Xbox and I think it's great. It could be bugged but after like 300 shots I haven't had to repair it. It has standard mods but still does decent damage that's just under my lever action. 
---
The usefulness of the ability to chain the lightning cannot be overstated. I've found it to be amazing in close quarters. If I'm having a hard time tracking targets close to me like mole rats I just shoot at my feet and the chain lightning will instantly hit the target without fail. I've also used the chain to bounce shots around corners in tight areas.
---
Agreed, the prime fissure is completely calm once SBQ is dead so really the only reason to go there is to collect flux.  You can't even farm masses and fluids because there's not enough enemies spawning to make it worth the trip.
---
Only whitesprings seems to have a large quantity of respawning enemies, and this is really only the case because it is already so spawn dense to start with.
---
Two Shot Explosive. They are two individual legendary effects combined together, one being the Two Shot, and the other being the Explosive.
---
Nobody is disagreeing with you about it being your own fault. Hence a QOL thing, just trying to make it harder to have those dumb moments when you forget.
---
You must be new open world MMO's. Over the past 20 years not one I can remember has released without a bunch of bugs to be fixed and game play mechanics that needed tweaking. Cookie cutter FPS games can do that, open world MMO's do not.
---
Silos Silos Silos. There are shit tons of robots in them that drop circuit boards.
---
Sure.
---
&gt; It is not in there because there has been no video evidence of it. No one seems to be able to replicate it and report it. 
---
Ironic since you're just talking out your ass and it's easily reproducible (as many have realized) by not having enough materials to craft/repair something without the material from scrapping the mod. Being ignorant of something =/= no evidence of it.
---
That's the thing, they don't enjoy anything though. The closest thing to entertainment they can muster is scorn, so they spread that shit around like herpes in a trailer park. 
---
This is why I'm concerned the stacking exploit isn't fixed.  
---
Imagine if Duping was fixed.  And now you have these guys with all these bobbleheads/magazine.  And now they are PISSED.  They could, in theory, go on a rampage to ruin every players time if they wanted.
---
This is so idiotic it's crazy. Every player has had that moment when they are at a vendor asking themselves "Do I already have this one?! I don't think so, let me purchase it. Now to double click and learn it......FUCK!!".
---
When I tried to defend my workshop, whoever dies loses caps. Everything time you engage in PvP whether in a  workshop or not, the loser pays caps to the winner. If you do revenge, the reward is higher. Anyway I ended up losing at least 100 caps if not more defending it. Lesson learned since I don't care of pvp, let them have your workshop and go find another server or workshop, not worth losing caps.
---
Here's the thing. I believe you did this. Only I also think that you just don't know what items give springs, gears and screws. Nor do you seem to know how to find good locations for that. 
---
Armor and weapons never give any of those. So why you were collecting those I have no idea. Here's a tip. The junk in this game is placed with thought. Things like typewriters, office fans, hotplates, clipboards are all things that give those three items. Note, Battered clipboards give springs, just clipboards give gears or screws. Go to any office building, medical center, and you will find lots of these. Especially if the buildings are seperate zones, because it will spawn all that stuff for you. 
---
I can do a 15 minute junk run, and get between 25-35 each of screws, gears and springs. 
---
You can't go AFK for three hours, you get booted after 30 minutes. Unless you are on a PC and using a hack, or rig up your console controller. And 3 hours wouldn't give you 300 of each of those. The junk extractors give you random junk, not just raw materials. And if you could get that much. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT? You don't even have to go AFK. you could do things close by, and when you get the notice to defend, you go back. You literally just made a statement how you can get what you need in 3 hours. So why aren't you doing that? 
---
Trying to use some logic like, I can build a fusion generator and not a spring isn't going to cut it. Sorry, you are trying to use some kind of logic to justify it. 
---
And FO4 was a single player game. When trading and junk are a valuable resource in a multi player game, then no having something that turns the most common resource into a uncommon resource, that isn't good for the game. 
---
Everything you said in your last response, just says to me. You play the game a certain way. And you haven't learned much about the world. Only about certain things, because that's your focus. Certain armor and certain weapons. 
---
If that's how you want play the game, that's your choice. And it seems your choice makes it harder for you to play the game. 
---
I say good day you to. 
---
Yuppers, I use to play a lot of d&amp;d back in the 90s and was a GM for D&amp;d, Mage and Gurps. So i like to create multiple characters for games like this, some of them evolved over me acquiring a legendary weapon or armor and then a build suddenly coming to mind.
---
1. Harley - Melee  Str/Lck Main that started with a barbwire baseball bat (luck)
---
2. Stinky Pete - a Stealthy bum that eats out of the trash and has(will have) all the "find more x" perks and as much sneaky skills as i can fit on one toon (agility)
---
3. Cooper - Male Face 01 looks like Bradly cooper hence the name and my first character that i had little clue about so hes a mess, gonna become my rifleman (Perception)
---
4. Money - This is my green haired snake oil man spec'd for max caps and team fun (charisma)
---
5. Heavy G - My heavy gun weapons build spec'd into explosives and heavy weapons (average stats)
---
6. Merchant - This is my 1st character on my 2nd account, this one is really only going ot be used for crafting i haven't leveled him up.
---
These are probably actually number 6-12 to be honest i remade my main (read 2nd+) toon at least 5 times because i didnt like the stats i started with or didnt like the face or the name and didnt know i could change the appearance at any time. Around the time i created Heavy i stopped giving them names because no one else would see them so i started naming them for that the character is used for so Heavy G is heavy guns &amp; Merchant is pretty self explanatory.
---
Harley is about 9 levels from complete, i keep getting perks i really dont need to complete my build on her.
---
All of the others are in progress, the remaining 4 slots shared on the the account merchant lives on will become mules when i get around to needing the storage space.
---
Feel free to add my main same name as here, my 2ndary i honestly have no clue what my GT is on it since its the default random one Ms assigned
---
Would this make me immune to scorchbeasts? Their attacks are explosive damage, right?
---
Okay except that if they handed you this entire game, but you were exploring Appalachia alone offline, it would feel almost entirely like the previous fallout games. So ya, you basically can. I've spent hours alone out there, and it plays pretty much just the like previous entries. Why you so butthurt about this?
---
Plans, serums, that perfect ledgendary deathclaw gauntlet. 
---
Why would that affect my heavy weapons though, I’m going to dig deeper tonight, remove all perks and see what happens.
---
Missiles are the worst! I always think I’m going to use them but I never do. I just keep hacking or shooting shit with my rifle. 
---
no reason it can't have both ;)
---
Guess I will hold onto the Gauss for sniping then, got a TSE Handmade that is comparable to TSE lever action I think. Thanks a lot for the feedback!! :)
---
I saw the other one, but I just learned of this one yesterday and it's really good: https://www.falloutmaps.com/#!/
---
They really need to buff boss xp and general XP gain.
---
People farmed the glowing ones at the golf club and in nuke zones, because it was the only "fast" way to level that didnt take and hour per level.
---
Also boss monsters like the scorched beast give barely more xp than two supermutants, so it feels completely unrewarding in combination with bad loot, to even try to kill them.
---
If I remember right you had to have a Bethesda account to play 76?
---
I dunno though, I logged in for the first time in October
---
The fusion generator in your camp makes fusion cores?
---
Caps are lost to every PvP death, it's just a thing that happens with it. Also, once somebody becomes hostile to you (such as attacking a workshop you own), they will no longer appear on your map. Same goes for if they seek revenge after they die. Workshop PvP is considered consensual, so no bounties are applied. 
---
If you're a high level wanting to change your play style, resetting your character and starting with nothing all over again is quite irritating.
---
Can it you evil no good anti American CO M MIE 
---
I have too many power cores. I almost only use my PA and with the perk card that increases the duration of power cores and usage when sprinting in PA I go through them sooooo slowly.
---
**Armor:** *Addressed several issues that would prevent players from exiting power armor and at times cause the Pip-Boy to become unavailable.*
---
I believe this issue was fixed after all, unless I misunderstood the description?
---
I just encountered this bug again: https://i.imgur.com/76nx6WT.png
---
No real change to broken pvp i see
---
Hardened lever action is gonna do a lot more damage per shot than a handmade, but with less ammo capacity
---
The sad part is we are so happy and appreciative of the change that took how long and all they had to do was add two zeros...
---
I find it hilarious how you people cannot let others have fun if you cannot have fun.
---
Instead of the -50 carry weight as the negative, the player should become the president of the USA. (this is not a political joke, its a tasteless joke on anatomy)
---
Yeah, there is very little point to pacifist mode when other players can still kill you really easy. 
---
My wife and I helped some guys during a whitespring nukeing, only to immediately have them turn around and kill both of us for our hardened masses (since that's all we had on us at the point)
---
Kinda makes me nervous about running into other groups now.
---
legendary Pitchforks are already a thing... wow no respect
---
or maybe you just don't understand the mechanics but ok.
---
If you like your location and building, don't move CAMP when it says it was removed.  Server hop until it's in your prized spot.
---
You rebuilding multiple times?  That's your own fault.
---
Please stop.
---
Xbox Elite controller
---
What do you do as a melee? sit there and hack at things, it's just the way she goes. Being one or two shotted by anything shouldn't be a thing though, pvp is broken, sentinel armor included
---
Was it a random spawn location?
---
If you’re saying he had over a 250 bounty, then he only had 60 caps on him.  That’s one of the complaints/workarounds people can use to screw over others on pvp rewards.
---
ik lol it's more of a novelty gun than a everyday carry but it's cool af 
---
Had no idea overdrive was broken but that’s gonna make my build even stronger than I thought it was. Also seeing some very nice changes such as plasma weapon hit registration fixes and lever action rifle fix. This will be quite a fun update.
---
Yesss.  That one is definitely on my top 5 list of power armor designs.  Good choice! 
---
Armor ignoring damage is multiplicative not additive. You end up ignoring \~87% of armor with max Incisor + Anti Armor. Also, not sure on this, but I believe a similar concept applies to Swing Speed. 
---
I do to. 
---
However, I don't ever expect to hear from Bethesda about if they are, have or what they do. I don't expect them ever to give numbers or anything.
---
It's a legal issue, and regardless of what people may think, I'd rather they not take chances.
---
Thunder mountain from frequently breaks due to mobs spawning under the concrete. Yet no mention in the patch notes. 
---
Thank you Kanye, very cool!
---
There is a buffer overflow on quality based weapons.
---
They were coded to only ever support 254 stacked together. When you exceeded that, the server was unable to process the code and you were disconnected WITHOUT saving your character. 
---
This is called a rollback dupe. The last save prior to possessing the code breaking amount of a single weapon.
---
Because it was hard coded in, they fixed the dupe method by:
---
 - Making it impossible for players to craft a consecutive amount of similar quality weapons stacking in inventories into the code breaking number.
---
This was a restriction placed on the crafting table. Dupers responded by dropping 250, crafting 50 more, and then initiating the code breaking limit.
---
 - They then made it so, you couldn't pick them up if you already possessed some of the stack and it would exceed the limits of the code breaking overflow.
---
This was a restriction placed on the players inventory preventing a pickup that would combine into a number past allowed. Players discovered, they could drop 250 weapons, craft 50 more, and drop 50 more and they would combine in the paperbag. They then picked up the 300 weapons to again initiate the overflow and rolling back their character.
---
 - Bethesda has fixed it again &lt;- You are here.
---
It is unknown if they fixed the code, or if they once again put another roadblock up. 
---
Exactly, this fix doesn't actually change any of the methods for nuking and farming xp, it just makes it go much slower and thus makes everyone unhappy
---
\*hears character wheeze in exhaustion, hears equipment unequip, hears tons of junk rattle around
---
Ah yes, the sound of disconnecting from a world.
---
lol. you must really love to break lockpicks if that was the biggest upside. 
---
damn, I just sold an explosive combat rifle because I didn't want to use an explosive gun for my "CQC" weapon (and already have an explosive for long range) :(
---
No idea. I wouldn't be surprised considering the shotgun perks were affecting a grenade launcher lol so who knows
---
300ish, just bought one the other day
---
where did you find them - Watoga?
---
I give it a day before another dupe glitch is found.
---
What about the gatling laser/plasma rounds bug? every time you withdraw them number of rounds = number of cores.
---
Also not to mention unlootable goo/ash corpses...
---
These two made me through out all the cores I have and just stop using them. These two bug me even more than them breaking so rapidly.
---
acid.  no question.
---
Perks are apart of the game to not count them in is not a fair analysis to base your argument on. My buddy with melee still beats me out in damage with full perk load out on both sides. Melee has more perks available to increase raw damage than lets say a rifle build.
---
That’s what I thought as well, I know I have an account. Bethesda just won’t send me any links to reset it or even figure out the username, because of Xbox they never ask for a username just email, at least of FO4. And I’ve already made a new account and managed to use the SAME username and still I didn’t get any new emails about my new account or anything lol. Starting to see that Bethesda is turning into a big joke at this point. Nothing they try to do works. 
---
Look it has never happened to me not once, I have had hundreds of mods on me I have shown pics of my mods on me, I have shown vids of me with said mods and 0 steel on my person and not once lose a mod. 
---
So no video evidence and replicable I think it is just dumb people doing stupid shit and trying to place blame elsewhere. Until there is proof otherwise. 
---
agreed. I feel like Bethesda should just go through and delete duplicated items. If a player has more than 1 of a legendary weapon with two shot or explosive its obviously a dupe since those items are extremely rare. Just go through and change the count to 1 for these type of weapons.
---
Whaaaaat? oh man
---
Actually you’de be surprised I’m in 3 Facebook communities and 2 discord communities and they’re all about two shot explosives. Duper’s frequent that area and sell them for 750 caps.
---
Just use different versions of chems to stack the effects i.e. psycho, buffount, bufftats, psychotats, etc.
---
Oh, my feelings! Better take a stim for that burn lol
---
I side with you but I seriously doubt it. I’d rather them nerf the crazy damn it puts out
---
Is there a plan to rectify the "Early Warnings" quest bug? It's stopping friends from completing the main quest line and the ability to help launch nukes. Every ticket opened claims support can't help and it's disheartening the issue hasn't been addressed yet. 
---
Short for cartoon. Early in WoW their were complaints the character models looked like cartoons. People were too lazy to type cartoon &amp; just started calling them "toons".
---
in the love action trailer, one seen shows a sign saying "Friends welcome". I would love to get my virtual hands on that
---
Not too mention go on eBay and stop the real world transactions for said duped items
---
I'm not convinced duping caused my server disconnects. I would get an odd lag storm when I suspected someone was duping, but never disconnected. I know server disconnects helped duping.
---
I'll tell you what I'm pretty sure was a cause of server disconnects. Owning a workshop. I could fast travel around a ton (like when I'm visiting all the vendors), do a scorch queen, all the things without a random server disconnect. But... As soon as I owned a workshop, it was a death sentence (guaranteed disconnect) especially if I fast travelled. I could probably only do a maximum of 3 fast travels before being disconnected while owning a workshop.
---
I thought that was a general "Whenever something like this is found out in a MMO, it lasts 20 minutes" kinda ordeal.
---
Edit to include: Made it more clear - I meant this to reference that this happens on most the MMO's where these exploits occur... People always looking for it.
---
Just break apart the blueprints and use the pieces to rebuild. 
---
Yeah, and since nobody wants to spend most of their time trying to organize their perk cards, there should just be a respec system, like OP suggests.
---
with the right legendary armor, mods, perks, chems, and food I can take a shot from and explosive dragon to the face and only lose AP, unless someone has a steady stream of explosive LMG bullets that all hit, I can usually kill them before they kill me
---
two sets of MIRV I had it tried it gave it to a friend I hate the fatman.
---
You get a popup when your camp is removed saying that someone else is there, and if you relog it can pop up again.
---
Blueprints have been buggy when re-placing complex structures
---
Yeah, I noticed this too. I got rid of my picklock perks in favor of other perks and it's too cumbersome to switch them out when I need to pick a lock. So I only pick level 0 locks anymore.
---
Maybe I'll spend a lock pick session and just go around picking everything.
---
All it takes is one swift kill though after starting the workshop takeover to get a random grab bag of junk and a decent cap payout.  Lot of players seem to not be on guard at all despite being in pvp zones.  I got a ton of ballistic fiber and different stable flux today from such.    
---
I'm guessing it is related to the patch for PC today.
---
I was trying to avoid this way, but i guess i didn't have any other choices 
---
They are duped.  They should turn into bubble pipes. 500 caps is nothing to lose. 
---
Lol. Because frequent full server crashes, inability to complete end game due to crashes in nuke zones, the disappearance of camps without refund of mats, duplications, infinite xp, invincible players, workshop claiming being useless due to constant disconnects, bugged quests that cant be completed, bugs locking you in PA unable to use workbenches, and weapons healing enemies are all invalid conplaints...  
---
I had a similar experience, it may be a random encounter type thing. The other day I was chilling at Vantage, above whitesprings, and bumped into a dog as well. Totally friendly, wearing a collar, all that. It came up to me as if to say hi, but was immediately draxxed by a charging feral ghoul that came out of seemingly nowhere. RIP ProtoDogmeat
---
See I figured it would go
---
Code Guy-"So I fixed the duping. It's ready for intigration"
---
Community Manager-"Lets get some good karma with the people complaining about dupers....here do this"
---
Duper-"Wonder if they fixed the duping glitch, probably not, stupid Bethesda...wait why did I disconnect and can't rejoin"
---
Community Manager 24 hours later-"And you will be glad to see that the duping glitch has been fixed along with a 30 day gamer tag suspension for those that attempted it post patch. Unfortunately we can't do anything about the items already out there, but we thought this would at least punish those attempting it"
---
And of course the power armor paint will just be for the usual 4 PA. Still waiting on ultracite or excavator PA skins lol
---
“The Power Armor light as been made brighter” 
---
When should I see this affect the T-51 power armor helmet that came with my collectors edition? Granted I got the PS4 version so I may still have to wait!
---
&gt; In non nuked WS a three star usually drops a three star weapon. 
---
That's all placebo, nuked/non-nuked doesn't matter, still get tons of 1* drops off those 3* enemies either way. And non-nuked you're far more likely to get an underleveled legendary which defeats the purpose of trying to farm for only the very best gear in the first place.
---
What is this game? 
---
you may have to move the camp to reset.
---
What a good boy. 
---
Is there going to be a patch that makes this game good?
---
I feel so bad when I do this. I actually got a TSE pump from some 170 guy that had 3 and was just being nice. When to white spring during nuke and obliterated everything before anyone could get to it. Started just waiting back for people to start swinging and shooting them down. At least then we all have fun lol
---
This happened to me recently. I moved to several different locations and nothing. I forget what option I pressed, but it stored all my camp pieces and I had to rebuild the whole thing from scratch.
---
How much def are we talking? I just sat in front of a wall with , power armor, a explosive shotty, max fire proof, and it still nearly ko'd me
---
I'd be okay with a free respec system, but not one that charged Atoms (or worse, real money).
---
To be upfront, I'd prefer a complete redesign of the entire system. There are a ton of situationally-specific cards that should be passives, for example (like dromedary and lockpicking).
---
Cause randoms being randoms and I don’t have  a team - the one time I nuked the prime was the only time the queen lived - wasn’t even close.  And I don’t know where people are getting these super weapons from but I don’t have anything really strong - All Rise and a Furious Gatling is my basic Queen set.
---
Guys, ignore this /u/JesMaine cat. All he does is dump on FO76, it’s legitimately mystifying why he still trolls this sub.
---
A week or so ago he was claiming that only a “couple thousand” people are currently playing FO76 and that Bethesda’s server costs were just a few thousand $ a month. Lol.
---
Most of the negativity about this game is coming from an extremely vocal minority, pay attention to their usernames and you’ll recognize the same people spouting the same nonsense.
---
You can still one shot anyone who doesn't shoot you due to exploit regardless whether its TSE or not.
---
Had one of those for a while. It’s amusing, but almost completely useless in PVP unless you are cool with suicide to kill whoever is attacking you. I ended up selling mine to a vendor in the end (the weight of the mini nukes is nuts). Best actual use I found for it was turning on pacifist mode and nuking mobs during SBQ event. 
---
My character should have a logout scripted voiceover where the equipment unequips, followed by a 20s expletive scream before loading out to the main menu. 
---
Ok man. What I meant is people involved in fo76 communities outside of the actual game.
---
To be honest,the more awesome the CAMP is the more I avoid it. Could be one of those high level players that is like " Mine ! This is mine! Stay out or else! "'
---
No, because I am playing the game at least. They are mostly not.
---
It is overpowered God status to compare level 50 with level 100 or 200.
---
Just run through the bos campsin the bog. I usually get 30 fibre each time and with the armor repair perks i only use 2-4 per repair.
---
&gt;anyone that liked NV when it first came out and now have switched sides
---
How do you keep track of people? Isn't it way more reasonably to assume that the people that were pissed off have left long ago and therefore just the ones that are fine with the direction are left?
---
They are probably just on NMA now, where most fans of the original fallouts reside.
---
Are you using gunsmith? That does affect energy weapons too. Although I admit, they still break faster than ballistic. My two shot plasma rifle breaks very fast and does ridiculously low damage for two shot. Only the tesla rifle seems to take a long time to break.
---
Someone took the desk fan for screws so.... back to unstable?
---
??
---
For repair purposes - I run just T-60. 
---
I also use repair and durability perks. Cant remember the last time I repaired.
---
Nah.
---
People still play this game?
---
I prefer my Instigating MIRV.
---
I follow every shot with a quiet "Aaand boom goes the dynamite" as whatever poor soul I was aiming towards erupts in glorious radfire.
---
It took me like a half an hour to talk someone into killing me, I gave them ammo and everything. They shot me once and waited for 5 minutes. IT TOOK FOREVER! 
---
Yes, though the fastest way to get fusion cores is line in the sand you get 2 100% cores for each completion. Keeps me well stocked without the nerfed worry on consoles, we will see next week though.
---
Potentially. From what I can tell there's two potential reasons. The pessimistic view is that some commotion over at Sugar Grove from some other players caused a mongrel to get loose and find me. I am kind of close to the location, though I am beyond the border and on the literal road. I have only ever seen bots and mole rats around Sugar Grove.
---
If it's a "triggered" spawn location, from what running around I've done on another server, there seems to be a spawn area just to the south of me. When I ran that direction I saw the typical group of them spawn at once. Going to look around a bit more, then maybe play with that area. I felt like he snuck up on me from behind, which was from the North.
---
This show is good though so I was pretty distracted.
---
This.  The weapon version of the perk NEVER works but rank 2 Lucky Break seems to fire enough that repairing my armor is not something I do frequently.
---
To help clarify things a bit more; When you claim a Public Workshop the game automatically puts you in PVP mode, and does not always set you back to Pacifist after your claim has ended.
---
Being Wanted also puts you in a PVP mode, but if you are in Pacifist mode you can till do very little damage to even a Wanted player,
---
I have seen this 1st hand at both Public workshops, and with friends that have accidentally damaged a CAMP and become Wanted, I could not do any significant Damage to them using a 500+ Damage weapon, without enabling PVP, but after enabling it I could quickly Kill them with a lower (100 Damage) level weapon.
---
Is it labeled marine ? Can I buy one 
---
Why? There is no economy. There is no impact to anything when duplications are made in this game because it has nothing. With a straight face can you tell me what duping impacts players with? Because it seems you forgot it in your OP. 
---
does it reload 20 Bullets?
---
got a quad Double Barrel and it only load 2 shells for 4 shells
---
You must be new here, in the 24 hours there would already be a mob ready to march on Bethesda HQ crying for justice.
---
It’s a baseball game.  MLB the show.  Horrible launches the last two years.  The ‘76 is taking a potshot at FO76 less than good launch.   
---
for £9 you cant go wrong...its nine quid.
---
And I just sold a 3* two shot gauss yesterday because it only tickled super mutants before. FML.
---
My melee build at level 55 is at base 900 per hit x2 for max hp, does more with adreline and nerd rage.  Pretty sure that's enough to 1 hit most level 55s.
---
Ya boi here doesn't use TSE weapons because fuck duped guns, but I am very fond of my 90% lighter/Instigating missile launcher, and am pleased to hear i can use the lad indoors now with a minor perk investment.
---
My long recon scope zooms in too much i am having trouble getting head shots or hitting moving targets sucks shoulda left it how it was
---
How this then: the bounty shown is the cost that player has built up.  They will loose up to whatever amount that number is, and you will receive half that as your reward.  When you show up and see them in person, it shows you your reward, not their penalty.  In your example, it sounds like they were still blowing up someone’s base while you were loading in, upping their PENALTY to 700, hence the 350 reward.  You got 150 because that’s all they had on them.  Same setup/explanation for your &gt;250, 60 caps received example.
---
There is a percentage with Wanted, and it’s 50%.  You just found people with less caps than that
---
maybe they made her immune to duped weapons
---
We're just fuckin' around. It isn't anything. Bethesda made a typo referring to ballistic fiber as anti ballistic fiber so we're busting their balls a bit.
---
Found the duper. There's no economy because of the inflation created by cheaters. It's pretty basic dude. 
---
It's honestly ruining my day right now and I NEED it to come back :(
---
Its just the lead in the ink. No worries.
---
How about a fat man blast? Can you just launch it at your feet with no repercussions?
---
yea, but if you wasted a lot of real life canadian dolars on a TSE you would also be salty that your toy got nerfed.
---
fair or not fair, some posts would be made to nerf other stuff too
---
^/s
---
Dude same and the one with explosive ammo weapons not doing damage is being fix now I feel like going back to fallout 76
---
True 
---
After firing the steel doesn’t shrink back to original diameter the way brass does causing the casing to be stuck in the chamber or breach. 
---
Well...you tried, bless your heart...
---
ill take whatever one you dont want. still waiting for my first TSE
---
Had a bloatfly spawn underground and kept peppering me with shots.  No way to kill it.  I finally just outran it.
---
Duper’s will try it anyway due to it being the way they are. Even if Bethesda say “it’s fixed” people will still try it. So it makes no difference in that respect. However, while the “code guy” is making and testing fixes the community will get more irate about nothing being done. 
---
Awww that would be incredible. I mean the game isn’t that dark but I’d love it 
---
If you're on PC and your mic doesn't work take a look at what sample rate/bit rate (google it) Windows has your mic set to use.
---
Some games will not work with certain sample rates and adjusting it may solve your issue.
---
And it would be nice to discuss a game we play sans all the negative assholes repeating the same shit.
---
Remember when gamers played games and shared insights?
---
Just thought there must be a reason it's 9 quid 2 months after release. GTA is still 10-15 after 6 years
---
I mean don’t get me wrong I love them fixing the game but durability for all guns should be increased.
---
Good point. They’d try either way
---
It reminds me of the old Sony Star Wars MMO. I did a quest for Darth Vader and he  gave me shoes.
---
sweet! go ahead and add me. GT: SonicRun83
---
Well I am lvl 115 so far but friendly.

While staring at the corpse I was literally thinking "what if this was my dog I left behind that got irradiated. it finally found me, it knew it had to look, but was too rad-blind to not get aggressive with me. I could've reminded him what a good girl she was."
---
I'm a broken man.
---
At least on Xbox, you don't need to request them or anything, you just go into their profile and join game. Not sure about other platforms.
---
Second is always a possibility, that's why I try to remember 3 or 4.
---
I wish I could upvote this a thousand times. I can think of literally no reason why--even in the game's canon--a gigantic minigun should weigh the same as a hunting rifle. Furthermore, they gave weight-reduction buffs to literally EVERY OTHER WEAPON TYPE IN THE GAME except rifles.
---
The lack of text chat is an issue :(
---
I didn't even know there was a setting for that. Maybe that's why I have never heard a voice chat since playing. Is it defaulted to off?
---
Well, I can see it on mobile.
---
Well you see I divested my portfolio and took strong positions with Orville Reddenbacher (NYSE:OBP) and also Ace Hardware (NYSE:AHD) I feel I am prepared to profit handedly from either the mob buying all the pitchforks, and also those sitting back and watching.
---
But another person posted, saying you fixed the dupe isn't going to prevent them from at least trying it. Maybe "We fixed the dupe, we dare you to try it now"
---
When I launched at Morgantown the other night, there were a good group of low level players there (5-10).  It was hilarious watching them scatter.
---
Lol nice story, but the quote at the end sealed it. Good on you bud. 
---
I've noticed that because you're holding space to initiate, once the trade is started, the game registers the space bar too soon and auto selects the first item in your inventory and prompts you for a price.
---
Similar issue when sending a team invite while wearing power armor: hold E to send the invite and then as soon as the invite is sent, you hop out of your armor.
---
What's wrong with their launches?  I think it's been at least 3 years since I bought
---
I have one of those.  It’s sitting in my stash fully modded but I will never use it lol.
---
Also we don't tolerate those damn ~~synths~~ dupers. It's not natural I tell you. They'll be the downfall of us all.
---
I dont see the note where it says the game becomes good?
---
lol. Well what is it showing on yur end? 
---
Got her down to where she regened and lagged until disconnected. It wasn't even that crazy of a fight. 
---
 I put in the effort to find out, so too can others. 
---
Its got nothing to do with shooting them actually.
---
So you're speculating to try and make your incorrect statement sound right?  
---
t51b having best starting stats means it'll still have the best stats with perks

Early Warnings. I have the broken uplink, but I cannot fix it. I keep getting a message that I lack the materials even though I have everything.
---
I'd settle for "We fixed the duping, lets move on."
---
The people with 10000000000 weight is the actual problem that destabilizing the game server. I suggest to give a deadline to people with more than 600 stash weight to clean it up, or loose everything above 600 limit. If every time after logging out, anything beyond 600 will be gone, no body will even care to use exploit to increase it. My un-matured 2c.
---
well i mean my art teachers brother working for bethesda, yeah i guess it was followed with more of a story, but haha yeah it is quite cool. 
---
First of all thats your 3rd xp nerf, wtf, its already hard to earn xp, your taking away the only end game. Also goodluck this time patching the dupe glitch we all know youll need it
---
What do you use hardened mass for? I’ve been selling them! 
---
You haven't played the game, you have already decided it's bad, yet you are on that game's subreddit, talking shit...? you need to take a seriously honest look at your life because this is beyond pitiful. Why don't you go find a hobby, or some friends? Maybe go do something meaningful with your life, or at least something you enjoy!
---
Maybe I’m just vindictive 
---
Wow so still not going to fix invisible team mates???? Seriously??

I'm actually messing around with Vivox to see if maybe it's a firewall issue. I legitimately have no idea why my microphone doesn't work in this game. It isn't a fancy mic, it doesn't require drivers -- it's just a normal plug &amp; play mic that goes right into my microphone jack (it isn't a USB headset or anything).
---
It's the Default Device / Default Communication Device. It works perfectly with every other game / application. But it's never worked with FO76 (not that I really care; I don't have much to say because I'm soloing 99% of the time).
---
For what it's worth:
---
The sample rate / bit rate is standard (16 bit / 44.1 Hz)
---
And both boxes for Exclusive Mode are checked off. I'm hoping installing Vivox's "Overtone" software will fix it, because I haven't found any reliable guides on getting the mic to work. When I submitted a ticket to Bethesda they told me to update my drivers lol.
---
Unarmed has fallen off a cliff?  It's the hardest hitting melee build out there.  If you bring 3 low hp/high rad unarmed dudes properly geared they can each be doing 5-10% of the SBQs health... per swing.  
---
it's pretty nice, though i've been struggling to figure out what kinda build/play style i want to go with. My main is a non-pa rifle for day to day, and pa melee for nukes/SB/queen stuff. I'm leaning towards a light armor pistols with a TON of AP and VATS crit stuff. 
---
haha, i literally just vendored a bunch of 2\* and 3\* weapons that were'nt drawing much attention over on the bazaar/market subs. I probably have some other stuff laying around though if you ever wanna check it out. 
---
Ah, holding it makes sense too. And yes, getting out of PA after inviting someone is annoying. 
---
Actually, inviting someone when just trying to get out of PA is more annoying. Right up there with opening the Loot All menu when just trying to reload. 
---
These keybinds suck balls.
---
You mean the one that goes from mole miner country to the outskirts of Watoga? Certainly wasn't that high density the few times I've been through there. Definitely not nearly as many ghoul bodies you can pile up at the golf club through the usual method of getting a buddy or two to manually reset the spawns after you've cleared out the initial spawns to help them power level faster.
---
Whats 9Q in US?
---
They went big into the online play and ultimate team modes in 2016.  It gained a ton of popularity.  17 was literally unplayable for weeks.  Servers constantly down.  Not crashing and disconnecting you, but down all together.   18 the servers were better but gameplay was horrendous at start.  9 months later there are still gameplay issues.
---
What perk is that for heavy weapons. I cant find it
---
This reddit doesn't allow you to imbed images into the post, just posting the link is fine
---
I’m one of those over-encumbered guys. 
---
No, the ones in the world that look like the one you can build in your CAMP.
---
Think of them like tato plants but with fusion cores, except I'm pretty sure the fusion cores grow back faster than a tato does.
---
This: https://cdn2-www.gamerevolution.com/assets/uploads/2018/11/fallout-76-fusion-cores.jpg
---
The one in the picture had a fusion core plucked out of it by a player.
---
It *is* for everyone. But if you own FO76 on console you have to install the games on a PC since the games never came out for current gen consoles. Just download the bethesda launcher, log into the same bethesda.net account that your console is tied to, and they will be there ready to download. 
---
Just happened to my buddy during Line in the Sand. 
---
Sorry! Put it in the wrong subreddit..
---
Oh for 9 bucks yea not for $119
---
Does Rank 2 of Science Master help?
---
Bethesda clearly doesn’t give a shit about this. I’ve reported numerous people to Bethesda and provided detailed screenshots of their inventories, and Bethesda’s response is to “block the player and not engage them in any way”.
---
What trash. Hopefully Bethesda does the right thing and bans them completely or adjusts their inventories.
---
You’ll know who the dupers are by the cunts screaming the loudest about losing their gear.
---
Oh, I was just busting your balls about your camp a bit. The image link shows fine though the text link didn't work out as it should.
---
Well I think magazines are kinda useless imo.
---
Seems he really got into your head and took up residence there.
---
it won't as rad resist is not increased by anything except maybe perk cards 
---
im not speculating anything i got x01 ultracite t-60 t-51b all at level 50 x01 is the best by far 
---
you underestimate the importance of rad resistance in blast zones and in general 
---
Level 70. But would love to see some pics of yur place when ya get time.
---
Ya...to the atom store for like $10 worth of atom lol
---
***Make sure you only do the below for stuff you don’t mind losing***
---
First move both your main and mule character to the same place with access to a world container.  Then log in to your main on a server with someone on your friends list.  Drop everything you want to transfer into a world container.  Log out.  Log in to your alt / mule to the server with your friend.  Pick up everything from the world container.  Log back to your main and move freely.
---
Take workshops, its a big part of what they are there for.
---
Most of the perks which would benefit it are things like +10% damage, which on its own isn't that noticeable. You'd have to get probably 6 perks worth and do an A/B test against the same type of enemy with and without perks equipped if you wanted an observable difference.
---
I keep seeing these stories but in my 300+ hours I've only encountered nice, chill folks
---
Fallout 4 wasn’t a multiplayer game, big difference that alot of people don’t understand.
---
And the funny thing is, even with it being that broken and problematic, it's still so fun that it's worth playing in spite of that. That shows how good the game is itself.
---
It's not that it drops to "normal" power armor levels, it's that Excavator is bugged and gives you double the bonus (200lbs) if you log in while wearing it. 
---
I don't know if you're trolling, confused, or just have very different preferences in armor than I do. Marine is objectively outclassed in every individual aspect by another set so I assume you must be looking for a balanced set. Personally I preferred BoS Heavy Combat Armor for a balanced set since the rad resist isn't enough to help in a significant way in my opinion and it is higher on both other resistances.
---
This is one of those pull my finger jokes ...
---
This just isn't possible, list your perks for base 900 damage. I have them all so I can test it out 
---
Yay!
---
- my lever action rifle will not be so infuriating to use.
---
- I’ll now use my gauss rifle anyway probably, depends what the damage is now that rifle perks apply.
---
- I could even use a hunting rifle again now that it can be legendary.
---
- duping exploit is probably a step harder now (I’m not holding out any hope it’s fixed properly.
---
).
---
- the issue where VATS flicks in and out non-stop until you kill the enemy that triggered the bug (or almost indefinitely if you’re lot able to) is not addressed :(
---
- Nothing said about addressing already duped items 
---
Ah that explains, thank you
---
They said they were going to see how it affected the performance but dupers are messing up the performance so they can't tell how it will perform. THANKS DUPES
---
I craft n sell power armor and power armor mods. I max my caps out daily and end up having to give em away to friends in order to fill the next days orders. Have had to stop posting my services because there's almost nothing for me to buy. 
---
yea they need to fix group looting system.
---
In the past week or so this sub has went to extreme hate against any criticism against this game. Wonder what changed. 
---
Steel doesnt expand the way btass does to begin with which is the main reason steel casing is not commonly adopted, consideribg it is lighter, cheaper and more robust. One of the main shortcomings is that it does not expand and hence does not provide anything in terms of gas seal in the chamber. Also how exactly are brass casings supposed to shrink again? In fact i. some high powered revolvers you have the real problem of the brass casings expanding too much and hence require a manual extractor to push them out of the cylinder.
---
I think people don’t realize that prior to this update crafting armour didn’t require ANY ballistic fibre, only repairing it did. Now it is required for crafting and repair (although yes, less now for repair).  It makes sense to need ballistic fibre for both but it’s a limited resource.
---
Everytime lowbies come out I have never downed the queen in the alloted time. Thats what we are reffering to. The DR scaling is too much.
---
I speak the truth and get downvoted for it lmao. &lt;3 reddit.
---
Haha yeah, it's been a while since I encountered a stereotypical toxic neckbeard in an online game. It's nice to know that people like him are still keeping the stereotype alive. I found it pretty hilarious and thought I'd share the story while it was still fresh in my mind.
---
That's a good point. I've found in close quarters (in building) melee has advantage. In open areas TSE has advantage. I personally think both should be nerfed. To each his own
---
I thought everyone could loot enemies as long as they hit it at least once. If not you don't even see what it drops.
---
Gonna try this. Wow THANK YOU (if this works!). 
---
&gt; but they're known to cause cancer in the state of California.
---
What isn't? Besides, we're in West Virginia where Black Lung is just a fact of life!
---
Cryolator is where it's at if you want all that sizzling death to enemies in an affordable debuff stacking package. :-)
---
I don't think so. In general, not an awful lot of people are talking, though.
---
It is worth noting that the default settings are "auto" which will broadcast to and receive from people in the immediate area - *unless* you're on a team. In which case, you'll only send/receive with your teammates.
---
&gt;  Isn't it way more reasonably to assume that the people that were pissed off have left ...
---
If only the people of the internet were that easy to understand...
---
Can we please be able to remap hold breath from left alt when scoped in! Its so awkward to the point where I don’t use scopes anymore because of it!
---
When it can be used in power armor, let me know, otherwise it's just an inferior version of melee with fewer options, not really fitting its legacy from previous games.
---
I had gotten past this point in the quest line and searched by PO Box but left the quest for a week and it had me start from before this point, now it's showing no PO Box lookup at all.  This is a fantastic bug. 😒
---
&gt; 'm a team-crafting build. High Cha (15) and Int (10). Most of the other stuff is 5.
---
5 Str, Per, Agi, and Luck sounds like playing on masochism mode.
---
Assaultrons
---
oooh, my bad...that's what I get for skimming
---
Would be hilarious
---
&gt;Here's the thing. I believe you did this. Only I also think that you just don't know what items give springs, gears and screws.  
---
They are tagged for search, also, I didnt state it but I wasnt actually out looking for these resources, just as I became over encumbered I decided to just pick everything up cus I was walking back to my camp at that point anyway so why not just have everything.  
---
&gt; Nor do you seem to know how to find good locations for that.  
---
I mentioned sugar grove just before and you decided that I'm just reading other people so I have no way to prove this to you, I dont really tend to farm areas either as that boring  
---
&gt;Armor and weapons never give any of those. So why you were collecting those I have no idea.  
---
I was just picking up everything by this point, also so I could scrap them for possible plans.  
---
&gt;Here's a tip. The junk in this game is placed with thought. Things like typewriters, office fans, hotplates, clipboards are all things that give those three items. Note, Battered clipboards give springs, just clipboards give gears or screws. Go to any office building, medical center, and you will find lots of these. Especially if the buildings are seperate zones, because it will spawn all that stuff for you.  
---
This I already knew but it is good advice for anyone that doesnt know this  
---
&gt;I can do a 15 minute junk run, and get between 25-35 each of screws, gears and springs.  
---
So can I, but that requires going on a junk run which takes time and resources, and also making sure no-one else has been through that area and picked up all the stuff you are after.  
---
&gt;You can't go AFK for three hours, you get booted after 30 minutes.  
---
Sort of true, you can also come back every 20 mins or so and simple push a button to make the game thing you are active, so just take 1 step forward.  
---
&gt;Unless you are on a PC and using a hack, or rig up your console controller.   
---
See Above  
---
&gt;And 3 hours wouldn't give you 300 of each of those.  
---
I was guessing based on what I was getting from my last base, it probably isnt 300 but it is a damn lot.  
---
&gt;The junk extractors give you random junk, not just raw materials.
---
No, they give raw materials, I have had my base on a junk extractor for weeks and it has always given raw materials  
---
&gt;And if you could get that much. WHY DON'T YOU DO THAT? You don't even have to go AFK. you could do things close by, and when you get the notice to defend, you go back. You literally just made a statement how you can get what you need in 3 hours. So why aren't you doing that?  
---
Because I have had my camp on a junk extractor for weeks, you cant spend all your time at your camp or nearby, and I wanted to move my camp since the top of the world gets a bit stagnant after 4 weeks of being there.  
---
&gt;Trying to use some logic like, I can build a fusion generator and not a spring isn't going to cut it. Sorry, you are trying to use some kind of logic to justify it.  
---
It makes a lot more of an argument then saying "no because you can get it elsewhere"  
---
Well you can get steel elsewhere too, you can use workbenches elsewhere, you can use beds elsewhere you can get literally everything a CAP offers you elsewhere but you build a CAMP because its nice to not have to go elsewhere.  
---
&gt;And FO4 was a single player game. When trading and junk are a valuable resource in a multi player game, then no having something that turns the most common resource into a uncommon resource, that isn't good for the game.  
---
Its simply changing the dynamic of the game, it just makes steel more valuable and these other resources slightly less valuable, why would you buy these resources anyway if you can collect them in 15 mins? because its convenient to buy them sometimes, I can go and collect steel elsewhere too but sometimes its just easier to buy it.  
---
&gt;Everything you said in your last response, just says to me. You play the game a certain way. And you haven't learned much about the world. Only about certain things, because that's your focus. Certain armor and certain weapons.  
---
This couldn't really be more wrong to be honest, I play the game for CAMP building, exploring, upgrading, helping out others (this is what drained my springs) and anything else I feel like doing, if by "certain weapons and armour" means more weapons than most people carry so I have something that uses every ammo type then yeah I guess It is certain weapons.  
---
&gt;If that's how you want play the game, that's your choice. And it seems your choice makes it harder for you to play the game.  
---
This doesnt really much much sense in the context, you want to play the game by having to go out and look for resources and fighting you way to them, I want to build a camp and have it as an option to make some basic resources, your way definitely looks a lot harder  
---
&gt;I say good day you to.
---
Well I hope you have a good day too even if you dont really mean it
---
So on imgur which share option should I use when posting pics here in Redditt?
---
I made a comment about this on the dev's update notes and I was informed by u/Denz3r that if he unequips one of the pieces of the PA while inside it and then re-equips the piece, the carry bonus kicks in. I haven't yet had a chance to try, but figured I'd share the tip.
---
Kind of my thinking
---
Condition of items affects damage also if I'm not mistaken. 
---
has happened to me several times as well (xbox), but then suddenly the next time everything is back to normal, seems random.
---
I use a Gauss TSA, it might have something to do with the number of players or other kinds of weapons, no ider..
---
"But exploits aren't cheating!". -every POS multiplayer cheater ever
---
Plasma flamethrower, shreds a scorched beast if it ever lands. The caveat it takes a painful amount of ammo and you better always keep the thing repaired to 200%.
---
Oh I agree that they should have a lump of coal coming their way from Santa, and a ban wouldn't be bad either.  Just not going to get to worked up over it as I am an advocate for personal responsibility and would rather just move past the whole thing since I am enjoying the game.
---
bc i'm at work and can't play at the moment, so i'm on the subreddit for it to find out everything i can. If you don't like the game, or plan on playing it, then wtf are you even on this subreddit? Is your life that meaningless that you have nothing better to do than to go somewhere you don't belong and aren't wanted to give your opinion that no one cares for? that is fucking sad...
---
You have to have faith that someday we'll all get legendary pope revolves. 
---
Interesting. I’ll have to give that a try. I’ve made a habit of wearing no non power armor, and just exiting it right before logging out. Pretty annoying. 
---
I have hundreds of the stuff and haven’t actively farmed it all.
---
White knight + fix it good + the perk that gives a chance for armour to repair when hit means I very rarely have to repair.
---
Also, you shouldn’t need to craft armour after a point (level 30ish maybe) anyway, just mod and repair legendaries 
---
It happened to me twice while in a nuke zone, having claimed no workshops on that map. One shot killed by explosive shotguns while in power armor and pacifist mode. I wonder if Bethesda will do anything about this :/
---
Something like this happened to me like a week ago too. About 8 lv 100+ with tses and shit, barely made a dent on her, eventually we all gave up and left.
---
scorchbeast attacks are energy
---
I don’t know, what I do know is that without weight reduction perks I’d have quit from being unable to carry hardly anything. Which of course makes those perks mandatory.
---
Just yesterday I opened my Pip-Boy before the game loaded my perks and my carry weight went from 700 something to ~250.
---
That has to be from all my Big Gun, aid and ammo for said guns. Which means I’d need at least 1,000 lbs in stash to have max options for my build just as the game exists if I didn’t have the weight perks.
---
What I also know is that the current limit is due to technical limitations, not game design. For all we know, Beth would make it unlimited given the choice.
---
just click copy on the main link they provide
---
I am not criticizing people that bring feedback. I am criticizing people that bitch on 76 because they don't like the game.
---
It would make sense to have people who can re-build to be part of the re-building team
---
I'm working with the spreadsheet OP posted so you tell me lol, marine with buttressed seems to give the most DR and there is a similar tooltip in-game that says it is "only outclassed by power armour". What set outclasses marine armour?
---
Yet somehow I got one shot in power armor by some people using death claw gauntlets. Sure thing bud
---
On legendaries, is there such thing as legendary scorched enemy? 
---
Last tim i did one a few weeks ago, 20 people an in the 30 min only did a quarter. They must be bugged occasionally. 
---
Meh Roses syringer is ten times more amusing for what you are describing.
---
Only crowned enemies aka legendaries although it's happened to me before on my first sbq run
---
One doesn't need a superior intellect to be smarter than fanboys. It's just like Idiocracy all over again.
---
Bound to find one eventually. Hard to resist dicking with him, I'd agree. Lol
---
Betheada was pandering to their powderpuff fanbase and created an aweful pvp system that favors whoever shoots second and constantly penalizes people for playing pvp. 
---
Yay. Gotta go grind caps so i can pvp more....
---
And a fix for the gatling gun sight, it’s still off to the side meaning you have to shoot in 3rd person lol. 
---
Well I have both, will have to check for myself. I do love the nuka cola paint
---
One shot is still broken
---

I've only heard of the one dog up on that ridge with those two skeletons. If that isn't this one. Interesting!!
---
The camp thing seems to work best people don't take to kindly to there roof being blown off ahah and last night i had a 2.5k bounty and it was amazing 
---
I didn't use them my opponent that fucking one shot me used them.
---
Also explain to me how a 500+ damage weapon ignoring damage resist with chem/mutation buffs can't fucking one shot someone?
---
If you didn't sell the .50 I'd like to trade with you!
---
I am playing 76 since launch and by myself only. As a single player, they don't affect me that much. Because I know once I buy/get a TSE weapon, the game will become no fun for me. Since game is not hard and 1 shot all the creatures means boring.
---
They accept rape culture an victim blaming posted to their pages to defend their games an the rapist they hired as community manager. The community manager who does hate speech&amp; is why my black little brother was killed. Who she also did hate speech etc to.
---
Meh.  I mean, yeah, energy weapons are poorly balanced, but they "work" and you can use them and be productive if you want without taking an unreasonable disadvantage.
---
If they're going to address balance, they really need to look at armor first.  It's just a disaster relative to the power armor that hangs on trees in this game, and it's actually gotten more gimped with the last patch (which requires ballistic fiber to craft as well as repair).
---
Haven't played in a while, have they STILL not fixed the bug with explosive weapons that makes it so you stop dealing damage completely and have to relog to fix it??
---
free would definitely be optimal, with a cooldown of sorts to prevent people from changing 10x per day. The only reason i mentioned atoms was that they aren't all that difficult to attain. I wouldnt expect it to cost something like 10,000, but somewhere around 500-1000 would seem feasible and not necessarily cause someone to spend real $ on it, unless they wanted. 
---
TOTALLY AGREE that the system could use revamping...spending 5 minute every time i swing through my camp or whitespring so i can get  my crafting/etc cards up is annoying. Almost as annoying as switching between my non-PA rifle build and my PA melee build...
---
yeah thats good, you can make a gallery on imgur as well with comments under pictures and link the gallery
---
I go for all bounties. Win or lose, I don't care 
---
Then I whisper sorry at them and pet their head.
---
Try using anti-armor perks and weapons, they're the most effective against the queen. Pop in some psychotats and they really fuck her up,

You having any issues staying logged in since the raid?

This will help dump all your holotapes and notes away it won’t let you ditch important ones
---
I’m on PS4 and I expect to see Whitesprings nuked and busy this whole weekend. 
---
Maybe create the ability to store caps in your stash and/or make PvP opt in?
---
They are nasty kids
---
it's a sorely needed nerf. PA is too good and it makes the game boring when the only viable strat for high-level PVP is PA.
---
You appear to be of the same mind as myself.  
---
What are you even responding to? 
---
Yes please titansdogma is my gr
---
who got into the qa room and how
---
Facts, I'm shocked people haven't really realized that 
---
Why do they keep referring to it as anti ballistic fiber? 
---
Considering the no npc and multiplayer criticisms still flying around it is more than just the state of bugs lmao
---
Right... but you took those perks for that explicit reason. If you really want to enjoy multiple play styles, you can create alternate characters. 
---
Agreed about setting up player shops tho. I wonder if there will be some kind of update where there will be an alternate STASH specifically for things you've marked for sale. Like, anything in the other box has to be for sale to other players. Setting price ranges would be the most difficult thing about that, I imagine plenty of people would just use it as an alternate STASH and set all their prices to the highest cap amount things can be sold for. 
---
You can take more than 1 workshop at a time, and if the resources are green that means you don't use any of your own. Depending on how much you build you can use none of your own resources if you choose to. Resources should be more difficult to get. Workshops are meant to be used, yet most of them are sitting unused. And it's passive resource gathering once set up. If you want more you can get active and farm mobs and buildings.
---
Cannot believe I wasted three levels on this. FFS

I'm not talking to your salty ass I'm asking Mr. 900 base damage to teach me his secrets 
---
I've an instigating one which I save purely for the people who build turret nests at the back of the gold club house.
---
Can confirm it's satisfying.
---
Sweet. Thank you so much ! 
---
Hmm maybe im in the minority but rare weapons/armor should be rare. My problem really is that rare mobs themselves are rare. unless you nuke whitesprings. They need to up the rate in which legendary cratures spawn .
---
Can ask you the same. I told you I was  one shot in power armor with high DR at a high level by people using melee weapons more than once and suddenly it never happened. Couldn't tell you what mutations/perks they used BECAUSE I WAS THE ONE BEING ONE SHOT. 
---
When you logged out in Power Armor ... when you logged back in the Fusion core would be full. 
---
You could put in a 1% Core and come back to a 100%.
---
Holy shit man I’m sorry. My game crashed a shit ton too. What do you play on? Console?
---
I've only defeated  one scorchbeast with help from one of those turrets and some random 100+ player. He and I both got to loot it.
---
No to all of this.
---
Maybe it's a bug?
---
Does it do all the time you want to play? 
---
It's all good. I definitely don't look forward to continuing the rebalance of moving a perk point, picking up perk card, min-maxing to an extent....but i'm also stubborn AF so at least it's my choice in the matter lol. thankfully, whitespring makes power leveling a little faster since i'm done with every quest (except launching a nuke). 
---
Does that mean you're immune to scorchbeast screech? It's explosive iirc
---
Uh... you're having trouble carrying them because **you put points in stuff other than weight reduction perks**, it's not like you just "have" a 1 STR, you chose that.  Hate to break it to you, but that behavior is called "exploiting a bug".  Your character is (was) more capable than it should have been.
---
Then why did you reply to me?
---
r/me_irl but without the bounty
---
Wat wdym "raid"?
---
Durability just isn’t fun in this game. It seems pointless on armour as armour seems to last forever, and weapons break as if they were made of plastic.
---
It should be the other way around. If you are getting shot at, your armour isn’t going to hold up for very long.
---
Meanwhile in real life, guns do not break every 500 rounds. You can fire tens of thousands of rounds through the lifetime of a gun. The only maintenance you need to do is disassemble clean and lube every so often.
---
They should remove durability damage from shooting guns or make it so minor you could shoot 50,000 bullets before breaking. But add firearm jamming and malfunctions. Jamming will do minimal durability damage. Malfunctions will cause severe damage to the weapon.
---
The longer you go without taking your gun to a bench for cleaning, the more often jamming happens. The less accurate it becomes, and eventually malfunctions will start happening and will cause the gun to basically blow up in your face and break.
---
That way, if you don’t take care of your weapons they won’t last long and won’t perform well. But if you clean them they will last the whole game.
---
I feel yea but you shouldn’t balance them at the same level cause one is harder to use than the other yea I don’t believe any thing in a pvp game should one shot. Plus that’s probably the unyielding builds that one shot I’m doing a vanguard melee build so I don’t one shot like you say unless they don’t have DR or little health 
---
Yes u need one per leg 
---
It started doing this a few days ago. So ive had ti hard launch the game from the folder. Everytime i play now i need to login.
---
&gt; Looks like im making acid this weekend
---
Damn. I was hoping they'd skip over this one for a little longer.
---
Acid is actually really fucking hard to find in large quantities and if you're a heavy guns user you need A LOT of it to break down all the lead/iron ore you need to farm to make bullets.
---
TBH, I think actually having to constantly farm materials for ammo may be the thing that turns me off this game in the long run. It's already pretty tilting, and now I have to go out and find good acid farming spots as well as make my daily lead and iron runs just to play the damn game.
---
People will lie to play the victim and get a pity party, and detractors to the game can use lie like this to discourage people from playing the game. 
---
Not accusing you at all, just point out for individuals there actually can be something to gain, even if its petty
---
Uhhh, the damage perks are reflected in tooltips in the pipboy. You don't have to do any actual enemy testing for something like that unless the tooltips weren't bugged and showing the correct numbers while the weapon actually did less.
---
Can I get a hallelujah?!
---
Good grief did I hate that place.
---
Thanks man we gotta spread the fun
---
I remember seeing the game on miniclip when I was at school over a decade before it came out as candycrush
---
With Goat Lega 2, Bird Bones and Marsupial I BASE jump of the top of Seneca rock.  Very little damage😻
---
PC, latest patch installed etc. And now I returned that shithole cave, of course every mob has respawned.
---
I. Just. Can't. Take. This. Right. Now. Q_Q
---
I cannot stress this enough:
---
There is objective criticism that is in fact being silenced.  It’s not large in quantity but there is clear and concise criticism that I’ve seen posted here that gets hidden by downvoted and the post ends up being extremely non-hostile, albeit very discontent, and often coming from a player who does not want to give up on the game.
---
There is without a doubt a silent minority proceeding to brigade against criticism of the game and in the long run it will not be healthy for us or Bethesda.
---
That said, don’t stop shitting on or mocking people who come here to do nothing but shit on the game, they’re the other side of the ‘not helping the greater cause’ coin.
---
My exact thought
---
Oh, that's a good point! I hadn't thought of differences in color perception from one person to another, that's a big factor!
---
thats not a bad idea… but do scorchbeast reproduce like normal bats?
---
Ligma Chode
---
Sbq
---
It's a West Virginian Terracotta Army.
---
Make sure you feed it. Apparently it dies if you don’t take care of it
---
I use the reaper for my melee build, I don't notice the icon pop up, but I do notice the refresh on AP. And I'm on PC though.
---
You're right. The Tesla rifle isnt bad. Its listed damage does no where near what it is supposed to do though as you cant decrease energy resistance like you can with ballistics 
---
Its ok because we will always know that they are trash
---
My point is if they don't tone back melee after a TSE nerf then we will go back to the one shot melee meta apparently people forgot about. 
---
Without TS or explosive legendary weapons Melee will be low risk high reward.
---
&gt;That all said, Fallout 76 was always marketed as a spinoff
---
Exactly. It does not stand against previous entries in the series. It's not a bad game, but it's shortcomings are clear.
---
Obviously you knew that I meant you were speculating that rad resist was important to OP. Again you're twisting things around because you won't admit you're wrong about DR which is what the person you were replying to was talking about
---
It's the same with bfv on every insta Post by battlefield i see comments like shit game etc. for no reason what so ever I mean if you don't like it I have no Problem but please let me enjoy it and shut the f*** up
---
yeah, doing all that, lol. It's just an entitled QOL request I'd like to have to save time doing that sorta stuff. More so, the fact I don't know "what build i wanna be when i grow up" does NOT help with moving points/perk cards around.  At least i feel better knowing im not the only one that screwed things up first go around :)
---
“Omae wa mou shindeiru” - Every melee user I’ve ever fought (and lost to) in this game 
---
I'm low level as I just recently started playing, and just got my first full set of power armor. I've been in it the whole time since and rarely have issues with having enough cores. They don't deplete that quickly, and they are found in the world readily enough.
---
I mean you can still enjoy a game still think its shit (I haven't played since the beta but I refunded that) I'm only here to see the changes
---
I would love to take over mega red rocket, but even if the servers were stable enough, there's just too much loot easily available everywhere else for me to care. :/
---
PC shenanigans, it's how they had the owl head and winterized items too.
---
Don’t worry about it. After a few hours, you’ll build back up. Find a high level player and nuke white spring with him
---
My long recon scope is zooming in way too much its hard hitting moving targets. 
---
PA weight is fine for me. Was fixed a couple patches back. Maybe post which PA you are having an issue with? I'd assume excavator but now that shocks are pretty common across all the PA's dont want to assume.
---
I believe it's a 1 in 100 chance, luck can hit you randomly though, I got calibrated shocks 2 times in a row, none since then.
---
So, all characters on an account share Stash inventory?
---
I guess it does make sense to add it as a crafting requirement, since it’s needed for repair,  but I’ve never had much luck in finding it. 
---
Can a match box? 
---
No, but a garbage Can
---
I have about 200 Bobby pins 
---
So it was taking up 20 lbs in my inventory 
---
How does that help with the margins?
---
I loved that post when I saw it. It made me go back and start a new FO4 playthrough now that I actually understood how the NPC's felt.
---
As the last incident has shown they lack the toolsets to detect cheating. 
---
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
---
You need to practice with it, learn the arc
---
I just wanna curl up in my bed and cry my eyes out D:
---
The condition for most of the weapons seems tied to dps. The higher it is the faster it breaks. Tie that with two shot and scatter on an energy weapon and it melts the weapon faster than your enemy. 😭
---
Nope, they plan to have player vending at some point but it will most likely be at some sort of a hub (if it's at a random camp, it is difficult to get to and can be griefed)
---
Exactly my thoughts... and I don't find the majority of mine in fusion generators either.  Most are in random power armors, drops from mobs, or just randomly on the ground
---
I'm pretty sure it only helps with crafting. I could be wrong and may test it out tonight. 
---
The negative is it makes you feel like you always have to be in Excavator, at the least carry it around and swap to fast travel.
---
I’ll actually come back to the game if they fix energy weapons 
---
You very clearly see the damage value of a weapon change when equipping or unequipping perks lol.
---
EVERYONE knows what a buggy cesspool this game is; why someone would believe something in a ebthesda game worked based on faith instead of just verifying is beyond me 
---
Yeah, I just carry all my heavy weapons because I can’t justify stash space.
---
That's the case with all ammo other than .50 atm
---
Here is my suggestion (simplified) to eliminate the argument of trying to spawn in X amount of items in the Stash when a player logs in.  
---
You have SQL Server A: In-game stash items (600 lb).  
---
You have SQL Server B: Account based stash items, cannot be accessed in game, infinite storage (or something that is ridiculously large).  
---
You can send items to the account based stash in game, but you cannot retrieve them them in game. You have to quit the game to main menu, access an account stash (similar to the atomic shop). You can then select an item from the account stash, select a character, a query is fired to determine if the item(s) selected exceed the storage limit on the character stash. If not, then it will be delivered to the character stash. You can then retrieve the item from the  character in game stash.  
---
Does this work for everyone? SQL Server B might be slow, but won't cause the performant problems that having all items spawn in game would cause in 1 storage server.
---
&gt;some people are bad at this game
---
I...  I’m not sure how I feel about that.  Aim, pull trigger/click mouse, keep track of your health, repeat till enemy is dead.
---
This...  this isn’t that hard, right?  Surely...  surely people aren’t *that* brain dead playing the game are they?
---
Sociology 101
---
You could apply this to any demographic subset. Although both groups in your example are isolationists, maybe the progressives moreso. 
---
Ah. And my power armor is fallen apart. Great. Just great. I really love this game, but these unstable servers fucks my mind. 
---
That's the entry above that, this is a separate entry in the notes.
---
I’ve noticed this aswell
---
[This](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a06awh/if_you_find_a_salvaged_assaultron_head_weapon_do) glitch involving the salvaged assaultron head still hasn't been fixed. I just shot a radroach with 288 fusion cells at once.
---
Ooh I kind of like that idea. But getting to implement that is a long shot.
---
new event next patch.... Glass Caverns: After Dark
---
Yes, but everyone called that a hoax.
---
There is something coming, there's not a lot of details at this stage. Looks like you will be able to sell stuff.
---
I was trying to make the list low level friendly so I avoided pointing only to high level spots for everything (where possible).  I'll be covering items you can grow at your C.A.M.P. in my next and final post on cooking.
---
I got the plan from a treasure map, no qa room involved. 
---
The game faded in obscurity.
---
Well the first line seems to say that, but this is a separate fix.
---
why not have it do a weight check and ban or /clear inventories of characters over a certain thresh hold, there's no reason any one should be carrying more than 600wg on their character after perks are accounted for tbh
---
My friend found that helmet (without the gas mask) in a bus. I can't remember where though.
---
My friends and I decided we would no longer support Bethesda games titles. We all purchased this game at launch for $60 only to see it reduced to half that less than 2 weeks in. That was already a slap in the face. And then to see how they handled everything else with the community was gut wrenching. It's extremely difficult for me to believe that a studio of this caliber didn't know what they were doing when they releases this. They took deliberate, ill intended actions. Ultimately, my friends and I decided, we won't stand for it, we won't tolerate it. This one is just too ugly to stand by and let it go. I truly feel wronged, robbed, and taken advantage of. 
---
I want to make sure , is it always mods made out of steel that dissapear when they are inside the box but not in your body ? Thank you for help . 
---
Finally! This has been an issue since Far Harbor.
---
Because I like the game
---
It just makes a HUGE difference as you get into stronger enemies. They will trash your nice armor fast if you don't have it. One run in with a scorchbeast or a pack of mole miners and most of my set would be trashed. Now it lasts a very long time
---
Yup, it's pretty low key infuriating but i've learned with Bethesda that it's better to let go of frustrations and hopes and just let it happen than it is to face constant disappointment.  Some of these are great changes though.
---
Wheres this narrative of real money coming from? All we have seen are listings and a few confirmed ebay sales. There is little to no data implying people are actually buying them, just listing for sale.
---
Wasted effort. If you wanna do unarmed, you have to not do power armour.
---
You bettwr make a video before someone steals your idea and passes it off as their own flamer idea.
---
Pro tip. Never aim at the enemy directly. Try to aim slightly behind them at their feet. Only the strongest enemies survive that. Especially good at Feed the People and of course Whitesprings.
---
Weighted Shortest Job First is how you should do it, not necessarily highest priority if that initiative is going to take a year.
---
Not to be Antifun Annie but I also wanted to be part of this conversation 
---
Have you tried testing it with just 2 perk points and the dense mod to see what the difference is?
---
I have at least a a hundred chemistry station plans because they’re everywhere and I compulsively pick them up every time, pls no ban.
---
so you make a nerfing post for every weapon that one shots you?
---
Roger that.
---
I have a better idea, assuming they have a reliable way to determine who used the dupe glitch: simply flag their accounts and only load them into servers with other people who duped. Let them suffer in the laggy, constant disconnecting world they created.
---
I cant even edit where the launcher searches for the files like i can on steam, or if i can i cant find it in the settings. 
---
they fixed the lever action animation....cool....hey guys, can um...you maybe port that patch over to fallout 4? it's only been broken for like, I don't know, 4 years??
---
How would this apply to that situation? Is it actually possible to block incoming explosive attacks?
---
What generators? 
---
My theory is that most people who constantly bitch about Fallout 76 are more heavily into FPS games. If they played FO4 it was more for the FPS aspect and not the RPG/Open World aspect. Even the attitudes you mention more resemble the online FPS community than the MMO community.
---
With no real background in MMO/RPG's, they're used to releases being more like cookie cutter online FPS games that generally release with little bugs or game mechanic tweaks needed and they have no concept about the release conditions of almost every single open world MMO in the past 20 years.
---
When I view threads, articles, and YouTube videos criticizing FO76 I can tell almost 90% of the time who comes from an MMO background and who doesn't.
---
Those who don't come from an MMO background:
---
* Give nonconstructive criticism and call it a shitty clone of other games it's kind of similar to.
---
* Bitch about bugs that hinder them / Bitch about bugs patched out that they used.
---
* Talk about how it's unplayable in one breath and then complain the end game content is too easy in the next.
---
* Whine about how the store is expensive with no knowledge about prices in other MMO, non-F2P stores.
---
* Are pessimistic about the future of a companies first online MMO and are quitting the game and never playing it again once a week.
---
* Are angry they bought a game they didn't like and can't return it. (&lt;- That was at least 1/3 of my experience in the PS1 days)
---
Those who do come from playing other MMO's long term
---
* Discuss what the future of game play will be like when bugs are fixed.
---
* Tend to focus less on bugs that are not game breaking (they mention them but it's not a 10 minute rant on doing no damage to Super Mutant sometimes)
---
* Focus more on new things they'd like to see such as game mechanics, group quests, higher tier end game content, player shops, etc
---
* Talk about other things they'd like to see in the store they'd be willing to buy rather than bashing content already there.
---
* Remember the growing pains of past MMO's and are optimistic about things because this is how these game progress, grow, and improve. (Hell, WoW over the years implemented so much stuff that started out as player made mods, I wounder if Bethesda has experience in implementing player made mods?)
---
Well! See I need to work on my build! 
---
Morally not sure. Funny yes
---
It would suck for the new player of a high level player shooting at you not knowing much about the game yet. But you give them free stuff. 
---
 I'd like a few added that randomly give much smaller amounts of lead, iron, and aluminum at the same node. Similar to the junk node giving small amounts of random junk. 
---
Can you read?
---
I've had some pretty wild experiences with super mutants having profoundly variable hit point pools. 
---
Next patch: *Ballistic and explosive weapons have had durability and damage reduced by 40% across the board, to better align them with energy weapons. Please use melee weapons like Skyrim taught you.*
---
I don't care about fame 
---
I raise you mole rats, where only the queen reproduces
---
thanks! if you find a spot where the pool can be enclosed but you can still swim to it, let me know! Right now due to the fact that you can only place foundations in "shallow" water, I dont know of a way to get walls on all sides and still have access.
---
Dont drop them if you get a warning, lost a full set of X-01 doing that for a friend. It was painted, we both had the paint.
---
The ones at the power plants. They now output 8 fusion cores per hour. (Used to be like 2 an hour)
---
Upvoting because I hope it’s satire, hesitant cause I’m worried You’re serious. 
---
If you can dodge a wrench you can dodge a ball.
---
&gt; toxic neckbeard 
---
you seem to really love this term.
---
Now we just need to deal with the dupers and we'll be all set.
---
Oh yeah. After the patch I've hard crashed more times in a few hours than in the last month combined.
---
It's fubar'd for me.
---
Logged in cautiously excited about the new changes(and reversions that were called fixes to save face - i'm looking at you power plant workshops) and upon attempting to use a stimpack the game promptly crashed.  GG.
---
North of Whitesprings resort, just West of the road, there is a shack with spawning Super Mutants, small pond, etc. Within the shack on the table is a comic spawn spot. I got an Unstoppable there earlier today.
---
Any chance you could craft one, so I can attempt to scrap it?
---
Ffs no one's asking, you responded to me twice in two threads but are too dumb to keep up with the format. 
---
Noted. Is it just a hit or miss thing, or some way to trigger it?
---
At this point, I'm starting to think the only way to make energy weapons remotely viable is to completely nerf energy resistance from enemies completely into the ground, because there's basically no strategical advantage to preferring energy weapons over ballistic counterparts when ballistic weapons can so easily attain armor-piercing capabilities that would have otherwise made taking advantage of weaker energy defence a useful prospect.
---
Yay, Locks be doomed now. 
---
The armor isnt the only thing unbalanced in this game. I do agree that changes need to be made so power armor isnt the only resonably viable thing in end game content (nuke zones), but I feel like it's in a decent place right now all things considered.  You can mod armor to do a lot more than power armor so depending on builds you can get more out or regular armor. 
---
Overexplainer Mode...ENGAGED!  
---
TL;DR  
---
It's like the wild west.  Sure, you can break the basic rules of  the fledgling society in the wasteland (don't kill people, don't steal their trash), but it will cost you a little inconvenience.  
---
/TL;DR
---
These are good questions.  The game isn't always very clear in explaining things, so your questions make sense.  (Probably more sense than my attempt at an answer.)  
---
I think that the "bounty" of the caps (which comes out of your character's pocket) is a deterrent against PVP.  Just like any society has rules and penalties for breaking the rules.  Since there are no police officers or jails, the players have to maintain society themselves.
---
I think of it as sort of "the law" in a wild west sense.  I think the object is to deter but not prevent people from attacking other players and stealing from their CAMPS, and so forth.  Also, I think they call it a "bounty" because it is open to any player on the server who wishes to step into the role of a bounty hunter of sorts.  Again, this feels very much like the wild west to me.  The whole theme of Fallout 76 really seems to me to be an epic fight to rebuild society after everything gets destroyed (no spoilers there.)  Part of what society is, is getting people to agree on working together instead of fighting.  But opinions always differ.  
---
I think that generally in online games there are people who don't ever want to engage in PVP.  Also, there are people who only want to fight PVP.  There's kind of a continuum of interest in fighting with other people.  This interest to engage in PVP probably  changes on a daily/weekly basis for individual people, as well.  
---
The workshops are a lure to get people to interact with each other.  
---
To take a workshop you need to spend some resources (time, ammo/meds, caps to pay for it, and scrap to build it up) but the obvious payoff is that you get stuff such as events and resources.  The additional cost, is that you open yourself up to PVP...maybe.  It's still your choice.  
---
When my character was a lower level and I felt pretty weak, I took a few workshops because I was in desperate need for something (usually aluminum or ammo).  If someone came along and took it from me, I just left.  I just wasn't interested in fighting them for it.  That was my choice, mostly made because I felt pretty vulnerable.  Honestly though, it didn't happen very often.
---
Now, my character is thoroughly average or mid-tier.  I'm less vulnerable, but alas I still need STUFF.  So, I take workshops.  I also take them because it's kind of fun for me to take a break and just build for awhile.   I've had a couple of my workshops taken, and you know what - I still don't fight for them!  Lol, I guess I'm just not very interested in PVP still.  
---
One thing I've started doing is I don't lock any of my resource collectors any more.  This is a new choice I'm making and I'm curious how it will play out.  (FYI: If a player takes some resources from an unlocked resource collector, they simply get the stuff without incurring a bounty.)   One of the things that inspired me to do this is that I've seen a few posts where people get frustrated when they come upon a player's CAMP or workshop and find the water purifiers locked.  Their frustration is pretty interesting to me, and I think it's a valid frustration because purifiers can only hold so much water - so nothing is lost from letting other players have some water.
---
I really like what the game designers have done here.  It feels to me like they really spent time trying to figure out how to balance the diversity of interest and motivations in a pretty broad player base.  Some of their oldest fans (like myself) just aren't very interested in PVP, so we enable Pacifist Mode and just run around scrapping the wasteland.
---
You don't have lead and steel? It's like the cheapest crafted ammo
---
Max out perks and charisma and you will get more. Yeah I know charisma and bots, hacking would make more sense no?  You have access to an unlimited amount of stuff to sell, so to help keep the economy in balance they limit how much and how often.  Keeps inflation in check to a degree but can be frustrating especially if you have the time to gather stuff to sell.
---
I’m aware that I chose that. Wanna know how I know? It’s because I chose that. Yup I “exploited” a bug” by putting perks where I damn well wanted them. I gave up carry weight for maximum damage. How in the hell is this an exploit??
---
How do you know that? Do you have sockpuppet accounts for downvoting?
---
Agreed. I only like them for their amazing art work. Some of them also come with a free video game though too!
---
No weapon should one shot someone in power armor.
---
Oh shit that would get you killed in the fallout sub haha. I loved NV but it took a long time and it was really restricting as to what areas you could go into. That and there wasn’t much to explore because it’s the desert. 
---
I live close to the Mojave Desert irl so it was kind of like virtual camping haha. The guns and gunplay was a welcome addition but it didn’t have the same sense of exploration as 3 and even though the writing was great I have no care to return to the Mojave unless I play on my laptop and put some mods on it. 
---
I absolutely love 76 because I can wander around and always find something to do. The world is so dense and has so much freedom for you to role play any way that you want. No kids or fathers or wasteland or vaults need Savin, I don’t have to pursue anything or anyone, i can just... exist in a fallout world. I don’t think I’ve gotten this into a game in a looong time and it’s actually really refreshing and fun. 
---
Are u doing it now and r there any high level already in your game
---
You can always just switch weapon artisan in to repair then makeshift when you're out in the field.. 
---
the manual reset is nice, but unless you can get everyone there to follow the same sheet of music it causes crazy server instability. Even if you are looting every last thing to get the meat piles to despawn, you get way too much client instability through stretched textures and stuff
---
Better than you.
---
Oh lit! I have a tesla rifle just sitting in my inventory just waiting to be used! So how does it work? Do you shoot it and the lightning connects to every enemy?
---
I don't understand why they have this limit and then reward you for quests with a whole bunch of heavy weapons like that flamethrower I had to sell and the missile launcher I keep thinking about selling. I'd rather get plans as rewards so I don't have something clogging up my stash.
---
Well man I for one thought that was well written and gives us a view into the situation as it stands for those who aren't in the loop.  
---
Or make the perk cards work by reducing damage resistance by whatever type you're holding. I feel like that would do a ton to help with their viability. 
---
OH good, maybe just maybe people won't just use melee or explosive shot guns now.
---
A regular jump wont hurt you. But jumping down a level will, because you jump higher so your fall distance is like double. I run healing factor with marsupial and goat legs level 2 and most jumps just heal right up. 
---
Lol. Thanks for the laugh. 
---
I’m just by myself sadly 
---
They aren’t used exactly for pvp; they are extremely useful in pve.
---
Besides, I don’t think a reasonable amount of people will switch over their builds just to have protection again explosives.
---
If anything, current tse users will get that setup in order to not blow themselves up with their own weapons, which is a godsend in closed spaces; thanks man, you just made TSEs more expensive due to being much more efficient with this idea.
---
Because the PC is currently in my bedroom and I don’t like to sleep with the damned thing on due the noise.
---
I seen someone jump with both of them and die. They posted a video of it. They had Goat Legs maxed out also. So there is a limit to it I guess.
---
Fucking hell, what a sweet start =/ Thanks mate.
---
I didnt say I didn't have lead and steel. I said I rather craft other ammo for other weapons I'm fond of. I'm not a gauss type person. I don't like the weapon, I don't like the ammo plain and simple. 
---
Such a shortsighted move on Bethesda's part. Grognak Axe it is then. 
---
I launched a nuke about 45 minutes ago.
---
It kicked me from the game then after rejoicing as the game was full it had been completed.
---
They really need to fix some parts of the game
---
Aaah thank you 
---
I'm not sure, as I haven't been able to play today after the new patch.  
---
Do you have a Fallout76Custom.ini file that you've created to alter the video settings?  
---
It turned out that the issue I reported in this thread was solved (for me) when I deleted that file.  
---
Since they created the Depth of Field and Field of View controls in the Settings menu, I don't need that file any more.   
---
You might also try changing your Depth of Field &amp; Field of View settings in the game menu.  Changing them might reset whatever is not working right for you.
---
Agreed, but that's why I was hoping for a reduction not an elimination of weight. I just weighted one for sh\*ts and grins and it weighed 3.6oz. Then I weighed an issue of Batman (these are comics, right?) and it only weighed 1.45oz. So if this game is set in America and we are using the crazy non-metric system, the weight should be between 0.1 and 0.22 lbs. :)
---
Did that forehead grease come out yet from the first datamine?
---
Awesome! Thank you!
---
aha, but its only the melee problem it seems, nevermind that TSE is performing optimal for PVP.
---
nevermind that melee users cant do didly squat half of the time when the queen is flying, except chase random mobs around.
---
or kill dozens of ghouls in whitesprings before anyone can even reach them.
---
must be only a melee issue
---
I have been one shot by nerds for no reason several times now.  One even coming into my house while I was crafting just to do it and leave, just because.  But yah, I had something like what you said two days ago. The asshat tried to one shot me but I fast traveled away, and he just kept following and hunting after me, fast traveled away again and blocked and ignored him. I just want to play the game in peace ffs.
---
And wait for some pissy high level guy to pick you off unfortunately.  But I like the idea.  Don’t forget to stock up on Radx and Radaway
---
Question energy weapon dudes - is the laser rifle and laser pistol the same gun? but with different mods to either make it a pistol or rifle? I’m asking because I have a laser rifle and may buy a pistol if they’re totally different items.
---
It is that rubber band lash-back effect going on. First you've had brigades of haters that downvote every positive post, and then in response the brigaders upvoting everything positive and downvoting everything negative. While the "fight back" idea is understandable, it means constructive criticisms gets buried too. I figure keep posting things that are constructive, and ignore the brigades, and eventually they'll all get bored and then we can have normal, non-reactionary, non-hyperbolic conversations about how to FO76.
---
I really like this game, but there is a lot of room for improvement. The bug fixes and balance tweaks keep coming, and soon more content will too. Just keep giving constructive criticism, avoiding the hyperbolic hate train, and ignoring the bullshit and I'm sure somebody at bethesda is reading all the downvoted comments for substance too.
---
Have the 6 intelligence for using a tier 5 crafting card with scrapper and 4 per. Cause I’m dumb and leveled too quickly.
---
Check today's (1/10/19) patch notes. They're changing this perk. It's now going to do what we thought it did but only at night time.  ***I think, I havent played today to check***
---
I had a duper tell me he can pop 300 heavy weapon bobbleheads and one shot the sbq so I’m thinking if that’s true he could one shot other players too...even with slap damage. 
---
Even if they can see if someone has multiple TSE's and they remove them then I get screwed, i paid caps for 3 of the same weapons, 5.56 assault guns.  I didnt dup them, I bought them for one of the trading forums.  different people, paid different prices.  Now if they pick a number like 10+ Im all for it.
---
Until next week when consoles update and the xp of ghouls is reduced. 
---
There's one in Hornwright summer villa also. Also Snaptail Reeds all along the rivers for making sugar. Then you can make the Cranberry Relish for +10% XP.
---
I would assume it might be a multiplicative formula rather than an addition one, like how armor piercing works. Adding 50% fall damage and 40% may not give 90% resistance from fall damage, instead it would be 70%
---
I got the plan for the marine tac helmet just north of watoga.
---
Except that's not even remotely true. I have a bloodied, explosive .50 cal that lasts roughly 4000 rounds with when repaired to 200% and all heavy and explosive perks maxed, gun nut 3 equipped. It's also doing roughly 10 times more damage per second than my armor piercing explosive gatling laser under the exact same conditions. But the gatling laser lasts a whole **two fusion cores** before it breaks like a Bethesda collectors edition power armor helmet.
---
I have a hazmat suit but it’s 35 levels higher than me. Do they have a sub lvl 20 hazmat anywhere?
---
Thank you! And nice mutation choice.
---
Ah, on PC you cant join others unless they are your friend. You can view your recents, but you cant join them. Have to add them, they have to accept, then you can join them. :(
---
Yes. All that changes is the stock or grip
---
Mods need to not be auto scrapped
---
Should deal with the inventories that still have thousands of duped items 
---
Still some stability issues
---
90% weight reduction on legendaries should include mod weight
---
Energy weapons do very little damage
---
I'm sure there's plenty more, those are just off the top of my head
---
There's a good few people L75 + in my game so whats your GT and I'll inv u
---
Only at night time?
---
Urgh. But thx for the heads up
---
I hesitated upvoting you, since I also use this spot but for the greater good more people should know about this awesome spot.  I've found in my experience, putting a spotlight and rocket turret guarding each walkway/plankway to your side of the lake is enough to keep the wandering ghouls at bay, for me at least.
---
That's where my camp is too, I have a Tent based camp on that cliff overlooking the boat. 
---
Since Skyrim the big criticism brought at bethesda has been the simplicity of skill trees, *being able to one shot every enemy*, and simplicity of dungeons. The TSE playstyle and it's unwillingness to face any authentic challenge in game is the distilled reflection of that attitude. Miss out on the game entirely by overpowering yourself.
---
Melee is pretty much useless if their oponent is using firearms along with a marsupial mutation/jetpack combo.
---
How about a fix for my power armor left leg unequipping itself every time I fast travel or get out of my of PA and back in? This is driving me crazy. 
---
They probably won’t help with it though 
---
My sneak gauss rifle build is sitting at level 26 when I abandoned him to make a melee main. I’d love to bust him back out. 
---
You’re very welcome! =-)
---
At the train station by the prime fisher site and the other train station at the north of the map near the pumpkin house. 
---
Thank you for the prompt reply kind sir, appreciate it
---
Use a shorter scope 
---
More stash space would be nice, but for me 600 is acceptable compared to what we had before. With 400 I had to be quite selective about what to store, especially the amounts of components. With 600 I can manage to do that, store 5 sets of PA and various weapons to use later. Once in a time I hit the limit, craft some bulk junk and keep selling it during the next several days.
---
But yeah, higher limit would still be nice. I'd like to store fully modded (fully in regards as what I have unlocked) piece of every weapon and maybe even some armor sets.
---
They will probs
---
Cause I dropped a nuke about 30 mins ago and it was defeated in around 15 - 20 mins
---
Busted ass Chainsaws
---
Not a problem!
---
Yeah this was just fixed today bro, if you are on console make use of it until the 14th though.  But you can still have a higher level friend shuffle you around killing what you tag in areas much higher than you can normally go to solo.
---
Class Freak not breaking Barbarian and Evasive due to the special fractions it generates. 
---
Class Freak actually working with grounded to I can use gauss at -12% instead of -50%
---
No you get a buddy to hold onto it while you switch characters.
---
It's likely the North spawn, just got a Mirelurk King that I just tamed
---
dont know why people downvote a post about a bug 
---
Is reflect only for melee attackers
---
They don’t disappear, you’re scraping them when you’re making something and are low on steel. 
---
It’ll show in the menu when you go to craft something that youre using specific mods and for what mats, so the two easy fixes are 1, always make sure you have steel in your stash, and 2, always read the prompt before crafting anything if you’re low. 
---
This art... it speaks to me... **IT MUST DIE!** 
---
My question: Does this help survive the SB Scream spam....?
---
Yeah, I was surprised how much power armor is around. At level 23 I already had 6 frames. I am just stripping pieces and cores off the ones I find now, and just ditched 3 of the frames since I now know they aren't that rare. And since I'm not high level enough yet, I've got a full set of t45 and t60 stored on a frame in my stash just waiting for me.
---
No auto scrap mods (possibly teddys too for collector reasons?) and tell us what plans/reciped we have read. I think those are my two biggest ones I'm waiting for now.
---
We already got a stash limit increase from 400.
---
Remember to scrap all your junk before you store it, and try not to hoard so much.
---
If I take off travelling pharmacy 3, I'm over encumbered by 100 lbs easy. Aid is definitely my heaviest tab and you might not realize you have a lot there too
---
I've heard they are a lot easier to maintain. 
---
What is the qa room?
---
Is no one going to mention the explosive weapon fix?
---
They fixed that in December. 
---
Is this an issue?
---
If I'm wanted and I group with my friend who is not wanted, they can't see my name and view me as an enemy, they also can't support me when I get hunted down. If you team up with a wanted criminal should you also become wanted?
---
I want to be able to know what plans I already have. I just bought pianos and already had it. I would also like to have card decks for swapping between crafting and fighting or what have you. I would also like to be able to label my power armour. Finally, I want to know what damn doors I have... I dont know if i have fancy doors, barn doors, future doors when in camp building it just says door. 
---
If/when I get that plan I will.
---
Maybe she has the fireproof perk. :P
---
Now she's immune to explosive damage and all those TSEs are doing diddly compared to plain old ballistic attacks. That would be amusing.
---
I think someone said she was already resistant to explosive damage, though, so could be they buffed that.
---
Sorry, I mean it's the "light" version. I called it standard because it came out first, but youre right. 
---
They just upped basic repair requirements, making players burn through almost twice as much junk every time they perform basic CAMP repairs. Of course that should come with a stash increase, and of course it didn't. Not holding my breath for them doing it, either.
---
Not as cringy as the following crowd:
---
\- Before Beta: you havnt even played teh game how can you criticise it
---
\- During Beta: well duh its shitty its a Beta and will be fixed at release 
---
\- At release: wtf is wrong with you of course its broken give them a couple of months to fix it
---
\- After a few months: yes its broken, yes its lifeless but I ENJOY IT
---
You are just passing this stage 
---
I was looking at a post about minecraft and comments about there being *too many* (completely optional) features and how they missed how simple it used to be were getting hundreds of votes.
---
Folks complaining about too many ways to play a game.  I never thought I'd see the day.
---
kind of amazed they don't have blimps floating around LA saying The Air has been known to cause cancer in California
---
Pretty sure it was in a house in Cranberry Bog.  That was actually one of the more recent ones I've found.  It would have been in the area between Forward Station Alpha, the Fissure (northern one, not prime) and the General's Steakhouse.  It's one of Delbert's recipes (there are actually a lot of them) and the recipe you pick up says something about Delbert's something something something Tea.
---
I played Fallout 4 so I am familiar with it on a mechanical level, and GTAO so I'm familiar with the characteristics of massively multiplayer sandboxes. Try again, kid.
---
How is my opposition to a game that is a cynical fad cash-in turned money and PR pit for a developer I care about pitiful compared to your ego-welded white-knighting for a bad game and a cynical publisher? I want to see Bethesda put out more good single-player content, not waste time and energy in a broken, shitty mess that lurches from crisis to crisis.
---
And I do this in my spare time. Otherwise I'm playing the last good game they released, Fallout 4.
---
pc?
---
Yes pls. Some of us just do not want to engage in PvP AT ALL. Ever. I just want to be left out of it. I want to help others, not antagonize or kill them. If there was a permanent setting for my character I could do that would set it so that I could never harm another player and they could never harm me, I'd take it. Pacifist mode right now tried approaching that line but doesn't go all the way enough for me.
---
Did you... forget the part where the method fucks up the server? Like it literally lags out the server. Also, a bunch of assholes are running around one-shotting people with cheated weapons. I'm not saying they all did, but a lot of them did. It's no fun setting up a workshop to have some numbnut one-shot you and I'm sure it would be a lot less frequent without the dupers. 
---
I kind of wish we had that just so Bethesda could get the perks straight...
---
No more semi-auto auto rifles or shotgun grenade launchers, please.
---
Exactly what a friend and I were talking about. They need to create some nuke zone specific events or maybe increase enemy spawn rates so we can still earn xp (not by increasing xp earned form individual enemies) only current incentive I can think of is the nuked flora 
---
Not sure on a spawn for the suit but there is a pretty easy spawn of power Armor outside of the mine to the east. Usually has lowish level raider parts.
---
You could also look for a spawn on YouTube if that doesn’t work out.
---
Increased by 200: Would you still be upset?
---
Increased by 400: Would you still be upset?
---
Increased by 600: Would you still be upset?
---
Increased by 800: Would you still be upset?
---
Increased by 1000: Would you still be upset?
---
Yep,  
---
It's the correct item right? Not the tactical one?
---
Please make it stop...I cant turn it off...
---
Best way to change this would be to give CAMP's a defense budget which only traps and turrets used. Once the defense budget is full, no more defenses.
---
Gauss rifle is an energy weapon that deals ballistic damage.
---
That sucks, thanks for helping out
---
Are you purposely being obtuse? My replies kinda point me being aware of that yet wishing I didn't have to pick up something that I should be able to find on a similar weapon..
---
Still on console. Gotta abuse the hell out of this until then I guess :/
---
Ok besides getting the best gun possible or armor theres no economy.  Theres a difference between a lotto economy and a real economy.  No ones going to buy your garbage stack of 308 unless they are to stupid to farm up 200 lead gunpower and steel. Its far faster just to do it yourself then hunt down some one trading on reddit.
---
Thats not duping its just time vs reward, may change a little with player venders if you could make a market area on every server.
---
Yea we enjoy it. Is that an issue for you? 
---
We nuked Seneca Rocks...  Nuke zone kinda sucked but since the target was a friend's house it worked out well.  Well, not so much for him...  All we found was an ash pile and some framing.
---
1.5k for assaultron blade?
---
Yea its really rare but ill keep hopping
---
You can't use power armor is the caveat.  You need Dense chest armor mod. It does 66% Reduction of Explosive damage on its own. Combined with Fireproof you are 100%.
---
This is tested and confirmed working.
---
We will need to get paint from FO4 to have power armor explosive reduction.
---
shoot i just dropped like 50 Bobby Pins this morning to save some space i could have sold them tonight and purchased myself like 4 rounds of ammo. cant always be a winner
---
You have no idea how accurate that is. I don't mean that in a good way, I mean it literally that you're making a claim with no evidence to back it up.
---
The ornate stash is neat but the rest I feel is pretty meh. The apparel and skins categories need to get much better before I feel like even bothering paying for atoms. :/
---
I've got a spare TV Plan I'd sell, I might have a spare of the Tabletop TV too.
---
Purifed water is free to make, Ultracite isn’t :). 
---
While the patch notes are really nice and a good step forward, the patch actually broke my game.
---
Whenever I am close to or on stairs my camera will randomly change the direction it is facing making it hard to move. Also there seems to be some kind of rubberbanding where there was none just yesterday. Obviously I havent changed a single thing since playing last apart from updating my Nvidia Game driver. This shouldnt explain though why this issue is happing 90% on and around stairs. 
---
Also I am getting half loaded pictures of the zones I fast travel to (or when I join a new server / world) as loading screen before getting another loading screen and only then loading into the world / zone.
---
Screenshot for reference: [https://imgur.com/a/rdkIGnN](https://imgur.com/a/rdkIGnN)
---
Yeah I have every other Delbert's except Granny's Tea so I had to ask.  Thanks for narrowing it down for me though and damn fine job on the spread sheet, this is just the best brother.  Great job contributing to the community!
---
Oh I know, my fiancé uses it with his build. But I'm a sneaky-sneak, non-scoped rifle build, and I really just don't like it. It feels so bulky and enemies always noticed me the one time I decided to try it again at a higher level. I also specifically get use the perks that aren't effective in PA. 
---
if it's not a nocturnal wood leg, I am dissapoint.  Every time.
---
Yes, please. It's time to address another stash limit increase if 600 has been stable.
---
You on xbox? I have about 200 caps
---
It's. *Dangerous* to go alone.  
---
It's. *Dangerous* to go in groups.  
---
It's just. *Dangerous* out there.
---
He's talking about re logging to refresh your power core. If your cores run out and you only carry 3 it should make you go out and look for 3 more not server hop.
---
Yeah mines excavator, but with no shocks. Same set I’ve been using for about a month through like 30 levels. Maybe I’ll try another set out and see if it helps. 
---
Negative , I purposely had 1000 loose raw steel , game randomly blue screen and lo and behold all of the mods where gun from my stash . 
---
So, 20 kill it, only one get loot?
---
It's not really anyone's fault for hoarding materials and such when every previous Fallout game practically encourages you to hoard, and old habits die hard.
---
I reinstalled for the patch, and played about 3 hours with 2 server crashes and 2 client crashes.
---
So I can't really see any improvement in stability.
---
Yeah, i like how you can pair it with other items, but why does it gotta be so rare.
---
[heres my actual build](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f3a58a5&amp;d=sb2s90sg2ss2sf2sa1pe2e82e60ej4ei0c72cr0i44i12a72s72a40au2l71lt2&amp;w=&amp;n=)
---
i use a lvl 50 mutants deathclaw fist with twisted muscles and talons mutations. i also have a few other mutations but they dont really affect my damage output. i also havent maxed my strength yet, only +2 from BOS underarmor. i wear 4 pieces of vanguards armor, one piece of bolstering and 1 piece that reduces dmg u take by 15% when not moving. 
---
my dream weapon would be a power fist or deathclaw gauntlet that has swingspeed but best i've been able to find are mutated gauntlet and anti armor powerfist. 
---
i use an anti-armor wardrum for when i have to put on power armor but i hate wearing it and using that weaopn so i try not to
---
technically i could lose a point or two in endurance, 3 points in intelligence, and a point in agility and put them somewhere else but im lazy and i like the utility for now. maybe if i had the regeneration mutation i could lose first aid from INT and go agility to pick up some more defense
---
yep it was nerfed, they reduced the spawning rate
---
hmm, tactical? Not sure, I can check later tonight though.  
---
\*Update, i looked up what a tactical looks like, pretty sure that's what I could make. Sorry
---
The Guass is a one-shot machine with proper build.  I don't leave home without it.  I only use the TSE lever when I want to burn some alternative ammo.
---
In FO3, the Metal Blaster with the Chinese Stealth Suit was the most instantly OP out there. The sneak attack bonus applied to every beam of the laser-shotgun individually, an you could waltz right up to things to shoot from point-blank thanks to being invisible. It would one-shot overlords and albino scorpions no problem.
---
This would effectively reduce the chance for any player that isn't playing solo and also alone to obtain a legendary item. So no, this wouldn't be nice at all. It would make for a more miserable grind. I don't disagree that legendary mobs should be legendary, but there are probably better ways to make that happen.
---
my best legendaries so far are tied between a nocturnal vampire gatling gun, and a troubleshooter's plasma.
---
look at the bright side. Now your gauss rifle is going to hit like a truck.
---
Yes, much much easier. No semi-hard to acquire parts. 
---
And I havent really found anything it wont take including multiple Scorchbeast.
---
You keep adding new facts that change your story. I find you not that creditable. 
---
Overpowered.
---
I can't guarantee that's where I found it, but I'm very certain it was.  The day I found that one I found about 4 new ones total so I remember it and I was all over The Mire and Cranberry Bog doing other things.
---
r/subsyouthoughtyoufellfor
---
yep!
---
Love my ghoul slayers wooden left arm
---
Their spawnrate at the bunker is insanely low. Queens drop them rarely too. I had a team of 12 playersto help me gather them. I also bought those I had again to trade them for recipes I need. It takes some grind to get just one of 19 recipes.
---
&gt; Enabling Pacifict mode makes it so that if you accidently hit a fellow player/his base with a few stray shots it doesn't suddenly flag you as "wanted".
---
That's astoundingly wrong.
---
It doesn't protect you from damaging bases at all.
---
I am on Xbox. GT UberToast - I'm at work right now and can get it to you this evening if you can wait.
---
No reasonable player is going to switch their builds?
---
Only TSE players will switch their builds?
---
What?
---
I get you value the TSE you got. But it's use in PVP is about to drop substantially. The inability to use Two Shot effectivly in VATS and now Explosives being ignored entirely.
---
Well I hope that third mod rolled well. ROFL
---
Medium works well for me. The long scope is not very versatile in combat. 
---
time is money. ive read some posts of people grinding the SBQ only to get nothing. even just killing SBQ once takes a lot of resources that took more time to gather.
---
i guarantee if these items were on the atom store they'd sell like hotcakes.
---
Yeah. it's pretty common confusion at this point.   
---
The Marine Armor Helmet is from the QA room.
---
Hopefully having duped TSE weapons will eliminate any remaining idea of fun for people in this game and they will leave on their own after realizing they have nothing else to look forward to. What do you give to the people who have everything?
---
Laser Commander was also great. IIRC it gave you a flat 10% more crit chance, which was pretty insane on gatling lasers.
---
This is typical tribalism that is part of natural instincts in our brain. But part of living in a society is to supress some instincts. The instincts that play the role here is to be in the bigger (therefore "winning") tribe and the flawed idea that large enough tribe cannot be wrong. In this case these people think that when majority of internet looks down upon Fo76, they cannot be wrong be jumping on the same bandwagon. These people don't understand that majority isn't always right.
---
&gt;Repairing: Component quantities required to repair mid to high level armor and weapons have been reduced up to 20%. 
---
Jesus H, finally...
---
Im not sure, when he dropped it he said he didnt get a warning, I  dropped it I did, he said to go ahead, It was painted with the Pre-order paint which we both have in our paint options. Nothing was changed.  We just thought it was a bug that allowed him to drop the item and it didn't get destroyed.
---
The queen is resistant to explosive damage, you need to use non explosive weapons.
---
blame Sony and Microsoft. It takes a lot longer for them to approve updates than it does for Bethesda to push one to the PC client.
---
If you don't have power patcher yet definitely look into that, its in intelligence.
---
I laughed, but I can't help but wonder how many people here will understand the reference in your title.
---
I don't know about anyone else, but even breaking after 30s, I still enjoy my plasma Gatling. Really wish it was more viable.
---
I'm finding cores for it faster than I can use them at this point. Which is sad because they aren't exactly common loot. 
---
Excuse me sirs where is the portable toilet?
---
You know, I was thinking about this the other night and I think they bungled their handling of photomode and the Atomic Shop.  
---
First of all, they should have made it a LOT easier to share and display photos taken in-game, both to other players and to social media.  
---
And they should NOT be selling poses in the Atomic Shop. Those should be given away for free (Except, perhaps, particularly extravagant ones).   
---
The easier and more fun Photomode is, the more players use it, and the easier it is to share, the more others see what other players are doing. It can create interest and potential new players.  
---
Having players pay to get extra features to make photomode fun is insane. They should have looked at how Firaxis did their photomode for Xcom 2. Easy to use, everything provided for free, and easy to share/upload images. It generated a lot of buzz.
---
And I probably would have but the problem was that I was at the Queen event and this one was just one of the random beasts that I killed and others that shot at it too. When you have a large group down there of 20 people I guess you better grab your shit fast and don't worry about anything else. But I saw a plan in there that I needed and it Vanished as the guy beside me was looting everything in it.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Same people. Can confirm; have seen the void. 
---
I mean this is nice, but since there are people with already practically infinite amounts of the best legendaries even if duping is removed the economy is so badly broken it will either take years for those items to disappear or beth tracking down duped crap.
---
If they don't fix all the duped items in the game I'm done, no online rpg especially with PvP should have insanely powerful duped items all around.
---
Makes it so if you want to compete you either also dupe, or pay for weapons with money because you sure as hell won't grind out all the same op weapons dupers and people that buy them for money have. 
---
The other option is ofc only play with your friends or alone and never interact with others since they might be running around with duped loadout. At that point why even make the game online only?
---
Oh well, I'll give this game an other chance if they find a solution the 2nd hand market, and legendary duping.
---
Found the loop hole, you can give it away. 
---
Just tried a two shot fat man at my feet. Nothing
---
Just dont do this at scorchbeast queen, her hp scales with the amount of players in the area, if your just there to tag her and not contribute to the kill your not helping
---
I know a spot with some mirelurk eggs. I had my camp by it for a while because there is also an event spawn on the road next to it and a hermit crab just down the road.. 
---
If you spawn at the house of fear thing in the north east corner of the map, and follow the road down the hill, you will pass a busted red semi truck. Directly past that is the event spawn so you might see a tent or tank or enemies here. Just beyond that the road will hang a left turn and then be fairly straight for a while... There's a big swamp to the right of this straightaway, with a queen that regularly spawns back in the swamp a bit... If you see the hermit crab in the road you went too far. 
---
Theres at least 3 piles of mire lurk eggs back in that swamp and about half of them are harvestable, the other half burst into baby lurks when you get close to them. 
---
These are the only working eggs I've found so far except for a single pile in a hidden tube in some factory that had one or two eggs. 
---
The only people left in the sub are the people that still play the game? 
---
Wth. 
---
Are you purposely being immature?
---
It will be something like: „+1% dodge speed“
---
I mean sure, that may be a part of the server straining but that hasn't been said by bethesda at all so where are people concluding that is the cause and effect? I mean the servers are screwing up as I type this and apparently they fixed the duplication glitch. Maybe it was always bad because of their server infrastructure? 
---
I really don't see the impact in duplicate one shorting weapons when it doesn't seem to be as prevalent as spoken about. I'm running around exploring and no one has ever teleported specifically to my area to hunt me down so maybe I'm just lucky. But if passive mode is on all you are going to get is slap damage and it isn't much. 
---
Also I love how comments like mine that question the hive mentality get down voted. What joys a fan base of a video game are. 
---
Oh man getting grounded hit me hard, was really disappointed to see class freak do nothing. I miss gauss rifles dearly
---
Trash.
---
Trash does.
---
a mortal combat fatality type of finisher? aw yiss
---
Damn this is nice. Tagged this for later.
---
You can see the full image on one of the pictures for th chrome minigun
---
It does happen.  I only noticed it after seeing it on here and trying to repair a weapon without enough steel left.  It will show the mod that's about to be scrapped in the background.
---
It looks different, because you will see whatever resource it's using from said mod listed twice in the repair bill.
---
Steel here too. I make my own ammo all the time but blow thru it so fast. I can get a lot of lead but steel not as much. 
---
throw tank killer on top of it...
---
Thanks a lot. I felt the same way too, see more one-shot action with the gauss than the lever 
---
I don't really have any issue sniping with it in first person. Just need to point the middle of the screen at your enemy. You get used to it.
---
Is it annoying? Yes. But the Gatling gun is still the only viable heavy weapon.

that only took me a minute to find
---
Absolutely not, just find it hilarious that some people have such awful tastes and the length they are willing to go on to avoid buyers remorse (like fooling oneself into thinking that this Fallout 4 DLC masquerading as a AAA title  is an acceptable product). Look forward to seeing where this mass delusion goes! 
---
This is literally your third post of this type in the last 5 hours, bonus points for the spelling error in the title.
---
The best interest of the game is going back to having TSE weapons and the like only being sold for a minimum of 25k caps. The better option would be to remove the cap limit at the same time of removing duplication methods, then mention incoming new content in the form of higher tier legendaries.
---
I feel like they are trying to deter the use of non automatic rifles because they’ve been so powerful in other games. But instead of making other weapon styles attractive, they’ve made most of them unattractive. Rifles way as much as heavy weapons, heavies consume ammo too quickly (except Gatling), explosives are often heavy and the ammo is heavy as well so they are costly as far as a perk build is concerned, most automatic weapons have crap recoil and again eat ammo too quickly, energy weapons do poor damage and break too fast.
---
This leaves melee as the clear choice, especially at lower levels. No ammo to scrounge, damage scales directly with STR, the weight is easily manageable, etc.
---
Also, they seem to really wanna push pipe weapons but have done little to make them more attractive than “look at how easy you can repair them!”. They need to make pipe weapons more robust— perks that increase damage of pipe, have their damage scale with INT, pipe shotguns and heavies, mods to add fire/poison/ice dmg to the guns, or make legendary mods craftable but restrict them to pipe weapons.
---
Losing caps is the _only_ deterrent in pvp really, and even then someone can hand their caps over to a friend if they’re just wanting to grief/bait someone
---
I will agree. Not always. But 99.14159265359% of the time.
---
I've only been disconnected once recently, the majority of my disconnects have been in the games release time, also I thought that the final table was pretty good.
---
Me and my buddy use voice chat like npc's. 
---
Create a scenario, depending on what the player at his camp does, determines what we do.
---
Kind of roleplay that may lead to pvp or smashing their base. We dress like rangers and demand building permits... Or booze. If they dont comply.. We are just doin our job, ya know. We gotta tear down the structure.
---
For sure, they can both use it. Is vera niiiice.
---
I've got 11 bulk concrete I'm not using if you're on PC.
---
Swap perks?
---
You can equip different perks.
---
it automatically scraps for ultracite, or you can use it at a chemistry table to stabilize raw flux so it doesn't decay.  pretty handy whether you scrap it or not.
---
Go to Poseidon nuclear plant near Charleston. On the roof there is a little gray trailer, inside, there should be a level 1-5 hazmat
---
I feel like there are enough of us older Fallout fans around to catch the reference. I'm sure it'll go over many heads, too, though
---
it's pitiful that you feel the need to try and tear down other people's joy. People enjoy this game. Whether you enjoy it or not, other people do. You don't like the game that you've never played so you feel the need to come to a subbreddit dedicated to that game and bash it? why? what's your endgame besides trying to take joy away from the people who like playing it? You mention ego, but how egotistical is it to come into a room and tell people they are wrong for liking something?? That you're opinion is more important than theirs? that is beyond arrogant and it's fucking sad. if you dont want to play the game, then don't play it. You want bethesda to know your feelings then go tell them, just stop trying to shit on everyone elses's fun. 
---
This should have been addressed in the update.  hope its fixed sooner than later.  there are alot of trolls out there who will shot you just to see if they can trick you into PvP or just kill you for the fun of it.
---
If anything, I didn’t get it for pvp, man, just for farming/sbq. Not specced into vats, either.
---
Then again, thank you man, I wasn’t aware of this combo. You have just enabled a lot of TSE users to spam fire on places like nuked whitesprings without worrying about having to make distance or being unable to shoot freely in the main building.
---
Bless you!
---
Cloth is used in making gunpowder, so not strictly useless. But yeah, pre-war money was super-nerfed from what it was in 4.
---
😭
---
Ah yes, I'm totally a "cheater". That word is so abused anyway it's lost meaning, duplication never was cheating, it was abusement of glitches.
---
Also again, you gave no actual reason to it impacting the "economy" that this game apparently has fluctuating so rapidly because of duplicate weapons. Instead you attack and label in hopes of convincing others without need for substance. 
---
Currently with TSE weapons.  Remove that counter and wait and see how OP melee becomes without a proper counter.
---
Thanks for the offer but I'm on ps4. 
---
Do you have sources for any of this? Also, wtf is "rape culture"?
---
Try doing it against Scorchbeasts, you’ll have fun wasting ammo lol
---
It’s so backasswards that it works that way.
---
&gt; Wanna know how to solve that issue, have a competent product to begin with.
---
That's saying you can solve this issue by not having this issue. We are past that. And we are past the humiliating thing, too. It was released when it shouldn't have been and they got humiliated for it left and right. You think not enough, fine, go to r/gaming and make a meme. But I would suggest we are letting them work. And it can't be done all at once. They are just n-amount of people for all the issues. And Beth can't just hire new stuff and teach them the engine and the code and the databases in a week, can they?
---
But you did reply! :P
---
Ah I was hoping they wouldn’t get around to fix the fusion core exploit. It’s way to hard to get enough fusion cores with the rate they’re being used. 
---
&gt;**Crafting**: Fixed an issue where certain objects aren't able to be scrapped through the stored tab.
---
Well one for legendary farming and one for access to the special drop table. I agree they need alternative locations, even Morgantown has a poor legendary spawn rate with similar ghoul spawns...
---
The latest YouTube video says they should have a new exploit in 2 hours and the fix is a band aid on the disconnect mechanic. I expect a new video tonight. 
---
I bought it for $40 and don’t regret it a bit. 
---
If you liked wandering the wasteland in older fallouts then this is a game for you. 
---
But it doesn't lmao. 
---
Yup. Beth have a direction they want you to play in and you are not allowed to deviate from it. It's their way or nothing at all.
---
Internet is a big issue. I only had lots of disconnects on release when the servers were more unstable than an unfinished nuclear bomb.
---
Maybe tomorrow.
---
You ok there, buddy?
---
I came for the Easter eggs and was disappointed. Get us the inside scoop my dude!
---
Thats reasonable, but a lot of people made claims like "If you open up a trade, people can take whatever they want out of your inventory without you even making an offer!".
---
I want this
---
We'll see if it's been stopped... 
---
Honestly we should have a robot somewhere in the game where we can just pay the caps to remove the bounty. Maybe make the warden at the penitentiary allow you to pay off your bounty.
---
Still no custom keybind for CAMP, photomode and VATS?
---
Guess I’ll keep waiting..
---
Reddit did this. Thank you Reddit.
---
Was it so hard to mute people?
---
Way to take away one of the best group activities for leveling up in the game. Sadface. If we aren't going to be able to level easily, we need to be able to trade in unused perk cards in order to help us achieve certain builds.
---
Turn in 5 cards to receive a new card pack without the bubble gum. Allow us to actually trade cards between players. something...
---
Aight cheers. You must be a fun one at parties.
---
Same, unless it’s been chasing me for a solid minute or two, at that point i kill it, they’re a tedious fight for next to no gain, not even juicy xp
---
😂 i got an inside man, time to infiltrate bethesda 
---
Holy shit. I’ve found my calling.
---
Most games I've played do allow the highest levels with the best gear to become pretty Herculean.
---
That was my one peeve for not purchasing them, great that they fixed it.
---
You can have fun with the game, I also agree that there is quite a lot to find, read, hear. Specially when you are into stories and such. There a very nice places, that take you into the world of Fallout...
---
...but other people just don't have fun, because the game is broken. They payed money for it and they are angry because of that. Bethesda needs to see, that there are a lot of pissed people, so they learn their lessons and prevent such things for the future. This game was way to early to be released. What we now have is a BETA.
---
They knew this would happen. Everyone who played a Fallout or TES game knew that this will happen. It was more than careless to let this happen. This is a full-priced unfinished game, that already had after some weeks multiple price reductions. If you bought it for $60, this is more than a slap into your face.
---
Tons of bug and glitches. So many duped items that the server crashes on a regular bases. The economy is beyond broken. Quests you can't finish, because of bugs or crashes. They could have said after the B.E.T.A. "Ok guys, we found a lot of bugs and issues, we will extend the B.E.T.A. to fix the issues, before we go live, so you can have a much better launch experience.
---
Bethesda stated already, they don't have the tools to fight duped items. Why? Why don't they developed tools to monitor and manipulate the game? This is a MAJOR point. Those tools are necessary to help people with bugs and issues. Also to get rid of cheaters. They are essential for an online game. This is something, where you can see, they just don't care.
---
They come with plasters to aid a ripped of leg. They need to learn, that they now play on survival difficulty and limbs do not heal automatically.  
---
Agreed.  Medium Scope is much more comfortable for a sniper.  You won't shoot at something outside of range as much either.
---
I thought it was just me but they did increase the zoom. I'm not going mad, right?
---
I played for an hour tonight and picked up 5 fusions cores from dead npc and containers. I think they've increased the amount you'll find from other places other than generators.
---
Okay, I either forgot or didn't know about the damage value updating.
---
Having said that, you are welcome to leave your negativity at the door next time :P
---
Yeah I have a paint combi with the christmas chest and nuka legs and Arms. Same Red color and looks really like a Nuka Christmas Edition :D
---
The issue isn’t the perk limit, it’s the excessive QoL perks. I know it amounts to more or less the same thing but they need to knock a few ranks off most perks (while retaining the max effect)
---
On a side, if you dont play, you dont like it, why do you care at all? Boring life? Personal delusions?
---
Sure. I'll be on in about a hour or so. Gt: endlessthreat
---
Look over your shoulder for what? The guy who’s going to one shot you with a TSE? lol 
---
Updating a ded game? Lol
---
I mean have you seen the smog in LA? shit is rough. 
---
Are you talking about the swamp that's near Ella Ames's bunker?  I've seen the Queen there if that's the spot you refer to.
---
Which part makes it jingle? That’d drive me insane!
---
i havent disconnected which is great but i dont see much of a change in crashing, places like flatwoods, summersville, charleston etc will crash if i go deep enough just like earlier
---
Dude... Read!
---
He wants to pump out dozens of Gauss rifles AND simultaneously pick locks.
---
The game's economy never had a chance to establish itself because dupers flooded it with everything early on. It's fluctuating rapidly because they can grow their inventories exponentially. Prices should have been and were insanely high launch week. And then they plummeted because nothing has any value because the supply heavily outweighs demand. Again... It's simple economics.
---
And aside from the market, duping puts heavy strain on the servers and makes everything suck for everyone. You're the ones crashing the game. 
---
id buy it
---
Yea I find that they are hard to hit no matter what weapon you use. Their movement patterns are far too inconsistent and jerky. 
---
No, no limit at all. I have both legs with acrobat and I take no damage at all from any height.
---
I regularly leap off the buildings in Watoga without a single point of HP loss.
---
Chest part of course 😂
---
It definitely wasn't bad... I just am probably burned out of big cooking shows (masterchef, top chef, hells kitchen, etc).  
---
My dc's eere fine until recently.  Hoping the patch helps curb the exploits that cause crashes.
---
Have they fixed the reload animation for the fucking lever action?
---
This one confuses me, because I know my expert/master/normal rifleman perks were raising my tooltip damage on the gauss rifle; I specifically had taken them off and checked my damage, then put them back on and checked the increase. I specifically wanted to figure out of the gauss rifle was a "rifle" and it looked like it was always working normally to me. 
---
If you get that "account was logged in from another device" you should change your bethesda.net password immediately. 
---
in 270 hours I haven't seen any explosive weapons. I've had maybe 2 two shot. Nothing for myself or any of my 8 friends that play with both.
---
Yeah, once I got my first hunting rifle and 10mm pistol, I dropped pipe weapons like they were hot garbage. Can't see a compelling case for why you'd want to use them--other than the fact that .38 ammo is everywhere, which mostly just means you'll never run out of ammo as you slowly chip away at enemies' HP bars at a rate that can only be described as "glacial".
---
Oh, because he has a locked terminal next to his crafting bench! My mistake.
---
Is it? I was lied to then. Hell people's "fix" for douchebags that put thier base close to whitespring was to turn on pacifist mode so if you  accidentally hit the base the turrets won't return on you. 
---
Internet is wrong again I guess
---
Only a synth could put themselves through that kind of torture🤫
---
Ah yes
---
Not everyone does pvp and this game is not dependent on it or even based around it. Pvp is more of a side thing to do. 
---
same here! 
---
I even decided to start using unarmed so that I wasnt using my rifles 100% of the time and while it did save on ammo consumption and ultimately ammo crafting; I still run out on steel. 
---
I think the issue for me is that a lot of things that yield larger amounts of steel are heavy. like yeah I can pick up every wrench and screwdriver but damn near everything uses steel to repair or craft so I just run through it without realizing.  
---
I wish they would allow us to have different layouts...my melee perk build, my camp perk build, and my shotgun perk build.  It takes forever to switch out the cards and i wish they would allow it to change with a button.  I know there is a mod but i dont use mods.
---
Sweet zombie jesus, this is the best idea EVER. Go enjoy your broken lagged out servers and leave the rest of us in peace.
---
Nice! That's a lot! I didn't see the assaultron head bug in there, so just wanted to say it's still happening, uses all ammo in one shot. Keep up the great work, thanks for the awesome game!
---
Honestly I just want a nice Legendary Gauss for my scientist, Legendary Death Claw/Power Fist for my Melee, and RailRifle for my Heavy build that I want to create with Flechettes.
---
I'm actually kinda nervous to ever actually get a TSE weapon because so far they appear to break the game and just delete enemies instantly, at which point I'm sure I'll get bored.
---
I just reloaded last night about 100 times in Watoga (lv77) to find Gatling Gun plans.  
---
I then reloaded maybe 25 times in at Welch station for MG42 plans (LMG).
---
100% agree, not really a fan of them literally shooting fart juice at me neither (when they fly and shoot sonic balls out whilst facing the other way)
---
All the power to you then, have fun with PVE. =)
---
Yes, to all the above.
---
If I were in PostApocalyptia, I'd be hoarding EVERYTHING. I'd be building sheds just to hold excess screws and fusion cores.
---
Seriously. When your survival could depend on having a specific item on hand, who would throw away excess?
---
I haven't found any yet but I would guess Watoga and Harpers Ferry.
---
I used one and liked it. But being unable to actually explore more than one area with it makes it non-viable for most people. 
---
&gt;It does make you wonder, if NPC raiders were added today that would kill you, and attack your camp, would people be on here tomorrow demanding their removal?
---
No, because they wouldn't be toting around extremely powerful TSE weaponry while being specced for it's utilization that allows them to one shot you. Not to mention it would actually give a reason for the various turrets/traps.
---
I'll deal with waves of raiders coming at me to protect my stuff. But some bored dude that's carrying multiple TSE weaponry while specced for max damage and also drunk &amp; high on even more damage buffs that simply deletes you with a button press or two? No thanks. 
---
All my memories
---
I wish they would fix the spawn rate of handmade plans.
---
i used to live out there. You know how cold states have snow days for school? we had air days where you weren't supposed to go outside unnecessarily because of the air quality. 
---
(PC) I've been trying to get the game to load me into a world for 24 minutes.
---
You will be able to buy a plan for your camp which gives you access to the (level 3 appearance from FO4) storefronts.
---
How it will work is another kettle of fish entirely. But it's coming... along with backpacks of various flavours and colours.
---
As a gatling laser user. I go through 5-7 cores every time I fight a scorch beast.
---
Why I can make plasma cores with acid and common house hold materials but a fusion core requires shit from a nuke zone is beyond me. 
---
this is oddly specific
---
Do you have a Mic? If so add me skflatlander. Also where are you planning on nuking?
---
Im a melee main with 0 skills in ranged, i found a vampiric assault rifle i use to fight scorch beasts. I had to fight one right after the other a couple nights ago and last night i fought 3 in a blast zone.

---
Shoot the wings, run AT THEM, not away or around, directly under them so they have to turn around a lot, it seems to trigger the land sequence.
---
I'm not sure I follow what you mean? :)
---
I run traveling pharmacy 3 and sturdy frame 2. In power armor, I switch SF 2 to full charge 2 so I can sprint in power armor. In Perception, I run concentrated fire 3 and 1 in each of the rifle perks. In Charisma and Int perks, I have too many to list but I have a team loadout and a solo loadout that are both completely different, except maybe both have travel agent 1 in them. In intelligence I usually run gunsmith 5, and I have almost all of the crafting and base-building stuff. In Agility I always run action boy 3, and on a team I run adrenaline 5 and I share that card. Solo, I run sneak 3 and adrenaline 1 and escape artist 1. In Luck, I basically run bloody mess and pharma farma 3.
---
I may shift 2 from INT to LUCK since I've had 2 starched genes drop for me without picking them, and all my friends ride the mutation train.
---
But I'm rambling. I seem to do OK overall.
---
Cheers!
---
If you're on pc there's a mod to reduce the visuals. 
---
You need to gather your thoughts first before you write (otherwise you give away the state of your triggering too easily). I purchased the game at Launch (worst decision / purchase ever) stuttered though it for a few hours, crashed decided it was time to put it down until it improves, picked it up recently and its still poor. So yh just enjoy watching you fools cry and moan at all the valid criticisms that this garbage game rightly receives. 
---
If I can survive 6 of them at once for 5 seconds while level 45 at point blank range via melee with nothing but a hazmat suit to protect me (and *not* specced into "Ironclad", then you'll be perfectly fine with your insta-gibbing TSE Shotgun while wearing fully modded power armor while at range. 
---
Now a level 90 glowing yua guai? By all means, delete him from fucking existence, that bastard one shotted me and was eating TSE rounds
---
But then I’ll have to stand there forever and wait and maybe get 2, just like with my purified water maker. I never get what it promises so I have no hope for that to work out either 
---
Now, when I am trying to go to sleep at night, I can just watch my quad lever action reload.
---
Getting quite a few disconnects and controls disabled. Hasn't crashed yet though.
---
Servers seem very unpopulated, so we'll see.
---
Im getting that since release, I thought it’s kinda ipv6 thing/with my provider 
---
How am I supposed to make a more Direct Title? It's pretty much the whole thing...
---
Wish in one hand, shit in the other, see which fills up first...
---
How’d you know?
---
I also built here.  Ill grab my screenshots when i get home and show you my build.  It's pretty sweet.  I built myhouse so the waterfall runs through it.
---
"Rads will no longer completely be removed when by dying repeatedly."
---
OwO
---
Pretty sure that’s the one already in the store 
---
I have a police report full of sources. Easy to find on twitter.
---
Yes hunting rifles have suppressors. So easy to get too because of how plentiful these rifles are from enemies.
---
Same thing for me with the freezing at those locations. Can't access entire areas of the map. I did a queen earlier but crashed halfway through. Not pleased at all. 
---
Yeah I got fireproof perks from my original build. But it was so useless I never used it. Good to know!
---
Aight thats even worse. You even spent money on it. And I dont mind appearing as an easy trigger, I dont need some mass identification to deal with my self esteem like most of you do.
---
If they keep nerfing without adding more content, there will just be nerfed content with nothing new and do you really want that?
---
If you liked Fallout 4, go for it.    
---
If you liked Fallout 3 or New Vegas, prolly go for it, especially for that price.  
---
If a semi-sandbox experience sounds good to you, packed with little secrets and fun emergent gameplay, go for it.
---
If you expect a "normal" MMO experience, you'll be disappointed.  
---
If you're expecting a fully-polished game with no bugs, you'll be disappointed.  
---
How this game wasn't released with a beta tag is astonishing.
---
Ahh yea, I wasn't very clear on that one. Thank you for that.
---
I think I was going for "The game doesn't consider that initiating PVP" but I just threw it all together and in turn it messed up what I was trying to say. When I was referring to being wanted I *think* I was going for if you hit a few stray shots in someones back they can't turn around and then initiate PVP to kill you.   *I had that happen at launch before I ran around w/Pacifist on. We were doing an event and I guess the dude wanted my junk too as when the last enemy died to clear the event ("feed the hungry" or whatever) he turned around and lit into me &amp; killed me because the game thought I was trying to initiate combat when he was running back &amp; forth in front of my gunfire while I tried to kill the enemy he killed :\
---
That's what happens when you only got a few min to create a post before you have to go back inside to work :(
---
That happened to me, but I didn't click on it to deposit my chest piece. I only deposited the food stuff. I didn't lose anything. So I guess you must have clicked on it and deposited it without paying attention?
---
There are so many ways this could be done but don't use Atoms, that then makes the premium currency have a game mechanic ability and haters would love to dump a truck load of salt on that. Thoughts on what else could be done:
---
* Since perks cap at level 50, make the cost sacrificing a level after level 51. Though if this reset XP needed to level it could be used to unlock all perk cards quicker.
---
* Have a daily quest in the &gt;!Science Wing of the Enclave!&lt; that unlocks at level 50. Maybe something that clones you. Completion would reset your SPECIAL to 1.
---
* Let you reset every 10 levels starting at level 50. This could be in lieu of a perk card pack.
---
* Respec anytime. Make it cost caps. This is boring.
---
I'd really enjoy the thought of attaching a quest to it, make the respec part of the RP meta rather than just saying "In the past day I lost 40 lbs of muscle and learned how to do advanced mental maths for no reason other than because."
---
You can still pay to respec in WoW and it's relatively cheap.
---
Still getting locked up by Charlston and disconnected me during a pretty tame queen fight.
---
I doubt that, but would be neat if someone could post whether it does or doesn't.
---
They fixed the Lever Action Rifle reload (according to the notes, haven't tried it). Finally!   
---
These are also welcome:  
---
* **Crafting**: “Hardened Mass” will no longer be scrapped when “Scrap All Junk” is selected. 
---
* **Repairing**: Overall repair costs have been lowered for both weapons and armor.  
---
I would also like to see the option to prevent scrapping of favorite items.
---
I’m wondering if everyone is confused about the xp subject or if it is just me that got it wrong.
---
AFAIK, they fixed those random 600-700 xp drops from bloaties, as they said they equaled the xp you got from a boss (i.e, sbq).
---
I haven’t gone to a nuke post patch, are they still giving 300-400 xp per kill? If so, that’s hardly a nerf.
---
There are certain items that if you bulk them, you save weight. Look into that
---
Me and a few of my Buddies launched a nuke and then just after we killed the qween. Everyone in the area started getting 1 shot by one of the other players. We even had Pacifist mode on and still got got killed with 1 hit.
---
Hmm, that does seem a bit unfair but on the other hand didn't want 20 people having the same legendary weapon...one person gets the legendary loot, everyone else gets wood legs! :P 
---
They'll still try and dupe for a while, crashing the server as they do, when they realise it doesn't work they'll stop.   
---
So the reason that I specifically mentioned Bear Arms is because you'll have to carry _several_ large guns that all break quickly. If you're just wanting to do Gatling+Super Sledge and remember to fix your weapon anytime you're near a weapons bench... you'll probably be fine without Bear Arms.
---
The firing rate boost is also going to decrease the weapon condition faster (much faster if you're using Two-Shot and much faster on the Laser Gatling).
---
Fallout damage favors big-one-shot over many-little-shots, so you'll want to get your Heavy Guns damage up as high as you possibly can or you'll just be peeing away ammo (especially true for Laser Gatling with ballistic Gatling not being as bad).
---
An Armor Piercing (Sharp) Sledgehammer (or powerfist if you go without PA) does really well without Incisor and if you can find one with bonus limb damage _use that_ instead of One Gun Army on scorchbeasts.
---
But have you changed the password? 
---
It’s a recent change. It was useless, and now it’s good. I re-specced for it
---
Come on man those things give like 2x - 4x what bosses or quests give.  It was bound to happen, u just gotta play legit now lol
---
Have a buddy craft them for you?  I bought the plans off the Watoga BoS vendor I htink they were 774 and 986? with my charisma 6 grape mens and 3 hard bargain.    
---
If on xbox and you have the mats I never charge a service fee.   
---
Also I have T45 jet pack ,stealth boy, and calibrated for those looking for something different. Sorry no luck on t 60 calibrated or jetpacks on the xbox. 
---
You can get another chest piece and weapon. You don't need to quit. You can find new stuff.
---
Happens when two people look at the same mob at the same time.  Sometimes looking away from the corpse and then looking back will generate the loot.
---
There’s another way to do it, but it’s more risky. 
---
You have have a friend online that you know is going to stay on that world for like 5 minutes. Put your items into a lootable container in the world somewhere. Switch characters, join the same world that your friend is on, loot the container you put the stuff in. 
---
You have to have more faith in the servers than I do though. 
---
Melee vats doesn’t work if your target is standing 3 metres above you. 
---
pretty sure some players would like that
---
SNL reference I like it
---
I agree. I think that would be reasonable.
---
The amount of damage a melee weapon does is effected by its condition. i repair my supersledge with weapon artisan and at 200% and 8/9 2h weapon perks my SS does 300 damage, as the condition over 100% decreases the damage does too.
---
If you have high luck you find weapons that have more than 100% condition
---
Problem is they do either energy or ballistic in 76 so its less efective
---
I actively seek other CAMPS to judge them. Most of them are basically double wides. However, every now and then I get treated to a good one. I always give directions to mine if the owner is around if they want to go judge my place. 
---
Increase your Luck. 
---
Great. So more ballistic fiber needed for everything. Maybe make the shit findable first. Everything else is fine. But jesus give me some fiber!!
---
It's not negativity if it's the truth. Christ you people on this sub are a bizarre bunch, but every game specific sub has them...
---
are you just east of the crashed plane? im pretty sure my camp is on top of that same cliff!
---
Take a bunch or workshops... defend get good xp and caps.   
---
Being a shitlord in a area that is about to be nerfed (and is already on the PC) into the ground is not worth it. 
---
They can absolutely kill you through slap damage. No, they don't usually hunt you down. What they do is wait for you to take and set up a workshop and then contest it, one-shot you, and win. The only time I encounter these dorks is when I'm trying to take a workshop and it absolutely happens frequently. I think it's because nobody wants to bother with their overpowered asses so they have to find other ways to engage in PVP. So, these lamers cheated their way to the top and have nothing to do but annoy other people lmao. 
---
I have very little respect for dupers and those that benefited from them. At the end of the day, they're absolutely cheaters and they should be permanently banned. Part of me wants to say take all the duped weapons away but innocent players could get caught in the crossfire. I'd rather see TSE get nerfed to oblivion, our ability to survive them buffed, or the release of a new weapon tier that outdates them. 
---
Even if they weren't hurting anything, which I argue they definitely are by spreading these low effort weapons, allowing one form of cheating is just opening the door for more. 
---
You don't have to rebuild when it doesn't place. It rebuilds it next time you log in. But I'm also on pc!
---
Yeah I was constantly using power armor because I never went through a full core before logging off and then I'd log back in later with a full core.
---
Hahaha exactly!!! 
---
I am levelling up quick enough, looks like they nerfed Stims a little though. . 
---
It would certainly discourage some forms of group play...but yea, I would like some more danger in the game but not sure this is the best solution. Just right now the only impressive damage numbers I see are from those armor-piercing general robots...
---
Alrighty, I'll be on around 7pm eastern and I'll be in touch
---
Ultimately I'd like an increase on special points too. 
---
But I'd settle for 3 or 4 preset decks we could customize too. Ultimately I'd like them to have their own arrangement of the 50 special points.
---
I agree it is so constrained once you get to higher levels. Yes all cards may be available, but if I want to max out my damage on rifles I have to perpetually swap out cards every time I have to lock pick. If I want to make ammo or modify weapons I have to swap out cards for weapon integrity first. And if I want to switch from using pistols to melee or heavy guns, well forget it. 
---
It feels like a lot of cards should have been combined, stimpack and rad away being more efficient. Junk and food items weighing less etc. 
---
The QoL cards are absolutely necessary with the limitations of the game but take up so many slots that it's almost impossible to work on building up damage and so on. 
---
I'd really like to see decks, with their own points for : crafting ( all the reduced material and artisan cards equipped), exploring/scavenging/selling (carry weight, extra harvesting and searching for item cards), nuke zone (radiation perks, speed perks etc) and then maybe two slots to set up builds for different types of weapons. 
---
I know we shouldn't compare to previous games but in 4 you were actually rewarded for leveling up, you could up damage on a pistol and a rifle and switch between with no issues. The card system just seems so restrictive and punishing. 
---
I'd even settle for one extra special point every 3 or 5 levels past 50. 
---
Have family there, can confirm. It’s part of their weather reports.
---
Yeah it's just annoying as hell cause I can't use my favourite weapon.
---
You are failing to see the ability to reach your target with speed demon.
---
Furious expo 50 cals make short work of hazmatters even in passive. 
---
Yep!
---
How about a fix for power armor pieces unequipping themselves every time you fast travel or exit and reenter PA?
---
I'd just like the perks for weight management I have invested and have equipped to apply to my 600 stash limit.  
---
Sadly it has nothing to do with xp gains, and this will effect newer players more than the ones like myself who are already level 240 and don't care about XP anymore.  Whitesprings is the hottest spot on the map for two main reasons - one is that there's nowhere else with a concentration of spawning mobs that dense in one place, two is that there's a crafting station safely inside the resort right there to make flux and break stuff down when overweight.  
---
At this point we've nuked pretty much everywhere on the map and the results of elsewhere are far lesser regardless of XP unless you need Queen loot such as serum recipes.
---
Tip: Leave Whitesprings.
---
I will say loadouts would be awesome but it's not that big of a pain in the ass to switch around perks
---
The comment that made me feel a bit melancholy was when Vlad asked Mia if she was lonely, and she said that she didn’t know.
---
Interesting, thanks!
---
no no, if you have the legs examine them in your menu, then compare them to your player model. You'll see the difference 
---
So basically, have to rely on super mutants for higher end legendaries? Also need to be a stealth sniper to deal with that one with the TSE light machine gun?
---
Basically your "solution" is allow melee to one shot because reasons. That isn't proper balance.
---
Bobby Pins going from 0.1 to 0.001 thank you!!! 
---
And make certain perks passive. Allow us to hack level 1 or lock pick level 1 passively at level 15, level 2 at level 25 and so on. We dont need 3 points of 2 different specials to do those things. And then to have to swap them out every time you find a safe or terminal  because you need the gun damage cards on to explore. 
---
Really? Sick
---
shhhh 👄☝🏻
---
They look like they’re all pointing to one single location. Not just in one direction
---
All that means is that customer support doesn't have those tools. It's a big assumption that Bethesda doesn't. 
---
I run speed demon along marsupial, man. You are confused about how fast speed demon makes you; it isn’t much.
---
I replied. I am hard when you’re driving.
---
Perk loadouts would be amazing!
---
Maybe you need to browse the forums more, they do. They really do. To the point there are 100's of threads on min maxing for ALL builds out there for all to see and use.
---
Problem is the though that TSE is fine the way it is .. when a majority of the players have issues with it vs the few who white knight for it as if it's really necessary for that combo of effects to be in the game.
---
One or the other is fine .. that is the consensus. Make explosive not be effected by perks, again one of the highest voted opinions. This lets both effects be in game and everyone gets cake and gets to eat it.
---
I mean we could all call for the extreme, for a flat out expulsion of the explosive effect all together in favor of using REAL explosive weaponry I.E the auto grenade launch, M79 .. etc.
---
Meh. I'm not gonna do that man... That's not how the game is designed and unless you're on my team, it isn't my responsibility to make sure you get yours.
---
Now if you wanna party up and give me that sweet sweet xp and mutation bonus, then that's another story.
---
(Ironic coming from a person who similarly purchased it and goes into an online anonymous echo chamber (to gain some affirmation) to cry about how some individuals have the sense to call out this hideous game for what it is)
---
20% move speed adds up. 
---
specific time until they reset to something else. 
---
Right, but you can't see what those plans are called.
---
What level of purifier are you using and how many do you have?  They do have a cap on how much they can store so even though it says it makes X per hour you'll never be able to get more than a fraction of that due to its limited container size.  To make it even weirder with water purifiers, as I understand it spreads your production out across every purifier in your camp.
---
Same. I invested heavily into melee now to try and get ahead of the steel consumption 
---
I haven’t proposed any solutions. Just stated melee is useless against marsupial + long range builds, regardless of explosive weapons.
---
It won’t be
---
Thank you :)
---
I don’t know why it would. For two shot guns you don’t load twice as much ammo nor does it consume twice as much. They’re just perks that effect how the weapon behaves. I don’t own a double/quad lever action to test it, so who knows for sure. 
---
Yay, you got the perk name right. However, no DPS stat is stated in-game. Do you mean the stated damage, the stated fire rate, an unstated calculation based off the two...? I could believe the condition might scale solely off stated fire rate, regardless of damage done...it wouldn't make much sense from a gameplay perspective, but it would track what we're observing.
---
What were the items? Surely they're replaceable. A Vault Suit certainly is.
---
very very cool
---
Everyone besides the dupers themselves want those assholes banned. 
---
Best case scenario: Cheaters banned, duped items deleted
---
Acceptable scenario: Cheaters banned, items kept (though made obsolete through content updates/rebalancing)
---
Unacceptable scenario: No one is punished and BGS is once again a laughing stock for not only allowing exploits to go on for this long, but to do nothing to punish the cheaters, basically announcing they don't care about what their players want and deserve.
---
Errrm...just look at the stats of guns per capita, and see by how much USA leads everybody else in that department. USA has approximately 120 guns, runner-up has 62. Look at state laws to see what's allowed in terms of open and concealed carry, quite a lot is allowed that is totally illegal right across the border in Canada, meaning you're much more likely to be around someone with a gun, even when it is legal. When polled, something like 40% of Americans say they own a gun, or are cohabiting with someone who does. The percentage is higher in rural areas, and drops in urban areas, but it's still quite high. This stuff isn't really up for debate.
---
And I'm not saying teach your kids marksmanship or give them CQB firearms training. But do teach them enough so that they don't accidentally shoot themselves or someone else. Like that story about a kid playing Russian Roulette with a semiautomatic...it did not go well. Or a story from just a week ago where one teen shot another by accident, and committed suicide. I'll say this much for the school training I went through - they taught us not to point a loaded gun at someone's head, and hammered that point in enough. 
---
At the core though, I don't understand the argument *against teaching children safety*. Be that safety with guns, vehicles, knives, chemicals, etc. There's nothing *to be lost* by teaching your kids these things, and everything to be gained. Knowledge is never harmful. 
---
That’s being patched. 
---
This gets posted every week.  Sorry for your loss.
---
&gt;Unless someone willingly shows others his countless duped items, I would not know how those evidence would be acquired.
---
You know the game records your inventory, and your actions, into a log that the developers have access to, right?
---
It's a trivial query to check who has obviously duped inventory counts. It's even more trivial to then bulk action on those accounts. 
---
Saying that Bethesda "lacks the toolsets to detect cheating." is laughably ignorant. You admittedly don't even know how the duping process works. 
---
Some of these are nice, but the scorched issue of them firing when not looking like it should have been fixed in other enemies first i would think. Who the hell cares about scorched, they aren't really much of a threat at most levels unless there's a bunch. But things like Mutants can be, when they are looking down and their gun is pointing up and to the side they should not be able to fire! lol
---
&gt; Most of the negativity about this game is coming from an extremely vocal minority
---
Only on Reddit, "normies" are avoiding this like the plague. Any topic that hits the front page from this subreddit gets decimated with truth.
---
Pop a Rad-X to temporarily (I think 10 minutes?) remove all mutation effects.
---
Same here brotha the only two shot I have found was a combat rifle I used for a little bit. I got lucky and ran into a few people who traded me for some of these TSE guns. Gave away some of my best unduped unyielding gear I found for these most likely duped weapons. 
---
Ah so one edge case makes it ok for melee to be one shot against
---
Shotguns+Short range rifles+Pistols+Anything not long range marsupial?
---
Why would people be excited to not have the glitch anymore ? If people are not making criminal money like the people in ebay, the glitch lets YOU have the ability to actually have the freedom of using anything you want with out grinding and losing your actual time . Also the instability issue , Bethesda isn't helping themselves with the way they take care of their game by having lazy workarounds . 
---
Wowwwwwww how did i not know thisssssss
---
Like how you can pay off your bounty in RDR 2.
---
It was a three star legendary stalkers mole miners gauntlet with 100% chance to hit outside of vats with 20% reduced dmg while blocking.
---
My chest piece was a three star legendary zealots chest piece with reduced weight and increased dmg resistance the lower my health.
---
After the amount of game play I've invested and the rarity of these drops let alone the fact it's the only mole miners I've seen like that I lean towards the chance I will not see one within my game play like it again
---
The chest piece was great also but I've seen a few pieces similar to it
---
I just feel that after something like this it's not worth it anymore giving the fact I received no help from Bethesda in the past.
---
If I knew I would get support like blizzard who replaced items I've lost before. In The 10 years I played that I wouldn't find it that frustrating by comparison.
---
Someone hacked my account vendored my rok'delar after cataclysm and they still gave it back it was only a memento but still 
---
Perks that only work in party and if your teammates are mutated too; kinda specific.
---
You are projecting a lot, over a very inacuous dissapointment that I have that laser and plasma rifles are still pretty bad. The way you over exaggerate this is comical, like some how a bunch of arm chair developers are hurting the people Bethesda's feelings. They ain't bitch made, they continue to work, and I'm doing nothing more than expressing my desire to have better energy rifles, while your panties get so in a twist they vanish into the 4th dimension.
---
Exterminators Pole Hook, with 50% reflect. Legit replaced my Vampires pole hook with it. 
---
Both are easy to get as armor plan spawns in Cranberry Bog.
---
Oh interesting...any bones or deathclaw specific?
---
Please excuse my ignorance, but what is "TSEs" :o?
---
If you mean BoS Officer Underarmor. I’m *fairly* certain I found the plans for that at the NAR Repair Yard just outside of watoga. I’m not going to say I *did* find them there, only because I don’t remember.
---
In the Cranberry Bog on the ground near Pylon V-13 there is a duffel bag with a key in it. That's the starting point. 
---
Who doesn’t? Lol.
---
How do you enable pacifist mode? I only have 30~ hours, and haven’t seen to naturally find out how to.
---
as a melee character, i really wish i could pick up and throw all those wrenches as an alternative to the knife and tomahawk. 
---
The marine under armour comes in plans that spawn around cranberry bog and the mire and the item can drop from mirelurk queens.
---
The BoS officer under armour (black coloured solider suit) plans supposedly spawn in cranberry bog but i havent been able to find them yet.
---
I was diagnosed with a life altering illness and this game helped me through it so it makes it even harder for me
---
Anyone notice that the grenade hotkey selection doesn't reset anymore when logging in?
---
Not sure if I missed it but I didn't see it in the patch notes.
---
Because they take up way too much weight, as compared to each previous Fallout game.
---
Rumor is they want to see (now that duping is patched) if upping the stash limit actually did hinder the servers at all
---
This is factual. The amount of items is only a table number. It’s things like plans and maps that really kill a characters performance. 
---
It reads the Robco Fun or it gets the hose again!
---
Once again I've never read it all though noe I wish I had it sucks you have to be cautious when playing a game in this manner.
---
Gotta give you props. I meant fire rate. I agree it wouldn't make sense, but I have all rifleman and commando perks and my semi autos definitely "seem" to last longer, so I wouldn't put it past them. Let's just hope this shit gets figured out soon.
---
I feel bad for the guy I watched drop 100 Bobby pins 2 days ago. All mine, and I now have room for them!
---
Probably players with duped inventories logging in.  No idea why they haven't been outright banned yet.
---
I thought of editing my comment but that’s be stupid.
---
In my personal experience, Marine Underarmor plan has a chance to spawn at Sunday Brothers’ Cabin on a barrel in the shed which the weapons bench is in. Most of the time there’s also a PA chassis and some armor that you can do with as you may.
---
It's been less than two months from release to this bug being fixed.
---
That's not a laser gun though. We are talking about the ones that shoot red lasers. The damage on those is pitiful. 
---
I'm on PS4, thanks though 
---
That’s the least of the issues, get them mutated aswell.
---
Imagine having to be 24/7 in party just to have your perks become efficient GASP.
---
I would understand there will be no more duping.. but dupers still have their massive inv to log to servers with. Or does the patch reset their inv somehow?
---
And the bug where fondations can't be removed/scrapped in our CAMP? :'(
---
I would throw money at the screen for another stash box.  
---
Neither. Read it again. 
---
Not only should they be banned, but Bethesda needs to removed all of these duped items or this game is already dead - the economy and balance of the game is going to be ruined for the foreseeable feature - long enough for legitimate players to get frustrated and just quit playing.
---
I just want to play in a "clean" online experience and right now that is impossible with a significant number of players above level 50 running around with duped TSE weapons they bought on eBay.
---
Two Shot Explosive. It is a legendary with the effects of 2 shot and explosive rounds
---
You are also defending dupers in another post, so that would make sense XD
---
"FaLlOuT 76 BaD"
---
I never said it was okay? Why are you making things up?
---
Confusing part about stash weight is when you have perks. It shows reduced the reduced weight in stash instead of full weight. 
---
How much does the low health stuff end up mattering?  I was on that track but it seems annoying to be so low health, and the %s from nerd rage (and adrenal?*) weren’t huge.  Meanwhile instigating is better than bloodied against anything but SBQ assuming you always one-shot normal mobs?  And the trade off is a ton of max health and it made room in perks to support explosives - I was thinking my nuke strategy would be an auto grenade launcher and probably power armor, jumping around tagging/blasting things?  But is that actually effective or will I need to hazmat punch stuff?
---
I can see that bloodied is better when you hit many times but if you only hit SBQ 3 times total instigating isn’t that much worse?  Just my naive read and would love to hear your experience with this, I’m at a crossroads in my build tonight.
---
* on that note, how good is adrenal?  What’s the damage boost and health threshold?
---
You should post some sources if you're going to make a bunch of crazy allegations about rape and hate speech. Also, please explain rape culture. You sound like a nut.
---
That's a build choice. Shouldn't be op still. 
---
My point is if your defense for melee is that one niche build that counters it there is an issue when many other builds are weak to melee. 
---
Two shot Explosive
---
That's like 2 shot any high powered weapon though. There's not really anything unique to set it apart from ballistic weps.
---
You do know.
---
They just released patch notes detailing the nerfing on exp given from glowing ones. By how much? I have no idea.
---
It just makes me happy all my characters are over 50 cause now ... hahahaha ... even more grindy.
---
good idea, i m french but gonna follow it !
---
Start &gt; settings &gt;gameplay &gt; pacifist mode
---
Something like that,  I'm not home at the moment :)
---
If you go to the watoga station and follow the tracks west you will find an orange cart. A skeleton in that cart and some boxes. The plan for the officer bos underarmor spawns on the boxes.
---
A slight error at the end:
---
&gt;unit
---
I believe you meant unite
---
Other than that, this seems like an amazing idea! I love it! Hope it gets popular!
---
Wish I could help you.. Xbone here
---
I own other quad guns and they do reload more ammo. It holds more ammo in the clip. That's the perk.
---
&gt; For two shot guns you don’t load twice as much ammo nor does it consume twice as much. 
---
??? They're two totally different perks that involve different aspects of the guns. Two shot has nothing to do with ammo capacity or reload. Double and Quad directly specify they increase ammo capacity.
---
 omg thanks so much, the amount of times i’ve been killed by love 100-250’s in nuke zones from accidentally hitting them will now hopefully stop 
---
Yep. More devastating as a ranged newbie was losing all my AMMO in one click. I thought I was ahead of the game until that point.
---
They nerf xp gains without a solution to lack of enjoyable content.
---
I'm more concerned about the one in picture 2 pointing the other way.
---
Very true. 800 now, 1000 next time, 1500 next time, and so on. 
---
Did you end up putting points in luck of the draw?  I see a lot of melee builds with one point and wondering if that’s the sweet spot.  Thanks!
---
Take the race track workshop in the far west.
---
Wrong. Generators and turrets require screws and gears. It’s a pain in the ass to get those.
---
What they did was idiotic to begin with, on fundamental level. If I'm switching from melee to pistols, that's going to take 40-60 levels. Meaning, it's easier and faster to make an alt. Secondly, halfway through the process, my character will be no longer melee, and not yet pistols. Meaning leveling will become very, very uncomfortable for a while. It's an absolutely awful system even on conceptual level. I just hope it's something they slapped together so we wouldn't be stuck once they start heavily modifying the perks (which they just started doing), and that it's just a placeholder until they can do it properly.
---
That is not what double and quad do. You are thinking of two shot. Double and quad give you twice or 4 times the ammo capacity in your clip.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking, as I was gonna be that way, still using it for the sheer am out of legendary enemies that spawn 
---
Yes, I had a furious one at one point. 
---
Yeah, I noticed that as well. 
---
Yea thats a lot of pretty words. At least I am having fun while you are spilling acid. Keep going.
---
See see recursion 
---
I built my camp on a junk node and pull some decent junk out of it. Those 3 junk items are the most sought after and would probably make people loot and explore less. While I think it's a great idea it would have to be a plan you could only get at higher level like 75 or something high to keep newer players wandering the wastelands or no one would bother looting or exploring. It's litterarly the only reason I go out looting other places over the high valued areas where legendaries spawn. 
---
i used the my atoms to buy the big ass 'Welcome home' sign for this reason
---
My main character has 2 50% fall deduction pieces. You are immune from fallout damage then and only then. 90% means you have a 10% for the fall being too high XD.
---
Btw what ends up being special about unarmed vs a similar 1h melee or even 2h melee builds? 
---
&gt;  0 steel on my person and not once lose a mod.
---
Well obviously because the auto scrap logic doesn't care if you have a million kajillion mods on you because that has no effect on whether it decides to scrap it to make up for missing material. 
---
If you understood how it worked instead of trying once to shove a square peg through a round hole and calling everyone idiots for saying they got something to fit through said hole you'd be able to easily reproduce it on your first try with me right here clearly showing the game trying to use my sacrificial blade mod as repair material: https://imgur.com/a/0BzLIab
---
 Yes, you did. ;) Me too.
---
I hate your kind when they do this to me, but have an upvote since I knew the rules of the game when I decided to build my C.A.M.P. in it. 
---
I think the nuke is the end of the main stuff. Now it's all about the grind until new dlcs
---
Do you rotate your weapons? This helps deplete stocked ammunition while also gathering other types.
---
# Legndary Hunting Rifles FTW
---
Had to give up playing today. 3 disconnects in an hour...that’s not okay. 
---
Yeah new vegas energy weapons were quite good. They DID break quickly there ,but we had weapon repair kits which were easy to make to take care of that.
---
I kinda doubt it will be now less than two hours out. All normal channels were closed on the PC and it seems 3rd party shit is involved now.

Hey kind of off topic but I have the base wetsuit already, just looking for it’s plans/mods. Every time I check a vendor I see “marine torso/limb” mods but I’m assuming those aren’t for the wetsuit. Since the mod descriptions can be vague do they explicitly say “marine wetsuit” mod yada yada?
---
At my C.A.M.P. , giggity!
---
Oh that's Ted. He's always been a snowflake
---
Have you verified that your GPU drivers are up to date? o:
---
Do you use VATS? My melee character can go forever on one core but my VATS based sniper burns through them like a wildfire. 
---
They finally fixed the Combat Rifle receiver bug!
---
Agreed. There are some sweet unique weapons I would like to hold onto while also having room for junk to collect and craft.
---
Ugh really wish they'd add just a few NPCs
---
You should drop a hardened mass afterwords. 
---
Once they fix the duping issue they will likely implement a level cap increase to render all duped items obsolete. Probably... 
---
With the number of people who live for this, I expect a new exploit. Plus there are rumors of at least two more methods. 
---
Easy fix m8, just carry 1,000 cores on you, free ammo every time you swap. /s
---
At 200% condition, all the lvl 50 power armors are all within a few +/- DR, ER, and RR that it is honestly not that noticeable. If you run the proper PA durability perks, or even associated resistance perks, you will be covered across the board. X0-1 mods are the easiest to get by far, as they are sold by the vendor and dont require crafting perks, like ultracite, t51, or t60 do. That being said, I argue X01 is the best for this reason. At the end of the day, though, it is personal preference.
---
It normally says it’s for wetsuit/under-armor
---
Plan: Ultralite marine wetsuit
---
They aren't doing it for fun. They are doing it for money.
---
Online grinds are a great way for people in underdeveloped countries to make money. If they average takehome pay of a region is $10/month, spending 10 hours grinding a dupe bug that generated $50 of income is a huge payday... and some of these exploits are generating a much larger revenue/hour than that.
---
For many people, online games aren't games - they're jobs.
---
uh... but I've not changed the options since it was first introduced. I changed it once and not touched it. Only since this last patch has it affected me.
---
But, I'm willing to adjust to see. (I'm doubtful it will change anything though)
---
Give it some time and r/fallout will show you something saying that's a lie or something. Absolutely waiting for the shit storm for this one because I don't see anything wrong with it. Usually that's how it goes, for me at least.
---
Cost/benefit ratio. Amount of atom profit they might make off of cheaters versus cost of the servers for the cheaters.
---
hmm, I would suggest possibly logging out of your Bethesda account and logging back in. I've had a similar issue, and doing that seemed to have fixed it. 
---
Pessimistic you are 
---
i actually came here to post this.  Dupers get duper servers.  people with duped objects have to be treated differently though.  Not everyone realizes what they are.
---
you need the option if you have a duped object to be given the choice just like the camp spot being taken -- you need to go do a dupe server to use it
---
I understand they have no way of telling whats duped though so its probably useless.  but if they had the way of tracking the duper, they should go to a duper server
---
Im writing a more detailed and calculated trough list of damage with different buffs and perks in respond of this bc this really made me curious.
---
If your interested :) 
---
raise it to 1k for the last time.
---
add ATOM shop items that let me increase it in 1k intervals after that. 
---
done, if you want more you can either buy it with cash or grind dailies for event rewards. 
---
Then people will have "something to do" for those atoms...
---
They have to actually pay for servers, if the investors/board don't see a profit then everything from free updates to new items in the atom shop will suffer. Then they will see profit and be motivated to add more stuff.
---
I feel like the exploding weapon issue could be dealt with by making all those guns require new exploding ammo. Clearly bethesda wont remove the duped guns. but now it would cost flux or something rare to create 'exploding ammo' and would be harder to come by. similar to Ultracite ammo
---
I actually suggested eaxactly the same thing in a post about the broken economy about 20 hours ago, although your explanation is far more thorough.  I really think that it is the only way to solve the lasting damage to the economy and ease some of the pain people have with duplicate cards, respeccing and errors that were made during the first playthrough.  I still only have one character.  As a Path of Exile player also, I approve!  It has this exact system in case you didn't know, but I suspect you do.
---
Who cares. Let the other people deal with her. They all have duped weapons anyway, if anything i want to go glitch her with ice and fire.
---
There that is evidence, now go report that shit to bethesda. I just have never once had it happen to me for anything. I could not replicate it. I take nothing at face value with lies people spread about the game. 
---
Who won?
---
Forums... forum software is so antiquated and a hassle now.  I used to love them around 2003-2010, even ran my own, but Reddit and Discord have killed them off, which is a good thing.
---
I'd suggest using the domain as a simple landing page for the tools you've mentioned, but leave all chat and discussion functions to a Discord channel.  There are a lot of Discord bots that will help you automate things, and will be a lot easier than hiring a web developer.
---
I concur. Most will keep trying to find exploits if they know that they are safe from the ban hammer. We need to put the fear of Thor into them so they stay in line. 
---
No not at all. There needs to be diminishing returns on scrapping. 
---
Dont forget to set your pacifist flag, or other players may kill you to death for the inconsiderate splash damage.
---
Trading for Flux, plans/rare outfits created from plans, weapon mods, power armor mods, rare C.A.M.P plans, drugs are all completely within reason to trade for.
---
Especially considering player vending is coming. I don't have all the time in the world to be farming flux since I know I'll need like 2 hours to launch a nuke and collect materials; it'd be nice to trade for it from a legit non-scumbag player.
---
But sure
---
Doesn't matter, I'll be reporting this to your Enclave officer immediately.
---
Oh yeah, the early (lack of) exploration in New Vegas is one of my biggest complaints.  "Ooooh, you wandered 30 yards from the road?  That's a murderin'!"
---
It was made worse by the fact that you could short circuit quests in confusing and unsatisfying ways by exploring locations before finding the quest starting point.
---
The whole alternative ammo crafting scheme managed to be both annoying and necessary in the late game.  Fallout 4 and 76's crafting is vastly more enjoyable and satisfying.
---
I also found the No Gods No Masters ending to be deeply aggravating and unsatisfying.
---
I think much of the problem was that duping required rapid creation of many items (like 300x Boards), which caused the server to lag and the duper to get disconnected and rolled back, creating a duplicate. The hope is that with the exploit fixed, we won't have a bunch of people on the server creating hundreds of items very quickly, and hopefully the server will run more stable because of it. At least that's the theory. I don't think anything can be done about existing inventory though, that horse has bolted a long time ago. 
---
They’re more likely to get rid of the items from the “actual” nuclear war in 2077
---
U wanna join my gang? 
---
Its just me and one other guy. We spend our time B-Lining it toward players on the map, then  doing improv type stuff over the mic.
---
We wear costumes and try to create scenarios that would force a player we meet to make a choice: with a reward or a pvp consequence. 
---
Go ahead it’s an undercover op I’m preparing for
---
Had to help Grahm out since Mothman started attacking me shortly after.
---
Those items are not really irreplaceable. They are actually not that great. You could probably find better with a few nuke Whitespring runs. Just because something is 3 star doesn't always make it better. I have some great 1 star items that are better than some 3 star items.
---
Weird, well hopefully it all ends up workinf out alright
---
Today I have had one crash to desktop, and the normal disconnected right after taking a workshop again, immediately as the second wave was rolling in. Sad panda.
---
I had a 3 star one but it was level 35.. 
---
The only explosive weapon I have ever found. 
---
Guess I shouldn't have sold it  lol.
---
Oh well lvl. 35 isnt the best so i'm not broken up. 
---
thanks for the info! 
---
oh wow, that's my first time seeing Mothman unshrouded since I'm usually running off in the other direction.
---
Couldn't agree more.  I feel like about 25% of this game is weight management.  I feel like I should be on The Biggest Loser when trying to get my inventory down to 600.  I currently have no idea when my Bulk Wood says 1.60 and I have 20 of them if 1.60 is the TOTAL weight or each one.  Sorting by weight doesn't help unless 1.60 is the total but that seems wrong.  
---
Why in my own base do I have to worry about weight?  Can't I just dump it all there?  Hey Bethesda how about 2 different weight limits:
---
1&gt; if you don't plan on moving your base.  There is plenty of room, why can't I stick my missle launcher in the corner?
---
2&gt; if you need to move your base THEN you must keep it at 600.
---
Thoughts?
---
I mean the first step is that they have to really make sure they've stopped duping first.
---
Last patch was supposed to stop duping but dupers found a workaround and a new method was up and on Youtube in under eight hours.
---
Anything they can do to minimize the damage that dupers have done is a waste of time until they can successfully prevent dupes from happening. And it's going to take a while to prove that it's really been resolved.
---
Beyond that, they may be working on developing methods to detect people who will dupe or already have (people walking around with a million pounds are probably dupers). That may be difficult as they've made it clear that they don't really have methods for editing player inventory yet (and thus most likely have no method for checking inventory). That may be implemented but may take time.
---
There's also a lot long term that they can (and I suspect will) do to minimize the impact of dupes that already happened. They can introduce new currencies. They can introduce four and five star weapons. They can nerf explosive guns. They can introduce new game modes like seasonal ladders to give players a fresh untainted economy to work in. But all of that is a waste of time until they know for certain that duping has been fixed, and right now we don't.
---
You seem to have contradicted yourself in this statement? Which is it?
---
Worst thing is that updates between PC and Consoles are different dates, so Consoles will suffer most if they find out duping was fixed on PC
---
Agree totally. Right now Flamers are kind of pointless, simply because the amount of resources required for crafting are beyond impractical. I'd really love to use a flamethrower, but I just can't afford to fire it for more than 8 seconds.
---
In other news, guys called Ted begin making pilgrimages to Whitesprings.
---
ok sending a report to MY officer, instead.
---
I'm not even sure it will be *next* update - It was only mentioned as something that is coming if I recall correctly.
---
We are hoping once everything is completed to have the website translated into different language options!
---
Salut! C'ent nos plan d'avour des traductions pour les different langues!
---
*insert that one lion king song here*
---
Wasn't a nerf, was a bug fix. 
---
I guess that’s my point, though. It’s not even something I would spend 10 hours grinding for. I guess it would be useful for farming the Scorchbeast Queen or the Whitespring, but I feel like it’s one of those things that expedites the game a little too much.
---
Saved cause i wanna see it!
---
I really don't think this is right.  Why should there be a limit at my own base?  I understand not being able to carry it all, but what if I don't want to pack up and move my base?   I have a huge house, there is plenty of room for all my weapons.  I think the limit should only apply it you want to MOVE your base.  Otherwise, load up!  
---
No, then people could just craft things and scrap them over and over for free to learn all the available mods.
---
Yes! It’s probably not something I’d ever *use,* but knowing how these things are calculated is always useful. Numbers have never been my strong point (I eat crayons). 
---
Many people have been using the Vault Boy standees pointed to open doors to indicate that their camp is open. This first started with the Beta.  
---
I added to this concept and I used the small metal letters to write "Welcome" on them. 
---
Proof it records inventory? They can't even store lost items with proven evidence a glitch lost it. What makes you think they can detect inventory logs?
---
Lmao, I have a weightless Ghoulslayer Gamma Gun with me. Couldn't throw it due to how amazing it is kappa. Might try some of these ideas out.
---
Epic comeback
---
I love my little explosive cryolater...when it isn't broken...
---
&gt; It would also be super nice to have some weight totals next to items,  e.g. if I have 60 Stimpacks, indicate how much total weight that is. 
---
Put more SPECIAL points into Intelligence and 60\*1 becomes a ton easier to do in your head.
---
But yeah, dig aside, having total weight of a stack in 1(60) format would be a nice addition to the inventory. They'd need to fix weight display between Stash and Inventory when you have weight perks on first though. I know Stimpacks don't weigh 0.4 lbs while in my stash, but that's what it tries to tell me sometimes.
---
Happened to me too. Luckily for me though, it was really early on. That sucks. I'm sorry to hear that happened. I figured they had fixed that by now. There has been complaints about that quest glitching forever. 
---
alright well, since i clearly can't understand what you meant, why don't you elucidate it for me, so i can respond properly? or is this just one of those "I don't agree with you so i'm just going to act like you're an idiot and i'm right without proof" comments?
---
So because of a lack of a 5th tier marine armor seems to fall behind heavy combat armor by a wide margin.
---
 Use short or reflex for combat. The long scope is really just for sniping.
---
like my grand grandpa say
---
talking trash doesn't make you hater,
---
like playing the game doesn't make you a fan
---
so sit down and shut the f\*\*k up LMAO
---
There’s one for the alien blaster 
---
omg that's such a cool way to help out a lowbie. Plus He got Atoms for getting the achievement.
---
Fun fact, the ncr bear pa was a fan made mod that the devs liked so they included it in the last dlc
---
You absolutely can be one-shotted through slap damage, and it happens often. You're not some "intellectual rebel going against to dumb masses", you're simply ignorant.
---
Today's Lesson:  Destroy all camps just in case they are trap camps?
---
&gt;Animations: Lever-Action rifle now only reloads the correct number of ammo.

Maybe. 
---
clear ending is launching the nuke and listnening to the holotape
---
You're just proving my point. The moron sperglords who can't stand the fact they're not able to pickup literally everything are never going to be happy
---
I'm not saying we needed that rate of XP gain. I'm saying we needed that rate of XP gain **if** they want leveling up and respeccing tied together.
---
What if it's a kilo gram?
---
Well the lower you are comfortable sitting the more it stacks up and bloodied stacks with adrenal.  Add in the 5% damage increase you are getting from each point of Str, getting to over 40 str on low HP without even stacking a psycho, food buff, and alcohol buff and it gets crazy fast.  I have seen folks hitting over 6k damage per hit fully buffed and swinging on the queen.  I am pretty sure that most melee builds can get close to that but most, in order to take blocker/martial artist/incisor will drop some amounts of their +% damage perks which may drop them below the bonus unarmed get with double mutations (25% from both talons and twisted muscles). Plus most other melee are so stuck in the mindset of "power armor is the best defense" that they aren't willing to try anything else out, unarmed players CANT use PA so we adapted using the systems in the game and it just wrecks face.
---
In short, I believe unarmed does more raw DPS with a slightly lower survivability (not that it matters since you can fight the SBQ outside the rad zones and the mobs inside rad zones other than her hit like noodles) but that melee builds using PA have more survivability (the mod that reduces all damage by 50% at 20% hp is pretty damn good when stacked with other skills like dodgy and blocker).
---
You can find the dmg boost to HP threshold by searching on the forums, I don't know the numbers off the top of my head just that with my daily runner I hit 1600 damage per swing on a bloodied unmodded power fist that doesnt have the 40% faster swing speed without any buffs besides adrenal, unyielding pieces, and bloodied at around 30% hp.
---
That would give a good role for snipers vs letting the melee do all the work? Which reminds me that melee would always get the loot over the ranged folks...
---
Those kids were not even homophobic, just light headed. Woke journalists labeled it as hatecrime. The incident happened in german language, which I speak fluently, and let me assure you, that there was no reason to ban anyone for life.
---
I think you may have huffed one too many cans of paint.
---
Now i gotta do it :/
---
I have no power armor stored, and a few raw materials and I'm out of storage. I ditch stimpacks and other things to keep the weight down and it's not enough, it's close for my purpose but not enough and I'm only lvl 43, some guns and armor I'm socking away for when i reach that level, and that is where the problem comes in. The game should be about fun as well as management. The time it takes to revamp your stash over and over and not hold on to the little things you treasure is where it takes away from the fun. I should be able to hold on to legacy guns/knifes/etc for when I want to play with them again. Or having different load outs for different situations. I feel like they are taking the perspective of hard core survivalist platform for the brute force player and it takes away from what makes recent fallout, fallout. The ability to play around and do anything you damn well please. 
---
So just be a Dick to everyone regardless of lvl until no one even wants to play is your philosophy
---
Ah thanks! I didn't know it had an acronym 
---
I understand your opinion but one of the things I liked about fallout was is the fact you can play how you want. One person's trash is another person's treasure literally in this game.
---
And not everyone enjoys farming whitesprings I personally avoid it because I don't find it enjoyable to do the same routine over again. And that could be a large factor in the difference of our opinions as far as game play styles go or I would probably be a lot higher than level 127.
---
I know you post a lot and help a lot and provide a lot information which I have personally benefited from. But its just a differing of opinions I'm not bashing the game In any way but their is a limit to some things for others.
---
Nice build. Best part of building is working your CAMP into the landscape. Nice entryway. Works well with regards to how it fits the environment.
---
Do some ATOM challenges and get them fancy floors! It will change your life
---
Thanks :D
---
not sure where you got those numbers, quick googling shows several polls that range from 15% to 35% of households, have guns. https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/15/politics/guns-dont-know-how-many-america/index.html is a pretty good article covering it. 
---
You're not wrong though that more knowledge is better, i'm not arguing with you there, but your original comment stated you were taught to field strip an AK in school and couldn't understand a gun crazy country like the US not having gun education (implied?) like yours. 
---
Unarmed can't use PA and has adapted to abuse other mechanics to make up for it, also has two mutations we can push damage with versus other melee using PA and only getting benefit from twisted muscles, but PA also has the 50% damage reduction mod for chest pieces at 20% hp.
---
PC version, todays update.
---
Lever Action Rifle reload is broken and buggy af. Enable modding so that the community can fix these bugs the right way please.
---
Not to get me wrong but the title of this thread is cringy and old fashioned that I had to vent. Can you clean up your titles to be smaller and more coherent cause I literally dont know what you are complaining about. Like do you hate people that enjoy 76? Seems like it. 
---
Ah i never used them i always wanted to use this epxlosive one i found but never got around
---
I agree, I was responding to above about how easy they are: with the best weapons in the game, they're not difficult if the game doesn't bug out. 
---
If the game bugs, I find myself in trouble even with a weapon that should chew through them, and it bugs frequently with regard to scorchbeasts. Especially when there are more than one in the area.
---
Right? Maybe now I’ll be able to justify using my Gauss Rifle to people lol
---
On the plus side, there being people who want to do the opposite of what you do, gives more meaning and significance to the help you give.
---
There is a few ginseng growing in one of the rooms in whitesprings. If you leave the clubhouse and are going clockwise it’s the 3rd or 4th room. The one with lots of plants growing in planters. 
---
Increase. I want more unique weapons and the junk required for basic functions of the game.
---
Additional content may include more unique weapons. I'm not talking legendary weapons either.
---
Not sure where I contradicted myself in the initial statement...
---
can ya'll pls replace my missing t-60 mods :( just scrapped them and watched as they disappeared not realizing that i was throwing 8 mods away 
---
Which system? Can i have your stuff?
---
I'd enjoy owning one myself. Good luck!
---
My house is on a lake shore. Every time I log in or fast travel, I load under water and have caught parasites by the timei finish loading in.
---
Holy shit they fixed like everything.  This has to be one of the bighest patch notes i have ever seen for any game
---
How do you find the nuke cola t51b quest 
---
I feel your frustration. Had to restart a dead-is-dead solo nuke launch by level 15 run (involves avoiding XP) around 30 times from vault 76 because disconnects reset nearly cleared quest areas having already collected XP and spanked ammo.
---
What holotape? The one that is at silo alpha?
---
Which makes sense on a conceptual level--it's an electromagnetically-propelled projectile weapon. Science! perks are needed to build the weapon and some of its mods, but it has armor-piercing capabilities like a ballistic weapon.
---
Oddly, it only takes Gunsmith to build Gatling Laser/Plasma weapons, though the Science! perks still affect the cost and durability of the created weapon.
---
They made a server like that on EQ2. Just for exploiters, cheats, plat sellers, etc. 
---
I dont agree on the legendary thing exactly, the chance of really good gear should remain the same just more variety along the way, easily 9 out of 10 I get the dreaded 4 L's, Legendary Leather Left Leg, so many....
---
I certainly hope so. I still need to kill one...
---
I have every floor. Honestly just like the look of these more here. The hardwoods give off weird glare an the starbursts an linoleum are kinda meh. I did use the hardwood in the upstairs though. An thank you!
---
No more exploits........You do know this is a bethesda game ya?   It aint bethesda unless its corrupting my save data Bethesda company motto 1999 - 2018
---
What happens now when you do try and duplicate? I wonder if it is the crafting they patched or the 300 item grab part
---
Yes I rotate between three rifles and occasionally a shotgun. My main weapon is a fire axe right now but I’m searching for a better one-handed melee weapon. 
---
Yes. The main story missions ended for me with rebooting a damn computer. Uneventful as all hell.
---
considering that likely 99.9% of them are things that were created via exploiting, I'd have no pitty
---
Preach, these are my number 1 and 2 QoL requests, better be in next patch.  It’d be nice to get another stash size bump, durability fix for certain weapons (plasma/laser gatlings) and being able to mark our power armor to tell it apart.  
---
Other than that dupe issues and undoing duping damage would be my next biggest request other than, I don’t know, maybe have some tools to fix issues for people when they submit tickets.
---
I'd be more happy with an extra cross-character STASH with a whatever limit. If it was only usable from the Main Menu it could be any size without causing server stability issues.
---
The concept would be a menu item that brings you to the Account STASH. From there you could pick any character and see their personal STASH and maybe inventory. From there you can trade between the account STASH and the character STASH. Boom, no additional items on a server, no stability issues, cross character sharing all in one.
---
Honestly I dumped most of my Bobby pins. I just can't be bothered with switching the cards in and out, and there's other cards I want so I never took anything past level 1 lock pick
---
Thanks!  Makes sense; I completely forgot about the unyielding piece of the puzzle too.  Appreciate it,
---
For now the forums is the landing page. Once we hit the point everything is completed, the forums will be their own module, and we will have exactly what you are explaining
---
Ok, so let me expand on this one then. I use Wasteland Whisperer, it's good for crowd control. Maybe not so much now at a higher level  but in your 50s it was good for pacifying creatures if there were too many around which allows you to focus on killing one rather than 10 at a time. Wasteland Whisperer when compared with animal friend only worked on things like Super Mutants, ghouls, radscorpions, gulpers and scorched. Yes it worked on things like deathclaws and mirelurks but so did animal friend as well so the actual benefit of using it was only for the other ones listed. What I was saying is that there are a lot of scorched enemies throughout the whole map  so to remove the ability to pacify them will be quite noticeable. If it was never meant for them to be affected by it in the first place fair enough but it might not make the perk worth taking up 3 of your charisma points anymore.
---
Would also need to see when they say it no longer works on scotched are they talking about the human scorched or any creature that has been scorched. If it is any scorched creature then using this perk in the prime fissure site will not work at all.
---
Yes it is only 1 enemy type but it is one of the most common enemy is the whole game....
---
Not a rumor there were two other methods that were known. One involved a 3rd party program.  Checked around seems that the other one (non 3rd party) was patched. 
---
I suppose there would be another way but it would be to unreliable, but there is a way to force a DC through actions. I doubt it could be used though but I have noticed when I do it, it sets me back to a slightly earlier state.  Still a pain to pull off and requires actual time and some effort also could only be used maybe twice on a server. It also wouldn't crash the server just you. It also requires being able to fast travel. 
---
I know this not from trying to dupe but just from my semi unique style of game play. 
---
I think I do recall seeing one there one time.  Thanks for reminding me.
---
I stared at this for like 10 seconds like a moron before I go it. Well done.
---
Now you just need a patch that gets rid of this godforsaken piece of literal shit game all together.
---
It looks like a Garrahan logo or something. 
---
If this game had seasons, sets, modifiers, etc. then I would probably play indefinitely.
---
Seasons is the best thing that ever happened to Diablo 3.
---
I unfortunately haven’t been able to delve into 76 since mid December (time management), but this Bobby pin news!!! About time!
---
Of course, what time?
---
Can't tell if heist or love story....
---
Great thank you!  Wanted to make sure before I started buying things that said marine. If I ever see wetsuit stuff that is.
---
Nope - the real answer is to go permanent Pacifist mode if you don’t want to be Wanted.  I refuse to engage in PvP whatsoever cause it’s utterly pointless in this game.
---
So when i first login my carry weight I  unmodded excavator armor is 460, after lime 10 minutes or goes down to 360. Is that the carry bonus you're talking about?
---
Clearly he was surrendering. Hope you didn't murder him.
---
Enemies scale. Turrets don't. Once you get to a high enough level, turrets are useless. These wall mounted turrets would be a great addition for higher level players that need real dps to deal with high level enemies. 
---
Looks great! That's a ton of data!
---
You are correct! Fixed that little error!
---
I see.  I think though the fix was really not even effective against the  current exploit that was used and they had a video up in like 20 minutes demonstrating one extra step needed.

Is it just me or did fps get limited to 85? I was running 130+ ... or is there something wrong with my game?

Wow, mine ended with finding out the satellite fell down so the bos lost comma with roger maxon 
---
If you're not using missiles then, even if it hurts to drop it, maybe you should?
---
&gt;The duper should be banned, recipients of duped items should have them deleted.
---
Banning dupers, that's fine but the recipients should be left alone, if they did not know that the item was duped (which is impossible to prove either way). 
---
Look up "good faith purchaser" statues to see what I'm talking about.

oh my god he’s like 60, i am fresh out of high school...i’m into older guys but i mean,,,that ain’t it chief. 
---
AND I HAVE FRAMES AGAIN!!!!! runs away screaming in clown attire
---
I have crashed every. single. day. this week.  Really getting old.  
---
this is true for right now. I expect them to flush out pvp for those of us who expected an end game pvp. 
---
Kind of like ESO did. Their big pvp release/revamp was a year or 2 after launch. 
---
They are giving us pvp servers soon. Maybe they will have better METAS until a structured pvp game/system/progression is released
---
You have nothing to worry about, BoS isn’t the target
---
Don't cut yourself on all that edge.
---
Even if so what does that have to do with this statement?
---
1k ALL THE WAY!
---
Exactly!  You would think that because you had to have a Bethesda account for this game, it would "know" that you had a PS4 copy of Fallout 76, but it doesn't seem to work that way.  This has just got me stumped!
---
At least ultracite looks pretty sweet in stock paint
---
Of course my dude, I am pretty sure that ANY melee build can be close or possibly even surpass the current unarmed meta if they focus on stacking just enough defense to not get one shot and then rack up the damage boosters, just not sure how much a difference, if all things are equal, that the extra damage perks for one handed/two handed, versus the extra mutation unarmed gets would make.
---
Figures. I just switched to combat rifles. -chuckles-
---
Yes, I find it HILARIOUS. Also, that's not how titles work.
---
I’m pretty stoked about the artillery range increase. Have you noticed a difference in reliability? About thirty percent of the smoke I throw results in a dud with no rounds fired and no notification about the status of the guns. 
---
They are afraid of revolvers.
---
You get a full set for completing Rose's quest line. 
---
&gt; Min/max by respecting 9 levels isn't min maxing anymore. Might as well reroll.
---
What? How is getting a second character to level 100+ faster than grinding out 9 levels? Also, how is it not min-maxing? I just got Herd Mentality, which when buffed with Strange In Numbers gives me 3 Charisma, meaning I no longer need 9 Charisma, so I'm moving those points to luck so I can fint in Bloody Mess, which I still need the cards for, hence why I need so many levels. How is that not min/maxing? I'm pruning unnecessary stats to get a little more out of my build - that's basically the definition of min/maxing.

Bunch others.she admits to doing Slander exploitation etc for her whole career. Not a allegation when its true. My little brother was killed while trying to get me to the er due to abuses done to me at her requests. Devann talks about the chargeback that ruined her christmas all the time, my mom did it because devann was having me raped etc to extort etc me an etc- an my mom didnt want devann turning into a human being once got the money on my bday/christmas an thus then file a report about my brother selling etc her pics(which he told police that stealing her pics an selling) an my brother showing her him rapeing me. I was a mod for her.
---
Its an overseer one
---
Does it show up when you log back in? Where do you think that information is stored?
---
I tell you what, my charging barrel Tesla crashes me out about 75 percent of the time. Given the tenuous nature of stability in this game, I believe the glitchers will find a way to continue in their merry way. It’s human nature, some people just want to game the system. 
---
Cool. I really dig the new dark hardwood with brick look. 
---
My camp is a cheesy checkered floor with the 2 hardwoods. 
---
I actually wouldn't mind this for the stash, either. A separate weight limit for each category.
---
Yep. But, be careful if you're near the Whitesprings bots of course.
---
There should probably be a hard cap on carry weight, like a few thousand lbs, with any items above that limit getting automatically dropped in the usual paper bag.
---
Don't know. But you'll definitely find more about, just not in generators. A strange move.
---
The BOS vendor in watoga has around ten shopping baskets laying around (plus concrete, hot plates, microscope) and each basket is worth 2-3 steel and 1 plastic. Worth grabbing on your daily vendor cycle if you do that kind of thing.
---
I found one of those at a vendor bot. It felt like I was back in the Borderlands. 
---
Seriously. Bethesda needs to look at the Better Inventory mod and copy that.
---
&gt; You know the game records your inventory, and your actions, into a log that the developers have access to, right?
---
You are assuming a lot. All evidence currently seems to be they don't have such a log. 
---
I have been wanting this since Fallout 4- good luck
---
I think i have plans for the ultracite reciever on the laser gat...not sure though i'll have to check. I know its not the same though
---
Energy weapons and group play adjustments are my biggest wishes going forward. Hopefully we'll get this looked at soon.
---
From the article you just linked: "polls from Gallup and the Pew Research Center in 2017 found that 42% of people in the US live in households with guns."
---
Field stripping the AKs was very educational, we got to intimately know the basics, down to nuts and bolts. Which is, again, I wish something that was taught in schools more. Too much abstraction these days, and not enough deep understanding.
---
I've noticed dropping items to quick does this. I have dropped junk for team mates they will ask me if I'm sure I want to drop my weapon too. Say what?
---
Starts here https://fo76map.com?locationIds=984
---
I can understand why they don't want you selling ammo, but at the very least you should be able to break it down and get some of the materials back. I think giving you 50% of the material cost back would be plenty, for example it takes 4 gunpowder, 6 lead, and 12 steel to create 20x 5.56, perhaps breaking down a stack of 20 rounds could give you 2 gunpowder, 3 lead, and 6 steel. 
---
No, they banned people who were using Cheat Engine. 
---
I found a TSE .44... on my rifleman. Who now wields pistols too!
---
I think to balance the damage they added that "spin the cylinder whenever you pull it out" animation.
---
I'll do it for 500 caps ign ashyshka
---
Another Settlement may need your help!
---
&gt;surely people aren’t *that* brain dead playing the game are they?
---
Speaking as someone who's run a user study or two... you'd be surprised.
---
Yes I am very familiar with Bethesda and their games. Just being positive and hopeful for continued patches to get rid of exploits (old and new) and continuing to improve stability and performance. 
---
sometimes it will revert so if you really needed some items scrap it lol
---
Ok, I'll just spend the next 3 weeks grinding events that each individually give like half as much XP as a single ghoul.
---
My point was that if I want to respec my build in anything remotely resembling a reasonable amount of time I was forced into Whitesprings grinding.
---
No idea what edge you are talking about.
---
Clearly not in a typical database or they wouldn't have all these issues. Especially with restoring lost characters. 
---
I think they hackjobbed the game/servers to load a fallout save file to be honest. Hence the lack of ability to restore/modify individual elements.
---
If it were any proper database there would be backups easily restored. 
---
Why would that make sense? When you craft virtually anything, you take raw materials cut them  down to various sizes to fit together. There is always material loss during manufacturing and likely scrapping an item isn't even a 100% recovery of the less material that is in the manufactured item.
---
I would give you one if I could, but I am on PS4.  Do the Watoga Power Armor Run.  If you are okay with server hopping do this run a couple of times.  Else just check on log on.
---
Drop Site V9 – In the far southeast corner of the map, the Power Armor can be found near a fallen Brotherhood of Steel member.
---
Watoga – Search for a large crashed Vertibird (those flying vehicles you sometimes find in the wild, firing at enemies), there should be a Power Armor standing next to the tail.
---
Watoga Emergency Services – Located on the building’s roof.
---
Survey Camp Alpha – South of the Flooded Trainyard, the Power Armor can be found underneath a tarp.
---
Big Bend Tunnel East – Close to the border of the Savage Divide on the western side, a Power Armor can be found outside the main entrance to the location, and another set can spawn inside the tunnel itself.
---

I tried to sing the title of this post.
---
They require 5 of each to rebuild your entire camp. Theres an exploit where you can store/replace a broken camp item like a turret with no cost. So theres NO COST to rebuild things like turrets.
---
Im sitting on 150+ of each in my stash. Pickup those fans and typewriters homie. 
---
Fair enough.   
---
I still think it will be a bit before they say shit though not without a back up. Since there will be one more patch this month. 
---
Pft NV being the best my ass. I think we can all agree Fallout: Brotherhood of Steel on PS2 was the best Fallout ever.
---
Hrm... I should go say that there.
---
I’M STILL NOT FOLLOWING YOU HERE, ELABORATE
---
I couldn't agree more. I got a Zealot's Exploding Laser Pistol the other day and I really want to use it since it's an exploding weapon that doesn't instakill everything. However, it breaks after about 25-30 shots when at 200% repaired...sooooooo, not that useful.
---
I'm presuming nothing of the sort. I don't GAF if they're gone laughing or not;  I just want them gone. 
---
Agree to a point, a lot of older Fallout fans, partularly the old iso folks who just could not accept that 3D direction the game went or the fact there there was a new developer, are just stuck in the past and will hate on anything Fallout related after 2006. However, folks in this sub should not conflate baseless hate fo76 has received for genuine criticism. Fo76 was released as a broken, buggy mess, and it should be called as such. It's gotten better but it's still a subpar game at best, and that's coming from someone who's enjoying it quite a bit, despite the flaws.
---
“**STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM, YOU VIOLATED THE LAW! ALL YOUR DUPED ITEMS ARE NOW FORFEIT!**”
---
Ok, it's funny... in short the word pacifist means someone that does not believe in war and violence. Meaning they would not be someone to FIGHT, doesn't mean that can't be killed. It's to lightly protect me from situations like the Nuked Zone from hitting another player is all. I can still be slap damaged and I gather slapped to death perhaps. :)
---
Agreed.  It will go underground and be a trade secret. 
---
It's really sad when the scorched beast Queen melts into a goo puddle and no one can loot it. :(
---
Fort Defiance has a decent amount on the BoS wing spread across the 4 floors and in the secure areas on the upper 2 floors. You may need to hop servers if someone already looted it. On a side note, Fort Defiance full loot clear has about 22 straight jackets. They have a base value of 200 and they sell for 46ish caps if you have decent charisma and the sale price perks.
---
Killed her last night with about 3 minutes to spare. There would have been about 10 of us there all up, with only 1 dude below level 50. No melee dudes though surprisingly.
---
I barely even got to shoot the queen, because there were so many fucking adds which hasn't been my experience the other 2 times I've killed her. I'm not sure if everyone was just ignoring them or what but I went from level 64 to level 68 in 20 minutes just smashing out the mobs.
---
It fucking annihilated my stimpak and ammo reserves.
---
Inevitable roll back incoming
---
Still kind of mind boggling that you haven't even addressed energy weapon durability.
---
So I haven’t played it yet. Is this game really good now? 
---
I would be annoyed if I did lose my item because it was Stand Fast which is a quest reward only item as far as I know. I don't actually use it at all now. But it was my favorite at the time, and I might use it again in the future. But I have found a lot of better stuff since then. I also don't like to do the same thing over and over. I haven't done Whitepsring nuke many times. But it's something to do, and the loot drops like rain, every time a chance to get something much better than what you had. If you were on PS4 I could give you a chest and weapon, as I'm sure many people would. And if I did lose my Stand Fast I'm sure someone would at least have been willing to trade with me. I just think quitting the game because of that isn't the right thing to do. It's just an item and many items just like them and better drop all the time at Whitespring.
---
I run around naked with area chat just saying "kill me" yet no one wants to usually. Then someone snipes me and jumps servers. Longest ive gone is 2 hours before someone killed me... such a shame. 
---
All they need to do is attach ID's to item. If they share an id it will delete one (only if this would cause an issue with players disconnecting without duping) or delete both if that wouldn't be an issue 
---
If you end up having to respec that much, your min maxing went very very wrong.
---
&gt;so I can fint in Bloody Mess
---
Yeah, not picking Bloody Mess as one of your first dmg perks is good sign of min maxing going wrong.
---
You don't min max after the fact, you plan your build. What you're doing isn't min maxing, it's called fixing your mistakes.
---
To min max is to get he maximum result with the smallest investment. You ended up having to sink in many levels worth of xp to get perks you should already have. You already failed at investing as little as possible.
---
I feel ya. The first three folks I asked ran away at top speed. Can't really blame them. 
---
"Click here to read more!" *buzzfeed voiceover*
---
You've never done Monster Mash, have you? Or any of the Mire quests with large creatures?
---
&gt; I was forced into Whitesprings grinding.
---
Yeah, you're not a victim. You chose that. I can get 9 levels just fine in less than 3 **_days_** and all I'm doing is looking for the Ultracite Gatling Laser plan.
---
Hey mate, we're looking to fix the mods scrapping issue in a future update :)
---
If I'm running anything on the internet, I'm sure as hell not giving support DB access. Doesn't mean the dev team doesn't have it.
---
If I scrap something with a spring, I should be able to get a spring back. In real life, If I take apart an alarm clock and keep all the components to it, I can put it back together because I never lost any of the parts... all I did was take it apart.
---
If people are worried about being able to scrap nonstop for mods then they need to change how you get mods (for example only get mods from weapons you scrap that actually HAVE that mod, or put more weapon mods out in the world).
---
Hardened mass no longer scraps... THANK GOD.
---
Good idea. I like snow balls
---
The game technically was not designed to go past 50. Allowing the respec was just their way of keeping people happy.
---
\&gt; People engaging in PvP, exploiting the poor mechanics farming level 100+ for caps.  
---
For sure.  A low level kept attacking me, and dying, \~10 times (I got maybe +100 caps total). Then he finally killed me from a  distance (I didn't even know he was still around) and I lost -250 caps   
---
I mean, between the Bethesfa forums and Reddit..
---
About 30% Vats I'd say.  So, enough to have an impact.

---
 &gt; Hey mate, we're looking to fix the mods scrapping issue in a future update :)
---
Great comment. I agree
---
Yeah I do, but I don't keep 150 of everything. No you can't store and replace broken generators and turrets, if they're broken you can scrap or repair them. 
---
this is welcome but I'm curious why they need to have any weight at all, lol.
---
Where did you see that in the patch notes? I searched for your text and couldn't find it. I only found this:
---
&gt;**Trade**: Changed caps limit for player-to-player trades from 5000 to 25000.
---
So having a database with your current inventory is obviously happening.  What we don't know is to what degree changes to the data is logged.  That's an optional consideration depending on your application.  So they could have very limited logs to determine past changes to the database.  
---
They absolutely have your inventory saved.. they send it to you when you open your inventory.  They just might not know what it looked like yesterday.
---
I read first "Permaban those assholes in Oblivion" I was like why the hell people should be banned in old singleplayer game...
---
You do realize many other games give their support the ability to view logs/request logs as well as restore items right? Right? 
---
I don't have problem with any of that, save possibly the last one
---
I dont think its limited to steel. For example mods for Exc. PA have Black Titanium as a scrap component. So if you are low on Black Titanium and try to make something that uses it, it will scrap that mod for the BT. So you need to look at whatever the scrap material for any mod you have and make sure to not be low on it.
---
Oh yeah, I’d love a larger CAMP budget. 
---
Best thing you can do is run a loop in Watoga.  1) Spawn in at Watoga station. 2) On top of the High School, to the right of the top of the stairs. 3) Downed Vertibot by AMS HQ. 4) Watoga transit hub, behind the level 3 locked door behind the counter to the left of the lockers. 5) Go to the top of the civic center, then cross the bridge, next to the Vertibot on the left. 6) Inside the civic center on the basketball court on the far end on top of the pallet. (There are a few other spawn points, and they may be T-51, T-45, or T-60, but I got a full set of each after a few runs).  Also, double check the level, they can spawn lower. 
---
are you trying to get all the reddit cliches into one thread?
---
And blue screen error which happen too often on PS4? 
---
Gimme sum flux bby.
---
That sounds really painful tbh
---
it crashes if you like sideways at it.  exceptionally fragile :(  sad effort.
---
Okay, I used the wrong term. Does that alter my point in any way? No.
---
move your "camp device" around without actually moving your camp to find a spot that doesnt spawn you in the water. I had to move mine to the very edge of the CAMP radius.
---
Great question, and this is the 'thing'...it's not a quest, it's more like a hunt. If you go to the nuka cola plant and read the notes, and use some serious detective work and a little luck, you can put it all together (or just google it for zero-effort). 
---
Another example is a set of keys you find on the 3rd floor (might be roof) of Freddy fear's house of scares. I have no idea what they open...maybe it's something similar.

= rape culture . many forms of rape culture. Use google. If i gotta give a teaching lesson that just shows even more how bad community is. 
---
You've beaten me to it.
---
I honestly had not realized this. That explains a lot...
---
I honestly dont know where I live with this. I accept what 76 has to offer but I'm still disappointed in aspects of it. NV is still my favorite fallout by far but I dont believe that there is nothing good about the other fallouts. 
---
it's a pretty crappy sub sometimes, unfortunately.
---
I always found its design to look a little rushed. Especially the parts where it was literally just a solid green colour 
---
You can bet they didn't design some custom database management system.  There's open source databases out there.
---
You have to consider how much data you're talking about and how their backup and logging is set up.  Which we don't know.
---
Try it. It works. Store a broken turret. Go test. 
---
Unless they patched it, which is entirely possible. But it worked for me in late november.
---
Those were my thoughts exactly lol 😂😂😂
---
And they’re all level 80+ who have already put more time than money into the game. 
---
Your point is dumb in the first place. Might as well clear up your misconceived notion of what min/maxing was, that's all.
---
A) I never said I was a victim
---
B) I didn't literally mean 3 weeks. Hyperbole, my man, look it up. The point is it's still gonna take several days outside of nukes just to shift around some stats.
---
I do the same thing, but I put water purifiers inside of my base, which I use as a source of income/hydration.
---
My only problem is that I’m super paranoid and keep everything under lock and key at all times. It’s dumb, but I’m afraid of people figuring out an exploit to steal my shit.
---
It’s detective time🕵🏻‍♂️
---
PC. 1/10/2019 Update broke the game for me. 
---
Excavator power armor doesn't update carry weight.
---
Game Crashes constantly when viewing pip-boy.
---
Laggy af (hit something and watch it die 5 sec's later)
---
CAN SOMEONE FIX THE  GHOULS SHOOTING FROM UPPER/LOWER FLOORS WITH NO VISION?
---
\-
---
On a positive note, i got two free 2-star items that duplicated my existing one star items (a couple of combat armor arms). No idea how it happened but was trying to see if having BOS suit still negatively impacted PA stats... IT DOES.
---
And then you attack them back.
---
You're all true martyrs dealing with the badmen at /r/Fallout . I shall make a shrine to this subreddit and their bravery.
---
Great, how about the plans learned part of the question?
---
A) Read your own post about being forced to do something
---
B) 3 days is not hyperbole, my man, leave Whitesprings
---
Maybe I’m thinking of quad .44...I have both just because.
---
I'm pretty sure that's how it's going to work on a quad lever action. I saw a video where someone was reloading their quad single action revolver and it took quite a while.
---
Hardened Mass is used to convert Raw Fluxes into Stable  Fluxes. Stable Fluxes are used in crafting endgame items, mods, etc. 
---
For example if you want to mod your Vault 76 jumpsuit to be "Shielded" it takes 4 Stable Cobalt Flux if I recall correctly. So you need those masses to craft some endgame stuff.
---
Hardened Mass also scraps to Ultracite used in other endgame recipes.
---
My point is dumb? So you enjoy the current respeccing system of having to level up to move a single stat point?
---
Haha I can relate i would definitely give you mine I had it sitting in my bank for a while but I ended up giving it to someone else who was using a standard combat armor chest piece and o wanted to help them upgrade.
---
Do we think that duping has been fancy-fixed?  They fixed it before, and it was worked around almost immediately.
---
Didn't know you had the inside scoop of how things work at Bethesda. They should just hire you so you can fix it all. You clearly know more about the game than they do. 
---
BDO logs everything even down to horse time of death and object that kills it. Support has full access to those logs.
---
Clearly that proves my point lmao. If they don't have access to it now then what makes you think they'll retroactively find that info or completely rebuild their code to do so?
---
So still no fix for users who can't play in the charleston area, preventing us from progressing the main questline? ok
---
The only reason I'd use one is to incorporate a .308 or .50 weapon into my rotation, so I use less .45 and 5.56. That still won't happen though because I don't have 30 pounds to spare for a hunting rifle and ammo. 
---
Not sure how practical this is, but would it be possible to add a column marked C/H/N or something, tagging foods as "Carnivore" "Herbivore" or "Neither" in regards to if they actually restore food% when you have those mutations?
---
Oh the groups are out duping in huge amounts it is all hands on deck on the xbox.
---
Not a bounty, but they still get to take some of your caps.  It is kind of dumb.
---
Purple forever
---
Also I can actually see shit now after the patch
---
I mean, I carry 4 of the damned things and still can't rely on them for working over anything that isn't a lone boss level enemy or they'll all be broken in no time from dealing with all the trash this game puts in your way.
---
If I remember correctly, the pump shotgun already does this too.
---
Well then I know what my next build is
---
They never should have used weight inventory management.  Limit to a number items like most games.  Would have limited the ability to do this. 
---
Yikes. That bad eh?
---
(stop jumping on bandwagons and go back to enjoying this horrendous fallout 4 DLC)
---
That would suck!!!
---
I never said *you* were using hyperbole, I said *I* was. I meant my 3 week comment was hyperbole.
---
This change makes me happy because Scorchbeast damage is explosive. So Fireproof + Dense, and I can pretty much ignore them now.
---
Hey Bethesda, hope you're reading the replies here.
---
Was wondering, should electrified Hachette have additional energy damage? And maybe a fun effect when you hit? Like how heated pitchforks do? 
---
The weapon seems fun, and it looks fun, the powercore taped to it and the jumper cables attached to the metal blade. 
---
I wouldn't mind this being a main weapon if it was working as it seems like it should. 
---
Recently I’ve Been getting no loot from 3* Legendarys I just think there should be something of use from these mobs and not a empty corpse.
---
Well I mean technically you listen with your ears and not your eyes, so...
---
Carrying 4 heavy weapons takes up to much space for my taste!
---
Took one of the workshops yesterday that had 3 acid extractors in order to get some flamer ammo. Was there for quite a long time, used ammo Smith (i think it makes 9 instead of 5) and super duper when making it. I still only managed to get like 30 ammo from it, that last about 5 seconds when you actually shoot it....
---
EDIT: Also, why cant the actual gas canisters we find in the map just be used as straight ammo for the flamer. That would make more sense...
---
I'm not sure how many I had but I know that it caps to 99+ when your picking a lock 😂
---
What are you doing right now? I understand your whining just fine. Do you understand that I'm telling you that you're whining for no good reason?
---
You're whining for no good reason.
---
Leave Whitesprings.
---
While you are 100% correct about the resistances, you should try wearing level 45 Excavator into any endgame combat and it does just fine. Those differences in resistance don't seem to matter all that much. Half of the people killing the scorch queen event at any given time seem to all be wearing exc armor and I don't really see them dying. When I wear it, I don't really use more stimpaks than when I am wearing x-01
---
The game is supposed to be hard
---
700 XP is how much I get from queen kills at level 140
---
Hey [u/borndovahkiin](https://www.reddit.com/user/borndovahkiin), as we outlined in a previous Inside the Vault article, we do plan to increase the storage cap beyond 600 once we ensure stability won't be affected.
---
Hmm, maybe this was my problem as well.  I was getting a lot of crashes at one point and I was probably using the charging barrel at the time.  I haven't seen nearly as many recently and I switched back to the semi-auto barrel as well.  I never made the association between the mod and the crashes though so not sure how well they coincide.
---
I’ve only ever fought 3 at once so I haven’t had them bug in the ways people are describing them. I also play a very VATS-crit heavy build so I don’t need to aim and frequently shoot them while they’re screaming just so I have the clearest shot and use Escape Artist perk when they’re mobile to keep them from zeroing in and screaming at me while doing their aerial circling. It forces them to stop before they scream but they do a noticeably higher amount of crop dustings. 
---
Do you even read?
---
Gun totally disappeared.  Nothing, nowhere.  Not in inventory.
---
Lol i meant between you and Bethesda game studios...not the old guy. Sorry for confusion. 
---
I think this guy is saying that it's still not registering as a heavy weapon for bear arms perk after patch.
---
LMAO OMG..i mean, i do love bethesda. it’s sort of a dream of mine to work there, given what i wanna do with my career. 
---
Yes.  I would also do Tank Killer.
---
You don't seem to have much experience.  "BDO logs", "horse time of death".  That's a record in a DBMS, not a log in a DBMS.
---
Just need make it so explosive perks don't effect explosive weapon perks. 
---
Is this a new bug?  I don't remember anything like this when using the charged tesla rifle and power armor before.
---
Do you know about those police women in the US, who dress up as prostitutes and try to  seduce men into buying sex, which those men would not have attempted to do otherwise? These glitches are similar, cause they tempt players. The fault is clearly with both parties, Bethesda and exploiters alike.

But to be clear... FO76 is the only multiplayer game with these kind of problems. In that sense the game itself currently lacks the basic capabilities to be a proper multiplayer game. And that is solely on its development alone. Players try to stretch and explore the boundaries and limits in any game. That has to be considered and accounted for beforehand. And the reason for FO76 being unable to fullfill those needs commonly for a multiplayer game, are quite evident. It is an assetflip from a singleplayergame, which never had to deal with multiplayer problems.
---
What I'm doing is arguing with someone who is missing the entire point of my post. My entire point is that respeccing being tied to leveling, at least in its current implementation, is fucking stupid. Apparently making a suggestion is considered whining now.
---
are there different versions of mutations? my twisted muscles doesn't say +25% melee.
---
I'd prefer they all get grouped into the same servers apart from everyone else.  
---
Duping is only a problem in so much as duped items make their way into the normal game economy.  Keeping all the dupers together means at least their shenanigans don't have to impact the rest of the playerbase.  
---
It would also remove their ability to profit from duping.  Right now the game is dupe -&gt; sell for irl money or for ingame items/currency to give themselves an unfair advantage they wouldn't have gotten without duping.  Lumping them in the same servers apart from everyone else solves all of that as they won't have any buyers.
---
Nope, we just got a challenge level increase for sad news of death has been nerfed, my friends ^   ^
---
I know what the perks do. I brought up two shot to show that the perks aren’t logical what their effects do. Can refer to the above comment for full context
---
I don’t for a second believe it’s ever going away 
---
I have to wait a week for the console update 😩 
---
Yup. 
---
Glad those Rad-away and Rad-away diluted still weight a quarter pound a piece.
---
Logging in for the first time with lag in nuke zone without power armor is a horrible experience, I hope you don’t go through this :(
---
10-4. 
---
Idk man. I get 2-3 levels a day from normal playing and I'm past 100. Havent touched a whitespring ghoul since the 50s. I mostly do queen runs with a couple friends. 
---
Sounds like your upset you cant exploit a mob that gave more xp than intended anymore
---
I was using the terminology their support refers to them as lol. That is the one thing you take away from my entire post?
---
What is the 10mm smg classified as anyways?
---
&gt;2 star Tesla rifle
---
If you slap on an automatic barrel with the Ground Pounder perk, Quick Hands and Adrenaline the Tesla Rifle is a force to be reckoned with. Using the weapon in the Whitesprings Golf Club where there are a million ghouls (you can pull all of them to you until you cannot move) it never ceases to amaze when all you have to do is aim at the ground and drink your cup of tea ;)
---
I’m with you on the top 3.
---
Yup. That's how the game intended. 🙏🏼 all three and tank killer is good.
---
There need's to be a handmade autopistol that fires bobby pins.
---
Did two WhiteSpings runs today since server up, zero so far (as I've seen)
---
What you're doing is missing the point.
---
Leave Whitesprings. You're choosing to make this harder on yourself than it is and whining about it.
---
Couldn't you drop a grenade and stand on top of it to take a bunch of damage and then let him finish the job?
---
I heard that scaly skin and grounded cannot coexist. I seem to remember having both on my Xbox character for team tanking. Herb and carni cannot coexist though, and it’s possible a failed roll means that one of the unavailable ones tried to roll. 
---
My god at the length of these notes. I'm surprised anyone plays this greed filled game. 
---
Ill be on in 3hrs. Ill msg you
---
Well, yeah....but then when someone complains about the game they're told they haven't played enough of the game to form a valid opinion. What is the correct amount to play and be able to form an opinion?
---
Does this timer reset ever time there's a patch, or do you just get a few more hours to decide if the game has been fixed?
---
At least The Devastator had 3 whole minutes underwater.
---
If someone needs to steal water from me, they can have it. Thirsty folks out there, you are welcome.
---
I only carry 1,  ima daredevil
---
But why bother?  Just don't want to be wandering with no idea when it might happen?  Might be the best punishment.
---
That is feedback the team is definitely aware of
---
Gee, I wonder if you're a duper?
---
Except there are no weapons, no armor, no diatribution of S.P.E.C.I.A.L stats, no perk setup that a level 50 can't have access to that can only be had after 50-150 more levels of nothing but perk points that only give you versatility to swap out to a different 50 point limit perk loadout and opportunities to shift S.P.E.C.I.A.L points around. There's no logic behind that statement at all.
---
If someone can provide that information to me I will add it.  I've never used those perks.
---
It's actually worse for me. Crashed more in the last few hours than the last month combined.
---
It's been a bug since day 1 of beta. I can't even count the amount of people that post about it. Not that it should matter, you shouldn't be able to deposit non quest items. A lot of people avoid this event because of it 
---
Can you tell me where that is you made those screenshots?  I have explored all of the map at this point but I don't remember a place exactly like that.
---
The same exact literal argument can be made for the exact literal opposite.
---
Secondly, there is no THEORY. The game is objectively bad. What are you defending at this point....a company? Just enjoy whatever enjoyment you can get out of it. IIO learned in High school not to let WORDS hurt me. You can heed what people say, but my god...I've never seen so many people get upset over words on the internet than about video games. I've enjoyed plenty of games that get that good ol' reddit brigade. But I'll be damned if it stopped me from playing it or made me go on the internet to tell everyone how their words made me feel...
---
I managed to get one pretty nice...healing factor, thanks to blackwater mine
---
I'm seeing 1*'s from 3*'s all the time, but I think it's tied to player/server RNG seed, some people just seem to be objectively "luckier (luck stat doesn't seem to be a factor)
---
wow, i wasnt expecting this much of a patch 
---
Let me spell it out for you.
---
***WHITESPRINGS. IS. NOT. THE. ISSUE.***
---
Having to level up to move a single stat point, losing out on the perk in the process is the issue. Whitesprings is the most efficient way to level up and it got a nerf. Bugfix or not, it got a nerf. Whitesprings' overinflated XP gains were a band-aid making the current respeccing system tolerable.
---
Yeah, I can understand your point on a spring, but its a game mechanic to provide consequences for crafting choices. Another exploit they would have to fix is to craft an item, then let it get really damaged and scrap and re-create it for free instead of paying repair costs. They would have to make scrap results scale down with item damage and only give you the original mats if it was fully repaired, etc.
---
What system you on?
---
They hire rapists now sadly an protect them an help them flee from an evade prosecution an help them get away with rape culture slander an exploitation an death threats etc, an are going to help a rapist with her legal fees to try getting away with rapes etc.
---
I was able to respec just fine when they patched it in. I don't know what to do with my level ups any more. And I find xp waaay too generous in 76. 
---
If you still need to lvl up fast, the game gives you a crazy amount of boosts, from perks, foods, and other xp buffs.
---
And for any build that would be too different, they give you the option to have several characters. I have 3 already, that lowest one is already lvl43.
---
So no, it was not a nerf, it was a fix. And no, they don't need to give you the same xp for one taping a ghoul than they give you for raiding a Scorched Queen.
---
If find it too slow, try *actually* min maxing for xp gain.
---
deathclaws in power armor... with jets packs.
---
And the scorch beast scream attack.
---
surely this will fix everything
---
Well with curator,an hour of extra 15% damage to scorched is great for queen fights, or 1 hour of slower weapon degradation.
---
Some have useless perk but others are great
---
Rereading my response does indicate that I worded it poorly. I know that you understand the difference, but they don't function nearly the same way as each other. 
---
While they are only weapon perks, my point still stands that it makes more sense for this to cause extra ammo to have to be loaded, because it actually raises the ammo count for your magazine. 
---
As stated in another comment, I'm fairly certain the pump shotgun already has this happening with their double and quad versions. The pump functions exactly like the lever action in terms of ammo.
---
I carry one strictly for anti-Scorchbeast use, though depending how well today's patch applies my Gauss Rifle may be able to displace it.  If it does, goodbye gatling plasma.
---
Xbox here. I would have run through with you if we were on the same system.
---
I dont care about their words, and I wont stop. I just cant stand stupid behaviours.
---
You know what? Fuck it. I’m just gonna abuse this. I’m done trying to help people understand why this is bad and getting idiots not bothering to read my posts and getting mad at shit I never said.
---
Thank you for bringing this information here. Unlike some idiots here, I appreciate it when someone goes to the trouble like you have.
---
Fireproof, Adamantite Skeleton, Dense... My body is ready!
---
Let me guess: You don't have one so you want no-one else to have them, right?
---
But yeah, fuck everyone that plays the game for having something you don't.
---
Is Whitesprings Nukes a shop?
---
I'm neutral on PVP from an outside standpoint. What's a few caps in long run? In a week, losing 30-50 caps and common junk after getting shot by a TSE someone probably bought from a duper won't even cross my mind.
---
In-game, lore wise though, I'm on the side of punishments for PvP. If you murdered another Vault 76 resident for some loose screws and scrap wood before the doors opened you'd probably get more than a fine. You'd be put on trial for murder and most likely not live to see the vault door roll open. So you get off pretty lightly with a fine I thinks.
---
It also raises the question about how a sociopath who kills their former neighbor for a half working factory even got into a control vault in the first place; considering how adept Vault-Tec at choosing people for their vault experiments you'd think they'd see all the people they're letting that would kill their former soccer team goalie for reason barley exceeding 50 bucks in bottle caps. 
---
Unless... that was the whole point of the vault. In which case I fully approve of PvP.
---
Just to be clear, it's not as simple as just rapid crafting. People like myself have crafted over 1,000 of the same item in a row (I do ammo by a couple thousand st a time) and haven't even lagged. Its something deeper in the code when crafting specific things that causes it. 
---
The servers will be more stable without that code causing lag but people having millions of items will still fuck things up a bit if you're too close to them. 
---
I'll take whatever you don't want/need if OP is on PS4
---
Tin Foil Hat Theory Time: 
---
If they ban them now,  then they'd have no way of knowing if the anti-duping fixes worked since,  theoretically, the people doing it would be gone. Some may persist, but may not find a work around quickly.
---
So I imagine Beth would wait to make sure that duping is actually done. Use the assholes to test their fixes over and over again untill they get it right . 
---
After all, we don't want them to go through the hassle of fixing the economy just for it to happen again. 
---
Once they know the duping is eliminated then they can start Banning, clearing out duped items, introducing new cap sincs and starting the process of rebalancing weapon attributes and releasing 4 and 5 star content.
---
Because let me tell ya, as bad as it is now. Itll be FAR worse if the fix isn't iron clad by the time they release 5 star items. 
---
Fatman skin was already in the atomic shop before the patch last night. Its called something like Blackbird or aviator skin.
---
The fact that you’ve literally complained about weapon animations three other times in Fallout subreddits. 
---
Bye. 
---
Whoa
---
If you are on PC I can mod that into a Plasma Gamma Flamer Rifle for ya!
---
It’s not limited to steel, but /u/CyKouxis was specifically talking about steel mods. 
---
must you bring your views onto my post? 
---
You want them to fix it unless you use a quad lever action. 5 round reload is 20 bullets. 
---
Except that such a change would mean Melee would have 0 viability against legendaries...
---
Ya, the water isn’t a problem. I’m afraid somebody will figure out a way to steal from my stash, or take everything off of my power armor like some people have reported.
---
I don’t even know if this crap can actually happen, I just don’t want to risk it lol
---
Did anyone else have this post sing out in that song's tune as you read it
---
This is cursed
---
I think I know what I'm talking about.  I quit when I hit lvl 190.
---
Agreed. I wish luck of the draw would proc more consistently. Even at rank 3 it’s not often enough. Is it tied to luck skill? Higher luck = higher chance?
---
I’m sure I’m the coming week I can round up some support. There was an old army guy I helped out the other week that I might team up with again.
---
I’m still over here like, why the hell does anybody have more than 10 bobby pins on them at a time? 
---
Can we ban all the cheaters to cheater only servers like Rockstar did with GTA?
---
Same boat, tons of application crashes being logged in the application log
---
I sold mine to some sucker when they made the announcement a month ago. I did give them a heads up about the fix. 
---
When I was about level 10 I fast-traveled to defend a workshop I'd captured from mongrels.  When I got there the mongrels were all level 50 and terrifying.  Just as I was about to abandon my lovely workshop, Grahm charged in and took care of the mongrels for me.  I hadn't been that happy to see a super mutant since I met Fawkes.
---
Yea I am sure you reached that within two weeks also. Exactly my point.
---
A while back my camp got removed and wouldn't spawn back in for a few sessions so I had to replace it manually. Ended up with 7000+ of each adhesive crop. Nice but I can't build anything due to the budget and it takes forever to scrap that much.
---
Hoping they add a 'scrap all of this'.
---
I don't know why you got downvoted. 
---
It seems reasonable that bgs should be able to execute a simple query to find anyone with more than x of a given item. 
---
Even if they take action on duped items and ban the dupers, they wouldn't ban people that bought them. At most they'd just detect and remove the dupes, but they can't even do that.
---
I think I know what’s going on...
---
I believe you and the other fellow are referring to actual physical ammunition coming out of your inventory and entering your gun. Which is true, yes quad / double weapons **consume** 4x / 2x the amount of ammo than the base gun does. 
---
However, I was only referring to the animation which is what was updated in the patch notes. The animation does not reflect the amount of ammo reloaded, but the amount of shells you have in your inventory (and gun magazine) does. Which is why I found it highly unlikely that a quad lever action rifle would have an animation of reloading 20 rounds, which was my original point. 
---
Got slapped out of the cranberry bog nuke zone because I was only level 30 I’m assuming, bullied by a level 140 or so... he kept hitting me until I died, eventually died, that’s the definition of gatekeeping in this game ladies and gentleman :) 
---
Knowing that's the only thing in the game you can lose upon death, why would you carry ALL your junk? You just cant for that reason. That sucks though.
---
Disconnected From Server
---
It got modded so it seems you are in a minority, bub. Maybe next time think twice about screaming at someone like that.
---
Yeah, same with me regarding some of the Christmas trees that I bought with accident. Contacted support and they removed the items from my account and restored my atoms.
---
So what you're saying is...
---
Duper servers would be super duper.
---
I only keep 10 at a maximum
---
It’s loud and clear 
---
Honestly it’s not going to make a difference for me, I’ve been selling my excess for caps since the first week, even in previous games they’re just too plentiful past the early game
---
Also included with this animation fix is that the +reload speed from the speed demon mutation actually applies now too. I reload so much faster now. Pass the ammunition, indeed!
---
**A bugfix is not a nerf and I am unsympathetic to your whining. I also have no problem gaining levels well past level 180 to respec.**
---
This is a _you_ problem.
---
So many great updates! I really hope that the inventory crashing is fixed with this. I don’t know how many times I have crashed from my stash or from selling to a robot vendor.
---
Same here. :(
---
I apologize for drawing you into an argument. You clearly have mental health issues, and I hope you are seeking help from a professional.
---
You are alone on an island of absurdity.  Perk packs are random.  You don’t get some perks until your 40s.
---
Float on the track like a Segway 
---
Lay off the drugs for a while, pal. If you paid careful attention rather than rambling like a child, you would notice me and the guy who “screamed” at you are two separate users.
---
Sounds like a pay to win request.
---
If  only the game gave you a warning that taking a workshop would put you  into PvP so people could make an informed decision about taking it and  going into PvP. Like, just a pop-up stating that when you click the  workstation. A clearly worded window that you need to click "Ok" before  activating.
---
I wounder if people would  stop complaining if that feature was in the game. Like, clearly there,  explaining that they will go into PvP. Maybe put it with the cap cost  window you see to activate the Workstation. Clearly worded that you'll  be in PvP. Wouldn't that be a neat feature?
---
Oh man.... I never realised it was a glitch. I thought it just took some really cool pics when I was stoned and forgot lol
---
That's just weird.. Must be a glitch
---
What's the hat that you're using in your screenshot? Looks really cool!
---
Yeah so for instance, on Christmas, the day before you bought it, the servers were so bogged down I (and others here that concurred) couldn't sign on for more than 3 mins at a time. And I still get disconnected once or twice a night playing for like 3 hours. And I'm also on PC.
---
So punish the legit players even more. Lots are close to quitting. If they're punished for the actions of dupers that have been "ruining the game" for them I don't see many sticking around. 
---
Pro tip...
---
Don't carry all your junk.
---
&gt; thinks Bethesda is making their own game laggy and unbearably unstable into order to dupe and sell high level items they could just create on a whim because they're Bethesda
---
* guy who used all his steel and lead scrap to make one hell of a hat
---
&gt;Corpse flower stamen gets added to all player inventories whenever any player completes Death Blossoms event, similar to Canned Meat Stew from Feed the People
---
Is that where those have been coming from?  Four or five times now one has just appeared randomly for me and I never knew why.
---
Rockstar has the tiny-winy problem of having listen servers. 
---
Sorry, but I completely disagree with you. Duplicated items should be completely removed from the game, and most games can track item ids to accurately remove all of them.
---
As in most legal cases here in the US, the purchaser will still lose the purchased goods, and not face any criminal charges over it. Hence why only the duplicators should be banned, and the people who bought duplicated goods only lose those goods.
---
If for no other reason, it's because it's the only way to restore game balance. What's the good of banning dupers only to leave hundreds of duped TSE weapons floating about in use in the game? It still completely ruins the balance of the game to allow that.
---
If you leave the duped items, anyone who DIDN'T buy them is screwed over, including every future purchaser of the game.  
---
If you delete them, only the finite and much smaller # of people who bought them are out anything, and let's face it, most of them likely knew or at least suspected they were buying duped goods.
---
It's like buying a watch off a guy on the street, it may be a great deal, but chances are it's fake or stolen. Buyer beware. 
---
It's also how most online games with duping exploits handle this sort of thing, and for a reason.
---
Not to mention that, apparently, Gauss Rifles weren’t benefitting from rifle related perks.
---
I swear they were, but if you comb through the patch notes, you’ll see it in there.
---
This Wastelander knows the way to launch easy nukes and the Enclave hates him! 
---
I don't think that would be a good strategy for Bethesda. All I know is I would never pay a duper real money (or caps) for in game items. But if the items were sanctioned by Bethesda and in the Atom store I would. I can't be the only one who'd feel the Atom store was ok but paying cheating dupers is not.
---
I don’t really get it either. I could see people duping a few of a weapon to try and sell or whatnot...but some of the screenshots are showing literally thousands of them.  Seriously what’s the point?  Makes shit not fun when you don’t have to struggle anymore.
---
You're the only shitlord here with your negative posts.
---
Actually I have a TSE LAR that I got from a queen, and wouldn't mind loosing it if it meant the economy would be unfucked.  You wanna do shit tons of damage to scorch slap a primey boi receiver on it and bada bing bada boom all the daka
---
I agree , I would like “Some” balance with existing content though but for them to keep putting out new and interesting updates is top priority for a lot of us!
---
Yea 
---
The Neverwinter devs were real sketchy like this, a lot of us thought they were selling items via the online black market so not to lose out on the sales. They had some pretty straight forward Pay2Win in the game already though, I really would hope Bethesda wouldn’t do something like that but you never know in this world.
---
People that think game data is stored in some magical ether that BGS has simultaneously no control and full control over, likely. 
---
The team is aware of this suggestion
---
Yup. Event viewer just shows fallout76.exe failing over and over and over...
---
Must you support rapists+pedophiles an rape etc hate speech an hate crimes etc an racism an murdering an slandering etc black people?
---
What’s the joke?
---
It is fotm, there are plenty of other viable builds but it gets a lot of attention thanks to the items you can use to make it op.  Basically you want "unyielding" armor that grants +3 to all stats but end the lower your health and then combine with these base perks:  
---
[https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f114333&amp;d=s42sm0se2a12la2ir2c72sg2ss2sn0&amp;w=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f114333&amp;d=s42sm0se2a12la2ir2c72sg2ss2sn0&amp;w=&amp;n=) The agility perk is optional, really and mostly only works if you have more than just that minimum amount of agi.  
---
But yeah just about any 2h weapon becomes overkill pretty fast.   
---
I'm sure there will be some debate as to whether or not the above perks are optimal and I prolly forgot one or 2 that help the build but you get the idea.  If it helps your 2h damage, or gives you something to help you become more effective "at below X health", or helps you avoid damage, take it.

---
 &gt; The team is aware of this suggestion
---
but would it be duping then?
---
wouldnt they have some sort of console command like spawn_opboomstick_69 and spam that?
---
seems more sensible that way
---
Put the toys back in the pram!
---
This was a feature for so long that I thought the whole point of using a nuke was for quick leveling &amp; legendary farming. I hope the higher frequency of legendaries is still there unless they somehow don't intend that either. I enjoyed this game but seeing stuff like this shows me how clueless they were. No one noticed the ghouls were giving 500-800 exp each and that it wasn't supposed to be doing that? 
---
seems logical\~
---
me telling you not to spoil a good time doesn’t mean i support rape culture or whatever else you must spread around on an innocent post. take that shit elsewhere. 
---
I’m one of those who does not use power armor unless needing to in nuked zones, etc.
---
I just don’t have a reason to wear a bulky tin can 24/7. my stats are perfectly fine out of power armor and in-fact getting into power armor actually lowers my overall damage output/carry weight among other things. it just isn’t worth using just for the physical/energy resistance buff.
---
holy crap, this alone almost made me stop using the gun
---
My favorite item in the list...
---
*yawn*
---
With the flechette mod I pick up anywhere from 1-20 depending on how many times it’s gets shot. Never need to craft ammo for it ever.  
---
I should be home and settled around 5:00 (Mountain time), and hour and a half from now.
---
Just invite me to a team and drop by the CAMP. [UberToast's Clifftop C.A.M.P. Retreat](https://imgur.com/a/tm6LQrE)

BEST PATCH EVER
---
This has happened to me as well, luckily it wasn't anything valuable for me, I think. Was a long time ago.
---
Some items can display in the left column (your inventory) for maybe a split second before they hidden again. Think this mostly happens if you place multiple items in the container very quickly?
---
They should replace the inventory system on events like this with a more automated system. Press E on the container and it will automatically remove the required items.
---
Wow mate yer a proper cunt ain't ya
---
@fallout "Game sucks" 15m likes
---
They suck in that too since most wear power armor
---
I just tested this.  While in Pacifist mode I did no damage to a camp or workshop.  My buddy was having me test his security set up.  I couldn't break doors or barriers with my 2SE Handmade.  Turned pacifist off and 1 shot the doors and became wanted.   
---
Now I could have picked the locks in Pacifist and immediately became wanted...  XBOX console
---
A better explanation or indicator in-game would help, including how it works in groups and how it affects workshops.  It's pretty easy for someone not interested in PVP, which seems to be most players just looking at the map at any time, to see pacifist mode and conclude it's their way to opt out.  When all it really does is make them a helpless but very durable target.
---
I've only had someone actually focus their fire on me recently.  Previous PVP deaths have been confusing.  One may have been due to the group leader having pacifist off and me not knowing, so I got pulled in.  The other may have been due to exploiting, since I really have no idea what happened there.  Really haven't been in enough PVP situations to get a good feel for it.
---
Recently I've had 2 people just stand near me and open fire at me, providing the my first direct experience with how the damage reduction works.  They would've had to be pretty persistant to kill me, and both times they were using explosive weapons (not sure of two-shot, one seemed like it could've been that).
---
Bigger threat right now is actually the Whitespring staff, since it feels like they'll turn murdery on you if you sneeze on them.
---
Hoping pacifist mode is just a temporary fix until PVE and PVP servers are brought around.  PVE players would probably like to not have to worry about it (if they're anything like me), and PVP players would probably like some actual competition instead of players who will likely block and relocate instead of fight back.
---
It's been offered to Bethesda, heck I've tried offering them Raider Power Armor paints, nada....
---
5 pieces of Assassin armor + Lone Wanderer + Fireproof = roughly 73.6% damage reduction from TSE Explosions and 52% less from the actual bullets/beams.  If you can forgo using VATS and have highly Agility/AP, you could throw in Dodgy for 81.52 % and 66.4% respectively.
---
I doubt it will be enough to cripple TSE weapons in pvp, just as I doubt many people will build around it, but it is an option.
---
On a separate note, has anyone tested to see if Assassin reduces damage you deal to yourself, since you are a player, or is it other players only?
---
People can be a 'dick'. You missed or forget where there's no incentive to be one.  
---
That's why repairing a base is EASY and costs so little in materials. It's the apocalypse. Adapt or don't. 
---
Yeah, I literally sell them off. As a rule, I never keep more than 5. Never actually needed more than two with any lock.
---
This isn't some stupid bragging thing, it should be encouragement. Just practice the technique with thoughtfulness and patience. It doesn't take much.

And Bethesda is owned by zenimax, and zenimax is controlled by the illuminati. 
---
Duped weapon sales are funding the new world order, and their "pizza parties"
---
Don't think they can remove them since they can't identify the dupes.
---
Why doesn't anyone ever troll or grief me?! I'm bored enough to actually welcome the interaction. I feel left out :*(
---
Except the economy wouldn't be unfucked. Remember that before duping, people were charging 25k+ for TSE weapons. Yeah, a lot of those were scams, but the point still stands that it was a lot harder to actually get one via trade. Now though, due to the lower price they sit at, people that want to get one through trade can actually trade for it.
---
That's the apocalypse. It doesn't care if you get a reward or not.
---
Missing cramburger?
---
What about scorch beasts doing a shit load of damage and having that annoying sonar shit hiring you all the time and disorienting you? Or the toxic spray it has that can affect you while in a building and the other attack. The loot they drop for the amount of damage you have to do is outrageous and unfair. Though these are some good changes I feel like they should be nerfed.  
---
I can't say about armor, mine is awful but get Ironclad (E) to rank 5 and it's +50 resist to damage &amp; energy, no PA is a requirement. There are S &amp; A perks that add resist per point in that SPECIAL. There are a couple others that reduce damage specific to no PA.
---
If they do this, some asshole is going to say "Bethesda banned me and I didn't cheat!" Even though they did. Then every cheap heat youtuber will make videos about it for a months.
---
Most reasonable players would see the benefit of this, as the benefit outweighs the cost.  Loose a gun, but gain an economy that actually allows for reasonable trades
---
There were a lot of subtle UI changes - about halkd of the interface files have changed, so anyone with inventory management or widescreen mods is going to want to get those updated soon.
---
Are there many people using triple monitors?  I've done a UI mod for myself and may upload if any demand.
---
Also check to see if you have any armor parts Favorited. If you do and accidentally hit that # when trying to switch weapons it'll unequip the armor as well.
---
Holy shitballs are you dense
---
Sorry but you signed yourself up for this issue.
---
Just got logged in, did they reduce the defence ratings of power armour? My X-01 is showing 469/455/453 and I'm positive it used to be higher than that.
---
4 "heavy weapons", no, no, no, you misheard me, 4 gatling plasma's, I have a lot more than four heavy weapons, you silly Billy you.
---
The xp of glowing ones is, but I didn’t see another change in the patch notes.
---
Ironic name.
---
I killed a three star glowing ghoul and got a flare gun
---
Right there with ya. Camp raids are a good way to rile up the high level protecters. 
---
More nerfs to exp. The exact reason why I wont make any more new characters. Effectively kills the game for someone like me who likes to have multiple characters and builds.
---
I enjoy this game.
---
I lost 900 caps to some turd burglar using a TSE that wrecked my camp multiple times and followed me, in the span of an hour
---
That is exactly what happened my personal inventory appeared for less than a second while depositing the 15 items so it just happened so fast that my item appeared as the next item on the list of quest items then disappeared. My mind was slightly overloaded after talking to my doctor so I was not able to to process everything as I normally do so I thought it was just my imagination.
---
I decided to do the quest because it was quick and easy to complete and I honestly find it mentally relaxing till now haha!
---
So turns out the perimeter walls now no longer snap to foundations?
---
It's true. I feel like Youtubers are so easily able to shit on anything Bethesda does because A. They're a massive company. And B. Because they don't take control of their PR as strongly as they should/could. 
---
Let's get it fixed first.
---
Can you make a video of it? I have it on XBOX and am curious but we won't get the patch for a few more days.
---
Signed up!
---
I get paranoid if I've gone more than 20 minutes without stashing my junk.
---
Sometimes you drop things and there is no bag to loot, or it's fallen through the ground. Yesterday I saw a meat pile 30 feet in the air. You can't assume you'll be able to pick up your junk whenever you die, especially with the random disconnects.
---
Good luck in end game and the main farming zone(still best after nerf). dat' broken rad resist system.
---
Now realistic weights for weapons.  24 pound "assault" weapons plus ammo weight?  Even a WWII M1 Garand doesn't weigh close to that (9-10 pounds or so).
---
You’re insane. I’ve gotten about 3 myself. Just serverhop and kill a lot. 
---
You shut your mouth!
---
Sounds like your just a chach lol
---
Dude this is as bad as the New Vegas circle jerk, don't fuel the fire.
---
Thanks everyone
---
The stash cannot be robbed, and power armor only when its at the station, but I wasnt able to replicate the report myself.
---
LOL, and someone was just saying there's no legendaries spawning in whitesprings.
---
Just RNG man... every spawn has a chance, and sometimes you get lucky, sometimes you get unlucky.  Enjoy it =P
---
I hope you never practice law.
---
I’m not doing much whitesprings since like level 120; wouldn’t mind hoping in on pa/hazmat for the usual sbq run.
---
Friend someone on the server your in, drop stuff in a spare trash can, suitcase, box, etc... Just make sure others don't see you doing it or your stuff is gone.
---
LOL.
---
Yeah, he said t51 is best in all stats except rad resistance, you said "rad resist is what OP wants" which they never said. 
---
&gt;t-51b has nowhere near best stats 
---
But it does. You can't just say that and make it true. It has the best DR and ER stats, which you might recognize as being *somewhere near* the best stats
---
Seriously. This shit ain’t gonna get past 0 karma
---
I join then get blocked? Why? Because I blew up the unions basses? I found you through here.
---
Yep, all 3 + Tank killer and all 3 lockpicks takes 15 perception.  But I love the build.
---
BoS Combat Armor is nice, but there are others that have better physical damage resist. BoS Combat has 86 on the chest. Heavy Hardened Raider can get to 88 for example. Heavy Polished Metal can get to 117. According to this spreadsheet.

I think it would be cool if we could at least have some simple color schemes to select from for at least the T-45, T-51, and T-60 perhaps I'm fine with Excavator being a default Yellow and I'd save leave Yellow out from all the others. Just feels like its all silver or you pick the handful from the Atom shop.
---
I'm sorry but I listen to my friends, 4 of them urgently sayd to remove you, thats not a good sign buddy
---
That might take 10 years
---
Just to add, be aware the initial cost of 3 points into 1 of each perk card nets you 30%, while it takes 6 additional perks to get the additional 30% because you only get 5% per rank up.  
---
So the it costs a lot of perks elsewhere to fully max out any given weapon to 60%.  
---
Not to say you shouldn't do it, just pointing out you are sacrificing other aspects of your build to get alpha strike rifle damage if you take all 3 cards to rank 3.
---
Cool!
---
Haha, I remember I was at Top of the World and killed a Moleman, not realizing how many friends he had. I ran down the high way in a flurry of regret when I ran into Grahm. He seemed so nice, but then he saw the Molemen and started attacking them so I could escape. I've always held respect for Grahm since that day.
---
25 lbs of worthless plans?
---
The other vaults will open, leading to actual NPC and raiders.
---
Good to know! Thanks for the response!
---
I wonder if PC will still be disconnecting after the patch fixing duping.
---

Since installing 1.0.4.13, I get *double* loading screens. That is to say, I sit there for 45 to 90 seconds or 3-4x that long sometimes) watching a loading screen, then I will start to hear ambient sounds and get the black screen with the Vault-Tec logo. Then that goes away and I get another load screen for 5-10 more seconds, and finally then I get into the game.
---
Note: While typing this up, the server/game crashed and I loaded into a new server, and it didn't double load this time.  I'll keep an eye on it.
---
Not only no reason to use them, last I checked they were broken.  Plasma deals 0 damage, even after they claimed to fix it.
---
lol. Bug that people were benefiting from gets fixed and they cry, "nerf!". Adorable.
---
Have you not done the mayor quest? Someone in that building filed a complaint about a lack of trash cans. Upstairs near the mayor's office is an office full of trash cans with a note. 
---
You can break it down to cloth, bulk the cloth then sell that.
---
Pre war money is useless and should be useless.  I’m just happy it has a use now as opposed to being worth caps on 3 and NV for no reason whatsoever
---
"moron sperglords" ... Wow. How classy and a great way to make a cogent argument.
---
For what it's worth, I'm talking about what successful living would be like when the whole world has gone to hell. 
---
I'm not talking about gamers whining. (Which they always will.)
---
If I were personally in that position, I'd certainly have more than a few hundred pounds of crap stored. I'd be keeping everything that's possibly useful to keep myself alive.
---
But thanks for giving the info.
---
What are you system specs?
---
I'm a dual Xeon system, wondering if they changed the threading or something else that's causing instability for a few but more stability for most..
---
I know nothing first hand about duping but I thought the method for duping was to cause the server to crash
---
There aren't any legendary hunting rifles in the game
---
But they dont have a Deerstalker or Calabash pipe on the game.  :(
---
Ok that's because I blew up their bases I don't mess with normal traders/events. How about you not ban people if they didn't do anything to you.
---
How much were the worth before, and how much after?
---
Bump.
---
LOL!  I had the funniest thing happen today.  I barely got logged in and was inside my locked camp.   A lvl 11 player with a 5 cap bounty was downstairs.  I ran down there an figured the bounty was from picking my low level lock.  "hey man put your junk in the stash box quick because bounty hunters...."  and before I finished my sentence a high level player in full PA picked my lock, one shotted him, took his loot and left.  
---
The bounty hunter took a quick tour of my place and left without damaging me or my Camp.  Thank you for being polite!  Also, when he picked my lock it didnt seem to give him a 'wanted' bounty.  Maybe thats by design so wanted players cant hid in other players camps?  Not sure!
---
Ive had people message me to kill them.  It is so sad!  But Ive done it.  They get out of their armor, I turn off pacifist, shoot them and then guard their loot until they spawn back.  Feels horrible even doing them a favor. LOL  PvE pacifist in me :)
---
AH! I remember now ty
---
It changes every where I believe 
---
I have an armour penetrating lever action rifle...so I’m good lol
---
Your duping actions may not cause instabilities issues for you, but it could cause issues with others, as you are taking server resources to dupe which could/should be used by legitimate players. 
---
You just level up but hold off on allocating points.  When you've got enough saved up, then allocate.
---
is this fake? I've looked everywhere and cant find it
---
Where is the best place to find ballistic fiber? 
---
Cave crickets spawn in rotation with ants and mole rats at Lucky Hole Mine, just west of Fort Defiance.
---
I apologize you exist helping spread&amp;support rape an rape culture an rapes of kids an racism an murdering an slandering black ppl an gaslighting etc an willfull ignorance. The community would benefit from better community members instead ppl trying to argue with rape etc vics so ppl can keep a "safe "skewed vision of their favorite games and the people who work for them.
---
Good view of it.
---
Well, your going to need a tap and die set, that'll run you like $50, that'll make your screws. Then you need something round to wrap the steel around to make the springs. That is some pretty advanced equipment to find in the apocalypse, I mean, it's not like you are trying to make something simple like a nuclear powered generator or a military grade exoskeletal tank.
---
Hey, you in my spot .. nicely done .. I got a slightly different perspective, mine is more of a cosy cottage, I really like the spot ..
---
Nice and big and spacious ..
---
Nice. I just got one as well.
---
And my axe
---
I just wanted to win some prizes
---
I see the point.
---
They apparently fixed something today too. We shall see. 
---
r/madlads 
---
Oh jeez yeah, i guess when yiu out it like that it does seem pretty unrealistic to be able to make these high tech resources
---
yeah and goverment is on to you etc
---
Knowing what I do about Sansha, I'd say he's far too cheap to ever do that.
---
No shit. Last night in a nuke zone a 3 star bloated ghoul dropped a drill. I kept going back to the body, like making sure i was reading everything right. It was weird, he just ran up out of nowhere in front of the club house at white springs. Not part of a mob or anything.
---
You could just bank your levels until you have enough transition without losing effectiveness
---
Ive done it once with a friend and once solo. when i was solo, ten seconds in a player uncloaked and tried to TSE me when i walked around a corner. Never ever ever going back there.
---
Does this mean that a legendary rifle may actually be better than a handmade??? Oh gd I hope so! 
---
Well, we have Faction PvP supposedly coming somewhere in the future. I'm curious about how they will make it.
---
If you place more than 1 are the laughs synced up or could you stagger them to make it even more creepy?
---
Who said that?  
---
It was advertised as "survival lite" or to put it in a different way, not hard
---
Why did you level it? Was it outside the golfcourse?
---
Something(grenade etc) made one trashcan clip the geometry of the other and the physics engine is constantly processing a collision making them fly around as a result.
---
Actually from the way things look with the sale of them for strait cash, caps weren't always changing hands for these items.  It's part of the reason I'm nonplussed about the thought of losing my own TSE that was gotten legitimately as people bitched that the atom shop would be pay to win, then came in to dupe to facilitate such things, ruining the stability/playability of the game for others, complaining about said issues they were creating, and then actually just being cancerous fucks for the comunity.  If they get upset and leave from TSE being removed then I personally think the comunity as a whole will be better off without them.
---
sweet!
---
Did you not read? He upgraded his vault suit with flux. It’s not easy to replace.
---
It's an MMORPG less than 6 months after release. Of course if you just do the normal quests and then stand around  saying, "Is that it?" you're going to to be less than impressed. Most MMO's are like that. Storyline isn't the core mechanic and you almost never have story options that completely diverge your endgame position away from that of everyone else unless it's faction based.
---
For example, If you sit in your ship with your thumb up your ass in Eve Online you'll be board af. It took well over a year for the community to make something of that game and it's almost entirely community driven with very little server side things to do in comparison. Or...
---
If you sit in a city with your thumb up you ass in WoW you'll get bored pretty quickly even with all the questing that can be done. You need to join raids, instances, and guilds to get the full experience. Or...
---
If you sit in a Star Base with your thumb up your ass in Star Trek: Online you miss out on most top tier ships you get access to if you join a fleet.
---
The issue of their being a lack of choice in an MMO isn't the problem, the problem is you're playing an MMO expecting it to play like an offline RPG. You're right, it does not stand against previous entries in the series. But it is the best official Online Fallout game I've ever played.
---
Someone going around downvoting dissenting views on NV haha. 
---
Yeah you’re right, going even slightly off the beaten path was an absolute death trap. Don’t even get me started on the cazadores that gang up on you and aggro you for miles. They even follow you under water like what the fuck. 
---
The ammo stuff was complicated for me at the time so I just didn’t use it. I might go back and check it out but I just didn’t even care to try it since I was loading my character up with caps through gambling and selling stuff. 
---
I couldn’t finish fallout 4 because I just couldn’t get into it. I loved the new art style, new gunplay, new power armor, etc, but I couldn’t stand the fact that there were so few enclaves of survivors and diamond city was about the biggest one. I also really just hated the main story and it felt so dry. Since I’m enjoying 76 I might go back and retry 4. I heard good things about the DLC too. 
---
Well for shits n giggles, i guess yeah Combat Armor is best. Try to get heavy pieces, and then BOS mod on them. The best legendary for defenses is probably vanguard if you like to stay higher HP. The sentinel for 3rd affix.
---
Nice!  I had a heck of a time surrounding the extractor.. So at first I build a little house behind and had some defense concrete up around the extractor.  Then I realized I could build a patio out from my second floor to cover the top of extractor at least.  Then a buddy showed me that you can drop walls down from the second floor 'balcony' and that those walls can go INTO dirt that a dang foundation wont.  So...it ended up huge!  but super fun to build :)  Just moved here this week.  lvl 69 and just figured out you could build on these type of extractor sites.  LOL!
---
Also - I might choose a different server if my camp spot isnt available.  But I like to come see what others have done first.  Do you have photos??
---
I'll give you a topic - The Heavy Barreled Auto Grenade Launcher is neither a Heavy nor an Automatic weapon. Discuss.
---
I am PS4 too I need help too level 40 and excavator power armor I am a quote squeaker but I am good at the game and one question do you have the stimpack recipe? 
---
Interesting opinion! Although, I respectfully disagree. By this logic the various vending machines for things like ammo and medical supplies should not require caps. In fact, they shouldn't even have a way to receive caps. 
---
Do you know where I can get it?
---
You can carry multiple different guns. If someone wants to screw with you in power armor, tse dunk them.  Otherwise use something else. 
---
If anything this just fucks over anyone looking to use reasonable weapons like missile launchers or auto grenade launchers. Yay for balance....
---
Curiously, what weapon are you using?
---
The Gauss in 76 is listed as an energy weapon in the crafting menu but does ballistic damage. No idea whether the ammo counts as energy or ballistic though!
---
Are you not intelligent? If we're on the same platform I can replace it for him.
---
Crazy that everyone made that relation lol 
---
20 was my carry amt
---
Exactly, a little forge machine could do that
---
No I understand everyone has the right to be a dick but why choose to be a bully to lower level players when there are other ways to get stuff. Being a bully to lower level players and causing them not to want to play is bad for everyone and repairing my base wasn't easy it took almost all the scrap I had
---
I just take off all clothes and armor, put on a goofy hat, and sit down at the banjo near the vendor just north of that army training base.
---
Then I go take a quick bathroom break.
---
I’ve been dead by the time I get back every time 
---
Tried my TSE handmade, regular shotgun, explosive grenade and plasma grebade. Even my fists wouldn't kill it.
---
Also as for Legendary effects, it all depends what suits your build and playstyle I guess, and some legendary effects are very situational, like ones that reduce damage from certain enemies. Ideally you would want to get the legendary stats on the heavy armor of your preference, but use whatever you can until then.
---

---
joking about self harm. way to go man
---
Thats because they didnt and dont plan to listen to us. Im also glad you didnt go as far as saying this is a complete redemption of past sins, because that would be a little silly and make us wonder who is paying you to say that.
---
Heavy is an armor type like raider or wood, etc? This whole normal armor concept is completely alien to me.
---
Already got an Instigating one 
---
just curious, whats the real benefit of the boosted stats? i have a bloodied spear (not a god teir weapon) that 1shots everything outside of nuke zones when im at 30% health.  in a nuke zone, youre going to wear power armor or rad suit.  
---
So what use are the extra stats when low hp builds easily 1shot stuff already? 
---
that said, I am working on an alt for this build just to check it out.  stats will be
---
15, 3, 1, 15, 3, 4, 15
---
capping chr for rewards, and ive heard luck effects legendary monster spawns but have not seen evidence.  on my phone so cant link build.
---
mod ... they are a great source of extra details, not just graphs.
---
who plays on PC can access it, but like me who plays on the console(PS4) it is cut off.
---
Post a pic it sounds hilarious 
---
what mobs are you referring to specifically?
---
I live in a hovel
---
We had this last night, seemed every other robot was legendary. Probably a similar total number to you. Like you all one star garbage but was weird. Never seen this before. 
---
Damn I had a nice power fist I just sold for caps to a vendor cause haven’t been able to play a lot - but wanted my daily caps lol 
---
Is there a list of rewards? Have my handmade rifle plans but don’t wanna keep doing it is I have all the plans it offers
---
Seen this before. He was French before he mutated.
---
That has an X rated sound to it...
---
My experience was a lvl 5 tick and a 42 bloatfly
---
Bethesda claims stash is limited because of server Instability issues. With that idea in mind 200k tse's loading into the server can't be good. That's the theory anyways.
---
Literally every game works that way. Your inventory is just a database, the contents are just a row in that DB.   
---
holy shit, i've done this quest a dozen times... haven't had an issue "yet".
---
Not exactly looking for solely phys damage resist, but an all around one. The chart is extremely helpful, though, thank you!
---
fortune favors the bold....I hope...
---
&gt; Carnivore: meat items give 2x benefits and no disease, but no vegetables (does it work only with raw meat or with other meat-related stuff as well? I'm especially curious about a dog food)
---
Packaged food is unaffected.  As a carnivore, I can eat dandy boy apples and instamash.  My friend who has herbivore can eat Salisbury Steak.  I see no increase from packaged meat food (or dog food)
---
Watoga BOS is where I see the Powerfist plans the most.  
---
Maybe they took it as "so you think you can kill me punk?!" 
---
Nope just redownload
---
To the place I belong
---
show me...
---
But are they really fixing the stuff? Cause every patch feels empty
---
Oh right because you saying that a regular vault suit is replaceable clearly means you want to know his platform even though you never implied that.
---
My gunsmith is 5 and that, lucky draw, and weapon artisan are essentially *required* for energy weapons.
---
At this point they aren't perk cards, they just help me meet the minimum point of game play to be reasonable... And they still don't even reach that point.
---
YES, was really a bummer when I'd bought that and it went from broken glass door to windows I couldn't see in or out.
---
I have actually come to accept the weight. Honestly I’ve only broken a few pins, so there really is no need to carry more than 10, and it’s silly to carry more than that.
---
I started dropping 20 pin paper bags, and half the people didn’t want them. 
---
It’s nice that they weigh less, but you don’t need that many anyway. 
---
Be careful
---
Yeah I'm on pc, that would be awesome. I wont be able to get online for a few more hours though. I have caps but unfortunately not much else worth trading...unless you're a fan of legendary pole hooks.
---
And how many of those legendaries were worth anything and didn't end up at a vendor or in the trasyxh?
---
I dont get that either, why do enemies scale to whatever players around them but then the turrets at bases dont. Okay so how am I supposed to deal with my house in the forest when a group respawns and attacks me because a level 98 decided to walk passed me, all the sudden me a level 30 is supposed to kill level 68 enemies solo. Armor gets wrecked so I have to pay ballistic fibre to fix it, weapons break, turrets are useless, everything at my camp gets destroyed.
---
Anyone saying that budget increases with level is either lying, trolling, or my game is totally bugged. To test it I maxed out my budget on a character at level 10, that character is now level 34 and the budget at that characters camp is still maxed out without changing anything at said camp for 24 levels. 
---
Yea I had a small sample size of playing with other players, but I can see how the PvP balance right now is really wonky. But it seems like a simple fix once Bethesda starts working on balance - nerf the explosive prefix.  But I think right now they're working on the primary problem - patching all dupe methods and then hopefully they'll get to balancing so TSE aren't so godly.
---
&gt;  If they get upset and leave from TSE being removed then I personally think the comunity as a whole will be better off without them.
---
So you think the game will be better if the legitimate players who spent hundreds of hours farming for their preferred TSE weapon? Also, I do so enjoy how you're only thinking that TSE's are the only weapon that got duped yet don't seem to think about the various melee weapons.
---
OMG you are an asshole. Seriously. 
---
I have 8 or 9, and its possible to get all of them at once with the exception of Carnivore and herbivore ... for those its one or the other.
---
It worked.  I took my time rebuilding my inventory, brought in a fatman with me and a suppressed gauss rifle and went straight on to the scorchbeast in the belly of the cavern.  Took the bastard down without a stimpak and am on to further missions.  thanks WolfbornXVII.  Appreciate the suggestion.
---
I haven’t really explored Watoga that much, can you be more specific? 
---
On the golf course, pewpewpewing the ghouls inside the clubhouse.
---
I always level them, because they're really fucking annoying.
---
Personally, I love me some Vanguard armor. If you're used to running around with tons of DR, try out Vanguard. As long as you keep your health up, you'll be able to take hits like a champ.
---
I was an support staff (was called Followers of Asura) on Age of Conan -- the original release. We had access to a limited view of player's inventory. That was not even close to the level of detail and log access that the actual devs had. 
---
&gt; What was the last Fallout game in which energy weapons were in a good place compared to the other weapons?
---
This is what I was responding to.
---
&gt; That's like 2 shot any high powered weapon
---
Indeed it is. It was a high powered weapon in FO4, not a weak one, and so that answers the original question of when they were in a good place compared to other weapons. "Unique" doesn't really matter, what matters is that it kills shit good. There are no "Unique" ballistic weapons either, only ones that kill shit good and ones that don't. It doesn't need to throw confetti and make the enemies dance the macarena or anything. It just needs to have comparable damage to ballistic weapons like it did in FO4.
---
I don't like the random crashes.  Great game but goddamn my nigga
---
I think mixing PvP with events is the wrong way to do it. I personally have no interest in mixing PvP with my legendary item grind, which is why I have avoided that one. I agree that the organic nature of PvP is what makes it great, which is also why I'm against platform-wide queues for PvP events (and just in general, PvP focused events). It totally takes away from the organic nature of it when you can pretty much expect to be thrown right into the experience. Most games that bring in instanced/focused ways to engage in PvP tend to shift away from that organic experience. I've quit quite a few that have done this because it becomes such a bore and takes away everything that is dynamic about it. 
---
Of course, the majority of my apprehension towards PvP events mostly stems from the lack of meaningful ways to chase legendary gear. Perhaps if that was addressed I wouldn't mind PvP-focused events. But overall, the PvP in this game has a long way to go before it's engaging and fun and I prefer a distinct separation of PvP and methods for grinding better gear.
---
Maybe not the law but they are violating Bethesda's TOS, just with BSG had a team to actually monitor for this stuff and hard ban the accounts in question
---
I don’t have that one yet, when do you play? 
---
I'd suggest you block them first, so they won't be able to find you on map at all. Maybe only for that session, if you don't want to fill your list with random blocks.
---
Crouched is also an option, yeah.
---
While I'm glad this was reduced, it would have helped in my lower levels, I never really needed to carry more than 5. Once you see the pattern on the lock it was pretty easy to guess where to start. Now all we need is quick sets for perk cards so I can quick equip lockpick and hack perks when im faced with that minigame. Not a huge pain to switch out but I always forget to switch back. 
---
When I wanted to move from a melee build to the TSE shotgun build, I started a new character.
---
Then I realised I had to do ALL the quests again... and get ALL of the plans I bought previously... and have to farm ALL the recipes and plans.
---
I decided it's easier to just keep levelling up my original toon and slowly get them perk cards.
---
Does this fix all the issues? Does it nerf things more or make it easier to play?
---
I have two copies of grognok the barbarian (not 100% sure if the exact name).  Shows as a stacked (2) holodisk.
---
I play ps4 how do i get my free stuff 
---
You're the one who can't keep up with the grown folks, your "sick burn" didn't pan out because its false based on my own earlier comments. you should try reading the entire thread before ASSuming what I do or do not know. 
---
Combat armor can drop as light or heavy I think. The heavy ones will look slightly different and have a little more armor rating. They can use the same mods as any combat armor though.
---
Never getting NPCs
---
Drop them at the bottom of a river so no one finds them
---
west Virginia 
---
God, luck of the draw sucks too. I ended up switching it out again, because it just doesn't process enough. But I completely agree.
---
I’ve been doing full sessions with a workshop trying to get lots of junk and plans.  Now that I know it’s the best way to get plans. 
---
Shopping Plaza - more towards the east side
---
Legendary combat shotgun, +30% damage to mirelurks/bugs
---
Legendary Gatling Gun, double ammo capacity
---
Legendary Handmade, damage increases as your health decreases
---
Was also a legendary Gatling Laser, but I’ve never liked that weapon. 
---
Two legendary armor pieces which I sold, some more I left for others. 
---
Sure, but if the "Db" is a modded save file used to work in multiplayer without any tools written to do mass searches/purges it isn't going to be viable or even possible to do.
---
Try Watoga, vendor bot Phoenix is usually good to have plenty of BoS stuff. I think there’s also one in Grafton that stocks BoS stuff pretty regularly. 
---
Grognak and the ruby ruins.. Thanks for the input! Wondering where the hell my nuka tapper went then lol
---
That's because it is reasonable. But present reason and logic to the "BETHESDA ARE INCOMPETENT HAAAEEETTT" train and they'll explode. 
---
Sick burn? LOL. Whatever. Oh my I'm sitting here all covered in shame form your self proclaimed sick burn! Woah is me! 
---
Get bent. 
---
Happened to me when I was lower level. Lost my only decent gun and it was a huge hassle. Would be brutal to lose what I have now. Sorry man :( Have avoided that event since
---
i thought there weren’t legendary hunting rifles
---
There was over 150 fixes in today's patch alone.
---
Bought mine at Whitesprings (inside the resort), but I think there is one at Berkeley Springs
---
Ok I'll have a look around thanks
---

---
If you’re XB1 I’ve got an extra soldier suit you’re welcome to, if that’s the one you’re looking for. 
---
Yeah I'm going to stop doing that quest... I have a 3 star legendaries across the board that I cannot afford to lose :(
---
When are they going to raise the stash weight?
---
No, I'd rather they deal will the things that people have been most upset about first. They dealt with some of it, great, but not increasing the storage limits?? Giving dupers a free pass and letting them keep all their stuff?? Not even fixing the damage output on tse shotguns?? These things have clearly been the fixes people have been hoping for. They really didn't fix things as much as it seems. I think they've sort of given up on this game. :(
---
How many caps does something like that go for?
---
I think that's too powerful for a camp item. Not to mention I wouldn't want one because everyone would try to steal it. 
---
However, a workshop that produced those would be nice. Say a fastener shop of some kind. I can see it being hotly contested like the ammo factory or the fusion core manufacturer.
---
mountain mama 
---
It would be kinda cool if you could recharge a power core at a fusion generator or something as long as the core wasn’t completely depleted.
---
TSE is the worst offender of this, that's why I use it as an example, and it would be the easiest fix I can think of, by making two shot and explosive legendary effects be mutually exclusive of each other.
---
Also: if you spent 100s of hours farming for a gun just because it's 'good' I really don't loose any sleep at the thought of you loosing it, again I'd also be loosing mine, but I'd view it as a necessary sacrifice and the lesser of two evils.  Do I like the gun, yes.  But at this point just using it leaves a bad taste in my mouth because I know what folks are doing with these weapons and how they are ruining the ability for others to actually play the game (duping affects server stability) or using exploits to essentially become gods, and making it so no one else can get credit for some things (like queenie kills)
---
tl:dr; if you only have fun in a game by being the biggest, strongest, baddest thing around, maybe play something other than fallout 76, as your not just affecting yourself, but also affecting those around you with your actions.
---
It causes you to get booted not for the whole server to crash. 
---
I realize this has been said already, but these patch notes read more like the notes for a beta version than a released game.
---
I get what you’re saying, but you might have noticed that after Bethesda nerfed the resource extractor rates and changed the output to raw ore, workshops have been almost ignored. If I get 20 nuclear ore per hour, then I only get 4 nuclear material per hour after crafting. It’s just not worth it. 
---
They need to either up the output from workshops, or add more resources to the map. If they want to create a player economy, and have certain people specializing in resource gathering, ammo making, weapon crafting, etc. then they are going in the wrong direction.
---
There absolutely SHOULD be a way to get way more resources than you’d need, if you specialize in it. That’s how an economy works in online games. You trade what you have produced too much of, for what you have nothing of.
---
You do realize database and what is logged/recorded/stored differs entirely from game to game right? Some games use similar structure, others use different.
---
Age of Conan was written ground up to be a multiplayer game for starters.
---
Half the time I don't notice an event I like has popped up until like 10 minutes later, and then pay caps to fast travel there only to find out it's just about to end or did end while I was loading.  I wish there were 1) timers on visible events so you knew how much time was left and 2) a way to flag events so you got an alert when one you like appears.  The game seems to (inconsistently) send out a server wide alert when somebody gets wanted status, why not something helpful like your favorite event is starting?
---
Only once this week for me but it’s hard. I play on a team of 4 and often at least one of us can’t camp because of where we are.  
---
The industrial purifier wasn’t worth it. Didn’t seem to put out as often as the dirt one!  Plus now it’s stuck in storage bugged. LOL
---
I’ve only seen Morgantown nuked once. 
---
take me home
---
...yeah, I meant the BoS Soldier Suit. It’s one of the under armors but it’s the orange looking one not the black (Officer’s Uniform) BoS under armor. 
---
I dont think they're any more rare than they uswd to be but they are just used more since repairing and crafting are in FO76 when they werent in FO4
---
You think a save file from a single player game, which literally has no concept of "other players" and whose scripts solely reference "the player", is what Bethesda is using to save characters?  
---
Just stop. You're embarassing yourself. 
---
Or bump max levels of weapon crafting/drops after the fix making most of those weapons obsolete anyway. Or adjust/nerf damage a bit with a follow up update. 
---
Cause everyone plays games differently seems selfish that you assume everyone wants the same thing as you. 
---
country roads
---
What platform?
---
I honesty don‘t even care. I just want it as I‘ve been looking for it forever
---
But in general about 5k I‘d guess
---
 No this is good for a rad build like myself 
---
all my memories
---
I think it would be tough to punish players who got a lucky drop and obtained their weapon honestly. Is there a way for Bethesda to tell the difference? 
---
I wish they would delete all duped items including bobbleheads and magazines, but I don't think they will. I feel like the only player running around with a crappy shotgun that barely kills bloaters.
---
I mean if you can tell me how you can tell who bought or obtained duped items, or be able to tell the difference between duped and original, that would be pretty great, but the thing is you can't. And pretty much every vaguely useful item in the game was duped at some point, sooooo.... who can we tell the blatant cheaters from the accidental ones are?
---
The only problem is now I'm paranoid of friend requests.
---
Thats what supporting them means now sadly since they allow a rapist to use their main twitter etc for posts an the rapist uses their page to promote etc the games an events, she gets booth action too. Means supporting tampering with coercing etc witnesses to rape of child (me) to give false police reports&amp;etc an helping them pay to cover up rapes an attack the victims. Until community etc boots the ppl working for them an in community ruining the game an company.
---
 I used to want to work for them too&amp; because i truly dont support gatekeeping or abuses etc and i love seeing advancements an helping them arise. Im a esfj. Have bunch friends who had liked to play etc as well. 
---
Countless other ppl i believe are more deserving of the position that the rapist currently holds. And id love nothing more than people with better ethics etc working for them. If thats you then i back you
---
It is all speculation. You're deluding yourself if you think a game using hobbled Quake netcode is beyond doing that.
---
The game isn't written from ground up for database integration for starters.
---
If the game was even using a standard database or properly designed to do so we wouldn't even be having debates about stash and storage space to begin with.
---
Comprehensive list- 
---
Systems: Fixed an issue where items could be duplicated.
---
YESSSSSS
---
Crafting: Ballistic Fiber becomes required for armor at level 25 instead of previously at level 20.
---
NOOOOOOO
---
It would be nice if your response had anything to do with post above. After reading through all your post I get where your coming from. I believe TSE should continue in game to balance out Melee so we aren't stuck with just melee. As you probably can tell I'm not a fan of melee just like your not a fan of TSE. I've said from day one on this sub that PvP is broken. TSE is just a part of the PvP disaster, albeit the most visable. We have differing opinions on course of action 
---
Had a bloodied lvl 50 do the whole breaks and keeps working thing. I proceeded to kill every scorchbeast I could find. 
---
Isn't that the purpose of having a melee build?
---
You already get normal resource extractors in camps so they would be targeted any more then the extractors already are, simply locking them is usually enough, but yeah a workshop would also be good
---
Yep, first thing I did was go to Harper's Ferry and OH HAI AGAIN, RADIUM RIFLE PLANS, MY ANCIENT NEMESIS.
---
If you got to that vendor after level 20, you'll never know it's supposed to sell the Handmade Rifle plans, the Crossbow plans, plans for the Targeting Computer mod for the missile launcher, and a host of other things that are hidden.
---
I'm willing to bet that MODUS' armory is bugged as well
---
This is what you get when you can't decide if the game should be based on crafting or RNG Vendors, and then giving a couple of things only one source.
---
Yeah I tried there.  Six times I server hopped and never got them.
---
Ginseng also at the farm workshop near Harper's ferry, can't remember name.
---
True I like it on my main so I don’t need to re radiate but it is a challenge level increase for early game and nerf to death similar to how many ppl enjoyed providing food to the server when they did feed the ppl
---
gather round her
---
Nah, I'm looking for the treated one, don't know if it's a mod for under armour tho... thanks anyways
---
Is Mike Myers livin in a van down by the river now?
---
Only thing new I saw in the notes was the legendary hunting rifle
---
i still have 2 full set of plans from doing her.
---
3k for a whole set of plans if you are interested xD
---
Miners' lady
---
Reasonable to assume they're like every other MMO out there, and using some combination of Redis and Mongo. 
---
Thats what i figured which is why ill get lvl 2 of goat legs assuming it stacks. And after i jump several times for fun. I know and as someone mentioned the numbers in fallout are not always perfect. 
---
That's awesome. I was pissed when I bought that door and immediately swapped it back just for that reason. 
---
&gt;&gt; different strings for different things aren't neatly layered and woven like an elegant tapestry, but rather wrapped  around an angry cat writhing in the throes of a bad acid trip.
---
I fee like you’re personally attacking the way some of my coworkers write code with this one....
---
Bear Arms under Strength.
---
I want to learn to duplicate, where can I do that?
---
Gotta sell those PA skins. Ugh.
---
Yeah but it produces a variety. You don't get a lot of screws, springs, and gears overall. A dedicated one would produce far more to even be viable. That concentration makes it a better target 
---
&gt;Not increasing storage limits
---
They did. They increased it a bit in order to collect data to see if they should increase it more. Data collection takes time. 
---
&gt;Giving dupers a free pass
---
How is Bethesda supposed to figure out who is duping? I’m sure they’d do something if they could, there’s no way they made a conscious decision to let exploiters roam free
---
&gt;I’d rather they deal with X first
---
That’s not how game development works. Some Things are a lot easier than other things. This is probably the easiest stuff coming. And then in a bit, we’ll get more fixes that may have been a more complex problem. I assure you that searching for and banning dupers is a complex problem if they aren’t as prepared for it as they thought. 
---
Also name is Squidshock
---
I want people not to cheat and not to use items obtained by cheating... How selfish of me. 
---
I'm scared to ask how long the reload time is with 4x the "mag" size. Also scared of how all those rounds fit in your gun, lol.
---
That’s funny, I actually find it ridiculous how people who overtly love 76 can’t handle when people criticize the game. I play it daily, but when Bethesda posted a tweet asking which bobblehead was your favorite, I responded with “none of them because you ruined them” (which is undeniably true) and instantly had some crazed fanboy jump down my through for criticizing the game. 
---
It’s a great game, it’s not perfect, and we should be actively criticizing problems. 
---
I find it was difficult shooting scorchbeasts when they were flying with the plasma due to the projectile travel speed but when it landed it got melted pretty fast 😁.
---
Scorchbeasts are now nothing more than a minor nuisance haha
---
&gt;Their database likely dumps the information into logs just saying. Which is a thing.
---
Yes, that's literally what a log is. Are you sure you've got experience with this? Because it really, really doesn't sound like it.
---
Still there :) thank you a month later
---
Stranger to new waters
---
I guess that could work and look pretty cool - tho just individual scorch beasts might look a bit lonely and groups would be formidable 
---
Or I've been saying that we should be able to make the higher MK turrets. Like how MKVIIs have incendiary rounds and MKVIIIs have explosive rounds. Just make them require more perks (like explosive expert for MKVIII) and have them build as variants to the regular types.
---
I'm thinking its coincidence and agree completely but its a little odd that the improvement is so sudden and it doesn't happen in any other games. 
---
I'm playing on Xbone and all other games are stable on Ethernet but I'm going to play half on WiFi and half wired tonight to see if I can replicate the issue.
---
I live in an apartment and am pretty familiar with Wifi instability due to interference since there are 30 AP's within range of my Xbox leading to some less than ideal range and connection reliability which is why I've run Cat5e into every room. 
---
We all knew what we were buying. Would like to see the purge.
---
The main difference being, the way I play is the way it was intended to be played and it doesn't give me an unfair advantage over other players, destroy the economy, or cause server instability. Your justification is pretty much case in point
---
500 caps
---
I love workshops I want to do them a lot more and claim them all. Imagine if there was an achievement to control every workshop on the map hehe. I think the most I have done is 3 or 4 and I ended up giving up as the defend alerts were getting annoying. But I don't think I set up the defenses very good so that's something I will think about next time I claim a lot of them. There are a few good ones I really like like Charleston Landfill, Gorge Junkyard, Grafton Steel, Tyler County Dirt Track, Munitions Factory, Dabney Homestead, etc. There are still a few I need to check out. But yeah they are great.
---
well, you sure can't make ammo anymore
---
Is it still available? I’ll give you an extra 300 caps. 
---
dark and dusty
---
look man, i share your views truly. it’s just this really wasn’t the place to post it :/ 
---
thank you for backing me, and understanding i do not support rapist and racists and everyone else who tries to justify hateful actions. 
---
i just found posting that kinda unnecessary is all. but thank you for sharing your views/opinion. in all honesty i didn’t know about any bethesda rape scandal until now. doesn’t ruin that i want to work there, but doesn’t mean i support any bad decisions they or the individual has made. 
---
That's a lot of letters for apologizing for not being very intelligent.
---
PS4 player here..  Never did the run, but I am up for assisting. I run pure melee.. only gun fired was the stinger for Rose... usually on around 8PM Eastern M-F.. weekends vary.. Gamer tag is the same as reddit. 
---
100.000
---
You can expect a community to all get banned they did name one of there own shops Super Duper Mart 
---
Wouldn't mind this one bit. Or ackowledge it on the vendor purchase screen.
---
Only been bit by this once, but even for a few hundred caps it stung. 
---
At this point, i'll happily cling to vague hope!
---
Seriously I deathran a new character over to Harper's Ferry to see what I was missing... I was kinda shocked at how many plans were there, with no other source, that my "real" character never knew existed and had nearly killed myself trying to get. 
---
It wouldn't be as big a deal if so many other weapons were unusable in their current form. And I'm not just sayin' this, I've tried, run tests, etc., and you just run out of resources trying to use them and they're not even very effective. So I hope the plans and things like Plasma issues are more "definitely in the next patch," and less like "they're aware and will eventually look at it."
---
I've had five or six explosive and TSE in 150+ hours of game play and apparently I'm a liar. I would love to see everyone that has 10+ of the exact same gun to be punished. Not so much everyone that earned them. Every person I've seen with them that they've found they all had different stats and legendary affixes and mods already attached. I was dumbfounded when I stripped my gauss rifle down not noticing I was raising stats but unequipping late game mods. My shotgun was base everything when I found it. 
---
Drop it all in a lake like I did. Keep what you want first. Lol
---
Yeah, I just had a CTD when I got close to a scorched queen. And a few stutters here and there. Not much has changed with this patch.
---
Whoever holds the largest volume of duped weapons is likely source or seller, tracking their trades back and the exact stats if the item could probably be used to find those items and delete them.
---
BDO developer calls them logs. I referred to them as logs. Someone tried to correct me. I provided them that information? What was the point of responding to this out of context bud?
---
How do they identify which items are duped? I have bought two TSE weapons off of people in game for hard earned cap. Didnt asked if they were duped and dont want to know but I damn sure dont want to lose them cuz they cost me a lot of caps. I didnt cheat and I shouldn't be punished for it.
---
Right, so making a suggestion about a cool thing to add is complaining, i have been speaking the truth the entire time and i also have a youtube channel with videos that can back me up for at least some of what ive said.  
---
You have simply resited anything ive said because you are apparently scared of change and have no imagination to what this game could be.  
---
Im not demanding anything and if they did put my idea in it wouldnt even be gamechanging, but it would be a nice little addition.  
---
You seem to be lost that not everyone wants to play this game exactly like you do so would rather an option feature not be there because you personally wouldnt want to use it.
---
Have you tested the ranks of the perk yet?  
---
Spawn at the train station. From inside go through the door that leads to the parking lot in front of the high school. Veer to the right and hop over the fence and down to the street, go between the buildings until you come to the super duper mart, inside will be Phoenix, the BoS protectron vendor. 
---
LMAO. Did you just try to claim it's entrapment???
---
There is so much wrong with what you replied I don't even know where to start.
---
I'm on an old but still quite good i7 980X (although I am upgrading once the new batch of 'X' 10nm Intel chips are in open market later this year) but I digress...
---
The only thing I can see on my system that could affect threading in any way would be my use of a program called 'Process Lasso'.
---
Saying that though, I've tried the game today with it running, off and all sorts of setting combinations and am still getting the same issues.
---
Since there really wasn't much change from the norm after watching my core use in real-time on the second monitor, I don't think it's a rendering issue. My money is on something back-end their side that's communicating very badly to the local client.
---
Suspected more anti-dupe methods or hook prevention maybe? I don't know - I'm just pissing into the wind here really. All I know is yesterday was fine.
---
I got a bounty accidentally one time, so I just ran over to where a blast zone was and just did the taunt emote until someone killed me.
---
I enjoy cooking lots of different kind of food cus of the buffs. But then afer playing for a while everything is gone bad already, so i just go back to Zombie food...
---
It doesnt produce them from nothing thouhh, you would have to put steel into it to get anything out
---
idk why but I find the industrial purifer is too large and ugly for me, used them all the time in FO4, but can't bring myself to use them in 76. I run 6-7 small water pumps instead, they still don't all work on the same cycle. Supposedly the skinned version in the atom shop runs a different cycle, so you get more water if you mix the two. Does the large purifier make 5 at a time vs 2 ? Besides you need water and generally can't build at a spot like this. I think I have only seen one post where they had a pond an a deposit at the same, somewhere near top of the world.
---
I have see twice it got nuked, first time I ignored it, 2nd time I was at my camp, I had a blast been so closed, I loved it. I hope people nuke it more.
---
Here a few pics of my first try at this spot. I was going more making the harvestor a center piece surrounded by a patio.

You willingly admitted nothing would stop your dumb tantrum, why even bother replying?

I mean, I got downvoted into negatives for merely pointing out that logs \*exist\*.
---
People need to get off the soap box or go to fallout Reddit I probably bought one idk if it was or wasn't but guess what I play how I want you play how you want if it bother you get 23 other like minded people and fill a server with purity tm 
---
I have been trying to get even a SINGLE calibrated shock for three weeks. Not one. I saw the +STR torso mod and grabbed it, thinking, well, this will help my carry a little in the meantime right? Next visit to MODUS, Jet fucking Pack. RNGeezus can bite me. Terrible system and inexplicable when we're supposed to be crafting everything.
---
What's a blatant cheat? Is there hard evidence?
---
You're a real beacon maturity.
---
The word is "from" by the way.
---
Yeah Vanguard is also my favorite.  With enough pieces you basically have a second set of armor on at high health, and it rolls quite often on combat armor and metal pieces so you can do well with the base gear too.  I run all the non-PA armor boosting perks plus a Vanguard set and some of the mutations (grounded, scaly) and my DR/ER floats around 500.  You might be able to get it even higher if you use perks to repair it way past 100%, I haven't played with that much yet.
---
Cool, thanks. Just trying to get a idea of what the better legendaries trade for. 
---
Oh that’s really pretty!  Nice cottage appearance. I love it

The NDA is the largest organization of players in Fallout 76. 
---
Oh thank God u don't feel so alone anymore 
---
That's sort of what I go for, and I've enjoyed just how much protection that nets me, along with one of the armor perks.
---
As far as actual type of armor - others in the comments have mentioned Heavy Combat Armor, and they're not wrong - the resistances on that stuff is nuts. It'll show up in your inventory just as regular 'Combat Armor', but when you wear it, it'll look different, and it will have different DR stats.
---
I can't find the post, but earlier someone put up this spreadsheet with most of the stats for various armors with their different base mods:

(If someone has the post, please link it, I really tried to track it down again but I can't find it anywhere)
---
It's not an "inside scoop." It's called "Literally every online game produced in the past 25 years operates this way" combined with "years of experience in software development."   
---
They should hire me to fix it all though, that'd be rad. 
---
I was just guessing scorched based off of the regular enemies. Thanks for the help.
---
Exploiting is cheating. 
---
Nice! I gotta wait till Monday unfortunately 
---
You'll probably have better luck with posting on the r/fo76bazaar subreddit.
---
I **AM** kinda wondering about that. There's too much to fix at once (...not that this should be an excuse, if you think about it, but it's reality....), but if you're already in there changing the scrap recipes, why not change all of 'em?
---
This is awesome. Me and my buddies just set up our own boxing ring, and cage fighting ring. The cage has audience controlled flame traps to help get everyone into the action. 
---
We should collaborate! If you are interested Pm me and I'll pass you my PSN.
---
&gt;I don't get how people can be against deleting all the duped weapons
---
The only people against it are dupers
---
No, in fact there is no evidence that suggests that whatsoever.
---
Different strokes for different folks.  There should always be different alternatives for players who have no interest in PvP.  I solo'd the game up to this point and really enjoyed playing solo.  But it would be cool to have more viable options for the grind: nonevent mobs (Whitesprings + more), PvE events (Uranium fever + more), PvP events (Monster Mash + more). 
---
It's already non organic to an extent because people know to to go to certain places (Whitesprings and Nuke sites) so you know you're going to be bumping into other players at the places purposefully.  But I respect where you're coming from, being a Fallout game PvP shouldn't be the primary focus.
---
Good, I love my cave it's rent controlled
---
Harper's Ferry can definitely be nuked. I'm camped just north of there and on a couple of occasions have spawned into my game and almost immediately died from the rads.
---
Ok that's how you play others like to break the game and see how far it'll go I personally don't and won't but you can't stop these people unless you patch and removing weapons and punishing people that got that 000.1% TSE drop is a load of crap. honestly if they wanted balance in the first place why even have TSE be a thing? So you argue balance but they game never had it before duping.

I had a plasma rifle and laser musket in 4 that 1 shotted everything. I also had a nice laser gatling that was pretty solid. The way energies are in 76 is just atrocious.

I'm constantly being attacked by higher level players. I'm only level 16! It's annoying in all honesty. I'm just grinding out levels or quests and then here comes a level 78 or higher that decides "I'm going to use my Gatling gun on him.".... another one came and completely destroyed my base, which was across from the overseers camp and completely out of the way from anyone. Not sure why some people enjoy making others not want to play.
---
You need the bos under armor and either the mod/plan to make it treated, shielded whatever. You can't buy from vendor with the mods on it.
---
If you're on Xbox and gave me materials I could for you. Otherwise find someone who has it all or get the suit, buy plans/mods or learn them from the technical data quest
---
Save for a couple perks, you'd already have access to basically all the damage boosting and essential perks you need to achieve peak "overpowered God status" by level ~40 excepting a heavy build due to the Master tier card not unlocking until max level which delays your optimal build by a couple levels (oh no).
---
The only reason why you'd need one or two hundred levels to actually feel that much stronger even if you're not trying to optimize your card choices is if you're some sort of frickin' clown picking the same damn perk card for those hundred or so levels and actually need to rely on RNG to scrounge up the perks you actually need.
---
&gt;Sure, but if the "Db" is a modded save file used to work in multiplayer without any tools written to do mass searches/purges it isn't going to be viable or even possible to do. That is my point.
---
That's literally not how Fallout save files have ever been structured. Your point is literally abject nonsense.
---
Thanks, just found some armor on a white spring run so I was hoping if they would be cool. 
---
Wow that sucks :( - sorry to hear that. Did you try re-logging at least to see if your progress was fixed? I'm guessing you did. I've never gotten past this point because the option has never been present for me on the terminal. I keep getting my hopes up every time they do maintenance or release a new patch that maybe, just maybe... I'll get lucky and have the PO box lookup option. Nope! 
---
I've been thinking about raising a ticket with them but have had pllleeennnttyy of other things to keep me busy in game. Though I'd love to cross The Cold Case off my list eventually once they fix it so we can progress.
---
Just checking in, is it not a pile of shit yet?
---
Had rank 3 leveled, so only tested it with 
---
-rank 3 only
---
-dense only
---
-rank 3 and dense. 
---
Dense seems to be the most effective so far
---
I like that your definition of trolling is a negative impression of how badly you dismiss the work of people who are ostensibly in your own industry.
---
You take care now, you hear? I'm sure all your game launches were awesome and every player though you were the cat's ass.
---
That Luck increases your likelyness to find cool shit in boxes? It 100% does. It's been that way since at least FO3 if not earlier. Increase your Luck, you will find better stuff. 
---
Let's face it, this would all be moot if they would just give up on this shared mode PvP and just have people flag themselves for PvP or not and get shuffled to servers running appropriate rules.
---
Yeah, it's not like you can't find another suit.
---
Google the definition of both and tell if they are one in the same. 
---
This feels weirdly sinister. 
---
But thanks!
---
However, it's not a cool thing. It changes a fundamental part of the game. Salvaging what you need.
---
You are not being honest. You first tried to present it like you spent 3 hours looking for those, and when questioned on, the story was, you weren't really looking for those specifically. 
---
You weren't honest about junk extractors. You can say you exaggerated. But people exaggerate when they know they aren't right. And if you aren't right about something, then exaggerating is just a nice way of saying you weren't being honest. 
---
You don't have to play this game the same way I play the game. I'm not even close to saying that. 
---
But *YOU* seem to think that the game should change to the way you play the game, because you don't want to play the game as it's designed.  
---
There’s a house at the Whitesprings where I frequently see ginseng. But I’m only ever in there when someone Nukes. 
---
Also I’m pretty sure there’s ginseng at a workshop in the Mire. 
---
There is another power armor spawn on the roof directly north of Watoga Emergency Services. You can see the vertibird from the roof.
---
its not gone.. its just that someons took our spot on that server.. change servers and it will spawn
---
There's plenty of evidence recorded concerning duplication cheats yes. 
---
Look dude, if you don't understand the difference between a log, and a database entry, I don't know how to help you beyond pointing you towards google; but you don't belong in this conversation.
---
I have to agree with using the explosive perk. Removing that perk card would bother me a bit for PvE or PvP.
---
I totally agree.  Maybe next patch...  I personally don't give a damn about bugs.  I want a game I want to play and no amount of bug fixes will change this.
---
Pssst: Fallout 76 was written ground up to be a multiplayer game. 
---
I have access to the best one that adds 2 strength and 3 endurance but you need violet flux for it. Which I might have enough if you wanted to just donate some caps. But if you have materials I'll do it for free
---
So your solution is to do nothing? Stopping the exploit is a step in the right direction. Who knows, perhaps in a few months or even a year from now we will have a semblance of balance. That'll never happen though if we ignore the problems
---
Lets be fair here. This is NOT added content. This is fixing a rushed, broken, under developed game that, as much as I love it, was far from ready to release. Lets not heap praise on patches as if they are some new cool thing to do when they are in fact simply attempting to get the game closer to the state it should have been in BEFORE release. 
---
It’s a random spawn point it just has a much better chance to have ghouls. Like I have had scorched their before. 
---
Fallout has never used sql also as you're implying
---
Taco flavored kisses
---
Nice video. Seems like the default light is more than enough now. I wish they had let more of the spotlight effect. Kinda feels/looks like a pipboy light now.
---
Woot!  **Bobby Pins:** Reduced the weight value of Bobby Pins from 0.1 to 0.001!
---
A sound point. It's not so much about the hazmat suits themselves, but the lack of PA alternatives and they just removed one of the two last viable options, the last of which is extremely cumbersome and leaves non-pa miles behind anyone just putting on a PA.
---
And again, not writing anything in the patch notes is annoying.
---
I don't think even bgs would be stupid enough to save character information on the user's computer. 
---
Or silly enough to store such information in a file,  server side or not.
---
I think they don't restore items because that's their policy.  A choice.
---
Side debate: 
---
In &lt;insert any database here&gt;, what would be the process to restore a single record from a backup?  (Much less a single item contained in that record) 
---
I'm curious to hear your method.  If you can manage it without restoring an instance of an entire database, you could revolutionize database backup.
---
I'm sure database backup does happen if they are using a database.   But restoring from backup would likely only be done if something catastrophic happened.
---
It probably won’t be traded for caps if duping is actually fixed. Right now even with duping there is some items caps can’t buy 
---
I thought loot is basically guaranteed when you're in the event area, because it lumps you all in the same "event party".
---
You do miss out on XP if you don't tag the mob, though.
---
Nice catch!  I thought that was in the list.  I usually do High School, Crashed Vertibird, and then the straight to the one that you mentioned.
---
Git güüd
---
I’ve gotten this as well. The ghouls spawned later so there was a mix
---
His accounts only 3 days old and dedicated to spamming this crap could just be a troll. I've tried looking around to see if anything supports his claim but have found nothing so i wouldnt worry about it too much
---
Could be interesting, but way too low a material cost suggested.  It should be a backup way to top off stuff you need in a pinch. Steel is plentiful.  10 to 1 may make more sense, or 5 to 1 and requires an acid. 
---
Yeah in this scenario if you don't want to move your camp, just quit and rejoin another world
---
Ok I thought OP said there was a group of duper and a group of blatant cheaters. But he is talking about blatant dupers.
---
Kdubzz93 is me my dude!!
---
No it wasn't. 
---
No, even if you're in a party or team you'll still hear people that are talking in proximity chat unless you muted them.
---
Not when I do that, but I've crashed twice in 15 minutes. Once hard, which froze everything up while fighting the SBQ (1/4 health, of course) and the other time I was at my camp running along and it just dumped me to desktop right after I'd logged back in.
---
Hadn't crashed like that in weeks.
---
yeah i’m really not, it’s like seriously? here? right now? 
---
the clean looking stuff (like floors) are from atom shop.  claiming and defending workshops will give you neat and useful plans like chemistry bench, chemistry bench, and lest I forget - chemistry bench.
---
No disconnects in several hours of play so far today 
---
Score, thanks for that info, I’ve only traded with him in the armory. I’ll add you when I get home
---
I swing through WES just because there tends to be a legendary spawn and I might get something good.
---
Clicked link only for scorchbeast wieners.
---
It might be worth reading the whole message next time.
---
I know I fucking hate it when people do that
---
I've been working on acquiring dense mods for this reason over last week or two.
---
Inv'd
---
To be fair the terrible shotgun was stronger 
---
Duping is cheating. 
---
Same
---
They go into stored tab 
---
Explain to me how multiple people have had their character information just "Disappear" or load into another persons character? Some weird shit going on in the back and I highly doubt it is your typical sql.
---
Game crashed on invite 🙄🙄 send again?
---
&gt; **PvP**: Opening Player-owned, locked containers will now be considered a PVP action as expected.
---
This was always a pvp action, as it resulted in an instant bounty as soon as you solve the lock. So, what's the change? Does it show up in red now, or provide another warning, BEFORE you take the action? Because that was the actual issue: you could be out in worldspace, with NO indication on your screen *or map* that you were anywhere near a player-owned workshop or structure; open a locked item that appears to be part of the worldspace; and instant bounty, no warning beforehand.
---
Like what kinds of items? 
---
I can never find "unruly golfer" ghouls any time I'm there. 
---
I'm not sure if it works either. I've never seen an animation pop up. I'm not sure if it procs. I'll have to pay more attention. I know in the past people have said that it was bugged not working. Honestly with 20-plus agility, 15 +, and critical savvy I'm not even sure that I need it. but it would be nice to know if it's working or not so I can put something else in its place.
---
I know you can dismantle the blueprint which takes all of the structures and puts them into your storage
---
If you don't think that exploiting is cheating then just re-read my statement as: "I want people not to exploit and not to use items obtained by exploiting."
---
I mostly use melee too, but I have a few guns on hand for long range stuff, I’ll add you when I get home
---
Keep telling yourself that.
---
I hate the fucking assaultrons. So damn op.
---
YAY!!!!!!!
---
OK, so this is normal.  Would have been nice if support would have explained it like this, instead of the answers I got.  Thank you to everyone who answered.  I appreciate it.  Now I know.
---
How is it an even playing field if one person grinds for 200 hours nonstop and never gets the weapon, and someone else gets it on their first drop at level 35 from simply tagging a mob at Whitespring that the guy who spent 200 hours grinding killed? Then that person goes on to dominate every server and workshop just because they got lucky? Where is the even playing field in that situation?
---
&gt;Also you claim I am embarrassing myself, but you're assuming every game uses the same type of database system without any variation.
---
I never said any such thing. That's twice now that you've made up nonsense that I never said, trying to put words into my mouth. That's the sign of a lost argument. I'm done with you.
---
Takeaway: It's pointless to try to waste a griefer's ammo if they're capable of duping as much as they could ever possibly need.
---
I do like the part about getting them killed by their own explosions, though. I once did something similar without realizing it, walked up to someone who was slapping me with explosive rounds, and didn't quite put 2+2 together to realize why they abruptly stopped and backed off.
---
I got a two shot plasma off of a vendor, L35 though.
---
I also did find a two shot The Dragon, off of a vendor.
---
so I'm happy.
---
agreed but in these cases I have removed everything possible. the game will not allow me to remove anything else.  Its happened 3 times now on 3 camps.  IT always seems to center around stairs though.  In each case stairs + foundations are the items that are unremovable.  I am going to try different locations, all 3 locations were across rivers as I've been trying build a house with a rive running through it.
---
Okay awesome thank you!
---
Pretty great update! However, there are a few notable things that didn't get fixed, such as Marathoner not working in Power Armor, and the Gatling Plasma's terrible durability. Hopefully those get fixed fairly soon.
---
Also, I feel the Charging Barrel's buff was not enough. It now adds 14 base power up from 3; but it's nowhere as good as the +42 base from FO4. And no, Charging Barrels in DO4 were -not-  OP compared to the standards when you factored in the fire rate.
---
I am not suggesting doing nothing removing the dupe glitch and keeping it from  happening again in the future would be fantastic. less server crashes and more stable economy for trading and selling but as it stands there is no way to remove duped items without some way of punishing those unknowing spent hours of grinded caps on or the people the got said item cause how exactly do you distinguish a duper from a normal player? I mean I imagine there will be the blatant ones but on certain people you can't punishing all for a few bad apples is not the way to go that's more bad feedback from the community Bethesda doesn't need. 
---
shrug, I could be wrong
---
when I did it last night, I could definitely loot things I didn't tap, but I don't remember how many legendaries I got.
---
I heard something about crown enemies being treated differently?  I'll experiment tonite
---
Okay thanks you so much!
---
Being notified when this event is starting would be helpful for me too, but it still leaves the issue of I probably wouldn't be able to drop what I'm doing to get there in time most of the time.
---
Do doors fit in brick walls properly yet?
---
RNG is the same for everyone. 
---
Literally proof of them in the "making of video" stating EXACTLY this. And in the Noclip video. And in live presentations.   
---
Stop trying kid. Just drink the bleach and get it over with, you've got nothing left to live for.
---
Scorched can be legendaries but the rate they appear seems lower than ghouls or super mutants for some reason. I'll clear harpers ferry once a day and it's really rare to find a legendary scorched but most of the times I get at least one of the others when they spawn.
---
I love how a super mutant can snipe away at my rocket turrets out of there range, I built search lights and they didn’t help, then range on all base defences is way too low
---
Just make it so if the duper has more than x amount of some item that isn't junk it gets deleted.  Item cap so to speak.  Shrug 
---
Unruly Ghoulfers
---
Whats the point of playing then? It will take forever for someone to use up all those bobbleheads so he will always run around and be a superhero
---
You're kidding right?
---
Beth actually nailed a good chunk of some really problematic stuff and you seriously think that the community reps here had nothing to do with that?
---
Pass me some of what you're smoking...
---
I have had one disconnect and only one server not responding in about 3 hours of play, so it's getting better!
---
Good job on not only killing him but causing him to lose everything that was valuable junk wise for him; hopefully he quits the game completely after that.
---
Anybody else have a ridiculously high zoom on reflex sights with plasma guns? (not gatling)
---
bruh. For reals. I posted about this yesterday. 
---
Meanwhile, I let a shot slip during a Defend event, hit the player’s generator, and get a 10c bounty. Fast travel home, and two level 200s with TSE Miniguns mow me down and my entire base.
---
I guess that is true. And I have had my share of good and bad luck.
---
agreed, I did once involuntarily but free due to someone being close by, that led to my 2nd attempt ending in the same issue.  I determined it may be the locations I am at, I've tried 3 times now and each were across a river. All 3 times as I backtrack and rebuild I get stuck with the foundations and a staircase. I've been trying to build a house with a river running through it so it may just be bugged as I try to manipulate the interior foundations to keep walls up.
---
It’s probably not you. Once I got five buzz crashes in the span of 15 minutes 
---
Haha sweet we got the same idea! 
---
I agree I don't want that either then. 
---
"It's a trivial query to check who has obviously duped inventory counts. It's even more trivial to then bulk action on those accounts. "
---
bud you fucking said query. Holy shit. That is referencing a sql database you do know this right?
---
That's not accurate.
---
Patches often come out for PC first vs consoles because Sony and Microsoft require all patches to be validated through them first to ensure things don't go horribly wrong. They have a vested interest in games not appearing to break more often on their platform. 
---
PC on the other hand has no heavy handed overlord and can be patch immediately and as often as desired. 
---
So in reality, Bethesda did you a favor by releasing immediately when available rather than delaying your already prepared patch just to match releases with the consoles.
---
You should probably thank them.
---
No tantrums here, just useless attempts at education. 
---
Explaining that in a real situation, a "stash limit" makes no sense whatsoever.
---
Where were you last night? =p
---
I did not know about the assaultron head when I looted a legendary one last night. Thought I would give it a try and proceeded to lose 1300 ammo.
---
Hmm I was carrying around a gatling plasma for shits and giggles just in case my 50 cal broke and the cores are actaully cheap to make, but I guess it breaks way too quick?
---
Mind of Dev: Agreed! Let's make it cost 10 steel 20 springs 15 gears and 30 screws.
---
Erf. In FO4, the CRAFTED Fusion Gen had the visual of a core being there, but it was non-interactive: you couldn't take it out. So, I never bothered to try in 76.
---
99.9% chance I have been walking past a perfectly good charged up fusion core for three weeks now
---
Also the making of video literally states they had to MODIFY the engine and it also states they USED QUAKE NETCODE. That isn't ground up. Holy shit.
---
Even odds, some are just lucky. 
---
yeah very wide range like pipboy.  Not just brighter.
---
I know this sub down votes the fuck out of anyone who asks it but why in hell was this game allowed to release in November? Look at some of these patch notes, there are entire perks that weren't working, quests that weren't appearing, weapons not functioning, etc..
---
I'm glad you are fixing this game and not just abandoning it but this really hurts me as a fan and consumer of BGS games and has me TERRIFIED for the next TES.
---
I don't see why people are defending how shady this release was with the logic of "well they are fixing it &gt;now&lt;" when that is as if you were to go out to eat, order a steak, and have the waiter bring it out to you incrementally in tiny pieces over the course of three hours. You wouldn't defend that, you wouldn't stand for that so why bother to defend it?
---
No worries. Its one of the few persistent plans, so there’s no point purchasing it. Which I think a lot of people do.
---
I wouldnt be against that, it could be a huge investment as it would be very powerful
---
And storm two castles, rescue three princesses, right? ;-)
---
Oh my god you think "Query" is a proprietary term only to SQL?  
---
HAHAHHAHAHAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHHAHAHAAHHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHHaHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAAAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAAAAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHHaHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHHaHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHHaHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHHaHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHHaHAHAHAHAAHAHAHAAHHAHHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHAHAHH
---
I'm glad tbh maybe now I can use up these eight billion partial cores I have without having to remember to GTFO of my armor every time i log out - to say nothing of all the times I just got disconnected while in PA and magic recharge time!
---
Pretty smart
---
What you're failing to account for here, is that people are selling TSE / etc god tier weapons, for real money. as in 15$ - 25$. if you're spending half the price of the game on a gun, you're gonna argue 'till the cows come home that theres nothing wrong with it .
---
Presonally i'm waiting for the delicious salt that will come once bethesda sort this out, it will be \*glorious\*
---
No stash expansion? Guess I'm going to keep not playing.
---
As long as 60 is the new cap so I can level my special more.
---
Actually, a purity server sounds good (even though I know you were being sarcastic).
---
If anyone could organize a group of like minded players, I would totally join.  Keeping the server full would not be impossible, and would make it less likely for rando griefers to randomize in.  Until private servers are launched, that actually might work.
---
Mods do not require materials. They are an “all in one kit”. The materials could be grayed out but it will still always apply them.
---
In the sense you referenced it that implied a sql database. Preforming those google searches you talked about would show you that is typically the case. Holy shit you're a moron.
---
AHAHHAHA ... brilliant post! 
---
Amazingly, the nuclear apocalypse seems to have targeted Milling machines and Lathes only in this region, making them unusable.
---
Not a bad idea
---
Quit sharing them on reddit, it just promotes them getting more views
---
Ahhh greed. The root of all evil. I guess people will perform all sorts of mental gymnastics to protect their bottom line
---
I'M SORRY KID I CAN'T HEAR YOU OVER THE SOUND OF YOU THINKING "QUERY" IS A SQL-ONLY TERM.  
---
COULD YOU SPEAK UP?
---
I got beat up by a protest sign. Spent the whole time trying to read it, so I could get a rival one. LOL
---
I gotta wonder. Even if they bump up the level cap, a gun that can do damage in the thousands would still be pretty relevant, would it not? 
---
The issue is that the name of the item in the build menu is pretty much always different from the one on the plan, so trying to know what is what is impossible.
---
Oic, I never saw duping as cheating because it doesn't really effect me playing the game. I thought we were talking about blatant cheating like flying around or shooting an automatic mini nuke launcher or teleporting me under the map or something
---
You can JO your own way
---
Well this is good. Thanks for pointing that out, don't know how I missed it.
---
&gt;C.A.M.P./Workshops: Placing Power Armor workbenches on foundation will no longer cause them to place on the floor/ceiling above. Edit: There is a fix for this issue coming, but it was erroneously added to these notes. 
---
For the love of god, please tell me you will fix all of the other items that do this: decontamination arch, thru wall conduit, wall mounted cabinet (last one is slightly different). Pressure plate on second floor.
---
You do realize it is in the context you were referencing right? Lmao. You have no clue do you? You're just using terms and acting intelligent. 
---
I agree 100% if people are going to farm we should farm together. 
---
Dunno why I'm arguing with someone that doesn't know how decimals work, but I don't think OP mentioned anything about removing all weapons, just those that are duped (if at all possible)
---
Yeah had that about 3 times tonight, that's more than I've ever got.
---
And every developer makes games operate the same then. They should really heed your expert advice. 
---
Without birdbones you will often cripple yourself if you are not cautious
---
I see you've never had the urge to loot everything after a Whitespring's nuke. I regularly have over 1000 when I finish then clunk slowly towards the nearest bench to scrap.
---
Hello!
---
I’m lvl 18 also on pc. I haven’t been able to play as I’d hoped, but I’ll have some more now. 
---
I’ve also not been in a rush to lvl, there’s so much to explore!
---
I’m mountain time. I’ll prob play tomorrow since we are expecting a decent snow storm and I make my own schedule 😊 I’ll add you in game. 
---
I’ll be the Blonde you see. 
---
Have a great evening!
---
&gt;Fireproof: Fireproof now reduces explosion and flame attack damage by 15% per rank.My new favorite perk.
---
Agreed. In all the excitement about lever-action and legendary hunting and whatnot, this was overlooked by pretty much everyone. 45% damage reduction from explosions might actually let you survive all this duped TSE shotgun nonsense, when combined with other defenses.
---
Maybe.
---
Edit: I can confirm, Bright Headlamps are BRIGHT! Base headlamps are now close to what bright headlamps were, and the bright is almost blinding.
---
I have a Purple headlamp on my X-01. I just thought it looked cool. Now it actually lets me see stuff too!
---
Once the vaults and dlc areas are opened what new monsters and level bosses await us ???
---
I wish they could code it so anyone tagged as a duper would have all their weapon damage reduced to 1 (even new ones they pick up).  XD
---
Have you played fallout before, everything is tedious.
---
Wish I could make it! This is really awesome. Hope it goes well and keep it up. 
---
Completely understandable.
---
Watoga power station, junk resource generator, deathclaw and ants spawn for +carry weight food, lots of wood nearby if you are an architect
---
Thank you! Good to know 
---
been there, done that :(
---
What materials does it cost? Flux is difficult to get so ill have to farm some stuff first
---
No idea. I have 2 alts both filled with mostly weapons and other items I've traded in for plans (or w/ever else I had) plus a bunch of rare mats that I needed, meds, other plans I couldn't fit in my main. I know people that prefer to waddle around with 1-2k rather than dump items simply due to the state of mind this game puts you in.
---
That's a valid point. Unfortunately it seems like whenever YouTubers discuss cheating, duping and exploits ruining the game this guy's channel seems to always pop up on their search. It's unavoidable. 
---
1 hour
---
Yo! We killed one yesterday I think. I would be down but I need to craft ammo and stuff. Haven't played today because I don't want to grind it all out. GT is statesidellama if you need an extra body and it doesn't look like it's going to pan out. 
---
Put these machines at certain workshops to give more incentive for controlling them.
---
I'll do it from the quest thank you anyways
---
I literally provided you links to three of the most popular databases in use today, all of which respond to a "query".  
---
You -- not me -- were the one to reference SQL. I never said anything about it. You then doubled down on that THREE TIMES after I consistently told you that I wasn't referring to SQL, and had even MENTIONED two of the other DBs elsewhere in this post.   
---
Again, I've done this shit for a living. You're a teenage incel who is just spewing words you don't understand.  Feel free to keep making a fool out of yourself though, I'm screenshotting all of this and it's going to make a hilarious twitter thread about how you think SQL is the only queryable DB, and that Fallout 76 does not have any logging because of that. 
---
Legendary flare gun shoots mini nukes instead.... ok I actually want that
---
It wouldn't be a problem if I wasn't carrying an 8-pound rocket-assisted sledgehammer (which is bugged and should actually only be 2 pounds!), giant gatling energy beam weapon that weighs 9 pounds, and missiles that fit in my wallet - but I still have this 18-pound rifle because literally everything else in the game has a perk that nerfs weight except rifles.
---
SO yeah, it needs fixin'. And soon.

I got a normal dragon once, not legendary. I scraped it thinking i would get a mod. Now i have no dragons.
---
I've had protections and supermutants as well as eye bots. I think scorched would be fun just because the extra scrap. 
---
Class freak maxed will cancel 75% permanently 
---
Yeah but they can't run for more than 10 seconds
---
It also worked with one I had just a plan for, not the actual physical mod. My mistake on the other ones, though. Thank you!
---
Raising the level cap of items would require a rebalancing of the game though, as suddenly you'll have weapons doing even more damage in PvP and PvE than we already have, thus even more complaints about certain legendaries and whatnot.
---
Lvl 70 isn't low level
---
Penetrating Fatman
---
Except I never said either of those things. I never said SQL is the only query able DB. I said it is the most commonly used as it is the standardized language for relational database management systems. 
---
My friends helped our low level friend set up a ring of flamingos around his house. We called it the army if Mingos.
---
Very likely.
---
There are legendary melee weapons too! And melee folks want them!
---
Sure keep meaning to do that.
---
That would be fucking grand actually 
---
Same 
---
I do loot everything, note how I mentioned AFTER perks are applied.  Most of the 'super high weight' mules that dupers use are basicly 'brand new' characters from what people have said, meaning they wouldn't have any weight reduction perks, and if your looting enough to have over 600wg on your person at a given time, there's a bigger problem at hand.
---
He said "lower", man!
---
&gt;And every developer makes games operate the same then. They should really heed your expert advice.
---
DING DING DING WE HAVE A WINNER!  
---
Gosh, it's almost like every developer uses similar programming languages to make their games too! And that most use the same IDE to work in, use the same SDKs to extend, and use the same online silos to host! WOW! Maybe there are industry standards for a reason!
---
DOH thank you, I forgot where I'd read that and thought the Vendor issue was meant for this patch. OK, good. Let's hope what they really mean by "number of plans" is "that missing flag in Harper's Ferry that Reddit poster demonstrated in the CK a couple weeks ago that shows it's clearly a bug and not meant to be a level cap at all."
---
I don't know why I am arguing with someone that can't read the first line of text OP typed lmao. 
---
Plot twist, they are all female.
---
Not really. There are just duped TSE‘s. Akso much more ppl here :D 
---
Did you get what you came for?
---
Anyone over level 50 could be built as good as a level 170 if they plan their build and have a good weapon. So I wouldn't consider level 70 low level really. But yeah people will try to use tactics like that in games that have these types of pvp flagging rules.
---
Nice which region still fairly newer so doubt deathvlaws will be high on my hotlist 
---
is the irony of this post completely lost on you?
---
I have a similar build, but finally dropped dodgy: gangs shooting me with lousy automatic weapons drop my ap to zero, and then i cant run to hit the next mob.  So irritating to imagine letting them kite me!
---
&gt; if you only have fun in a game by being the biggest, strongest, baddest thing around
---
TSE minigun/LMG are the only usable versions of those weapons. Unless you find it fun to need 500 rounds or so of 5mm or .308 to deal with a single mob.
---
&gt; as your not just affecting yourself, but also affecting those around you with your actions.
---
I play solo and don't do events or nuke zones anymore besides the occasional SBQ, so how am I affecting others exactly? I don't PvP as I keep passive mode on, so really, who else am I affecting?
---
Are you loading it in the terminal that is in the back of Sugar Grove? The one protected by an Assaultron? I only ask because I remember the diamond for that quest kept pointing me to Enclave Bunker for some reason.
---
That sucks, the griefers are getting out of control.  The best thing to do is as soon as they start, just log out... Alt+F4 and wait a bit before moving to a new server.  
---
Still, it's not because of the lefties at Bethesda, it's just be ause you can look at the chamber animations this way. Plus, it might be explained by it being another quirk of the divergence lore-wise. 
---
&gt;Just saying. Also those are the most common management systems seen. My bad didn't realize you were referencing niche products.
---
LOL look at the incel who thinks MongoDB and Redis are "niche products"
---
Pretty clearly says "duped weapons"
---
Jeah we basicly need to balance the whole weapon categories a lot and make them feel different.
---
Pistols really need to have there own Playstyle!
---
What's about giving them bonuses to use them as hipfire versions of rifles. "Western style" so rifles could go for vats and crit builds and pistols for hipfire, some kind of "no scoping" rifles with a lot of gimmick.
---
Maybe perks like "free auto reload or fast reload" or extra damage on last bullet of magazine. (So you shall fire ur bullets fast into them) 
---
Or raising firerate for each fired bullet?
---
I see plenty options for them.
---
On the other hand side we shall find solutions to make semi automatic and automatic differently.
---
High level mob with an instigating, armor piercing and faster swing speed grognak's axe swinging at you. Fun...
---
Bethesda has said many times they have no tool to identify dupes or alter your inventory. 
---
Simple; make bobby pins sell for 0 caps. Problem solved!
---
LOL look at you who thinks they are more commonly used than IBDB2, MySQL, Microsoft SQL, etc.
---
I like that.  Using street signs is a brilliant way to repurpose old world relics into armor.  I actually like the juxtaposition of the wackyness and the serious post-apocalyptic stuff but I am always a fan of Max Rockatansky.
---
Yeah, that's the thing. Most of the systems that people complain about were put in place specifically to prevent a certain type of griefing. But players being the way they are, find ways to use those systems to grief. You come up with an idea to prevent that, sure, but it will be exploitable too. It's a lot tougher problem to solve than most players think.
---
Use combat knife 
---
I've heard rumors of Knob Gobblers, Toll Trolls, Oil Checkers, etc. All of what you would expect to exit a vault.
---
I realy hope at one point beth will do something with graphics bug with "brightness" of environment in certain times of day. This looks ugly as hell and spread all over the game, making it look like unrendered 3D model.
---
This is a logical choice for a lot of people, but raising the cap would require a serious rebalance of the entire game. These 55-60 weapons would be even more powerful than the legendary stuff we have at the moment, and then there'd be even more complaints from players.
---
I also think that wiping data/raising item level caps is punishing to all of the players who have worked hard for legitimate gear at this point.
---
That would mean he's assuming he wouldn't be one-shot himself...
---
Had that happen to me when I first started playing - sat down to play a banjo when I hear a big ruckus.  Thought somebody was firing at me or something - but I just happened to knock a can over during the animation
---
Rad.  How do they look?
---
Yeup, and they'll also try and LOS you when your firing at an enemy to initiate the pvp.  They also try to initiate a trade and use the double R3 glitch to see what you currently have.  That way they know if they can easily take you.
---
Right, like the Hunter/hunted (??) but in specified servers would be hella nice. I hope that’s implement better than the current version of pvp.
---
I have a huge selection of asylum hats including pink, but sadly I only found dirty white and weathered uniforms.
---
I was able to find them.  Thanks for pointing that out.  I got 14 that had condition and 14 without condition.  I'm pretty sure I only picked up 14.  I guess that's what the patch notes were referring to.
---
Is this confirmed? It just seemed odd that I could get a legendary eye bot lvl 1 that gave me a 3* item
---
Thank you for joining! 
---
I was curious if this was going to get fixed or not. I guess not :(
---
Paging BostonGeorge, that kook does nothing but troll lower levels with his cronies and enjoys destroying radiation showers peole grind to make. That guy is a grown man who's most likely unemployed and is a CREEP! Some people are so unsuccessful in their real lives that they get off on trolling innocent players just trying to have fun. Talk about a waste of time... We should make a list of trolls who should be blocked by normal gamers not trying to deal with crazy grown men with mental problems. 
---
Would you please explain what was won't with it, and what it does differently now it's patched. I don't have one, just nosy.

I was slightly disappointed 😢

- The problem is annoying as hell. Talking about the **prime receiver** of the **.50 cal machine gun**. If you want to revert back to the **standard receveir** you can't. It's impossible. Please fix this thing. I can't use my prime weapon more cause I have so much time to spend in the game in this period (university exams) so I can't handle ultracite ammo. I thought to revert back my receveir but I can't.
---
Does griefing happen on ps4 at all? Because I’ve never actually encountered it only time I’ve been killed was if I had a bounty and i only kill if they have one. Or have I just been really lucky?
---
&gt;What legendary armour might be key for surviving such an encounter because I am 100% willing to farm for such things
---
i will pm you
---
Making the switch back to lever action when I get home later and do the patch. I tried them out at first and while I was giddy with the damage over my combat rifle, (especially when the 2.5x sneak damaged popped more than once) the reloading five shots when I fired two got old really fast and went back to my combat rifle. 
---
Why? it's the real deal, unaltered, uncensored, raw, animalistic scorchbeast penis, straight from the game. What did you expect?
---
No I simply got tired of people only showing up when there's drama. They bring nothing.
---
Had this happen on Ps4 as well. Weirder still I got attacked by a scorched while repairing my weapon inside whitesprings, I couldn't figure out who was attacking me at first cuz he kept ducking behind the doorway. Not one robot tried to kill him, security at the whitesprings is lacking and someone needs to be fired. 
---
Wtf are you talking about???  Do you think I only played during the "beta"?  If you really think this game was released in a good condition, then thats your problem.  Just remember
---
\-It took over a month for them to fix the damage bug
---
\-It took 2 month to fix the duping glitches, making the economy completely fucked
---
\-Salvaged assaultron heads, gatling plasmas, gatling lasers are still buggy as shit 
---
\-There is NOTHING to do after you kill the queen
---
The games been out for 2 months and is 80% off in most retailers, the player count is in a fissure, and dipshits like you defend this piece of shit game because you had fun for an hour or two.
---
Well, they nerfed the spawn rate, so maybe we won't find them so easily anymore.
---
Yup, thats exactly how I got my bounty.  Guy who owned the base would not kill me because I think he assumed I'd seek revenge.
---
Non-PA build for nuke zones doesn't even have to require a hazmat suit.
---
It may be inconvenient for you but if it now works this way (ie: correctly) it's a welcomed bugfix.
---
what a guy
---
It also shows a diamond on the hackable locked door outside the building. Made the mistake of thinking that was the terminal to put the holotape in. 
---
I've always figured it was that way for the animationsand lore. If I recall right the original FO was the same, I know it wasn't in FP, but I think it had the left handed bolt animation as well, I could be wrong.
---
I was very happy with this update; it fixed a lot of issues. 
---
More girth.

Please Bethesda, remove all challenges from the game for me.

Well, I'm anticrosh, so heres hoping

Yee! August I don't got this one. Oh, check this out, Mr. Handy, Plum Crazy Purple, he wants 1400 Caps? What?! I used to have one of these, I'd give him 750 Caps, this guy is crazy.

You basically described humans. Bravo \* slow clap \*

Nah I'm pretty much playing daily. It's gentlemen like you, so high spoken and refined, which lack the brainpower to understand that if you don't like something you are just supposed to gtfo instead of camping down and ruining the party for everyone else.

You are unable to understand this game, it's okay, move on.

Never trade with randoms, they use the trade screen to see what gear you have and if you'd be a threat or not.

Make each stash box add like 500 weight, but make them costly in the C.A.M.P. budget

Just keep hoarding. It’s like a saving account that can be converted to caps.
---
You’re the kind of person that would be upset if they fixed everything because you wouldn’t get to complain. 
---
Does it disintegrate less fast than the regular Gatling?
---
Bottom line here, the same guys do this type of behavior. Block them all and eventually they will end up on a sever with only each other to mess with! Basically a pretend PVP troll server for idiots that like to cheat and wear god armor etc. Sounds like fun, NOT!!!
---
Yeah, the main quest is very badly designed and makes very little sense unless you do everything in the specific order the quest designer wants you to.  
---
You'd think Bethesda has this shit down after a couple of decades, but no.
---
I would have liked to see a matching helm, amongst other things.  Maybe if this DLC comes through, I can build one.
---
If you think people are using something as slow as Microsoft SQL for something like inventory logging in a game, I don't even know where to begin, other than LOL.  
---
Been there. I ran around Whitesprings yelling "Kill a man for 200 caps!" like a carnival barker. 
---
Tried to play today, server not found
---
Thank you! Is it on a rotation? I am in Whitespring quite a bit and this the first time I have seen this. Is it new or I’m just not observant?
---
Bethesda hates you?
---
....and then there are people like me who have never seen one of these proverbial two-shot explosive anythings, anywhere, isn't strong enough to even bother trying to farm nuked zones, pretty much keeps to themselves and doesn't get griefed,  who hasn't traded or grouped with anyone since the first day of B.E.T.A., buys things only from vendorbots, and otherwise doesn't interact with the "economy" at all, who sees no difference at all whether duped items exist or not. I'm betting there are more people like me than people this affects. Not being critical of either side, just pointing out duping may seem like a bigger problem than it really is. Also may be why B isn't in a huge hurry to remove dupes. The people who'd get hurt the most are people who are like me, but were lucky enough to get their hands on a good gun while being oblivious to its origins.   
---
(INB4: "but the servers!" I've been lucky and haven't had many issues with servers. I'm sure it's the same for others. I would guess that might be a bigger issue that the complaints make it seem. Most people having an okay time with something don't get on the internet to say "hey, everything's fine".)
---
Yeah, I heard stories about people who got challenged with sustained explosive fire run up to the challenger and have them kill themselves.
---
Yeah you really lost track of the entire discussion haven't you? I was listing off popular SQL based database tools. Not databases Bethesda might be using to store inventory information. You're a joke man. 
---
How'd you do?
---
Imagine paying real money to cheat your way out of like half of the end game. Then they’re gonna bitch and moan that there’s nothing to do lol. 
---
True, but I don't think Bethesda is going to give everyone what they want. And, they won't sacrifice the server stability for a 2k stash limit unless it's reasonable to do so. So I'm betting they will incrementally increase the limit as they see fit and as the servers can handle. 
---
What? That's a nonsense statement. The game is clearly designed to go above level 50, just like Fallout 4. They have just capped SPECIAL because in Fallout 4 everybody ended up as a living God.
---
Where? Source?
---

I've hung around for two days now. Too many higher level players. Ghouls are all twice my level. Green is littered with camps covered in rocket launchers. Average FPS is 15. 
---
I'm 8/10 on the ghouls and I'm completely sick to death of the place.
---
Same happed to me.  
---
The whole junkloss mechanic is another one of those untested ideas that doesnt work well.
---
And I am pretty sure stable flux is not actually junk.  Calling it that doesn’t make it so....
---
And to the guys who wonder why is he carrying his junk, please note that packrat does not apply to stash.  So, Ridiculously(!) it takes up 4 times as much stash space.  I had three ranks and actually got rid of it because it put me in these situations where I had a foolishly irresistable incentive to carry it.
---
I doubt Bethesda will make anything like this. But if you really want I know there’s mods on new Vegas that adds the Sierra helmet into the game since it was cut just before release. But the chances of seeing it appear in 76 is next to none, I’d rather see Bethesda come up with never before seen armour designs rather than reusing stuff we have already seen.
---
Not sure if
---
You are familiar with destiny but once all the players reached there peak new guns and levels where raised with dlc ect so that everyone started to grind once
---
More if puts everyone one back on par again and only dedicated fallout players will make it to the top it will make the lazy players
---
Pay full price with trading caps - will destroy a lot of the pay $25 dollars for this legendary 2 shot powder pistol sites and kill there market it will increase the prices
---
Of there cap purchasing packages to insane prices that  only truly lazy players would be happy to purchase and now they can. I longer just sell dupped gear to vendors to make theme selves more
---
Money 
---
I only get armor drops so I hope they do delete the items for the economy’s sake
---
This is a great fucking idea
---
Sure, but given most PvP is one shot now, being wanted means at any point, someone could turn up and one shot you.
---
The annoying bit is it seems to last a long time.  I've only been wanted once after accidentally hitting someones base while trying to help them, and for the next several hours, it was like walking on egg shells just waiting for someone to claim the bounty, and trying to make sure I didn't have any junk I minded losing the whole time.

The Cold Case "research the key" advancement bug still exists after today's patch, no mention of it in patch notes either. TL;DR The terminal in the Clarksburg Post Office DOES NOT display the 3rd option on the first (only) page which should be for PO Box lookup in order to "research" the key. The only 2 terminal options are First and Last name which don't do anything - it displays something about  the data being corrupt when you try to use First or Last name...

Three times since the patch I have dropped dead for no apparent reason. Not in combat and no mobs or players around. Running a low health nerd rage build. I have Rejuvenated rank 2, and losing Well Fed could possibly kill me, but I don't think it's that. The last time I died I had just eaten soup to take me to 100% food+drink.
---
Assuming they become more aggressive with their bans in any aspect that's going to happen in YTs cesspool regardless.
---
Fill their inventory with cheese and turn them into rad roaches. Or ban them or make them permantly stuck with a bounty on their head.

Anything like this i would consider justice served.

What is your alternative to a hazmat suit and non-PA that allows mutations and/or fist weapons?
---
Furthermore, as I mentioned in the original post, it's a change that makes sense, but it would have been nice for them to mention it in their patch notes. Once again they leave stuff out and you are left to wonder what else.
---
Lastly, It's not about convenience. The post never was. It's about viable alternatives that doesn't cost a ton of perks and removes benefits such as mutations. It leaves PA as the only viable option. It leaves no alternatives in a game that should, in my opinion, have them.

What about the players that had their organically dropped weapons disappear from their inventory who get upset enough over it to seek out and buy the weapon that went glitch missing. Those guys should tottaly be penalized! I hate to say it but this game is petty broken and if you haven't lost something yet do to a glitch you will eventually and it sucks! My friend lost a double shot dragon. I have had my power armor disappear. It took me weeks to get that conplete set, lucky for me someone dumped a set in front of me so I could replace it. Why are my water purifiers still glitching and only producing 5 bottles an hour and not the listed ammount etc.  
---
Right, there are scorched at the airport but the town itself is invested with ghouls.
---
No you weren't dumbass. Nobody else was talking about that. This was ALL in response to MY comment about the player's inventory being saved.  You're a terrible liar, considering that it's trivial to just go back to the OP and fucking check. 
---
I think suggestions that ask for a contradiction of a purposeful element of the game take away from better more doable request.
---
I wish you luck and have fun even though the game has a lot of problems.

---
And the next fallout game FO4 will be considered one of the best fallouts ever. Like come on can you not enjoy a game. Every game has had its bugs, but all have been fun. 
---
Scorchbeast are the only unique enemy in this game. I think they should just get a bit of a rework or something. So far every strategy I used to kill every enemy in this game is to just stand up on a high spot and dodge their ranged attacks. They do no effort to actually try and get to me, even when I’m up stairs.
---
Sounds like G4S have that security contract. 
---
I'm not really sure that will help much.
---
I've seen *lots* of folks mention that they're still using their lvl 15 explosive weapon because even as a lvl 100+ character, no other weapon comes close to doing as much damage.
---
It would certainly hurt those looking for the "best", but for most folks, a lvl 15 explosive shotgun is just as nice as a lvl 60 one would be.
---
How much effort does it take to do the same thing you did with hardened masses? No reason it couldn't be in this update.

I second this. Killed two of them so far. Neither dropped anything even worth the time

Hm. Maybe equip the perk to find cap stashes during your junk runs.
---
Its what i do. I just buy whatever ballistic they have and the extra junk I dont use I sell to them. Frees up stash space and balances out my caps so I dont lose anything since Im not using the junk I sell back to them. Still look out for the bags and mil duct tape though.

I love the idea of attaching it to a quest, especially adding more usefulness to something like late game Enclave (more than x01 and serums).  You make some very good points.
---
I like the little sound it makes when you pick them up or a box, satisfying.
---
Appreciate it! We killed the queen, and couldn't be happier there were no disconnects.

Crevasse Dam just south of it on the road there are random spawns. There's a Halloween costume plan you can find there that you can make for caps. This was something I was doing. Also not caps but XP you can make Cranberry Relish for 10% XP. I'm doing that now too. I grow Gourds on my farm. You can get 5 at Raleigh Clay's Bunker just south down that road, that you can plant at your farm and use Green Thumb to get 2 every harvest. You can make the sugar from Snaptail Reeds that grow along rivers. And also Cranberries grow at Aaronholt Homestead (10 plants total in the south field, 20 cranberries with Green Thumb). With Well rested bonus from sleeping +5%. Cranberry Relish +10%. And You can get Charisma perk for 15% that's pretty good XP boosting if you want to farm XP to level up some more.

Right?  Something to help differentiate a player from the rest of the transformers in the white spring nuke party.  Sure, the atom shop has the paint jobs but even a basic color palette in the p.a. station would be nice.  Something we can change quick and often but more importantly, that it's accessible with no extra hit to the player.  DLC it.

KH3 is coming to Xbox as well ;)
---
Buy a marine helm plan from someone and craft to sell to vendors every day for like 1300ish net caps with fast travel 
---
I am the same, being sarcastic.
---
Also I can burst the 5000 cap limit in trades, can set to 25000 now.  
---
&gt; it doesn't really effect me playing the game
---
it ruins the in-game economy of the game you're playing.  and even if you're not a trader it leads to a vast number of 1-shotting players in pvp and pve events.  so i'm not sure how it "doesn't really" affect you?
---
With the changes to Fireproof and not nerfing explosive affix, they are essentially pushing for Explosive to be the main affix everyone is supposed to use in end game or higher lvls.
---
Blame BGS, not players using the exponentially superior weapon type.
---
I used to like to be a bounty hunter. Always for low caps. But one day I got up to a guy with a 15 cap bounty and shot him and the second I did that his teammate came at me like a banshee with a hunting knife and wrecked me. So yea there is a lot of baiting going on. Needless to say I am no longer a bounty hunter as a 15 cap bounty ended up costing me 75 caps.

Fallout bobby pins are made of *dark matter* extracted from the brain of a Flatwoods Monster.
---
Thanks I'm going to need xp as well because it's starting to get hard at my level.
---
Why don't you change it to semi?
---
Doubt they delete them, they'll nerf the effects and release better weapons
---
I think y'all miss the point as to why springs and screws are sought after so much. There's always going to be a scarce resource. They don't need to make it less scarce, you need to figure out how to manage it. 
---
Too many of the suggestions I see posted here are how to make the game easier and the game does NOT need to be easier.
---
Ok will do
---
Jist bulk and sell junk. How do you NOT max out vendors? I can usually max half of them out just from water and random chems 
---
I know it was an old datamine, but has the fruit hat been released for a limited time at all yet? I really want that 👀
---
It's so unfortunate that it happens like this. The bug only affects each head the very first time you shoot it. But who would know this ahead of time unless they saw a post about it? Naturally, when you find something new, you pull it out and test fire it, maybe try it out on an enemy. Then when somebody sees that it eats up their 200-5000 fusion cells all at once, their natural instinct is to immediately scrap it. But that head is forever safe now. Then when somebody tells them that it gets fixed after the first time, the person tries it again next time they find a different head, thinking that's how it works, and there goes all your ammo again...
---
Tbh one day it randomly worked for a few minutes then never worked again. I didn’t change anything. 
---
It won't let me sell dirty or boiled water
---
I dunno, maybe. Would respeccing with a cool down of a week really give that much of an advantage though? I hate pay to win games, they are soulless. 
---
You carried 3,620 bobby pins???
---
Any weapon is good with the right legendaries and build. What are the legendary effects?
---
No I blame the player I always go in there with my found Tse gun to shoot the lesser miners but only go melee on the bosses so others can get a hit in
---
If you're accurate it will last you about 2 cores
---
I like that stash box 
---
I managed to break that habit, but now I always keep running out of resources.
---
You just can't win.
---
Throw the mirv launcher on it! It's way better lol
---
Delete.the shitty game
---
And farm low level super mutants. They don't drop many but there's always a lot of them and it adds up.
---
I love this game but I don't pretend its as good as it could be, that being said I'm starting to tired of all of these fronts page posts that are people repeating the same sentiment of not appreciating the hate the game gets, if you don't like people hating on the game that's fine you do you, idc abt it but idc if someone else does, that being said its honestly just repetitive and annoying at this point.    
---
Sidenote it's never a good idea to post an edit complaining about downvotes imo
---
Is that your ingame username?
---
I attack anyone whose name I dislike. Yours is one of those names. 
---
Also users of the "Cannibal" perk; it's pretty gross. 
---
This. I've enjoyed this game a lot a poured many hours into it. But goddam is it frustrating. Came home today and expected a refresh but after crashing three times when viewing pipboy and my excavator only carrying 245 i think I'll give this game a couple of months... 
---
I've killed ~300 and only about five dropped anything else...which I'm not sure why they dropped anything else. For example: killed the queen and got plans and such then killed another lvl80 scorchbeast and got another prime receiver plan.
---
Fun detected nerfs are making it harder and harder to go back. The whole, "but it's about the grind man, THE GRIND", I just don't get it. I know some people love it, but it's not for me. That and the holier than thou attitude people get defending the fun nerfs, "well obviously you weren't playing the game the way Bethesda wants you to play", it just gets fucking tired.  Once I finish off the achievements I'm probably done, unless they add some more end game content. 
---
Full set of assassin/sentinel gear with dense mod on chest piece. You’re not getting one shot. 
---
Heh. They're almost certainly gonna nerf explosive soon, too. So double helping of bitching incoming. The first time I see someone start ranting that the game is now unplayable 'cause they no longer do 90k a hit with their shotgun is gonna be hilarious. &gt;&lt; 
---
I just added you and sent a message
---
Will do thanks
---
What, why?
---
It’s 3 total points and you start with 1 point by default. That’s 2 levels of end. There is already a good enough reason to put a few points into it. You have things like life giver and rejuvenated.
---
Thanks mate.
---
My god my CAMP is gonna look so much better now! They're the only door I use really, thanks for the PSA!
---
the full 5 round reload animation used to be played regardless of the number of rounds missing, ie: fire one shot so you are at 4/5, reload and it puts 5 more rounds in to reload the single missing round.
---
Those numbers are roughly correct.  The defense goes up if you have the armor crafted/repaired beyond 100% durability.  So your armor has most likely just gone down in durability over time.
---
Pretty sure it's also energy because the gauss rifle is weakened by the grounded mutation
---
I think it is. I’ve heard lots of other people having different ones too. 
---
EVE Online doesn't use SQL for inventory tracking, it uses SQL for BI reporting. Try again.
---
all they need to fix now is the fire rate for certain mods for it
---
For fuck's sake why'd you say it like that? Sounds like Rick and Morty.
---
Basically the reload animation was broke and no matter how many bullets were currently loaded, you would load five bullets. So fire a single shot, still have four rounds left, reload and get stuck in a five round reload animation.
---
Ok nice but where is this Watoga?
---
 [/u/LoneVaultWanderer](https://www.reddit.com/u/LoneVaultWanderer)

...or the Charleston Landfill?
---
I also had this glitch. I left the building and re entered. Had to fight everything again, but was able to do it the second time. Also it might be worth noting that there are 2 different computers u can use. Both at the lower level of the main section one on the left and one on the right. If one doesn’t work, try the other.
---
I say this only when one realy annoying bug will brightness of 3D models will be fixed. Currently it is still live, and ruins the whole incredible work of artists and level designers. It's presented all over the game and looks horrible af, but, for some reason, still not adressed by devs. You 100% saw it, it feels like everything around is covered in white powder and shadows almost not visible.
---
When this horrible looking bug will be fixed, I will be able to finaly say developers care about their overall game state. Because it's hard to say that if game looks like this, lol
---
Damn dupers!!!! I'am i right yall? Hee haw.
---
That would be a great idea too.
---
I've seen a handful of mods for it, but they all ended up scrapped
---
Well good thing I don't care about people thinking I care too much, or downvotes.
---
windows 10 did some awesome up date a bit ago and messed the mic settings up. i had to play around with Cortana to get mine to work it was a hair pulling adventure.... good luck
---
You go on r/Fallout for the karma whoring, I go there for karma suicide sometimes and say things in defense of 76. But a lot of the stories you see here are new bloods thanking god tiers for boosting them in blast zones, when in reality most are probably just going on killing sprees and failed to see them
