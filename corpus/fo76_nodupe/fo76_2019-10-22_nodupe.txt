No way dude! Fighting back against the event busters was so fun. You aren't supposed to trust everyone you meet out here!

Mandatory second code breaks

I swear the fast reload for this comes and goes.  Like marsupial you’ll notice real fast when you lose it though!
---
Oh right. Well at least your comment was an answer instead of what thse others bark off.
---
I specified what platform. And scout armor which I'll edit in now. I'll go ahead and make the platform easier to see aswell.
---
And make it so they cant be broken down for scrip.
---
Trigger me timbers
---
I mean it's closer to $12 since they give you more than 100 atoms per dollar the more you buy but it still doesn't make much of a difference. That's more than Automatron cost.
---
This depends on what you are trying to build, but if you put down a concrete foundation with the top just above the water you can place what you want on top of it and then lower it so that it’s under the water.
---
I have just hear too many horror stories to trust someone online. I even have a friend I play with almost daily but I don’t like bothering them constantly with my switching and stuff.
---
TROLLED!

---
Haha, that's pretty funny. I'd be peeved a little, but I'd see the humor in it. Maybe he was just pretending to be a noob. Either way, good on your for being a good member of the community.
---
Incidentally, I've only launched three nukes, including my first about a week ago. I wish I knew about the steamer trunk.
---
I'll have to try that. Thanks!
---
That's understandable bro r/PKOA might be a good place for you as we are there to help.and.if any issues arise we let our Elders know and they add the name to a Red Watch I recommend it bro very, very helpful people :)
---
I wouldn’t want to play games on that terminal. Far more zoomed out than the desk terminals (would much rather they’d implemented one of those instead. Also looks better and gives desks some utility.)
---
Lol of all the random encounters...a plethora of meat cleavers at your doorstep 😂
---
I just picked up a legendary scout armor left leg, but I can’t remember if I can’t remember if I exchanged it or not since I’m at work. I’ll check back on here when I’m get home and let you know
---
If this is something that upsets you enough to post about it on reddit, then you probably shouldn't play anymore... far worse things can happen, be thankful they didn't leave derogatory signs up instead. Scrap and move on. Sorry to sound like a bitch, but you're over reacting over something completely harmless.
---
Thank you.
---
Imagine the water goes all the way up to the sky. You can place foundations and maybe a fence or two but otherwise no, you cannot place anything else in water, even on a foundation. I tried and tried with my second waterfall house and wasn’t able to achieve anything more than a bridge.
---
I can mod it too, prime it.
---
I know just about every laser/ Ultracite laser mod. Took the time to learn them while kitting out my two AA, +10%dmg while aiming laser rifles.
---
Always happy to mod out someone's lasers

---
Concrete specifically? I never tried that material.
---
That’s what it seems like.....the water goes all the way up past where I can build. I am two stories above the water and I can’t place one wall because it’s over the river or creek....But it has no problem letting me place a water purifier that’s only 1, maybe 2% in my build radius
---
Plain and simple, Bethesda has not made it pay to win. People selling and idiots paying actual money for in game weapons and armor have made it pay to win. Nothing in the atom shop has been released that would improve the play style of anyone. As for private servers, that is still to be seen.
---
Yes 10% is good on a sniper.
---
Overseer's cache, Morgantown Airport - small backpack plan = + 30 carry weight
---
 I’m not even in the water I’m trying to build two stories above the water
---
My interpretation is : more fun and engaging for me means less tedium so less grinding. More impactful for me means they will give more atoms each. So less missions and more atoms each = same number of atoms in the end. Let's be patient and see what it really means for THEM.
---
Where are other possible spawns besides the shooting range and one in crafton? The roaches at the range where always already killed by the ghouls whenever I got there, so annoying
---
Thank god there is someone who understands what question. Thanks for your answer :)
---
In Nuclear winter any damage from any source except the storm stops healing instantly.   Also melee is a single instant hit. It's literally impossible to over time heal something that does max health oneshot in an instant.
---
10-15k you only get them from the encrypted event
---
You don't need to complete all the Enclave quests to get access to the vendor that sells the Scout Armor, it's in the manufacturing wing, I believe. I dont think it will have all 5 pieces at once though so it might take some server hopping. To buy mods you'll need access to the Generals' area, but those are available all the time now. If you dont want to do the quests, I'd suggest offering to pay a decent amount of caps for someone's time/trouble in getting them for you because I doubt anyone will have a full set of non legendary scout armor just sitting around.
---
It was discounted for me last night
---
Yea, super frustrating. I ended up giving up on that build, even though it was a great spot.
---
In the last Inside the Vault post they made a deliberately vague statement that alluded to adding more utility items to the Atomic Shop. 
---
That’s not a good thing, and the way they handled it was even worse, but as of now nothing has changed. It’s a bit early to make any definitive statements, so for now it’s just doomsayers doing their thing for clicks—something is going to change, we just don’t know when or what those changes will look like.
---
Alright cool! I most likely will not be on tonight but I'll hop on after work tomorrow for a couple of hours
---
Oh right i see. Dont worry i didnt click on anything. Just heard it of my brother lol.
---
Hell, you probably know where I’m talking about. Southeast-ish of Pleasant Valley station By the flower on the map. River kind of breaks up into two or three separate little channels. Oh well time to move on I guess. Keeps it interesting
---
I got this one .. Cause sometimes you can't delete it without tearing down a vital piece of your camp. Dudes on my team think it's funny to hide radios all over the damn place. Put em too close to my foundation and the instant it's placed the game decides you can't grab it. My builds aren't cookie cutter. Taking down one wall means I'm gonna be spending the next hour replacing an entire roof and power system and MAYBE I can grab the damn radio.
---
I haven't even done the enclave missions lol. I guess I'll just do em again.
---
Stay gold Pony Boy... Stay gold!  This story cracked me up BTW 😂
---
I really wouldn't bother mate, this game is a wasteland.
---
The way Bethesda frames all their statements are so vague they always allow wiggle room for them to squirm out of any backlash. It’s not a Beta, it’s a B.E.T.A. We said cosmetics only...for now.
---
It’ll be a subtle change, some rewards go up, some rewards go down. But the bet outcome will be down. Just like a casino with a 51/49 odds split. It seems fair at first glance, but THE HOUSE ALWAYS WINS.
---
Yup, in the air
---
I understand it as a way of preventing early gameplay from getting messed up.  But it's so aids when you are level 300 and you get a level 5 roll that's otherwise perfect.  Why would a level 5 weapon break so fast and do less damage?  It shouldn't.  Level requirements should only be bars to entry.  You can't find an M2 lower than level 25, and that's good.  Levels could even be raised for things like The Fixer.  It wouldn't do more damage than it already does, but it would make sense for it to be only available for use after level 70.  Seriously, the whole scaling damage with weapon level thing is so BS.  Enemies don't even always drop the weapon they were using, so we can forget saying that it's for game balance purposes.
---
Thats actually happened to me a couple of times lol. You just laugh it off and keep it pushing.
---
Why bother now?
---
I just started up again for the first time since near launch and I've made it level 27 so i chuckled when I see low level followed by 60
---
It hasn't
---
Just copy Minecraft and make records as rare drops to play in jukeboxes. I get so tired of that infernal tootling that I shut off other peoples' jukeboxes when I visit their camps.
---
Almost $2,500 a month off Patreon alone, to say nothing of YouTube's ad revenue.
---
Clickbait sells, man.
---
&gt;The more they add, the fewer items you'll be able to have without buying atoms
---
This is so very true. Stuff had been added to the shop at a snails pace.
---
The really sad part is even though utility items are selling well if they add BOS or Enclave bundles like they did for the free states they'll make a killing.
---
What would be the point in farming legendaries and gathering scrip if I could potentially buy a god roll from a vendor for a few thousand caps? That would ruin what endgame we do have.
---
Dammit i watch his vids cause my damn autoplay on xbox.
---
**Outrage** ought to be a legendary attribute on weapons

*3\* Bloodied Explosive Outrageous Handmade*
---
Omg I can't believe they did that! Funny, but also not cool. I myself am only level 55 and a newbie to the franchise but I dream of launching a nuke someday and love how high level players help others out, it is what drew me to the game.
---
 I will never forget being a lowly level 19 and a level 235 player saved me from a sticky situation and then joined in a team with me and typed "I can come with you to explore wherever you want, I will be your medic" as I also don't use a mic (classic). The whole experience was so fun and uplifting as I just got to cruise around and felt immortal... made me fall in love with the game!
---
I ROFL'd but I'd be happy to comp you a nuke card and whatever else I've got that you might want to need, just for helping the little shitstain :D
---
Thanks, and keep doing good.

Right ... because if you make a  Reddit post then you must be terribly upset .... or something....
---
Best story I've read on here in a while, kudos!
---
From one introvert to another, keep on keeping on my brother
---
Theres nothing that you can buy from the atom shop that gives you an edge over other players. We got a fridge and a robot that collects random junk very slowly.  Oh and the scrap &amp; repair kits that are more for convenience than anything else.
---
To top it off...you can earn atoms thru challenges so nothing is truly locked away behind a pay wall.
---
Maybe related - hazmat suit plan on xbox does not give the option to craft suits. Bugged.

I've bought 3 sets of skins all from what I've earned in game. I've yet to see anything of pay real money for, but those that do keep the game running.
---
Some people do and it’s actually sad :/ I’m all for buying stuff especially if you enjoy the game but not $20 for ONE thing. 
---
Hell gears pop is doing it but you get 3 exclusive skins and a TON of in game characters $20 MOBILE GAME is beating a $60 TRIPLE A GAME not to mention it sounds like we have to pay for private servers as well -_-
---
There’s no way in hell we’re getting *more* atoms; unless atom shop prices rise to compensate, and they’re already comically high. It’s Betheda’s early game generosity with atoms that has put them between the rock and hard place they are now (reduce prices of shop items and lose some revenue as early game players are able to buy more for free, or choke the supply of atoms and risk pissing off the fan base.) Given a choice between those two options, from what we’ve demonstrably seen over the past year, they will always choose the one least likely to effect their bottom line. 
---
The latest ITV regarding more utility items in the atom store should be taken as a sign of intent going forward. A lot of people bought the fridge and collection, but the problem was many of them did so with free atoms. Solution? More utility items along those lines, as they’re proven sellers, while you methodically choke off the supply of future free atoms. It happened a while back with daily and weekly challenges. Weeklies became a little more generous, while dailies became less so. Shrewd bit of psychology, as you see the bigger weekly payouts and like that but with dailies reduced they’ve taken away more than they’ve given. 
---
So, considering all that, here’s my read: ‘Reworking parts of the challenge and reward system to be clearer (meaningless. Lack of clarity is not a problem atm), more fun (more enjoyable challenges over the tedious or obscure ones), and more impactful (this is the pivotal bit. It means more of them offering in-game rewards over virtual currency, as that’s more ‘impactful’ on your experience.)’ The sad part is I actually think offering in-game rewards over virtual currency is how it should’ve been in the first place, and might’ve led to a better atom store experience for all, but to move to it at this stage would feel like a bait and switch.
---
I have not, and do not plan to spend real money for atoms. When a skin costs as much as a DLC has then there is a serious problem, and I'm not going to give them any fuel to pull more bullshit.
---
Who hurt you?
---
I came here and got something wholesome and funny at the same time. You take the time out to help someone only to find out they pulled a fast one on you.
---
I went from :D to D:
---
They should've just given us an ability to play offline, with console commands and mods.
---
Yes, they do.
---
I've never actually bought a Power Armor skin though because I personally think it's the one thing that has been consistently, grossly overpriced since launch.  And it's not like I use PA much anyway, let alone have multiple suits of it for multiple skins.
---
I bought a buzz cut because my hair was falling out don't ya know, only thing I've purchased from the Atom store, other than free icons.
---
just under 4k Atoms and can't be bothered to buy anything.
---
You gotta do all the dailies. For me, each one is between 400-900 ish xp and I think it's only 13000 xp to the next level. 60-99 shouldnt be too hard just have to run west Tek the DMV place etc. I think the xp is alot less for when you're under 99 to level up
---
On PC, I do scrip mainly now. I might get into nw rank that up sometime.
---
It's driving me insane...
---
Because the odds of having it be an actual god roll are just as infinitesimally small?
---
I actually like the idea.  You know, before we had Murmrgh and the Legendary grinder, it used to be a treat to visit Watoga Station or Whitesprings, just to see what Legendaries other players had sold off.  Sometimes you'd get lucky.  That never happens anymore, short of that bug where you find the surprise unprocessed Legendary in the grinder.  In fact, I almost never buy anything from the robot vendors anymore because they don't sell anything I want.
---
I keep having a problem of the notifications in the top left not appearing sometimes for anything.  Like I'll start playing then after a bit they will just stop appearing until I quit and play again.  This means I don't know what a player bought from my vendor like a third of the time.
---
Probably best bet, or get a friend to go in and buy them for you
---
I also play on PC, my tag is HappySlapp, but I can't remember if you have to capitalize, so it might just be happyslapp, maybe we could play sometime.
---
Ok cool thx we can play sometime tomorrow

Cool you on rn

You're right, it's exact numbers. What are they doing!
---
No friends. Sooo gotta go the long way.
---
It was me sorry, I did apologise and I gave them a juice box... Would you like one to?
---
Can’t wait till they fix it. People glitching with nuke mines killing low levels on passive mode.  I want to give out level 1 hazzes and protect all my mules too.
---
Toilets. Toilets everywhere!!!
---
You could probably use wood, but concrete seems to be overall more agreeable in terms of what it will allow you to get away with.
---
If you need concrete there is usually a bunch of bags behind R&amp;G processing (Site Charlie) in the fenced in area.
---
Should probably be asking yourself that question if you think someone is a dick just for putting harmless stuff in your camp.
---
It will probably be reset next time you log in.
---
I've had the same line in my custom ini file for a while, that one seems to stick.
---
Collect magazines, get all 96 &amp; then sell them, farm dresses, try to learn all radium rifle plans, do possum quests.
---
Move camps a lot :)
---
I normally pick one for a day &amp; do something else the next day
---
i don't. i log in to check out new content when it's there. when i'm really bored i'll log in and remodel my camp. i check this channel every couple days to see if i'm missing anything... and typically, it's no. i'm not.
---
Instigating is great on things like Axes and Hammers, especially with the +40% power attack damage as the second star.
---
Slay bells skin was 9 dollars I didn't pay cash but accidentally got it by double tapping x have hated myself ever since
---
Near 800 hours across PC and PS4, find myself more frequently alt-tabbing out to hit up reddit as well.
---
Get my scrip and bumblef around a bit, boredom sets in. If I do play for more than that I'm just hunting legendaries out of habit and go buy a plan or two to keep me away from max caps.
---
"Honeymoon" phase is pretty well over &amp; done I think.
---
I love the game but... you know
---
I think that’s an excellent idea. I’d still like sheet music, because it’d be a fun way to “show off” at other camps and even coordinate role playing bands. But the records would be a ton of fun too!
---
Ya know, that hadn’t even crossed my mind. After getting jumped a few times I was in the mindset of “oh shit, here we go again”.
---
I feel like every player and their mother would love to see the riot armor from NV to return.  Give some reasoning that WV got some shipments of it do deal with strikes.  That'd be believable.  Then change it to fit the setting more by taking the desert duster and cutting the length down to make it more like a jacket.  Only problem is it'd likely cost 10 fucking dollars or close to.  They really need to give more atoms when purchasing with money because the prices are just ridiculous.
---
I edited it in when he replied
---
That's the magic of a confusopoly. Obfuscate the price behind a buffer currency so it doesn't seem like that's what people are *actually* paying.
---
doing dailies &amp; weeklies and supply runs to make ammo.
---
do sbq when someone drops a nuke.
---
sort my inventory.
---
Wood didn’t work, I tried. I’m over building it, I was just curious, but thanks!
---
even these days, still check the scrip machines- I recently found an I SS sledgehammer in one
---
Interesting question...if you get all the "P2W" (/s) items for earned atoms and just buy skins, is it still P2W?  That thought just occurred to me, I don't have an answer really.
---
I feel you bro
---
If they are randomly generated, the chance of getting a "god roll" is slim, but you may find cheap scrip or a decent weapon for a fair price
---
It's remarkable what some players will just throw away!
---
Almost any Instigating melee weapon is basically a "win the game button" against everything except Scorchbeasts.
---
Do players seem to like the armor that gives a chance for damage resist when standing still or against players?  Those used to be OP.  Had a player once buy a couple pieces from me and ask if I had any more.  I figured they'd be sought after still but I don't know on what level.
---
Start an Alt and level them up specifically to make use of that gun. I am doing that now for a trio of awesome legendary fixers I got with the purveyor sale.
---
Exactly, same here
---
I found 6 of em stranded in the toxic vally lol very funny
---
And people wonder why players are buying god tier gear off Ebay and gameflip for 15 bucks.
---
When it comes to a release time it's very difficult to find a place where a game would not be competing with other releases. Yes, next year they'll have to compete with Cyberpunk 2077. But if they kept to the schedule they would be coming out shortly after Outer Worlds. Which arguably would be even harder. Obsidian has leaned pretty hard into the 'Developers of Fallout New Vegas and spiritual successor to that game'. So a Venn diagram of the fans between it and Fallout is practically a single circle. How many people would be pulling away from that game to play Wastelanders would largely depend on the quality of the final products... and Bethesda, the ones who were okay releasing 76 as it was, felt the quality wasn't good enough. I'm sure they are well aware that if Wastelanders doesn't blow people away, nobody will give them a third chance.
---
You are right that the holiday season at the end of the year is a big game buying time. However, I think that would have worked against Bethesda and not for it if they had stuck to releasing next month. There are so many games out at this time period it would be very easy to be swept under the rug. Especially when you consider it is a free expansion. They will probably promote for and get some people buying 76 new but the majority of people would be coming from returning players. Returning players who may have bought one or more new games they also want to play... The draw is strong to play what you just bought rather than go back to an older game you dropped for a while.
---
In all, I think the November release was probably a mistake for them, and pushing it back to Q1 will help more than it hurts.
---
I know I'll be going back to lurk mode in the game once the Halloween event is over and I pick up Outer Worlds...
---
For me the reason I love the game is because its pretty much what you make it 
---
I was lucky and played it with a friend in the beginning, and from the start we explored, didnt really pay attention to the story tbh only played it here and there,which is why I find it strange that people end up in super high level areas when theyre only level 20. Like there are 100s locations to check out in the starting area alone, if you only go for the main story I think it makes sense that the curve should be steep, youre supposed to explore, do events, scrap items and learn mods, earn caps, scavenge armor, weapons, items, all while you level up
---
And of course, fix up your camp
---
Ive played this game almost since the start and a thing I like about the game is how you can go the exact same path everyday and its always gonna be a little different, because of random encounters, change in enemy types e.g: you can go on a path and one day you meet 5 ghouls
---
Next day, same path, there is now 8 super mutants fighting a scorched beast 
---
And on a side note, yeah I play alot with my friend which makes things easier and funnier, but I think most of my play time today is solo play, just by walking around, joining events with random players (i dont talk to strangers, but emote etc) that alone can be fun and just a nice experience
---
There is a grind to the game, going for legendaries etc, but for me that has always been more of the boring side to the game
---
Why aren't you in a clown suit? Ha ha!
---
I don't really trust of vault 96 situation but i still collect antimirelurk armor parts. Yeah I move the camp a lot too
---
&gt;  I don't think I've seen a single 76 player asking for or talking about private servers in the context of 'I want to do anything with no restrictions!'
---
Maybe not current players, but certainly prospective players.  I'm not playing until I can do exactly that. Private servers that I can mod, unrestricted, are pretty much my primary prerequisite for buying FO76, so I'm interested to see how they're handled - this is the only title in the entire franchise that I haven't yet played, so it'd be nice if they make changes that solve my problems with it.
---
Why do people like that outfit?
---
Mostly I use them to restock my vending machines with plans. Occasionally I have gotten power armor plans (Raider Helmet, T-51 Torso, T-45 Right Arm)
---
I play with a player faction on Xbox. Not enough time now! Haha
---
Why would I need to do that? Shouldn't I just be able to download it?
---
Reduce the fucking prices.  I remember seeing a hunting rifle skin that was limited time for 700 atoms.  If I bought 1100 atoms for $10 then that 700 atoms would be $6.36.  That's fucking stupid.  If it was half that then it'd be more reasonable.  But that's a real fucking problem that the price is twice what it should be.  Fucking twice.  I don't spend any money on atoms because I'd be getting ripped off if I did.  If they ever did reduce the prices then I might actually spend some money.  As it stands, I'm not about to spend about $12 for a power armor skin.
---
i think the skins are corny. i don't get why the aesthetic is so cheesy anymore. i rock the blackbird pa skin that i've had forever. but yeah... kids rob mums cc and waste money on this shit.... which in turn makes bethesda salivate and thus drives further monetization. and bethesda fanboys applaud it all because they think beth should be making billions off this clunky glitchy game cobbled together from mostly decade old assets. (still a fallout fan btw)
---
The only good stuff I got was
---
Quad, +33% V.A.T.S hit chance, 25% less AP cost Radium rifle.
---
Bloodied, explosive handmade.
---
Bloodied, explosive pipe Revolver.
---
Everything else was crap
---
I haven't seen enemies using sentry bot animations but I have seen a whole lot of them exploding like they are.  The first time it happened I was stunned and had a real good laugh.  Then it kept happening.  It's really fucking stupid to loot a super mutant then have him explode under you and cripple and nearly kill you.
---
Set read only attribute, mine hasn't been messed with for ages. Maybe after they launched NW it got tweaked, undid the read only even if I remember correctly.
---
Honestly man I’m not sure. I finished my second playthrough about a week ago and I just keep coming back. I spend a lot of my time trying to find nice legendaries to pawn off and keeping my camp/diner (pay for rad-free food &amp; drink, take a seat w a view) stocked. Otherwise I’m typically lost exploring the forest or the mire. Think it’s the beauty of the game.
---
I have noticed the increased friending this past week. It's always a higher level player and they always wait until initial wave attack and shoot from behind. I just left the game after the same player followed me to two different workshops and killed me at each one.
---
Between that and the disconnects, the game is becoming less enjoyable. But oh well, let the morons have their fun. The Outer World's will be coming out soon...
---
Honestly.. most of my time is spent building my camp... getting bored of it, then moving and rebuilding elsewhere.. then i spend time shopping at peoples vendors.. server hopping and shopping again. occasionally might do an event that pops up.. I really need to push myself to do that rose the raider quest line so i can get rid of her annoying speech everytime i get in game..same with the mayor. I just really love camp building and getting peoples opinion on my builds haha. I hope the build budget gets expanded eventually, or on private servers.. i also sit there being annoyed at how much of your budget gets used by display items ugh..
---
If you're on XB1, I've got a spare.
---
In VATS you have a crit meter than fills up and you can push a button after it fills up to force a critical hit. With the right talents in luck, you can crit every few shots. That legendary effect increases the VATS critical damage by an extra 50%.
---
But the potential is still there, same as it is with RNG on drops and from the purveyor.
---
People sold those items to vendors because there was no other outlet for them. We have player vendors now.
---
PSA: this is exactly what it's like having children.
---
Just... letting you all know. Anyway carry on and remember that.
---
There’s one in the bathroom at Hemlock Holes, three at the power pylons near the HH workshop, the shooting range, three at Pricketts Fort, three at Philippi, and three at the Col Kelley Monument. It’s also possible to have some spawn at Kiddie Korner and in the irradiated area south of HH, with a Grafton monster.  There’s a couple others in unmarked locations, but those are hard to describe.
---
Currently, for a new player the game is a pretty good investment and you’ll get your times worth with the little amount of money you’ll have to put down. The people complaining are the people like myself and others who have been playing since launch with little new content. A new player will still have plenty to do by the time Wastelanders actually comes out, so honestly I’d recommend either picking it up now and seeing if you enjoy it or maybe wait till the big Wastelanders update to decide.
---
I have 61 that I have earned in-game and never used 1.

One of these days, I'll launch my first nuke. Tried it once, and found out that 50 stimpaks isn't enough to grind this feat.
---
[removed]
---
i've noticed this with anything fallout related. some folks very identity is so caught up in this game that any criticism feels like a personal insult to them.
---
Workshops are potential PvP grounds. The sooner you accept that, the better.
---
The utility of a workshop comes with the risk of PvP. And those 250’s were low levels at one point.
---
Artificial scarcity is probably a factor since its been out of the atom shop for a while.
---
I know I kinda regret not getting it despite having all the opportunities since last November lol.
---
Thank god, I thought this was going to be another post about someone taking the ammo factory, that sucks though if I see a super high level swooping on my workshop I dip out
---
Comment.
---
Everyone knows PvP in adventure is a load of crap. It’s which ever melee account gets first hit. Go ply nuclear winter if you want PvP
---
And?
---
Three pps, damn radiation
---
And what? You accepted the risk when you claimed the workshop.
---
Thing is, I don't want to. I like to PvP in the regular modes. Now that Survival is gone, Workshops are my go to.
---
Coming to an ATOM shop near you, December 2019 - 700 Atoms.
---
OMFFFG! I had the voices audio all the way down this whole time!!! XDD 
---
I remember turning it down becuz the damn robot at the train station would not shut up while I was trying to decide what to sell. Ughh thanks tho. I can’t believe I couldn’t figure this out for a whole 5 months! Lol
---
I had the same issue. You should try a new character, with a new build.
---
That’ll make an awesome loading screen. I got a sweet one of a player smashing a honey beast with a super sledge and it looks great since it’s a glowing HB
---
I do all the time with my atoms. Never buy anything else really.
---
But it’s like not even PvP it’s just sneaking up on people and one hitting them. That’s the flaw in this games idea of PvP 😂. There’s no skill involved so it’s mind boggling when people use that as an excuse.
---
Lol seriously? Hahah
---
That was the same with me at the beginning. I then realized I was holding to a lot more than was needed, especially chems. I either transferred some to my alts or just became more liberal with their use.
---
Whoa i am high level and i dont not do anything like that.  Dont lump anyone over 200 in to being evil.
---
It should be straight halloween up in the atom shop. Costumes, face paint, orange jack’o lantern head and matching paint for PA, etc. let’s get spooky Bethesda
---
It is what it is, son. Accept it and move on.
---
What if bush was never elected?
---
I’m convinced y’all are bored asf because you were done with the game probably 500 hours ago but don’t wanna make a new account.
---
I like this, being able to run the server however I'd like at the cost of character transfers. Especially since I'm paying for it. Maybe Nuclear Winter build rules as an option, let me build in places we can't build in regular worlds.
---
That said, we should also be able to have servers linked to normal worlds, at the cost of custom settings.
---
Not a bad idea. I’m pretty much there with my second character aside from Gunslinger which apparently works with gamma guns now.
---
Ah yes, the classic “it is what it is”
---
It is what it is.
---
Unfortunately lower levels are the easy pickings of the super high level, probable xp glitching and trap disarming egomaniacs of this game...
---
Me personally if I see a low level at a workshop I don’t bother them as it’s hard enough to grind up from the bottom, but if someone persists to PvP you there you just gotta leave it. The mechanics of the game dictate that workshops are open PvP grounds which is fine. But you will get those who abuse it of course.
---
Now that survival is gone be prepared for a lot more of this. The agenda is usually to either cap farm you (if you intend to fight back) or just bully you to enhance their E Peen, or ya know just so they can have a slight glimmer of PvP action against someone who doesn’t want to fight back and isn’t a min/maxxed Tesla stealth boy sweat. It’s highly unlikely they want the workshop for its intended purpose so I agree it’s pretty cancerous.
---
Because it might not be a real code?
---
It’s the rules of the game. Bethesda has heard the complaint thousands of times and they haven’t addressed it.  Bitch to Bethesda not the players.
---
Ya know this is reddit right? Where one posts rants and other things to spark conversation and debate.
---
You're just being rude at this point and I've lost the sympathy I had for you when I read your OP. I bet you're the type of player who gets on the mic and is a total asshole toward whoever is taking what you think is yours.
---
Don't take the PP, plenty of other content to enjoy.
---
My name on psn is my reddit name. I’m level 97 and I can help you get better gear so you don’t feel like the wasteland is against you. I’m typically on late nights between 1-5. I can build you rare weapons and armor with good mods. Add me if you’d like some help :)
---
Hahahahaaa! that's AWESOME!
---
You don't even need to pick up the bones. I just talked to him and he said "go get the body". Then I left and haven't heard from him since.
---
It says it's a code for fallout 76, it appears in my transaction history but there's no option to install it
---
I took it on my alt character. Around my level 60, a level 300+ came in. He challenged me to put down all my atomic shop crap into the workshop. He then placed all his atomic shop deco down. We had a great laugh. He told me to have a nice day and then wandered off.
---
I got mine in the get it before it’s gone part
---
Exactly this. Have gotten several things but.spent no real money on it
---
I feel this. Happened to me and a friend a few days back. We took a workshop to try and fix our weapons, and immediately get attacked by a guy that's around 200. We're both under level 40 and still starting out. I know all the 200+ people aren't like that, but it's disheartening when we're trying to learn and exploring in general.
---
I took a few months off, now I'm trying to collect and display all the magazines. I'm only on for an hour or so these days, in comparison to before when I was on for 4 hours and had more to do.
---
No spare ones at the moment, but I find them fairly often by checking object spawns in the mire.  https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bsyukf/new_map_of_random_encounter_locations_found_by

I made a guide how to farm power plant workshops quite safely, if you still need help here’s the link: https://youtu.be/2fq7R7yQQ9w
---
Fret not adventurer, for I AM HERE. 
---
I’m a level 97, PSN same as Reddit username. I know lots of good plans and mods to help you get an edge on the wasteland critters and creeps. I’m usually on late nights between 1-5am since I get off work at 12:30
---
I remember how good it felt when I was helped the first time and I want to reciprocate that feeling so it can be passed on. 
---
I can help you with power armor, armor, guns and bullets, chems and anything in between! Happy trails
---
A week, at most. I’m talking about actual put in time.
---
It's a great game, though still a bit buggy. Lots of content for new players and a friendly community. All of us who've been playing since the beta are eagerly awaiting new content.
---
2* til you get something decent to use for your build, then work on 3* afterwards
---
yea
---
This x100000
---
How much do you want for them?
---
This / 100000
---
Yeah, i remember the PC version being available for around 10-15$ for the most of the december last year. It's easy to find it dirt cheap.
---
How TF is he one shotting you? Are you that low level to where you can't survive a 110 hit? In that case you should have thought of that b4 engaging in pvp
---
Came here to post this.  People will burn through the basics fast. Likely will be grind stuff to it like scout badges.
---
probably could just sell you a costume for like 1 cap, as she has read the plan she had
---
I think you missed the main point of the OP
---
I can't remember the year rn but just Google that date and it should tell you
---
God I hope there’s that much new content
---
The trap xp glitch has been patched since mid august. Yes and everybody who workshop pvps is clearly a stealth boy Tesla sweat looking for some E Viagra for their E peen.
---
Thank you!!
---
Yeah,I need 2 sets.I could give you 100 caps if thats what you want
---
Green thumb was it! Thank you
---
Last disconnect for me was two weeks ago. Play almost every day. Today, I played for six hours. No problems. 
---
It's all about luck and dark, unlucky days.
---
Pretty sure BGSA\BGS has multiple accounts for their employees to defend the game no matter what, I can't imagine there being so many blind, self entitled fanboys blindly/ignorantly supporting some of the lame ideas people have or undercover BGS employees toss out to see what drums up excitement. I want better servers and bug fixes for a smoother gaming experience, fanboys want to just be cheerleaders and downvote any and all real,valid criticisms....so the game remains a stagnant roach motel.
---
You realised mid August was less than 2 months ago? The game had been out 10 months by that point... haven’t you seen anyone at like level 400+?
---
I never said everyone did I? I said it’s highly unlikely that it’s done for the workshops intended usage.
---
Jeez you must be a mad salty boi that all these points apply to, did I tag you in this post? Are you offended?
---
Not a horrible idea. Just need to be able to build those walls before someone comes in and kills you.
---
2 sets is no problem, she will quote "literally give them to you for free"
---
It’s not possible atm but you can technically get 5 effects, with the fixer It has to be 3* and have the prime combat rifle receiver, along with the base effect it comes with allowing it to have “5” effects
---
Hard reset your xbox: shut it down, unplug it for 30 seconds, plug it back in, and start it up.
---
That's a good point.
---
Looks like I’m going to have to search a switch plan so I can build one of those fancy garage stores likes everyone has
---
I’m know. Hope they change it soon. Found out the hard way 😅
---
Lmao that's an interesting theory.
---
Everyone knows it’s the red wire.  Please report it as a bug if the red wire causes it to explode.
---
i have heard if you attach letters to it then blueprint the whole thing it will keep the inventory but if someone else could confirm that
---
I'm not mad I just don't think there;s anything in the game that can let you do that.
---
See I’ve read something like that too but I couldn’t remember the trick, can anyone confirm this?
---
There’s a rifle perk that lets you do limb damage
---
If you PvP with someone and they damage your base you can move it and it’ll auto repair and keep everything in the vending machines. Happened to me.
---
If you move your camp, even to the same location everything is stored in groups if items are touching and vending machines can be replaced and will be stocked, as will magazine racks, bobble head display etc.
---
Limitation obviously is the dreadfully difficult if not impossible build system that fights moving and rebuilding the camp at every turn.
---
I believe I have had it keep what I have for sale when I’ve moved my camp but not when I store it directly from camp
---
I buy 1*’s to see what the purveyor is dropping, if it’s desired effects then move to 2**’s. Picked up a 1* quad gamma and quad Tesla doing that.
---
I walk a lot and have killed loads of them all over the map and photographed a few, but mostly now hear the noise and move on, like scorchbeasts the loot is pointless and not worth the ammo to kill them. Better to find ghouls for better loot or animals, as carnivore I get useful meat.
---
I refuse to move my camp lol I’ve had my same spot since beta, I’m stubborn
---
Holy Shitake mushroom that’s so good!!!
---
Sounds like a great idea
---
I haven't seen anything pay to win yet.
---
We can only hope
---
Was more so the fact its such a rare sighting for me clearly, and many others here and all around ive ever heard talk about it. I've seen lots of posts saying people only see it before level 30-40 range when that quest or whatever pops for it and never again! so i was excited to finally see one again at level 170 :p
---
I have seen old man winter masks and what looked like the sun mask but none of the others
---
 Only ever used bloodied explosive laser rifle and not really tried a normal laser, but this thing is a beast. So is my bloodied plasma rifle with flamethrower mod
---
Thanks for the heads up!  Lol
---
Dear God! I MUST HURRY *walks at a snails pace from work*
---
Is this game any good
---
post under your real login
---
Played pretty consistent up until the last announcement. Pretty active on the market. I've noticed a reduction in market activity and I've only hopped on once since the push back dropped.
---
This Wendigo clearly watched a lot of Naruto before it mutated
---
Need to do it. It’s fun and addictive.  Easier alone but for first time take someone with you that knows the routine
---
If you can keep up with the increased use of ammo and equip the commando perks, its the only way to go.
---
THANK YOU!!
---
Commie bastard
---
No problem!
---
I’m a bloodied  rifleman/melee non commando build. But for DPS I’m thinking of equipping the automatic receiver.
---
commando is currently the best build in the game.
---
In the trailer they show someone in power armor being killed by the shockwave of (presumably) the DC nukes, so I'd imagine at least some of those are from that. Some of the car accidents could have happened by people seeing the flash in the distance and being distracted, or ensuing panic.
---
Murdered? I was drunk wearing a clown suit wielding an axe. I have no recollection of a cave cricket murder
---
Another reason is that there aren't enough varieties of wine in the game. Seriously Bethesda, Falmouth Merlot that's it? We need more wine in the game!
---
Has that always been the case?  I received the plans as a drop from the event a ways back but I have yet to complete the actual quest.
---
That’s a great idea!
---
Yes it has.
---
If they were to bring back NV outfits, one underrated classic I’d definitely like to have would be a Ghost Person hazmat suit. I wish that was in game now, it’d be so perfect to wear for Mischief Night...
---
I’ve only heard the screams but i can never find it.   On another note, Where does the alien spawn/lurk?
---
These and copper, oil, gears and leather. Sell them all for 50 c.
---
Yes, as a matter of fact, I plan to wear it tomorrow night while my wife and surprise her sister with a night that....... ohhhhhhhhhhh, that’s probably not what you meant.....
---
Hopefully
---
The golf course, northern part of Hemlock Holes irradiated section. I get all five usually right there. One in the bathroom on the way out to the course just to be safe.
---
there is plenty of whine in the reddit to go around..
---
My first instinct is “plasma grenade”.
---
The bar idea is nice I like it.
---
Well, unless they change the Vault’s entire story radically before they launch the Raid, there’s only ONE Vault left; we already know nobody survived in Vault 96. No idea what’s up with Vault 63, though- it’s most likely nobody survived it, either, but there’s no lore in-game yet so it’s possible that could change.
---
I’ve never looked into that build. I’ll def take a look now. Thanks!
---
I remember being ten years old.  If the Internet had been around then, I probably would've posted some really dumb shit too.
---
The neverending perils of the wasteland...
---
ive found it once out by the mire area, top right of the map, when i was level 20 and you get that little side quest for it, and then since then i only saw it this once right outside harpers ferry, i think it can wander around these higher level areas in the mire cuz ive never heard it or seen it besides this
---
What’s the quest and how does it start
---
its so awesome right! i had to sit admiring it for like 20 minutes with photmode and camera since i know for me and many other players its extremely rare to see it, figured ill probably never see it again and enjoy the moment and examine its insides little legs and such xD
---
it's nothing special, really. as a rifleman you could probably respect into it in a few levels.
---
just mix commando with stealth and bloodied. you'll offset the ammo usage with sheer damage. you can probably oneshot most things as you would with a bolt-rifle.
---
Have you browsed this sub? Theres wine everywhere
---
I have tried this. It works fine and keeps everything in the vendor
---
Ah yes Fog Meat, the elusive fog crawler pet and man's best (and smelliest) friend.
---
Welcome to the weekly bugged weekly challenge.   What will it roll over to tomorrow?  Who knows!
---
Idk I’m just desperate to find a solution because I have ear problems and wearing the headset or ear buds for too long really starts to hurt. This is the only game I’ve ever had this problem with
---
When you leave out as many details as possible it is basically leaving the reader to fill in the blanks to try and comprehend the message. Given that they have in the past they have nerfed some challenges to not give atoms any more and have for almost a year neglected to fix almost all of the broken dailies and weeklies it can be fair to assume the worst.
---
That has always bothered me seeing a number of recently killed Raiders and Responders along with skeletons of others in the same area.
---
Haven't beat the main quest yet, but I'm sure it will reveal more.
---
Alrighty, Thanks!
---
See now that’s a fun atom challenge.  All the hours I’ve got and I’ll find another of these every few weeks it seems.
---
Gnomes too.  Those gnomes are up to no good!
---
I definitely can’t wear normal headset of earbuds this I get weird headaches from them, so I’ve had a good experience with this  https://www.plantronics.com/ca/en/product/rig-100hs
---
It’s not a solution just a bandaid 😅
---
I think I’m going to do that, I sunk some atoms into that little camper thing and I don’t use it, going to put a door on it and lock it.
---
You would need the commando perks to make it worth it.  Otherwise, you would get better DPS as rifleman
---
The other day I saw 5 orphaned scavenger bots near the station, it was so sad.
---
I've seen some screenshots that seem to prove that someone got lucky.

---
Do the commando perks apply to the .50 Cal?
---
Until the last line, I was going to say that this needs to be the most up voted comment on the sub. Now I want a name. This person has a 1000 cap bounty on their head.
---
No. 50.cal is a heavy weapon
---
I don’t know how you could possibly say that.  Best damage in the game is melee.  Most efficient gun build is Rifleman. Highest damage gun build is heavy. 
---
Commando is a solid build, but I don’t think there’s any way to say it’s the “best”.
---
Powerful auto with commando perks is top notch
---
Le Matomaty
---
Vault-tec Alarm Clock... Found mine hiding behind a desk at Fort Defiance.
---
Exactly
---
Not rare 2 spawn in fort defiance I’m pretty sure
---
I got stuck in a dirt thing and lasted quite a while, while panicking the whole time lul
---
Well I knew a guy who said he saw someone buy one once. **I** certainly would **never** do that though. What? What are those doing in my stash box? Never saw them before! I swear!..................^(runs away.....................)
---
Pick up the commando cards and try it for yourself and decide while keeping the rest of your build unchanged.  I like the Lever way too much to move my Rifleman build to Commando. If I want to waste ammo and blow up everything into goo I’ll use my heavy build.  
---
I do think I’ll make a 10mm SMG build eventually.  Not optimal, but I want to do something different.
---
Hmm. I use Defiance for my daily caps. Go in, pick up everything, sell at vendor... Have only ever found it once out of maybe 50 times. Not saying you're wrong, just figured it was rare.
---
For real on the melee. And I'm mostly a heavy gun build myself and can say, those legendary .50 cals can shred stuff.
---
Hahahahahaha.
---
lol!  altho it always gets me in the feels to hear the ghoul mom talk.  ugh -- my eyes arent wet, its this damnable boston humidity! (sniffs back in booger)
---
I also use defiance sometimes for straight jackets, and I’ve also farmed many hours for asylum outfits, and I always see people selling the alarm clock also, plus I have 2 haha
---
I would just love to have the one from the Purveyor, music included
---
Commando Is the best probably because it works PvP and PvE, considering damage caps, rate of fire, Vats benefits, etc, etc. 
---
All builds are viable, all styles can Shine. Nothing Is crazier as an unyielding unarmed ninja hitting for 20.000 points of damage. You can one-shoot 90 percent of enemies with a critical gunslinger, etc.
---
The 50 cal is awesome, but wait until you get you hands on a legacy Gatling plasma. It’s pretty insane. 
---
(I do kill myself a lot with it though!)
---
They only apply to the full auto rifles, e.g. combat rifle, handmade, pipe,10mm smg and the other smg.
---
Edit: also things like laser, plasma and railway rifle if modded to be auto.
---
You made me laugh. A lot. Some Paul Giammatti kind of laugh.
---
I don’t even consider PvP, so you might be right there. Does anyone really play PvP now? Maybe it’s just on the PC, but I know very few people who play PvP any more.
---
Edit: Also, what would the best DPS gun be for a commando build? Wouldn’t a BE Gatling Plasma still be strongest even without the cards?
---
Dude... There Is a timer. Top right corner.
---
All depends what you want to do. If you are strictly pve then going hardened receiver with rifleman perks is pretty good and you use ammo a hell of a lot slower. 
---
With my commandos I find myself trying to single shot or at most get a two shot burst for pve. Anything more and I'm just blowing through ammo. 
---
I guess the nicest thing is if you can do both mods to the weapon you can easily do a card swap and see which one you like more.
---
The devestation will be catastrophic if i dont use my atoms on these. screw getting new cool camp items when I can buy these majestic beasts instead
---
I have a bloodied gatling plasma, that thing is a beast. I just had stopped using it for a while because of the problem with plasma goo loot not loading. I know they fixed that so, I really should use it more. XD
---
Don't know why people don't see him More often. I see him maybe once a week. Do you fast travel a lot? I rarely do, and I travel a lot early in the morning for roleplaying reasons.
---
Yeah, I mostly use my VE one now.  I kill myself too much with the BE.  🤷‍♂️
---
We had a similar system in Star Wars Galaxies. One benefit was there was a pretty long countdown on the switch so you couldn't just toggle it on and off all willy nilly. When you toggled it on your name started flashing then eventually you went red. Toggling it off worked in a similar fashion except if you died while the countdown was ticking you respawned with pvp disabled. 
---
We also had a decent sized pvp zone that would rubberband you out unless you first hit the toggle. Hitting the toggle and running in the zone instantly enabled pvp. You could not disable pvp while in the zone. 
---
I've heard rumors that some of the SWG devs work on this game but I don't know how much merit there is in that. The system was not without flaws by any means, but it was a hell of a lot better than what we have now.
---
Upload it to imgur and post the link
---
I've had this happen a couple times in ps4, closing the game and restarting it was the only thing that fixed it
---
[deleted]
---
Can I not post a facebook link?
---
What platform are you on?  I try to drop a nuke a day, more on weekends  I could perhaps walk you through your first drop? I've done it for a few folks.

---
Done got it.
---
I had sun, Jester, old Man winter and two others, but I sold them to vendors a week after the event, because I didn't use Reddit and I thought they were just garbage. Also, most of my characters had one or two, but got deleted months ago. One of my characters still has two or three common ones.
---
I’m worried about this - I can’t imagine them making it more generous. I am trying to finish the world ones before it changes.
---
the dps of a BFFR25 fixer rivals that of a BSSstr meat hook before food. it's weaker after the bonuses, but you don't need to worry about the Queen blasting you away. it's definitely the 2nd hardest hitting build in the game and tied for first if you're not keen on psycho.
---
you're also hitting hard enough per trigger pull that regular mobs, even tanky ones like super mutants, die with a single bullet to the head. so no difference from a hunting rifle or gauss when it comes to ammo efficiency.
---
and the only heavy that can reliably out-dps a fixer or a handmade are explosive plasmas which, like meat hooks, arguably, rely on bugs to output such ludicrous amounts of damage.
---
spend a lot of time on reddit, I do t really log on much anymore
---
He still follows the path but I very rarely ever see him. In fact I haven't seen him in months except for meat week.
---
He hosted a two cookouts and you didn’t come man get the message that he’s avoiding you
---
Damn i needa find old man winter bad that one is dope
---
I just found him today actually lol on PC, I spawned in at Charleston station looking for the responder bot and he happened to walk by, chally in tow
---
My buddies finally picked it up, and we're having fun exploring it, even tho I've been playing since the beta. Lately tho, ive gotten a lot of enjoyment out of just scavenging and making armor and weapons for lowbies who pass by my camp. It's close to the overseers camp, but if they want I drop leather armor, a pipe pistol and ammo, along with food and water. It ain't much but its honest work
---
Soldier Is common too. That one and Owl are not hard to find.
---
This!
---
Well done.
---
Then bring the game mode down now.
---
If you trying to fast scope you still waste time adjusting because your having to guess scope position before drilling in to scope view. It's a mute point if you have a rifle build then you will be using all those sweet VATS luck perks. But for rifle secondary builds thinning the herd on solo runs is smart tactis
---
I’ve got BE and B25 fixers.  They don’t seem to be nearly as strong as one of those legacy Gatling Plasmas.  I’d guesstimate the GP does 300% more damage. I’d also say that neither B25 or BE Handmade/Fixer can compete with a BE LMG or Minigun for pure DPS.  Maybe I’m wrong, but a good heavy build with BE weapons seems to outclass Commando DPS by a decent margin.  It’s an expensive build to run, especially the LMG, but it hits incredibly hard and fast.
---
Nice comeback.  
---
The old "I'm rubber and you're glue" gambit.
---
An oldie but goodie .... if you're in the third grade.
---
Nope - probably only works for you. Use imgur for a guaranteed success.
---
When you say "dailies" you mean daily quests right?
---
They’ve patched that, your flux reward from the queen is no longer loot able by players, it just disappears now.
---
Scrap every thing you don't use
---
If something shoots at you, shoot back.
---
If you are running out of ammo try a different gun. If you are running out of all ammo try melee as it's quite strong.
---
There is sometimes an event in the top left corner called Leader of the pack. You can get a few low level legendary items from it which can give you a small boost in your power.
---
Well... Workshops are dangerous places nowadays... I take them for the thrill, and I sneak and run away. Never defend, never retake. It's like graffitti.
---
He was in the Big Bend tunnel.
---
Enjoy the scenery,  take it all in, run from scorchbeasts, pet mothman for xp bonus.
---
True. In my case, I have 5 characters and each one must have like 5-15 kits. Never used it. In fact, I forget I have them and cry and scavenge looking for materials with broken armor. They are not part of the game for me.
---
In your defense, there hasnt been cool new camp items in 3 weeks.
---
Also consider investing in sneak, ninja and escape artist in agility.  My buddy and I both run bloodied unarmed sneak builds and we absolutely wreck the SBQ
---
I seen him yesterday out in grafton. The enemy super mutants dropped poor charley down to 1/2 health.
---
Unless that something is another player.
---
It's really surprising what people will undervalue.  Got a near god roll Instigating Deathclaw Gauntlet with +40% power and 90% reduced weight from a player vendor for under 1500 caps. Vendor hopping is kinda fun at times.
---
This is true :( every week i hold out hope.. but no :( I'm holding out hope that some of the flooring comes back as well as the greenhouses :( maybe one day  
---
im sure this week they will bring out bulk repair kits instead though.
---
nothing can out-dps legacy plasmas. that's until Bethesda fixes them, though. much to my dismay. so it doesn't count, I guess?
---
&gt;a good heavy build with BE weapons seems to outclass Commando DPS by a decent margin.
---
it doesn't. a LMG sits at around 5k dps. a fixer sits at 7.5k. that's sneaking, of course. but in my experience, the Queen is blind. her perception is awful. and that 7.5k is not counting crits, which can be every other shot in the right hands.
---
I roleplay it. My current character Is a soldier. Like the skeletons you find: dirty army helmet, dirty army fatigues, combat rifle with no silencer, backpack, frag grenades and an anti-armor lightweight shovel. 
---
No fast travel.
---
&gt;Only problem is it'd likely cost 10 fucking dollars or close to
---
**Worth it**
---
I love my lever action as well so it’s a hard decision for me
---
Pretty sure Crater is the crashed space station, which will be a city for one of the new factions in wastelanders.
---
7.5K DPS? That can’t be right.  That means you’d be doing 1.35M damage in a 3 minute SBQ fight (not counting reloads and whatnot).
---
I like it!
---
there's a good legendary market out there, you simply have yet to find it, it would seem. As for "creating your own" that would simply be absolute bullshit, to be perfectly blunt. Let's go ahead and invalidate the entire point of "Legendary" gear by making it easy to get god roll stat equipment. smh you DO realize that not everything in a game should be handed to you on a silver platter, yes? game's already way too easy pve wise...
---
* Always have a decent melee weapon to fall back on when you run out of ammo
---
* Don't pick weapon specific damage perks until you have a better idea what you want to be, I like to focus on Inspirational, Action boy/girl, Marathoner first.
---
* Scrap every weapon and armor piece that you loot and do not use. Learn those mod plans!
---
* Don't spend your caps
---
* Don't fast travel if you don't need to (see above about not spending caps)
---
* Don't burn stims in impossible situations. If you have to just die and respawn, pick enemies off one at a time.
---
* Dont burn stims healing outside of combat. Use water, food or sleep instead. 
---
* Don't claim workshops unless you want pvp. 
---
* Grind as many levels between storyline quests as you can stand to. If you don't, the story will get ahead of you in a hurry and you'll find yourself on here asking for help. 
---
* Hit public events and try to tag every single enemy there is. Let the high levels finish them off, you will get fantastic xp.
---
Correct. Your trash Is someones treasure. Bought an instigating faster swing combat knife for 300. And have a furious faster fire cal 50 for sale at 3000 and nobody has bought it Yet.
---
it is. check the calculator. I know it's oftentimes incorrect but on my end the numbers check out. and that's with a BFFR25 Fixer, an explosive one with demo 5 nets you 8k. *before* adrenaline kicks in, or any drugs.
---
against the Queen your numbers are always lower. I can't vouch for the calculator in this case, but it's closer to 2.5k.
---
Awesome vid, nicely done -))
---
They're like mice. They're all around us all the time, but they're just so quick and sneaky that we only get a glimpse of them every so often - and its usually once they're already dead.
---
2* or 3* and if 3 whats the third modifier? I'd be willing to buy it for 3k if youre on PC. I love me some 50 cals, and I'd like a good non explosive to use so I don't cripple myself in close range since I have a TSE fast reload one.
---
If they have a lock on the resources, or if the workshop is not built out, I will take it over, destroy the locks, and build it out.
---
I won't kill them unless they shoot first tho. They are free to run away, if they want.
---
Dont feel like downloading or figuring it out.
---
Anybody got  a link to that map?
---
Faster fire handmade or legendary Fixer are probably the best ones. Bloodied and junkie's or furious. No big difference because they all work like chainsaws which shred you from a distance with no misses because of Vats. 
---
I don't pvp, and my main weapon Is a .38 Fixer, because everything else Is overkill against enemies. Vats the head and three bullets are enough. 
---
Gatling plasma dies not benefit from silencers and stealth multipliers.
---
The game is coming out with a massive update that will bring new life to fallout 76.
---
We are no where near the death of the game. Stop being so dramatic before people start collecting your tears and use them as a brine.
---
Lol a true response I hoped for! I hope you're right brother/sister.
---
You have to build a floor on the shore first, then clip it into the water and delete the pieces you don’t want
---
Ps4. I also have a junkie's faster fire. But my camp looks 'low level' and Is not near Whitespring, so... Just for curious ones. Like a good restaurant nobody knows about.
---
What I did when I created my last character was to go to Overseers CAMP, I think it's the first quest when you leave the volt. Next Sunshine Meadows killing everything on the way and place my CAML on the junk pile + water there.  I got the Sunshine Meadows workshop for the experience and then continued with the quest that should be around. If the power plant is active you will see a green light to a connector on the wall there (Next to the food processing machine thing) enter build mode (hold V on PC) and connect the wall power with the food processor.
---
Ping me if you need water, food or plans at some point. Nick: b1-0s
---
I can’t wait for wasteland update, private servers hopefully will be cool but if they are not it’s fine  because wastelanders is going to be fantastic
---
you'd be right if they were locally hosted. as it is, it's simply a premium feature for paying players.
---
7,500 damage per second.  So you are seeing floating damage of 2,500 per shot? Or what?  I guess I don’t play around with drugs and whatnot, but that seems WAY too high.  I know I see 2,500 head shots, but I don’t see any build being able to sustain that on a fight like the SBQ.  If you are saying someone is able to pull 7.5K DPS on the SBQ with a fixer, I’d love to see the video.  I don’t think that’s remotely possible with a BE GP, and that’s the most powerful gun in the game. I own all these different guns too. 🤷‍♂️
---
Also Demolition Expert maxed is a waste of points.  It nets you 4% pure damage for the first point, and 2% for the rest of the points.  Compared to perks like Bloody Mess (5% per point), I wouldn’t waste points on Demolition.
---
I’m not in the water....I’m a story or two above it
---
Thx tho
---
You sound like those who complain because they got killed at a workshop... You team up, you know the risk...
---
I have mad social anxiety and I can't even escape it in fo76. Like seriously. Ha
---
I was thinking you could use the staircase (one w the floor) and connect another floor piece to that but it’s always finicky. Look up norespawns on YouTube I like his style of builds. Has tips and tricks too, the rug glitch being one of them. 
---
Tons of stuff from fo4 as well
---
Shame we're one different platforms, I hope they add crossplay later since Sony is doing full support for it now.  CAMPs like your make for a nice surprise.  I admittedly run a more mainstream shop near Whitesprings, however I'm way cheaper than the market subreddit/forum types and other srsbsns players and I curate my shop to have only worthwhile weapons/armor.  Everything is under 10k most under 3k and only god rolls or near god rolls get close to 15k.
---
I appreciate the tip, I’ll check his stuff out in the am. Thx again man
---
Have you used a BE Gatling Plasma?  I own BE Fixer, B25 Fixer, BE Handmade, B25 Handmade, and a ton of more meta guns....they don’t compare remotely to BE GP damage.  Even a non-bloodied legacy GP absolutely destroys. I have multiple characters and multiple builds, but I just don’t see any commando build being close to a heavy exploding Gatling Plasma build.
---
If you are just saying the GP sucks tactically in PvP, then I defer to your PvP knowledge.
---
7.5k without drugs. and no, it's not 2.5k per shot, more like 1.5k if it's a headshot. that's what my handmade hits for. around 1000 on the torso.
---
and I told you, you hit the Queen for a lot less. your dps falls from 7.5 to around 2.5. I'm not using demolition expert personally either, just saying that a BE Fixer with demo 5 is stronger than a BFFR one. but a BFFR Fixer is stronger than a BE one without demolition expert.
---
Workshops are PvP zones. Sorry you keep getting ganked, it is what it is. The game warns you with a big popup asking your permission for PvP when you claim it.
---
Uh no thats stupid.
---
I made the mistake of telling my wife about the perk that lets you tame animals and bring them back to your camp. Now when I level up she gets mad that I'm getting perks that'll hopefully keep me alive instead of investing towards a camp cat.
---
"and it gives me someone to do in-game"
---
Woah, easy there. XD
---
I cried
---
I do usually give water to low levels when i'm overfilled.
---
I just want some unbroken windows for my camp. I can build a damn fusion generator in a cave, with a box of scraps, but all the windows I make from scratch have to be half broken?
---
I’d love to see a video someone doing 2.5K DPS on the SBQ with a fixer or handmade.
---
The risk that someone will be a dick?
---
Well I guess so then.
---
Yeah but the Vampire outfit just Looks baf and is extremly underwhelming
---
The Outer World's drops in two days. Get it on PC for basically a dollar with Microsoft gamepass.
---
Parenting: such a thankless job!
---
Im staying on the adventure server as that shall be were the events are and were the nukes shall drop.
---
I think i agree, at this point, unless it is otherwise made clear by bethesda that the case is otherwise, we should assume the worst when it comes to the atomic shop.
---
They're in a vault.
---
If they do something nice for me sure.  It doesnt have to be charity
---
Not random legendaries, but some static legendaries.
---
Vendor pricing doesn't work with legendary effects, so unless they go through and change prices for each leegndary effect you could theoretically come across a two shot explosive pipe pistol, or instigating +40%power attack machete and it would only cost a hundred caps.
---
At least his game didn't crash ...
---
like I said, I can't vouch for the calculator, but the numbers check out on my end. you can see for yourself, around 300/2.5k on the Queen with a BE fixer.
---
this is the closest I could find: https://youtu.be/pXln_vGshKs
---
Im pretty sure its a new bug with one of the recent patches
---
There should be 4 player storages.
---
1. Stash 
---
2. Vendor
---
3. Displays 
---
4. Small account wide transfer stash.
---
We dingos are by far the scariest fallout creature
---
I did my daily deed earlyer. Went to flatwoods gathered 1,000 dirty water from the stream. Boiled them then distributed them into all the containers around town.
---
If you go the code route, they need to be 8 of the same.
---
Or you could just check out this site:  [https://nukacrypt.com/solved](https://nukacrypt.com/solved)
---
Dude I just wanted to make a cute lvl 106 camp, what did I do to you 😞. Btw, why you want a Power Plant? For the fusion cores, because those things... at your level I had 10 cores
---
As other have said, the Wasteland is a dangerous place and workshops are free game.  Make some friends with high level players that can help you defend and it can actually be pretty fun.  Your lv200 friends can crouch in the wings and light them up when they think you are easy pickings 
---
Use it as a role play opportunity - If this was a real wasteland and you are solo and and organized team of more powerful and better equipped people rolled up on your spot you would have no choice but to run ... it’s actually a much more realistic part about 76 vs. 3, 4, and NV IMO
---
Lmao what? That was nothing like the I'm rubber you're glue bullshit but okay. Hope no one places anymore big scary stash boxes in your camp&lt;3
---
Decide if you are there for the story, pvp, or top level.  That will make a huge difference in how much you explore, what weapons you choose, and what events and monsters you will defeat.
---
I'm a story driven roleplayer so i rarely attend daily events unless they happen to be where i am currently.  I instead follow mysteries and explore.  I rarely fast travel.  I could care less about specific builds.  I am in no hurry to level rise.
---
Yeah that bug has been going on a while.
---
Maybe not 20$ now, but as much as I now, the liberty prime power armor skin costed 20$.
---
But I see some sales and power armor skin for like 10$ stills being a lot but lower than 20$ for sure.
---
Btw I don't buy skins for the fact that, costumes can be surpassed by ingame clothes.just try trapper armor with the flying hat.
---
I found my first Flatwoods monster about two weeks ago in Whitesprings. I didn't know wtf it was, I was shocked. Never have I been so surprised in a video game except for the time I found the crashed alien spaceship in FO4.
---
I don’t understand this game. Do I just keep killing them until I get 8? Or do I need 8 specific codes? If so then how do I start the quests without going back and forth from the white springs bunker? Because I don’t have very many caps and I can’t spend them all on this damn quest
---
Also where do I launch the nuke
---
nice thanks bud! ill send ya an add!
---
there probably wasn't anything of use on it so don't worry about it.
---
lol it's absolutely, definitely timed. I've done this event multiple times.
---
honestly its not like thats even hard. a triple A development studio should have no problem implementing that feature if tons of indie games are able to do that.
---
Lol what level are you? I remember my first encounters with them, it was scary.
---
The only really cool item so far was the salvage robot.  What a hoot he is
---
Use nukacrypt, also unless you have hacker level 3 you should do site Charlie because it has no turrets
---
Flamer and Cryolater are technically heavy energy weapons with no spin up.
---
Don't rush the story. Do side quests, dalies, events, etc. Limit your fast travelling; you find wayyy more secrets and cool stuff if you walk/run. Be a good community member. Get youself a nice CAMP set up.
---
Yeah those numbers are pretty much my experience playing in West-Tek and whatnot with a handmade.  That said, the actual DOS numbers sound way off to me.  I assume you’re using that one that went up on Reddit last week to calculate it?
---
This sub reddit is so gay sometimes
---
It's more like p2convenience because the scrap kits are useless, the repair kits are surpassed massively by their in-game counterpart, the fridge is just a waste of atoms as well as the robot.
---
But again it's just p2convenience, people call it p2w 'cause it's a simple way to call it.
---
https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html
---
you just have to multiply whatever damage you're seeing by your rate of fire.
---
Anytime i see a low level holding a workshop i help her defend it
---
Bought one when I needed some junk i couldnt find to fix some gear. Never needed another
---
My home is in tick ville in the forest so got a wood extractor but keep it unlocked so players can freely grab as they need. And alwase have 6 water purifyers i keep them unlocked aswell.
---
Paying 10$ for few minutes of saved time is stupid.
---
I walk and enjoy the view as i explore.  Still have plenty left to explore
---
as a pvper? probably.
---
There are a lot of perks and mutations that help out with a bloodied build. For a junkies build it's not as easy to rack up so much damage. However you will have have the benefits of not having to be at low health to maximize your potential damage output so it's basically a trade between more health versus more damage.
---
Personally I have never actually dabbled with either of those two setups. I personally enjoy being a heavy weapons vampires build. I predominantly play PVE the only PVP I do is during nuclear winter.
---
Here is some damage calculations for you to see and compare yourself.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cqvxb4/updated\_comparison\_of\_legendary\_weapon\_mods/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/cqvxb4/updated_comparison_of_legendary_weapon_mods/)
---
It’s fine to take a work shop on slow servers I recommend setting up camp on a lead deposit easy ammo 
---
Work shops get atacked by dogs sometimes after taking one and that’s easy food
---
Appreciate your insight dawg 🤙
---
I feel like whoever is writing for the site really needs to work on their clarification.  Through was the wrong word without a doubt. 
---
I see on the twitter page it says 12PM EDT, but doesn't say it on the Cleanup Appalachia page nor do I recall it seeing it in the game news thing.
---
Considering players are selling legendaries in their stores what could it hurt?  But since said players already are, what does it matter?
---
I got a tweet at 10am this morning telling me to be sure and get my scrips in before the noon deadline....oh ok, Bethesda...let me leave work and do that real quick, no problem! I feel your pain.
---
Good sources of bulk items.  Player stores should sell more of them
---
This was super helpful man thx. I guess for me personally it's the stat debuffs that scare me the most
---
Nah the title is a little too much like click bait... downvoted and ignored
---
Not stupid at all.  I'm level 255 and I do the same thing.  I wait for it to land and kill it in a few hits.  I'm a melee build, and hitting it with my lever action or whatever just seems to make them stay in the air longer.  I have like 700DR/600ER so the screech attacks do literally nothing.  The gas rads me some, but nothing I can't handle.  The mobs need to be taken out it seems before it will land; but again; not a bad strategy at all.
---
2-4 hours depending on terminal load times.
---
In my opinion this list should be deleted and users should be allowed to post what they wish. With the past weeks ITV release, Bethesda made it very clear that they do not understand what the community wants from them as developers. By purging the conversation you are allowing Bethesda to create their own narrative of what they claim the community wants, with no actual proof for or against their statement.
---
I understand that this list is useful in keeping conversation fresh and minimizes spam, but at what cost? The moderators removing post that could harbor productive discussions is ignorant and dangerous to the future of this game. Had posts regarding the addition of functional refrigerators been allowed the community would have a basis for claiming that Bethesda stole a community idea and sold it back to that very community for profit. Or at the very least we could have had some information from the developers that could have hinted that it would be an atom shop exclusive item and the community could have spoken up.
---
Have you found the bear couple that's 69'ing? nice.
---
Same here, very surprised and annoyed, the game time zone is probably based on EU or Asia instead of America.
---
wow yes i need them...... not, waist off atoms along with any other utilities microtransactions.
---
It was a CC mod for FO4. The works already done.
---
Gp does suck in pvp
---
Yeah that make sense. It’s not very good for stealth.
---
I had it before it was pulled out, i wish you could take the cape off, that would let you have a badass stylish vest
---
I was nervous as hell but after the first few times (I generally initiate conversation), it got sooo much easier. Even had a few folx express how pleasantly surprised they were that someone else was talking to them. My general rule is just be nice and ask advice. Some nice player gave me a Skelton costume today after we talked. Thanks!
---
I don’t think this is a good idea for a multiplayer game that already has a devalued currency problem and limited items for end gamers to hunt down.
---
I can appreciate the idea coming from a casual, one character, one account perspective, but 76 is multiplayer and everyone needs to be accounted for when decisions are made. Some players seem to have all the time and money in the world to grind endlessly with dozens of characters on multiple accounts, and I won’t even mention the sweatshops that meth up kids to grind/dupe gear that’s sold for real money online.  Even if they have no malicious intentions, heavy players can destabilize a game economy when their efforts are compounded.
---
Vendors would immediately be abused in the same way that people server hop looking for dense torso plans and unicorn-rare outfits. Players will server hop Watoga endlessly all day for dense plans that sell for 5-15k caps, so if you add the chance at legendary handmades, 50cal, etc, that’s even more incentive for more people to server hop endlessly until the market is over saturated.  Never underestimate the motivating potential of power and greed. Plans and cosmetics are one thing, but weapons and armor have real impact on the game.
---
The scrip limit cap is intentionally very low because the game economy needs some items to hold incredibly high value. Watering that down in any way is a slippery slope, if you’ll pardon the pun. I know players have been asking for limit increases, but I don’t think it’s wise right now.
---
If you can just sell assault rifles and straight jackets until you have enough caps to buy all your ultimate guns and armor, what’s left to do? It’s good to have problems that money can’t solve, at least in a game.
---
We already have a vendor that trades in legendary gear, but her currency is walled behind an effort barrier, as is appropriate. You have to actually play the game and wear out some virtual shoe leather.
---
In order to get top end gear in 76, you have to do three things. Grind scrip, kill legendary enemies and utilize the trading economy. Given that we now have scrip that can be gathered from unwanted legendary items, as well as daily quests paying out scrip, plus periodic discounts, getting gear is pretty easy.
---
I could get behind a caps to scrip conversion, but it would have to be a 50/1 ratio or higher. It would certainly help add value to caps, or at least create something for end gamers to buy other than ammo.
---
I need nicks, pipers and sturges outfit in my life again
---
Did you at least give it a chance?
---
Taking on full team isn't impossible, but its pretty damn hard. You gotta have good position and equipment to do so, but damn it feels good when you do.
---
My tips would be; 
---
* make sure you have high ground and cover
---
* if you down the first and they don't know your position then leave them for bait for an easy second, that way you begin the fight as 2 on 1 rather than 3 on 1
---
* never forget grenades! if they are grouped together and you vats it so they can't get away, you can take down an entire team straight away.
---
* or even use for tactical moves, throw a grenade and go to stimpack/or move to cover. When the enemy sees that grenade symbol all focus goes to worrying about being hit, rather than watching/attacking you.
---
* keep moving, chances are someone on the opposing team isn't stupid and they will start moving to attack from different angles. Keep watch for players movements to make sure you're not flanked and think ahead to where your next point of movement is incase you begin to get pinned.
---
Maybe under a bridge, saves you budget from roofs and makes it look undergroundy, there is one that i used for a bunker type camp at the mire and another one at the forest.
---
I'll take "never gonna get fixed for 800, Alex"
---
And I agree. I would play NW more consistently if there was a solo mode. I like playing teams when people I know are on, otherwise I'd be going solo all the time.
---
That’s the community with almost every property. You’ve got a few types of fans to expect 
---
1) fanboys that blindly accept everything and won’t admit that the game/movie/show is flawed and could be improved
---
2) casual/fans that overall enjoy it, but think it could be improved in some areas
---
3) toxic people who shit on the property no matter what and probably haven’t touched the game in months/years, yet continue to prowl the forums just to spread toxicity
---
That too.
---
T-45, T-51b, and T-60 plans can be obtained from Distant Thunder Event uncommon. Raider is exclusive to the Toxic Valley Treasure maps as far as I know. This is a long grind. =/
---
I went there tonight and was shocked to see the price, so i quit the purchase window. There were several players came after me and all of them quit it as soon as they initiated the purchase. Many shocked and disappointed wastelanders today 😫
---
Are u talking about not hearing people or no sound from the game when using a controller?
---
Not that I think the original idea is great, but why add in even more complication? The last thing the game needs is two different brands of legendary items to further tangle the wires. You know an update would happen where legendaries would all be converted to unscrippable status , become untradeable or some other disaster that fries the game for days or weeks.
---
That would be awesome! You fish up a caps stash with like 100 caps in!
---
Story of this whole games UI. It's fucking horrible.
---
On my experience it runs like a charm. Not so much on destiny 2 as a guide line. It doenst even connect to those servers and if i do i get disconnected before i load into the world
---
PVP is just awful and dumb. I’m getting grief during scorchbeast events trying to clear mobs where lvl 30s will get in my way and kill me out of now where. Also mini gun mechanics are still broken and gun jams for no apparent reason.
---
The mechanist was in that pack but I’m talking about the NCR veteran outfit or was there never one due to lore
---
A lil bit adervtisey, but you're starting a conversation.
---
I haven’t seen him in a couple of weeks. He used to walk past my place in the Mire all the time. I miss him and Chally.
---
i saw one old man winter and one jester. also plans doent exits or they werent ingame as the event was on going
---
Really, zero upvotes? I think it’s a good system, dammit. I don’t end up spending any money on the aesthetic pieces I like, despite what little is available in the store.
---
I always check the person's achievements for fallout before giving them a ton of stuff
---
Thanks amigo, lots of good advice
---
The corpse outside the vault is in the same state as the corpses with know death dates from 6 years prior. There are corpses from even earlier that are in the same state, so the lack of realistic decay was likely a deliberate choice. They ought to all be skeletal by now, but seeing only minor decay adds to the feeling that we just missed being able to save them.
---
The Free States people we know of are all dead. Maybe some new wastelanders will take up the mantle, but they're kind of missing their raison d'être. Without an oppressive government to rebel against they're just another group of survivors.
---
I’m talking about not hearing anything at all when I load in. The start up menu has sound and when it’s loading in at first there is sound as well. As soon as I’m in the game the sound is gone. When I plug my headset into the controller, or just a headphone plug as I’ve broken a pair and took the plug to play, the game sounds come out of the tv. There’s videos online saying to change voice chat in game to team and then sound works normally. However that doesn’t seem to work for me and all the videos are dated. When you unplug the headphones the sound from the tv will play for a few seconds then suddenly stop. If I press the Xbox button the sounds for the menu can be heard, and all other games and menus work. This is a known glitch that I’ve yet to see Bethesda acknowledge. I think it was overshadowed by the invisible enemies glitch among countless others, but this one was very well reported also.
---
You’re not taking into account that some people will play the numbers, so to speak, and use whatever resources they can muster to improve their luck. It’s the one downside to RNG. If you buy one lottery scratch ticket a day, your chances are slim. If you buy every ticket in town, you’re going to win a bunch of times.
---
As a personal example, I spent 4800 scrip on weapons over the half price weekend, not counting scrip earned from daily quests. 3 characters all waiting with 1000 scrip each on Thursday, then each being logged on daily to get 150 more scrip on Th/Fr/Sat/Sun. I wanted a bloody fixer, knew it was a matter of throwing numbers at a problem, so I did everything in my power to get one.  I have a B/E/reload Fixer now, so it worked out.  
---
If I can show that kind of initiative for a video game gun, certainly tens of thousands will do the same if all they need is time and a pile of caps. You don’t even need to kill anything if you can server hop endlessly at Watoga until you see a god roll in the vendor inventory.
---
I didn't even realize they changed!
---
My point was that they can't even get the friends system to work properly, so what makes you think they could create a chat system that wasn't also completely unusable?
---
Sheet music so you could learn new songs on your existing instruments would be cooler in my opinion, and Bethesda wouldn't have a licensing issue with music that way.
---
I think a randomly played learned song would be sufficient. Similar to how the Atom Store music is randomised upon entry.
---
I watch decoy's dungeon alot, because I like building with existing structure. This wasn't in one of his videos, but linked from a comment from another user. 
---
This is a sweet little spot just east of the big dried up lake at the southern tip of the first. It's a 3 level building with most of the work benches. 
---
I've never really seen it elsewhere.
---
[Spot](https://youtu.be/P0gMy7HkKvs)
---
Oh my gosh, this was hilariously awful! 
---
Don't stop being you, though. It was awesome of you to help him; I promise not all of us low levels will act like that! I'm a level 62 and would be so grateful if someone like you helped me launch my first nuke. I guarantee I'll have zero idea of what I'll be doing! 
---
I hope you were able to server hop in time!

When I was a level 11, someone dropped a nuke on my base. I was still very new to the game and trying to figure it all out. When I saw the nuke zone was over my camp, I went to a nearby ridge to watch it happen thinking to myself, "it's no big deal, when Whitesprings is nuked the buildings all stay in tact, it's gotta be the same for camps!". 
---
... Nooooope. My entire camp, except for one wall and a staircase, was entirely destroyed. I shrieked in complete shock and signed off, vowing I'd never play again. ... And hopped right back on an hour later. (Of course). It gave me an excuse to build a better camp in a better location!
---
Totally agree man. I'm not the only person with multiple accounts, and I don't even use the other 2. But I see people that atom farm on multiple accounts, and even then they don't farm for items that were in Fallout 4. They farm to get skins for weapons and armour. 
---
But now Beth has gone back on its cosmetic only promise, so expect more pay to win
---
I know so much from videos, people asked me about is this your alt etc. but no, im 11 level 7/24 video watcher. Maybe he is same as me
---
This didn't happen. You're just pissed off that nobody wants to engage your stupid ass in PvP  and you made this up to make yourself look like you accomplished something when in reality you just failed at everything and you're a pissed off little troll. Get off the internet and go back to your racecar bed, fool.

I saw it yesterday im 11, he just disappeared i was like wtf
---
I think you're desperate for attention, even negative.
---
Change my mind.
---
Un surprised, had it effected Stealth I would be more inclined to that a bug.
---
Well I've got a dog helmet. So give us pets already.
---
I don't think the blast wave was that strong. Most of the survivors we know about weren't in any special shelters, just normal houses. Lots died in the ensuing panic afterward, sure, but that doesn't account for all the skeletons posed as if they died suddenly while doing a normal pre-war activity.
---
Found RedEye
---
Then you get to the point where you just one shot them, and it takes more shots to kill a radroach when I’m too lazy to use vats and with trash aim.
---
Yeah, but it kinda has that "What We do in the Shadows" vibe. When it first came out I mocked up my character to look like Jemaine Clement and ran around quoting from the movie. Called it my "Vat we do in the shadows" character.
---
yes a buddy of mine got a 3* quad ffr tesla for 40 scrip, everyone in our xbox party was excited/salty at the same time lmao (this was about two weeks ago)
---
If you go “melee build” it would be more efficient to build out for heavy weapons or shotguns as ranged alternative.
---
Heavy Weapons and Shotguns use STR as main category for perks.
---
That happens every now and again, items a previous player scrapped don't disappear from the scrip machine's inventory and you can claim them when you visit.
---
fwiw Two-Shot isn't that great on multi-shot weapons like the Shotgun, it only adds one extra projectile.
---
pathetic...
---
Quite often there are weapons or armor still in the machine when you first go in.  I think if you back out they will disappear so if you want to redeem it then don't hesitate.
---
I found this out by accident a little while ago. I did have some signs on the machines (and a flower pot or two), and I had dragged the machines out into the yard while I remodeled. Eventually just picked a new spot and started over. But, since my machines were outside, they were blueprinted separate from the building, and I was able to place them, with all their contents intact. I'm probably going to do that any time I want to move, from now on. Drag the machines outside first.
---
Wow that’s Lucky!
---
Yeah it’s pretty awful as im not doing a shotgun build either so I gave it to someone who I play with in the end

 "If it's like 'Well, these guys did this, so we're gonna do this,' I  can't stay awake. 'Hey, here's our Battle Royale game!' No thank you.  Not even remotely interested. That's not who we are as Bethesda; that's  not how we've gotten to where we are over the last 30-odd years.

Funny how things change...
---
I didn’t at one point but recently I’ve adopted hoarder tendencies and just pick everything up and scrap it, ended up with plenty of it!
---
yeah man we couldn’t believe it, here’s a few [screen grabs ](https://imgur.com/gallery/D2Fz16k)
---
It would be cool if this was added as an actual feature.
---
I was thinking there would be a lot of good legendaries for sale today from player vendors (PC) too. Didn't see that today but maybe it's too soon after the purveyors sale? Don't see why it would be rigged. What would they gain by that?
---
That’s pretty cool I still to this day have not got or received a Quad Legendary 😂
---
The ones I get the most are Vampire and Medic in weapons anyway Armour is always bloodly Nocturnal.
---
I’m not sure if it’s the case i did get some really good rolls although not a single fixer or bear arm what’s a bit suspicious. I spend in total 14k scrip and recorded everything, feel free to check your theory:
---
https://youtu.be/kRt7ivu6vBI
---
https://youtu.be/DQyh6bM-RuA
---
I see it as another outlet for my insatiable desire to take better screenshots. I spend maybe 20% of my game time chasing shots and having a private server would be amazing.
---
 I'm also looking forward to seeing and partaking in some event's or themes. There are a lot of very creative people out there and I think there will be some incredible world's to visit after a while. 
---
However I don't think it will 'replace' Adventure or kill it off. There is still a need for that and hell, Bethesda might even implement some of the fans' ideas (or even hire some people) after seeing the stuff they come up with.
---
no way? i’ve had a few quad ffr drops (hunting rifles, - combat rifle, and a 10mm pistol i use for low level mobs during events) vampires are sometimes some of the best drops! good luck in the future i hope you never get another nocturnal drop! 😂
---
You should put your camp nearby and build stairs
---
kinda pointless imo. you can loot more just be exploring the world
---
Up until I find the 20 serums in his vending machine.
---
Technically thats six no? 
---
Fixer comes with two, Harder to detect while sneaking (The quest awarded Steadfast also comes with this) and Move faster while aiming. Add 3\* Effects (Like, Bloodied, Faster Fire Rate, -25% VATS cost) that gets you 5 Effects. If you're saying a Prime receiver is an effect that would make it 6.
---
Get commando perks, hidden bonus on automatic receivers for rifles is -50% ap cost in vats and dmg per shot is almost the same s as with semi receivers.
---
Got a 1\* bloodied baseball bat this way. Snagged the wiffle ball bat skin. Thing is pretty powerful and the character that has it isn't spec'd into two handed at all. I keep kinda hoping it'll happen just cause it seems like better odds than the RNG proper :p
---
I have never bought any, only used improved ones. I actually have not repaired my gear without using an advanced repair kit since they came out. It's too convenient not needing to farm ballistic fiber
---
Crazy! How does one collect sooo many pies?
---
Cool. I'll check it out whenever I get the time.
---
Its all RnG i got alot of good rolls and a few crappy rolls.
---
UPDATE:  Today I logged in and it worked fine on the first try.  Perhaps the problem was limited to that particular server.  I certainly notice differences between servers from time to time, like tree and brush placement since sometimes it comes through the walls of my camp and sometimes it doesn't.  Regardless, THANK YOU to everyone who responded and tried to help.  :)
---
Most people were able to farm large quantities of XP during earlier stages of the game before they nerfed how much XP you can receive from enemies. These people are more than likely going to benefit greatly when legendary perks arrive.
---
#Can [confirm](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=IaGi1HLYhC8)
---
I hope so too Nocturnal is the worst one don’t see why they made it lmao
---
The pool of potential rolls is so enormously huge and the number of good, or even half-way decent rolls is so small in comparison that 1) the amount of rolls any given player does is almost certainly not enough to detect anything but the most blatant of bugs or skews and 2) the system doesn't need any bugs or skews to have produced nothing but crap for a large number of players during the sale. I got a few half-way decent pieces of armor for my alt and two or three weapons that might be usable but don't fit my build and hence will go into the vending machines as soon as I've spent enough caps to absorb the caps from the sales. And that's about what I expected to get; heck, it's somewhat better than I expected...  
---
Where I agree, though, is that I would like to see that system change. The pure RNG grind isn't enjoyable for me at all, the 150 scrip limit wasn't helping either, and there is no sense of purpose or progression whatsoever - either you get something useful out of the RNG or you (most likely) don't.
---
Never tried Bloodied I’m a bit OCD and don’t like my health being that low 😂
---
But that a find that is!
---
I had to do a double take when he said "in the game."
---
Surely he meant, "In the Atom Store^^TM "?
---
And that glitched weekly the silo code one thats been patched before needs fixed
---
Perk loadouts are coming next year:)
---
See, this would make more sense if there literally weren't workbenches ALL OVER THE PLACE!!!
---
Rigged because if everyone got a 3* Fixer or the dream Bloodied Explosive the game would be over fairly quick.
---
They have turned it onto a lottery most of us grind whilst there are one or two lucky winners. One decent weapon and some time then is all it takes...
---
👍🏼
---
Do you remember the last time they touched the challenges? Not in a million years they would make challenges give us more atoms. Learn to capitalism.
---
It's just RNG, just because you didn't get good rolls, doesn't mean the system has to change, people out there did get FIxer god drops. 
---
Take a look at the RNG, a good portion of range weapons are Junk or niche, regardless of legendary effects. Certain legendary effects are only good on certains weapons (Instigating Miniguns anyone?) The odds of getting even "average" rolls are low.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I got a ton of heavy weapons, to the point I had to get Bears Arms to be able to carry them, Like hell am I putting them in my (Already full to bursting) Stash at 20lbs a weapon, and due to scrip limits you can only get rid of so many per today. 
---
Give it a day or two, people will clear down their Stash, scrip the junk and you may start seeing them appear in Vendors
---
Becuz there a company there intention is to make money they left it somewhat vague some people would naturally and rightfully assume especially given what they did with noob challenges they be giving out less
---
Mr. House always wins.
---
I don't remember all dailies from all regions, but for me they just appear by itself, whenever I enter the region. Some are kinda broken (Cop a Squatter - it appears when I logging in to the game and if I won't finish it, it vanish upon server change), some appear more than they should (my record is 3x Play time, one after another), so it's generally a mess. Since recently dailies rewards with scrips, so I do even those, which aren't rewarding (Trick or Treat is an example). I do those from Toxic Valey (chance to get Western outfits), from Savage Divide and all possible from Mire and Cranberry Bog (a lot of EXP, most scrips and possible rare outfits). I completely ignore Forest Region ones...
---
They don't care about the 'for me', more impactful means they will give items/aid/ammo/fuckingshit instead of atoms.
---
P.S. I think randomly teaming up is the best part of the game for me. We never talk in voice and the muted adventures are very stress-relieving. I always take pictures with my comrades and generally enjoy the community of this game. It’s very altruistic!
---
Agreed. It's safe, and the only consistent reason I log in. I find them very fun
---
I'm a little more concerned why every good gun I got has 250 damage resistance while reloading. 
---
I got that effect so much that the pile of weapons I'm sitting on is effectively worthless until bethesda fixes that effect.
---
If anyone got any god rolls theyre not gonna put them in their vending machine. So unless you wanna risk getting ripped off by someone with a "trade only" weapon, your never gonna see them.
---
And those that we can build on, have more edit-ability. There's a house i stumbled across, had a weapons bench and pool table and thought would be a great place to build except that the basement and top floor were boarded off...
---
I hoard every chem I see. That’s why. Some of it is going to be put in the vendor, but I keep most of it for when I want to use it.
---
Agreed. I spend half my time now just collecting. Could make some of your money back from the purchased songs if the phonograph charged a cap for someone to select a song from your collection to play. Have some chairs sitting around it, sit back and enjoy the music.
---
And sitting there could be a temp stat perk (like playing an instrument or sleeping). Bring some civilization back to Appalachia! Let's get this dance party started!
---
What about that ghoul chair from 4
---
It’s not rigged, the pool is just entirely too large. This is especially true for players who already have “Good” legendaries. The odds of getting something better than what you already have become astronomical. 
---
If the endgame is going to revolve around a legendary slot machine, players need to feel like they win at the slot machine from time to time. It just doesn’t work that way. 
---
They need to do two things: 
---
1. Cull the garbage out of the legendary pool—If an effect is bugged, fix it or take it out. Garbage effects need to be yanked or changed—I’m looking at you, Stalker’s, Suppressor’s, Berserker’s and Nocturnal. 
---
2. Give players an option to spend more scrip to specialize their selection at least a bit more. If 100 gets a ranged weapon, let 250 get to pick from pistols, rifles, commando, energy, explosives, shotguns and heavy guns.
---
Well i was doin challenges now im done with most of em same boat as you i make bullets then get bored and do somethin else
---
Ah same here! The veterans are generally really lovely. If you ever see “Aengul” in your world add me. 15% bonus xp and a friendly camp awaits you! 
---
P.S. As soon as you have the equipment relocate to a higher level area. You will level up faster because your surroundings are all higher level as well. I tend to sweep through the 2-5 locations nearest to my base for basic supplies/legendaries/etc... Near Berkeley Springs Station is a good place to be once you hit Level 25-30.
---
Damn, I didn't remember about Cyberpunk release date.
---
It's about you, not me, Bethesda.
---
Yeah I think it should to he honest give someone else the chance to use it if someone else doesn’t want it
---
Thats a fairly good question some1 needs to reasearch this
---
There is none. Check if you have nuclear keycard, choose Alpha/Bravo/Charlie silo and do it. At the end go to nucacrypt.com and choose code of your silo. Enjoy after
---
I genuinely don't know what I'm looking at here.
---
There's a mod for this on Nexus, works well. It's called [Perk Loadout Manager](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/124).
---
I have sets for selling, different crafting types saved...
---
My first time launching a nuke was shortly after level 50. I was wondering the restrictions for nukes, so I tested if I could attempt a nuke on a camp. Button jammed, so it got launched at this level 20’s camp.
---
This , or bring back the ability of Recon scopes/mods to target cloaked players.
---
Lol, yup. I had an interesting one recently I think I was in the title screen.
---
 It was all black but I could see my hud and access the map (I think I was somewhere in flatwoods, can't remember exactly where) and the title music was playing.
---
Sorted itself out when I restarted.
---
Since I'm a bit of a noob to Fallout, I just searched for perk loadouts and found that this has been on everyone's (console players, at least) wish list since launch. I read that PC users immediately modded to get this ability, but consoles (I'm on Xbox) have to wait for the "official" update? What's up with that?
---
Ugh. Makes me think seriously about building that gaming PC I've always wanted and reboot my character on PC. Anyway, thanks again for pointing me to the correct posts. 
---
Cheers.
---
The bottom half is the part of FO4 where you would select which save slot you want to load. Shows character name, your level, lv25 in this case (for a lv3 character), and the area the character is in, "Wasteland".  
---
The top half is from the FO4 pipboy RGB selector, where you could change the RGB values and change the colour of your pipboy screen and torch colour.  
---
Over to the right, dunno, maybe an error about a dlc not being installed?
---
Usually a misconception of the turrets, well as I see it anyway.
---
If someone has destroyed the turrets previously on the server and that server has been active for a good while, the turrets never respawn until the server has been restarted, regardless of what silo you use.
---
Well, it's always been like that for me anyway.
---
the problem wouldnt be the orice if someone has them you could probably get them for 2-3 k caps 
---
your problem is that this isnt exactly an armor piece someone would carry around or put in his vending machine
---
i imagine most traders would immediatly scrip that piece unless they happen to remember you are searching for it 😬
---
You know how to mark Mats for search?
---
Yeah
---
The 'no content found' placeholder should have a screenshot of the saving spot I believe.
---
Natione Radio Astronomy Center.
---
All over the entire bunker, desk fans and clip boards all over the place....I usually go in through the service entrance and make my way down to the control room right below the Nuke area that is Enclave General only...if you hit the right server and nobody has looted it prior, you can easily pick up 5-6 deal fans and at least 5 clip boards
---
Dude looks like he's about to Naruto run away
---
Honestly, I don't think it's a good idea to mess commando/rifleman with PA. The whole idea of PA is to protect you against enemy attacks (tanking) or "cooperating" with heavy weapons for best effects. Commando/rifleman shines when used with sneaking or at least with heavy vats crits build. You should kill enemies before they'll be close enough to harm you, so PA not very useful here. I got two characters - one is heavy gunner with occasional use of PA, another is stealth rifleman, both bloodied/unyielding. I don't imagine myself combining those two...
---
Put this in the search box:
---
Where to farm: all the things
---
That will cover your junk question.
---
Legendary locations haven't changed too much but no star legendary have been mixed so none of those in Whitespring any more. There do seem to be more 3 stars in the world however. West Tek, whitespring, flooded train yard, sometimes Harper's Ferry, road from the More to Watoga, and certain events like Uranium Fever. Just go to where you enjoy playing.
---
Sweatshops would get a pile of kids addicted to meth and make them server hop vendors for three days straight looking for god rolls to sell on the internet for real money, and just replace them after they have heart attacks. 
---
Farming legendaries and being forced to actually play the game creates some kind of barrier for that activity, but you may as well fill the Ohio River with b/e guns if server hopping, a couple thousand caps and checking vendor inventories is the only requirement to acquire a god roll weapon.
---
Yes, duping and cheating already exists, but why make it 100x easier?
---
Sometimes i get the intro home screen fo4 music when im logging into 76. Maybe everyone does?
---
Then go play any of the other fucking Fallout’s if you don’t like it
---
On my level 25 character yesterday i was near Devils Backbone and a cargobot, 10 lvl 68 super mutants and a scorchbeast were clashing, i only died about 6 times
---
No. They are paying $20 for atoms and buying whatever they want with them. 
---
Personally I am able to earn thousands of atoms and have no issues buying what I want from the shop. Some people are just impatient or
---
Impulsive and cannot wait and therefore is cash for atoms.
---
250 is really good. Don't think anything else's gonna beat that. Explosive heavy weapons like missile launchers or fatmans seem to have really good range as well but I don't think that's what you're asking
---
Its not healing them. Their health indicator is just bugged, so they "heal" back to the level it should be. 
---
I see it happening with shotguns alot, namely with explosive or instigating ones.
---
Jackpot, it's been nearly a day since I last played 4 and I had a complete blank.
---
It swings much slower if you are playing in 3rd person. And yes it was like that since fallout 4. what a surprise
---
Yeah just did that ty man
---
I needed this too thank you
---
I’m not really big on pvp, but getting grouped up with randos is definitely not a selling point for NW. If my two pals are on that enjoy NW, I’ll play with them. If not, I’d rather do my thing in adventure. I don’t know if the option to go solo would help much, but it wouldn’t hurt. Most strangers are cool, but it really sucks when you get stuck with a loudmouth or someone that’s a 10 in confidence and a 2 in skill.
---
Not being headshot from across town while I’m stutter stepping from cover to cover by some guy with miraculous aim would be even better.
---
Bro it be internet get over uself warth proparn puncuTion also i dont use autocorrect maybe i should start

---
In every other game you can find and use several of the strongest weapons in the game at level 1 or just above if you know where to look for them. yes regular enemies won't drop really good shit until your level up but stuff that is just lying around or quest rewards are all aces to use from jump.
---
Gatling gun. It's basically a sniper rifle disguised as a heavy weapon. It hits harder than pistol on far range and as much as a rifle without the luxury of a scope for precision aiming. Off course it has a dip in damage, but hitting headshots from afar makes up for it, also it is satisfying.
---
You’re retaining quite a few quality of life perks like bandolier and batteries included - if you go down the rifleman route you won't need so much ammo and so those perk points could be reinvested...
---
....Not into strength and intelligence though - agility and luck will be more useful to a rifle build. An intelligence of 3-5 will cover most needs (need rage for bloodied builds and perhaps a level or two of explosive expert. Strength need be no more than 2-3, ideally a little less as it does nothing for rifle builds - there's a perk that helps against melee hits that you should use to make yourself a little tanky when caught by surprise. Otherwise spend the points elsewhere.
---
Make the change above and you'll have 13+ in each agility and luck which can be invested well. Agility should include all the stealth perks (stealth, covert ops, etc) plus adrenaline and/or dodgy (added to your action boy). Luck can have things like bloody mess, better criticals, Serendipity (if bloodied), and perhaps starched genes and class freak so you can properly use mutations
---
Double drop rates of items needed to make stable flux/yellowcake etc.
---
More hardened mass etc. dropped by enemies.
---
Or just learn the difference between there, their and they’re.
---
Yeah bare minimum each factions vendor bots should sell at least one static legendary weapon and armor piece, preferably a full armor set that complements a play style related to that faction but without being stupid poo poo OP to prevent just using those and nothing else. 
---
Like none of it is over one star would be a good compromise i think, that way no one is 100% beholden to random luck to get at least something kinda good but also none of it will compare to true endgame god rolls.
---
I honestly dindnt think it was that big of a deal
---
No. People just like to whine.
---
I'm gonna say none of this happened and you're a lonely troll. I PvP all the time but this is just sad.
---
It’s so awesome right! The mothman I love him too as it’s more rare encounter but not as rare as this guy, these flat woods monsters after level 50 they die like instantly though, I remember a solid 5 min fight with it when I was level 20 trying to hold my own that was awesome itself
---
This, I'm really surprise how far it can shoot with nice VATS accuracy and good vats costs. I use BE90 version and still can vats-kill most of Distant Thunder mobs on one AP bar for far enough to be safe. It can also hit SBQ when she emerge from fissure site standing on top of Drop Site V9.
---
Yeah this guy on the earlier sightings that what happened for me, you see a glimpse of him for a split second and then he teleports away, I thought I was going crazy when it first started happening! Then I got the side quest and happened 2-3 more times before I got to fight him, I think it’s like mothman (most the time) where you need to kill them fast and not startle them or they just disappear
---
Man this is exactly what the flatwoods monster reminds me of! It’s such a good memory that first encounter with the fo4 alien, I wish we had dialogue in this game and could’ve conversed with it during the first side quest sighting though :/
---
Hm, I do use several Gatlings specifically for long distance sniping, but in PvP situation that 204 range still wreaks havoc on dmg output. Yesterday, when battling over steel factory, my primed EE gatling would only tickle a cheeky SentAss, while he kept denting my HP with explo laser - from very, very afar.
---
Lol. You spelled two different words exactly the same and neither of them were correct
---
When I first ever had it at a low level I can’t remember how it triggered but I think it was just being in the general area of it you see glimpse moments of him(1 second then he teleports away like mothman) he does that a few times before you fight it but after the first sighting I recall the quest triggering
---
Forgot to mention, I was asking specifically in terms of PvP. Some auto rifles are capable beyond 250, HWs - not so much.
---
Started it a few times myself yesterday. Seems to be working.
---
I and I would believe nearly everyone fast travel a lot, with all the different places you need to go for some side quests/dailies/events it takes a long time. But my first play through in fallouts i usually spend a large portion only walking so I discover everything and side stuff
---
300 is like 200, except your back hurts and your knees crack when you go into stealth mode.
---
Done twice today
---
Really youve never been slightly curious what a ghoul smells like
---
Well you have the answer in your comment. Sentinel assassin with explosive laser rifle. No heavy gun can do more but a tickle him from far range. While they can snipe you with that buggy legacy weapon.
---
I realy wonder what a ghoul or deathclaw would smell like.
---
Yep been bugged for a while
---
I had regular encounters with the mothman before and I always love it. Now that I'm not dying so fast any more I take the opportunity to make nice pictures of these encounters (espacially of the special effect during their attacks) . But with the Faltwood monster I was really desperate as I thought I would never meet him and now it was twice in a row.
---
The "fallout 76 news" panel is sending me.
---
They could solve this shit forever by just making it so instead of random challenges that drop atoms, atoms in various amounts can be earned as quest/event rewards with a few tiers of drops that are on a cool down per player. 
---
For example completing the end game boss fights could drop like 20 atoms (i don't know if this is too little or too much but whatever is balanced) but only allow anyone to get that drop once every few days, then have the same with every event in the game with easier events dropping less atoms. 
---
That way everyone will want to do every event at least sometimes instead of what we have now where half the events in the game no one gives a shit about.
---
That's a good rule to go by. Just treat others how you want to be treated
---
I’m wasted on so many chems I forget to wear armor
---
Ive just finished a heavy combat, vanguard set
---
I tried bloodied, but not being at full health drove me nuts
---
I have never done surface to Air before.... I tend to avoid Bog events lol. What happens during it?
---
I don't VATS, strictly fpv/ads. Anway, harpoon took care of that. It's just that I thought I was missing some clue, but alas, heavies are very peculiar.
---
24 scrip x 20 caps so 480 caps

The bug has been around since launch. They’ve tried to fix it a couple times, but it just won’t go away. That and the audio loop on automatic weapons seem to be difficult problems to solve. They’ve proudly announced both have been fixed in a few different patch notes, but here we are.
---
I’m no programmer, so maybe our complaints are  the equivalent of one of my clients asking why I can’t repaint the Sistine Chapel ceiling in their foyer with a budget of 2k and a 72 hour deadline.
---
Why are you using so many screws?
---
And once you know it, you wish you could forget it again.
---
Was this in Xbox? Scripped that same Shotgun yesterday
---
Having the opportunity to _choose_ a faction yourself would be nice, although it might end up limiting the number of people playing the match, if too many try to play the same faction(s) while neglecting the others. Possible workarounds to maintain an initial balance however, might be that the specific scenario would change (if there were multiple scenarios), or that the underdog group would have access to somewhat "better" gear.
---
They could still keep lootable cases scattered around the map as they are currently. And while these locations would be memorized over time (as they are even now), the faction of the container could be randomized so that it can only be accessed by a particular faction, and the number of containers overall could be increased somewhat, in order to make up for the division of cases between all the factions. Numerically "weaker" factions would always enjoy some sort of a bonus, either by an increase in experience earned, or having more cases made available for that faction and/or a higher tier of gear in those same cases.
---
Power Armor for numerically weaker  factions, might also come equipped with jetpacks, whereas stronger factions have PA without them (and this would prove advantageous, even if you already had the "frog legs" perk card, as jetpacks would allow you to reach even higher locations than by jumping, alone). Other PA additions might be built-in stealthboy or other mods.
---
Axe body spray mostly...
---
It takes the fun out of everything, why would you play a game if there was no reason to play and use one of the main aspects
---
This. Sharing rad sponge and ghoulish is huge
---
What an inspiring story of willpower and tenacity.
---
You should get it published and do motivational speeches.
---
The stack itself whether its the particle effects or damage is completely irrelevant the fact is it crashes the game. Its also completely  broken as there is no counter to it ive had friends test the legendary armour effects it doesnt help one bit, you die instantly just by being clipped by a legacy weapon. With base legacy weapons you can survive a good few rounds and even dodge shots but if you just get clipped by stangler acid you are 100 to 0 in 1/4 of a second
---
If you deny that it crashes the game  as ive seen it with my own eyes or its balanced you are legit delusional. You say you have the armour but I’m starting to doubt that considering how little you know about it
---
If I have to pay for a server in which I cant mod or anything, it better save to public servers. Otherwise, what is the point or incentive to rent one?
---
Vanguard/Sentinel with maybe a couple additional rad reduction effects. Powered effects are good if you use vats a lot.  Poisoner is really useful for PvE, as well. A couple poison reducing pieces will remove any danger from standing in mirelurk queen acid, and hunter spit goes from deadly to mildly annoying.
---
What is the incentive to need one anyways?
---
Damn, you missed out on a wing and a hand grenade. God tier loot.
---
Its mainly for people who want a controlled environment I suppose for a group of friends with (hopefully) little to no lag.
---
Lol. Sorry you had bad luck. Def not rigged. I was pulling down bloodied combat rifles, anti armor other exploding handmades, etc
---
When there are other bugs: i sleep
---
When there are Atom $hop bugs: **real shit?**
---
Was the survival server like that? Where u could transfer between? Never played just wondering
---
What the hell does Todd have to do with anything? The sale started at a certain hour a few days ago, and ended at the same time yesterday.
---
I too lost the last day because the scrip Machine didn't refill until a few minutes after the sale ended, but you don't see me screaming on the internet against someone who probably hasn't coded anything in decades.
---
Calm down, and next time do some research.
---
It’s too bad you can’t have a berserkers junkie weapon.  BGS needs to be more accepting of alternative lifestyle choices. Nudist psycho fiends, your day will come.
---
They didn't even outsource the helmet, it was fully a GameStop item that Bethesda had no involvement in that *GameStop* had outsourced. Which makes it all the dumber that Bethesda got shit for it.
---
Your advice is very misleading/wrong.
---
TS is not good at all in general, regardless of weapon.
---
Shotguns still do +25% like every other TS, it just visually only adds an extra projectile.
---
TS is trash in general, shotguns get the same benefit from TS as others do. Don't listen to that comment.
---
1. Stability, lower lag, lower latency 
---
2. No PvP for the food builds (not myself) 
---
3. Uncontested control of every workshop
---
4. Controlled level scaling unaffected by others
---
5. Ability to get a full lobby of friends to farm hard events for rare plans such as stimpack diffuser, bear arm, fixer, formula P, and all raid gear.
---
Sorry chief, you wasted scrip there. Don't lose hope though, there are still sometimes good weapons in there.
---
It's a joke about the 2 dumbest possible ways to correct a minor inconvenience. However if you want to go all SJW-tastic and claim it's about spousal abuse have fun. I got you virtue signal activated 😂
---
I don't want to be that guy but that's not what OCD is. People actually suffer from that so that's kinda insensitive, man.
---
Assassin sentinal because I like my PvP
---
Lmao. You're friends must be terrible. I use a BE gatling plasma and stranlger heart PA and my friends can last at least 50 shots from it. The armor can crash the game but only if you ho buckwild and shoot non stop with a crazy rate of fire weapon on the queen or something. You have no clue what your talking about as every claim you've made is demonstrateably false.
---
Yes
---
As a guy who has over 7000 hours in the Fallout franchise i can very safely and confidently say that none of the fun is ruined in any of the games by rushing for endgame level gear early on. 
---
The fun of Fallout has always been about the quests, characters, choices, the little hidden stories you just have to pick up on without being prompted by any quest marker. the raw gear progression is part of the fun yeah but part of the freedom of Bethesda RPGs is being able to use your knowledge of the game world and its systems to tell the normal progress path to fuck itself and die, because i know how to skip to the endgame at level three.  
---
Hell my standard play through of 4 is to leave the tutorial and run straight to Nuka World at level 1 to both challenge myself with the most difficult content in the game early but also get the best weapons as soon as possible and it is always a blast. 
---
Seriously ask yourself, is the game actually more fun because of you being literally forced to grind just to use random stuff you find lying around? or is that just a completely artificial way the devs have extended playtime due to the game not actually having much content to keep players coming back?
---
Jokes about domestic abuse aren't as funny as you may think
---
U can but u will never be effective as s heavy gunnner in pa or a stealth commando
---
If only they’d done that with the base game.
---
We all know it’ll be a buggy mess regardless.
---
Huntersville, West Tek and every location with super mutants. Whitespring and other places full of ghouls.  
---
AWOL Event.
---
There is a excel sheet floating around that tells u the best places and even breaks down how much at each location. Just search farming guide or something like that
---
People at workshops
---
They aren’t small, they definitely count and they LITERALLY promised that.
---
Stable flux is 1 pound each. You must have a weight reduction on your player, it does not effect the weight in stash.
---
Well i would buy a private server if we can transfer just for the fact that i could farm the hell out of it with no worries. I guess we will see today or tomorrow?
---
Lower ping and latency is based on server location not amount of people on it. 
---
Pvp is piss easy to avoid.
---
You don't really need every workshop
---
The rest seem to dictate that private will be a seperate chacters from offical.
---
Any weight reduction perks you have on your character are not applied to your stash
---
You don’t have to give a shit. You’re still a liar. I don’t like liars.
---
Everheard of perks and armor effects and they are not applied to the items in the stash
---
Well, today technically
---
Again, not about domestic abuse. But if you're running around looking to be offended you will be.
---
There are perks that reduce the weight of certain items (heavy weapons,junk,ammo,...) that apply to your inventory only.Once you drop them or deposit them in your stash they weight their full amount.So you might have a 20p minigun that thanks to a perk weights only 14p while you have it in your inventory.Once you store it in your stash it gets back to 20p.
---
"It's either hit your fiance in the head with a brick."
---
Jokes about domestic abuse aren't as funnyman you may think
---
Yeah I have the quest unlocked I just didn’t pay much attention to the storyline
---
I've done the same. Thier camps are also themed, my favourite is my free states town and my raider Road block.
---
YES THATS THE POINT OF PLAYING BETHESDA GAMES! You might like it because you don't have the time to play, but someone, like me, has a lot more time to play than you, I hate when I start a game and am basically given the most OP weapon in the gane because it isn't fun anymore
---
The server location is only one part. Connections to host server, location of connections, actions being tracked, items being tracked, damages, status effects, and visuals like shadow behavior all play a factor in server stability. We'll see later today but I'd bet my bottom dollar your wrong.
---
I've just come back and respawned as a noob. A 125 came by the overseers camp, made a bunch of stuff for me and escorted me into Flatwoods, pointing out stash and trash and taking care of the supervisors so we could do fertile soil and share the rewards.
---
So crazy they are keeping hush hush about price and rules. Thanks
---
Wouldn't use one unless you had invested in perception. 
---
I have a laser and plasma on my rifle and commando characters. They're powerful but are realistically outperformed by ballistic weapons.
---
Yes hitting someone in the head with a brick is the dumbest possible way to correct this situation. Doesn't matter is it's a friend, brother, sister, stranger or possibly a squirrel .
---
Buying another X-box is also rather dumb though as I said if OP has the money to do so at least they can play together which would be nice.
---
The price will have to be released today.
---
Up to you really
---
300 is great. I’m 422 now. 400 is just having to explain to everyone how I’ve played this game way too much. It’s like “yes, I know. I have no life. No, I’m not any stronger than a level 90 person.” Lol
---
I would think right, if its like 10.00 a month im in not a bad price i would think
---
That's a fair price but I think it'll be 20 or 30 a month because bethesdas atom shop prices are so outrageous already
---
I’ve see it all the time.
---
Lol yeah right, well for that price i better be able to transfer between public and private if not than not worth it to me at least.
---
My experiences it is server location and how your connection is routed to it that matter most. The second part is somewhat out of your control.
---
Spears are bugged I think.My knife works just fine,same as any other weapon I used.
---
Okay that is completely fine for you to play that way, even with this system the only ways any low level player is gonna get the highest tier shit in the game from jump is if a high level player just gives it to them, or they they know where it spawns and just sprint straight there and into danger to try and get it.  
---
Its not like TSE .50 cals spawn in the forest man. you can follow the intended progression path and people like me who are either just starting an alt to try a new build or whatever can actually take advantage of our skill and knowledge of how the game works to give ourselves an advantage. 
---
The game is not harmed in any way by removing literal forced grinding and tedium from just one part of the experience, even if you found an amazing high tier gun at level 1 you still wouldn't be able to mod it basically at all until you level up a bunch, or take care of it properly until you built up a stock of rare resources, or even barring all of that be able to do even half the damage of any high level player since you would completely lack any of the buff perks or utility perks in the game.
---
I'd it's not transferable they wont sell very many
---
True
---
Thats what i was thinking, ive talked with a few players on here and they feel the same way, not worth it.
---
I'm literally an IT system administrator and do this for a living my guy. It's not just server location. The second part wouldn't be out of your control with a private server which was my point.
---
I think the claim is true but the data is skewed. Many people including me have "bought" repair kits just because they came with the outfit and 1500 atom bundles. I didn't want the repair kits, I just wanted the other stuff in the bundle.
---
Just because they dont have perks doesnt mean the weapon wouldnt be strong, i had no 2 handed perks and my all rise did 250 damage
---
Yep. I just want a stable farming server
---
Skyrim's release on Xbox wasn't awful. Bethesda games are always worse on Sony platforms. Even though that makes no sense this gen since the hardware is so much more familiar it is nonetheless true. FO4, Skyrim Definitive, and even 76 all perform worse and have more issues on PS4. Its kind of weird, I expected that to stop this gen but it hasn't.
---
I used to think that, too. But with the right equipment and perks, it's not bad at all. You just have to be mindful of jerks who try to blow up vehicles you're near, so the explosion will injure/kill you (which is why I'm generally sneaking all the time, and have some Chameleon gear to reduce my visibility to dick players).
---
It's exhausting how people are so pc these days, and every little thing sets someone off.
---
I find it beautiful for introverts to not wan socialize with ppl only to be gamers who spends hours talking to NPCs 😂😂
---
It’s a personal opinion on whether or not someone likes that game, mainly because it’s so different from the previous games with the perk cards and the legendaries I personally would recommend having some friends to play the game with because solo is not as fun since the game was made for co op
---
I mean if it does it'll kill the following aspects of the game
---
1. bobblehead/magazine collecting, selling
---
2. tank the prices of fusion cores
---
3. ammo will worth practically nothing
---
4. rare spawn collecting, selling (asylum uniforms for example)
---
5. plan selling scene will tank
---
6. because of guaranteed 3\* boss events (horde, UF, AWOL comes to mind) 3\* scene will suffer
---
7. and more
---
I mean if they carry over I'd be really, really surprised. **They HAVE to cancel workshops at least tho if its gonna be carried over.** I could spend maybe 5 hours tops to have a supply of fusion cores, 556, acid, food etc that would last me for a really long fucking time.
---
Ooh, I like that idea. I'll have to go check some bridges out.
---
Claiming that you're OCD is no different than claiming "I'm so awkward I'd may as well be autistic."
---
There's a time and a place for everything. The offensive shit I say or do around friends or some family to joke around can be messed up. That doesn't mean I should just act that way in a public forum.
---
Stop complaining just because someone want to be respectful of what people go through.
---
I have a Vamp Plasma Gatling, Vamp Handmade and a Vamp 50 cal, when it comes to spraying mobs and SBQ nothing better!!
---
Just walk around a nursing home, I reckon they'd smell a bit like that.
---
That is a problem that I have were none of my friends are interested in Fallout in general
---
RNG my friend. I have gotten some nice drops. 2-3☆ IE combat shotguns. An Executioners Explosive Assault rifle along with numerous Junkies and bloodied weapons.
---
Sometimes the RNG gods love you othertimes not so much.
---
golden question; will it cost to join servers, not host one?
---
No way
---
Everyone seems to be IT now a days when the conversation comes up.  Seems like 90% of people are IT.
---
Ok then IT why is it that I have suffered 0 server crashes in months. While other people can't seem to play for more then 2 hours without a crash?  What some how makes me special despite only having internet speeds of 2mbps down and 400kbps up?
---
How do u feel the public market would react to a flood of resources. Really if i was unhindered in taking all the workshops the resources i could collect including world resources would be astronomical. Not to mention farming events. Personally i feel the market would see prices fall dramatically. Look at serums now, u can sell to a vendor bot for 500 but players sell for 150 to 450, i believe this is do to the number of players who have the recipes is much greater now. Im not an economist so not sure why else would anyone sell for less than they can sell to a vendor bot. I do understand max caps suck but i don't believe thete is a limit to 556 except weight. What do u think?
---
wanna bet? i feel like it will cost some money
---
Holy fucking shit, that weapon comes from an endgame area and quest and if anyone who succeeds at doing that quest at any level gets the same weapon then they all have earned the right to use that weapon. 
---
Why does that piss you off? seriously how are you affected in any way at all by people who want to and know how being able to fast track to the endgame just like they could in every other entry in the entire franchise? 
---
If you do not want to skip the normal gear progression then don't do it, but it does not harm you at all to get our of the way of other people who want to do that.
---
I couldn't say because I have 0 information about you, you're connection, your location, the servers you connect to, what's happening in the servers you are using. Call me a liar if you like but it doesn't change the facts. Seems like you're mad that you got called out on your BS though honestly.
---
I'll bet you 10k caps if you're on xbox that joining doesn't but hosting does.
---
A level one should not have an endgame weapon! Im not gonna sit here argueing with you because no matter what I say you are opinionated to saying that! I cant get it through to your brain its not possible.
---
I played at beta/on reclamation day and it was okay I'd have kept playing but a big update came out and it would no longer run on my pc, a couple of weeks ago I got a new gpu and I've been playing it constantly, I love it it's much better than it was although there are still some issues. I'm in a similar boat as you I love fallout I've played  the obsidian games but I love fallout 3/4 I've complete both multiple times on different platforms and fo76 hasn't taken anything away I really like it and even though they're delivered through holotapes mostly the stories are really good
---
its the same as 3/4 but different. no easy way to discribe or compare with the other fallouts. But if you already have it, then, go play it. As with 3/4, you make your own choices. I'm still playing close on a year since general release.
---
OMG thanks for the morning chuckle,  so effin funny thanks
---
You act like there is no way to balance that stuff
---
I can see the appeal to play with others, I'm personally really enjoying it solo, occasionally you'll have to team with someone to complete a teammate challenge, I actually love the feeling of playing it solo I'm in my own wee world then all of a sudden I bump nto a real player, to me it really makes it feel like a wasteland
---
That’s awesome. Good job!
---
Im not saying there isnt it does concern me tho. I really do hope there is because i really enjoy the market to me it whats makes my game fun. So i really do hope so
---
Everything starts and ends at around noon eastern time. It is what it is.
---
very well written story, what an ending
---
DUDE I'd totally take that bet if you were on ps4, you seem like a cool dude!
---
but I wouldn't risk 10k tho but definitely 5. They have been oddly silent this week and oh boy wording on that last ITV article was sure suspicious.
---
I think it will carry over and none of that is a really big concern
---
I have several - quad Fletchettes harpoon fun, quad railway rifle, and quad Tesla rifle.  The harpoon does silly damage and the railway is just such a fun weapon.
---
How about showing us what level someone’s camp is when we scroll over it so we don’t rock up at some level 20s camp which says they have armour but are actually selling overpriced rags.
---
If it doesn't carry over they wont sell very many and Bethesda cares more about money than anything else with this title at least so I'm confident it will.
---
I'd bet it'll transfer if you don't use mods kind of like fallout 4 mods regarding achievements
---
minecraft lets us host private servers. dont pull this we cant possibly run this on our own server crap. ea pulled that with sim city 5 and was obviously bs. heres whats going to happen people will just pull the files them selves and make unofficial servers. we already paid for the game like minecraft and we can choose to have official servers, hosted 3rd party servers and private servers at home.
---
I first read "pornography"...
---
Just stay away from workshops.
---
uh i can host a server for minecraft for free wtf you on.
---
You can hear the Flatwoods Monster long before seeing him; it's a strange whirring "alien-like" (obviously) sound, sort of like from the old-time SciFi movies of UFO's.
---
 Just follow the sound, sneaking along so that when you do find it that it doesn't run off (or, it may attack you, too, depending on its level). Also, you may have to follow it once you find it, as they don't remain stationary all the time. I found one before, only to have it move a good distance on the map (several fast travel hops), only to stop near a crashed satellite.
---
Every time I kill one, I snap a photo to highlight it's location. That way it's in my gallery for future reference (in case there's another Atom challenge for it).
---
You don’t need it but for optimizing the build it’s worth using if your 100 percent meele, makes a difference against super mutants and heavy armored stuff
---
You can't get it through to my brain because you are wrong, if level one players getting endgame gear was an actual problem then why does basically no one ever complain about everyone being able to do that in every other game in the franchise? 
---
Seriously man the only thing you have said at all is variations of "low level players should not be able to use high powered gear." 
---
But you have yet to explain why that is true or how the actual game is harmed for everyone by people being able to use whatever they can get their hands on. 
---
PVP won't be affected since everyone would still have access to the same gear as everyone else. PVE won't be affected negatively for other people either since right now low level players with shitty gear are nothing more than a nuisance in high level events and them having access to better stuff would only help the events clear faster. 
---
Please honestly explain a single rational scenario where a low level player with a good gun would make the game worse for anyone who is not that person who chose to use it.
---
I litterally just asked the fallout discord im in and everyone disagreed with you
---
then give us the server files and make characters not offical characters. otherwise we will do what we done for other mmos we grab the files ourselves and make our own. easy or hard way up to bethesda
---
they at least have to disable workshops man
---
If you have had this game sitting unopened for that long then No. You dont have what it takes to play this game. This game is for grinders and for those with the drive to WANT to play it.
---
give us the option to have server files so we can host our own unconnected servers. or we will just get the files ourselves and do it bethesds.
---
So you know all this information.  Bit you seem incapable of explaining why I deal with no server crashes and low latency? But you know for a fact private servers will fix all this?
---
I’m thinking about being a hybrid melee/heavy just because of scorchbeasts and stuff. Maybe 1 in each slugger 1 in each heavy weapon 3 in martial artist and 3 in blocker but i’m wondering if i’m better of putting those last 3 into incisor or just committing fully to melee.
---
Doesn't sound like much of a "challenge" when it's something already tailored to you.
---
I check vending machines first if they have any, if they have a bunch of garbage i will drop stims, radaway, disease cure and a few other health items. Vending machines are always a good indicator. My best story is when i went to a camp and right off the bat a young man greeted me, very polite i bought all his junk dropped it on the ground along with a bunch other stuff and he thanked me a great deal. That to me is what it is all about. So for me even if it only happens once its those moments that make me give to lower level players.
---
SO FUCKING EXPLAIN THE COUNTER ARGUMENT PLEASE! 
---
God its like pulling teeth with this, the only thing i am asking for is a single scenario where it would be bad but you refuse to provide one most likely because one doesn't exist and you know damn well know you are wrong.
---
OK, so from that response I'm thinking you are trying to be funny / rude.
---
If you don't want an actual conversation, fair enough but there is no real need for the sarcasm. I provided a link to the main site, where they only refer to them as updates. 
---
Can you provide me some links please? I have honestly looked and cannot find any official mention of DLCs
---
I know that when they revealed at E3 they said it would only get free updates, they didn't want to do DLC because it would split the player base.
---
Quad or at least TS is a pure pvp gun. Your radiation damage dealt by gamma, not direct is useful. Quad gamma with painted strangler heart PA is a huge surprise for griefers who thing that PA player is an easy prey.
---
Isn't that, Illegal?
---
I read this as ISIS fire axe
---
Thanks
---
And now i am done with this, you do not have any valid arguments or if you do you refuse to provide them, and have devolved into petty insults like a whiny child who knows they lost.
---
i have downgraded to just look if anything is new on the atomshop, look at it and then do the same as you turn off the game.
---
not good enough if they don't disable workshops and valuable collectibles
---
New video is up!   
---
[https://youtu.be/xpi2BrqhuBU](https://youtu.be/xpi2BrqhuBU)
---
yes support a dev breaking a promise we agreed to that they removed publically. i cant wait for the class action lawsuit for breach of contract.
---
I just wanted factions to actually be a thing and meaningful (like if I join BoS, I shouldn't just be able to walk into the whitespring bunker, consequences ya know?)  
---
But who am I kidding, they can't even add simple stuff like enclave skins and backpacks, let alone create a proper consequential faction system.  
---
It'll be "raiders" or "settlers", and the only point at which you'll actually see the 'impact' of your choice will be in quest dialogue. Woop dee fucking doo.
---
You won't regret that gaming PC! Unless you play Nuclear Winter, maybe.
---
I agree! Them low lvls need some support :)   
---
Btw, new video is up!  
---
 [https://youtu.be/xpi2BrqhuBU](https://youtu.be/xpi2BrqhuBU)
---
No thanks.
---
I leave one unlocked exactly for low levels to take if necessary.
---
I havet played in close to a month and it sad to say that nothing has changed. rip fo76
---
Hey man, ty so much! :)   
---
Check out the new video!  
---
Congrats! I hit level 200 a few weeks ago myself.
---
I think I hit 206 a couple of days ago.
---
Radiation would have nicely sterilised everything so it would probably smell okay.
---
The wild lands around Chernobyl havr a big problem with old dead plants not decomposing and just kind of layering up.
---
I’d rather then delay the dlc for an entire year to fix the entire game it’s still Bare even a year after launch and still as buggy and broken the game needs a complete overhaul and Bethesda needs a reality check for how shady and scummy they are becoming
---
I'M SO GLAD YOU UPDATED US ON THIS KILLER DEAL! WHAT WOULD I DO WITHOUT THOSE AMAZING KITS! GONNA GO WASTE ALL MY ATOMS ON THOSE BABIEZ!
---
I keep all 6 of mine unlocked for ppl to take what they need
---
Most likely if we get admin rights, it will be a 1 way trip for our characters
---
If it's a 1 way trip, well, make this game f2p because it will kill this game
---
Folks usually leave some unlocked just for the passing travel to quench their thirst.
---
Just nope.
---
Nope. The first picture is my lvl 201 [https://imgur.com/rLFs8yr](https://imgur.com/rLFs8yr) and this is my lvl 3 [https://imgur.com/xMzDRIh](https://imgur.com/xMzDRIh) the only challenges are the ones not check marked off. I have 4 more toons, that are the same way.
---
What platform are you on?
---
if its not locked then it a fair game. I know mines always stay open.
---
Not a public event, but it’s on a timer and I believe that if there’s another event nearby I don’t think it will start up.
---
To me it's a double-edged blade. 
---
 If you don't make it a one way trip and are able to go back-and-forth between private and public it will kill this game as well.
---
read the terminals and listen to holotapes. If you do not, you miss the story completely and the game will feel flat.
---
I have a Vamps Tesla with limb damage it's a fun gun I can cripple a room of ghouls in a few shots
---
I got couch and above it on the wall neon sign "AFK" - when I sit there means I'm AFK... As for billboards - you can buy them from shop and write anything you want.
---
Berserkers u can wear broken armor and still have 0 Dr and legendary effects
---
But why do you want to go from a private server to a public one? Is it to farm and grind without competition so that it can be brought over to public to sell?

If I can pay money to have the opportunity for farm more creatures, farm rare items without competition, and then go back and mingle with the non-paying players, isn't that P2W in a way?
---
Nah, I hope they don't. I want to take each workshop and turn them into little towns. If they allowed survival to carry over they'll probably allow private to carry over
---
Is it a bug or something?
---
Come on by my place and get up to 30 water for free.   You can even use my machinery - just don’t track any mud in.  🙂
---
I think i got my plans when I captured a few farms / points.  Was that just random luck?
---
(of course nowadays that’s a dangerous proposition...)
---
\+1
---
What system are you on?
---
Can you just imagine being in the Cranberry Bog, trying to kill the queen and everyone starts puking? Smell-O-Vision can stay non existent.
---
But it started at noon Eastern time.
---
One would think it would end at the same time on a different day.
---
You were probably in the workshop area which is a pvp zone
---
Yes... yes you did. I love this
---
You can solo the main questslines.  
---
There are a several events where other players in the vicinity helps, but you do not have to be formally "teamed" to completed the event.
---
I'm waiting for the [Feel-Around](https://youtu.be/TCq_nzlou0Q?t=1m43s) that is coming out I think it would be pretty neat...with the right help
---
If you enter a workshop area prepare to be killed. It does warn you that you’re entering a pvp area.
---
just wondering why ah T-45 lvl 25 and not a excavator lvl 25. I would guess you would benefit from the +100 carry weight that the defense the t-45 would give you.
---
I would love the legendary hazmat suit idea, or maybe a challenge where the reward is an armored hazmat suit but maybe only offers 500 rad resistance but you can upgrade the armor on it to make it a viable option at least!
---
To be fair, the Enclave was doing fine surviving the mess (they themselves) created. It only turned to shit because a large portion of their soldiers suddenly decided to do "the right thing". And got everyone killed as a result.
---
laughed at"mentally healthy"
---
Yea mods would be useful too, wanted to add that to the post but forgot lol
---
I’m always temped to be that guy. Poor impulse control isn’t the same as ocd.
---
Two days ago i locked down 2 power plant workshops for 2 hours while questing etc. i don't think i'll need cores for another month or two, not counting all the acid, steel, nuclear waste i got as well.
---
If they are open they are happy for you to take them., well i am any way.
---
Had this exact thing happen too. Drives me crazy
---
I do like to PvP but admit a 115 killing a 17 is pretty lame.  But I feel the same about people and their cheese cannons (Tesla and explosive lasers anyone)? 
---
People need their PvP fix.  I’m game like 95% of the time.
---
HAHAHAHAHHA!!
---
I did not expect that ending.
---
Happens with Scorchbeasts bodies, too.  
---
Really fun when you have multiples dropping around you.
---
This is the question.
---
Just last night I messed around with the T-45 I had in my Stash, the repair costs are surprisingly high, the protection low. I could not work out a reason as to why you would chose a suit of T-45 over any other suit.
---
OP
---
I suggest you get yourself a suit of Excavator armour, that you do you well until you are of a level where you can wear the better suits (45+). Where you will be gifted a suit of Ultracite (Very good but tough repair costs) for finishing the BoS quest line, or X-01 for the Enclave quest line (Hell, finish Roses quests and you'll get a suit of Raider)
---
I level alts all the time (I have one that I delete and remake just to hang out around low level spots) and sometimes I just don't have the heart to tell someone im not a noob. They just seem to feel so good about giving goodie bags and helping me out so I graciously thank them for baggies. Hey they still help at low levels! But I would never lead someone on like that, that's shameless haha.
---
My purifiers and junk bot are always open.  Same thing with my camp.  Take what you want but please leave the toilet seat down. 
---
Yesterday I went to a camp and heard some guy laughing hysterically.  I get closer and in neon letters it said “legit stuff” and saw 10,000 stimpaks, 8000 nuka colas, etc.  The owner was really cool and we chatted it up but I could not stop laughing myself!
---
Yeah, you're _really_ respectful when you already admit that you say "messed up offensive shit". Do everyone a favor and do your virtue signalling somewhere else.
---
There is a glitch with scorched animals where even if they are tamed they still attack everything. I saw a similar post a while ago. Your best bet is to just wait till they fix it or get another one
---
Just dont vacuum clean the place, if you dont need it dont take it.
---
I do. Sometimes it doesn't work as well as it should, but I'm sure I could borrow husband's. 👍
---
They'd need to improve the entire fucking mode. Right now, there's an incel on European servers who plays every hour of the day, and is in every single match (unless you just died to him) and generally everyone *knows* he's cheating. European players will know who I'm talking about after I say this: level 300+.
---
He clairvoyantly knows where to go, even if it's pretty much impossible to know where you are.
---
I think this little loser has a superiority complex. There's no other way to explain it. His former/current teammates seem to have contracted Stockholm syndrome, as they just mindlessly defend him.
---
So they need to start by weeding out the cheating trash, or adding anticheat to begin with. Literally anything works, even FairFight, despite being a famously trash anticheat.
---
 I bearly use PA and when I do is mainly EX PA for the weigth, anyways thanks for the info I didnt knew about the T60 been cheaper.
---
Sweet next time I'm in game I'll add you
---
Nah Playstation and first time it’s happened to me :p
---
definetly got a timer. I powered up one plant just yesterday to get the windmill plan, there's ~40 minutes. You could have experianced quest not showing on you screenfor some reason. No need for salt here
---
up to level 50 yes.
---
Yes but a last minute delay would mean days if not a week before the announced release.  Mid October is not a last minute delay for an update that was originally scheduled for November.
---
Happens due to bug when someone scraps something, whats stupid is isn't a feature that we can trade in scrip for items players scriped. Previous players would head to vendors to buy legendaries others got then sold to vendor.
---
I was hoping to get a Quad explosive Harpoon gun from the sale but I had no luck. With just the explosive perk and flechette mod, it does 650+ damage. and when you ADS with it, it is basically a sniper. If I put on the heavy weapon perks, it jumps the damage up to 1100+. who said being able to 1 shot lvl 68 scorched and some times super mutants would be OP
---
Oh yeah? I'll have to check that out! I don't really care about the case. There's enough cases in my house that I'm sure I can figure something out. But it would be worth it to me for a PS4 copy!
---
I’m on Xbox too. If you have the Xbox app on your phone you can download the image or video or on a pc you can access the Xbox app and download and upload from there :)
---
Oh yeah, forgot about cores! I only have eyes for the ammo plant haha. Although you'd still have to carry or stash em, kind of a practical limit to how much you'd benefit over others. plus you still put in the work to get them, I'd be ok with it. It's not the same level as exploits/dupes or whatever.
---
Yes. If i didnt lock my resources. Means free for anyone who pass by to take it
---
Who really needs to buy stimpacks, unless you charge into the fray with no thought to tactics? I'm a bloodied-build and only carry around 20 maximum, and I only use 1-2 in most instances, if ever. Even in SBQ fights I may need 3-4, but even that's unusual.
---
If resource items are open and not locked, its generally a sign that you are free to take what you need
---
What’s the mod on the Harpoon gun that makes it like a shotgun? I saw it on a youtube video the other day
---
then get one-shotted by a level 300 with a legacy TSE Plasma Gatling gun
---
We all appreciate your respect for this game, even if it’s still a buggy mess.
---
I had it set to read only, the game didn't seem to care at all and updated the file anyway.  But it's all good as long as you're getting what you want out of it, just keep that in mind in case something changes.
---
Q2 2021, hang tight!
---
Why are people shocked that events end in the middle of the day when every previous event has ended in the middle of the day?
---
Don't have my book with me, but with Power Patcher, the limbs are Steel, Plastic and Aluminum and 2/3 of each. Rediculously easy/ cheap to repair.
---
I bored of the game too. Done everything like you. But i found pvping is what makes me log in again. All your words are true. Btw outer worlds woud be a good replacement but its only signle player game :/
---
Haha! Oh my god. I'd forgotten about those commercials. I wish I could give you all the upvotes!
---
You missed the fad of scratch 'n' sniff in the 90s.
---
lol yeah I agree with that! but still, game is riddled with "currencies" like cores, bobbleheads, magazines, ballistic fiber, some resources like springs etc that are essentially supposed to be hard to come by because they are scattered around the world for every dweller to compete for them. private in its core disables this hardship. A guy can single handedly loot the entire world and sell/use any and all items once every 20 hours if current rules apply while pumping cores, ammo and food from workshops on the clock. That is kinda problematic wouldn't you say
---
damn thats cheap as hell. 
---
no idea maybe OP got the awnser he was looking for.
---
Same here man,  might be worth checking out when wastelanders drops.
---
It's a bug. Because the legendary effects are applied even when the armor is broken.
---
And Automatron was a GREAT dlc! I remember that my PC wasn't REALLY a gaming PC yet, and that last battle crashed me to desktop so. many. times.
---
It's funny: when you earn atoms in the game, it's easy to forget what they're really worth. But when you compare it to the DLCs for the last Fallout game, it really does change your perspective. It looked vaguely overpriced to me, but when you compared it to Automatron, I think my heart broke a little.
---
If so I probably would not have eaten the hotdog I found in a toilet.
---
I login, get my caps, scrip, possum badges, keep a supply of stuff for the badges to turn in, and do my daily challenges and weekly. Then logout. Might shop around a bit but that's pretty much it.
---
With new content being pushed back several months I think they need to look at removing gameplay limiters like the scrip and cap caps. They also need to unfuck the public event system so they will spawn more.
---
Lol you are one of many that do that, my closest friends in the game do the same thing. I carry at least 80 on me. Same with radaway, purified water and dog food. I'm a hoarder like that, I feel like a walking pharmacy sometimes. I do tend to sneak as best as I can but once I get caught which happens alot (considering I wear power armor almost all the time) I got no choice but to go crazy. I have this OCD thing where I don't like being under 50% for my health. To each their own I guess. As for people buying them.... I made 30 stimpaks and put all of them in my vendor at 10 caps each... They were all bought off one person literally within 30 mins, along with radaway
---
I think the workshop area bleeds into the posoden power plant and that's how he got you. Also he's just an asshole. There is no benefit to killing you when you are such a lower level than him other than to show you how small his penis is by showing off his e-penis.
---
Oh I thought you were saying it was coming out in November. Lol, my bad
---
Sounds like you got your monies worth buddy, move on!
---
I know its not in the game and should, be but once a month do a fishing tournament, make it every 2nd weekend of the month and if you win you get three choices to choose from like plans, legendary armor, or legendary gun.
---
Items I found that does this:
---
Tesla rifle
---
Pipe bolt action weapons
---
All rise
---
Supersledge
---
The fixer (Tap fire)
---
Mini gun
---
Gatling gun
---
50. Cal
---
MIRV mini nuke launcher
---
Automatic combat weapons ( rifle and shotgun)
---
Light machine gun
---
Legendary Explosive shotguns
---
Legendary explosive automatic rifles
---
The ripper
---
Mr handy buzz blade
---
And finally drill
---
I don't think my first response to anything has ever been grenades. I've just never been about them. why throw something that'll move stuff around and might not hit them when one head-pop will splat brains? lol. says the vats guy of course
---
Yes.  We're trying to beat the scorched and restore the last vestiges of civilization.  I have a lot of free ammo in my player vending because we're all killing the same enemies.  So if I need a drink, I'm taking one.  I would ask you, but if it's unlocked - you have my gratitude wastelander!
---
To the a-holes who take ALL my free ammo just to sell in their own vending, and all the free water - you raiders get what's coming to you.
---
That would certainly help
---
although I like the idea I am really asking for stuff that is super easy to implement, so they still have enough time for wastelanders and still give us some incentive to keep playing until it WL is up.
---
The same thing happens to me as well 
---
And I don't use a Tesla
---
The ridiculous thing is, I would actually go for that. I know most wouldn't but it would enhance my experience
---
Try putting on Animal Friend/Wasteland whisperer and Pacifying it, if possible
---
This needs to be fixed like ASAP it sucks logging in to a empty world where there’s only 1 event and to my luck it would be Lode Baring going on.
---
The one time I tried that I had so many codes and it still said zero. It's almost like they don't want to give us Atom Caps.
---
Toilet hotdogs are tha bomb.
---
This is... strangely cathartic. I'll be here to roast each other some more!
---
Nah. Got tiered of the game's endless bugs so since we all got ourselves PA set i'm taking a break atm.
---
A true connoisseur
---
This is the best read I have had in a while, thank you! Quite often people have lots they want to say but sadly lack the storytelling perk card. You clearly have it maxed out. Well done on your adventure and it's telling!!
---
There are two on PC US servers I know for sure are hacking: vanmeter94 and techfox3010
---
And I'm 90% sure NukaWhale is as well
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if the Vault 96 raid drops sometime between now and Wastelanders; the Vault and its missions are basically completely finished and have been for some time. Though I suspect it got delayed due to Bethesda attempting to rework it quite a bit after the Vault 94 backlash.
---
Thats happened to all of us at some point.  (Hostile takeover of workshops is part of the game.)
---
That said, a 115 whacking a 17... I don't necessarilty agree with it.  Likely, there was nothing you had the 115 could not have found/scrounged in the same amount of time it took to walk into the zone, contest the claim, then shoot you.    
---
Except perhaps a point towards the kill 20 player trophy, making a L17 is low hanging fruit, so to speak.
---
Anyway, for any given workshop try this : Check the map for nearby players that are much higher level than you.  If none, hit the button to take the workshop, and while the sat dish is ratcheting up, go to the edge of the zone.  As soon as the workshop claim is complete, step over the green line and and leave the area.    
---
You'll still get the rewards/plans for taking the workshop, but not PVPd for it.
---
  If you want to do the "defend" (against world critters, not a person) event, stay outside the zone and use a sniper rifle.  Takes longer, but still effective.  You'll still get the reward.
---
BTW, fusion cores are rather plentiful - you dont need to take a plant to get them.
---
My First instinct is  two shot fatman
---
Almost 10% towards the grand prize of 10 Atom Caps for playing for 7600 hours!
---
You can go to the Redbox website, from there you can pick a machine location(if it's in one near by), choose to buy it from the website, and then just pick it up from the machine 👌
---
Same here
---
Everything in my camp is free for anyone who passes through. I can't be bothered travelling back every 12 seconds to collect everything anyway. I miss settlers.
---
it's probably too much to ask that your platform of choice would be PC, wouldn't it? You'd like my circle of friends.
---
Really? My brother-in-law and a friend both had it on xbox, and they complained just as hard as I did. To be fair, I should probably stick to first hand experiences. What I CAN tell you first hand is that brother-in-law's Skyrim crashed on xbox so hard that corrupted his game file and he had to start over... Which I have never seen without mods before. Needless to say, there was a rage quit there.
---
I'll dump all my duplicate plans I am carrying for them.  That is if they don't just run away from me.
---
Monies worth? That's one way of looking at it, but we've effectively been paying testers for the buggiest and at times just downright broken game I've ever played.
---
How are the vault raids working out for everyone?
---
So yes, they gave it some love after I gave it up as a bad job. I think the wiffle bat was my last straw...
---
It does not waelrn you, which is why it's a bad setup.  It only 'warns' you when a claim on the workshop is started, and you can be killed the moment it starts before you can react....so it's not really a warning.  You can join a defense event and be killed with no warning at all, too.
---
lol.. this ended well...
---
hotdog toilet water
---
I'm not even doing it for the alt! I've got a PC copy, but I have a PS4, and the few friends I have that still play, play on PS4. So here we are. I'll check out the Redbox site. Thanks!
---
BTW, radx/radaway supress the effects of mutations.  (If you do not have starched genes2 equipped, it will also remove your mutation.)
---
if you use diluted versions, it does not supress.  Quite a handy in a nuke zone.
---
This is all conjecture but is based on my amateurish experience with the mess that is this engine. 
---
Ok. So this system is based on the Fallout 4 system. 
---
One problem they had with F4 was that when you saved with mods, it stored some mod data in your save file. If you removed the mod, that ref was still stuck in the save file. Having too many of those "unused" mod references in your save file would eventually destabilize a d corrupt it. 
---
I imagine the same issue may apply between files from easily moldable or customizable private servers and public ones. Meaning that going back and forth might risk server crashes. 
---
So I doubt they'll risk it and let you migrate back and forth.
---
Hopefully they have grind content and other mechanics in place to allow people to still play after they burn through all the new content.  I have a feeling players will race through the content so Bethesda needs to really think about adding the following ideas in some form.
---
\-More Ever Upwards badges to earn
---
\-New "Nuke-able" areas with different bosses to fight
---
\-New weapons and armors with different effects
---
\-More camp building opportunities and camp builiding pieces
---
\-Radiant quests similar to Fallout 4 and Skyrim
---
\-Better pvp mechanics or a pvp arena
---
\-Faction related challenges and commendations that earn new items and cosmetics
---
\-More Vaults to explore and better "raids".
---
\-Weekly weapons and armor you can earn similar to the survival weekly weapons
---
\-Better trade mechanics that allow item for item trades
---
\-Re-work of all legendary items that make more of the item pool viable-usable
---
\-More perks and a rework of some of the under performing ones
---
\-Legendary player system
---
\-Expand the cooking system
---
\-fishing and gold mining
---
\-Player hub/market inside Whitesprings. Allow players to place 1 vending machine in an instanced location
---
\-Make the workshops more desirable by changing what they produce, ballistic fiber, screws, springs, etc
---
\-New maps for Nuclear Winter. New rewards for leveling in Nuclear Winter.
---
\-T.O.W.N.S- allow players to build together and create settlements.  Smaller budget but shared conveniences
---
Bro don't say that, they will take you serious bro. Bro I don't think they understand sarcasm in written form bro. Bro they will see this as an honest suggestion bro. Bro add an /s at the end, please bro.
---
Fireproof in endurance makes you highly resistant to exploding! Worth it for scorchbeasts/cars
---
Tastes even better coming back up.
---
Lightly flavoured to guarantee satisfaction!
---
EWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW
---
A buff making it deal+200% damage is the only way to make it viable.
---
better still the second time .... waste not, want not
---
LOL
---
already did it but didn't work, i tame another deathclaw anyways but thanks
---
Medievil remake, CoD MW, Outer Worlds all come out in 3 days man!
---
You can bet the "Reach around" option will be out first
---
No ....NO ONE "missed that"
---
I like the wiffle bat. What a satisfying impact sound. Bong!
---
Lol, let's just nuke the player economy from orbit.  Great idea....
---
What about that rare camo forest jumpsuit from the forest region though?
---
I've twice got the drop on two teams fighting each other and come out on top. It's very hard (especially since I'm crap) but it feels so good when you pull it off. I've been killed by other solo players sneaking up on me more often than teams. I would like a solos only mode, but I doubt it's feasible.
---
F
---
This is why I put my ammo at 1 cap. Not to make a quick buck, but because the capitalism aspect of it keeps people from buying who don’t need it.
---
That's more p2w than anything in this game by a massive margin.  It's also destructive to the player economy.
---
I think they made it faster because when those machines first appeared it was worth checking to see what other players had sold, but the other day I used one straight after several other players and saw almost nothing in it.
---
My rule of thumb is usually: if the resource collector (including water purifiers) or door is locked, I don't take from it. If it's unlocked, that usually means that the player means for you (and others) to have free access, imo
---
I have quite a popular diner as my camp for vending so I mostly AFK leaving that open for others, not much to do other than mindlessly go PVE or farm
---
Was rebuilding yesterday after a visit from 3 Scorchbeast and now have an unused wood floor that I can’t delete and can only find one place I can put it down that it will actually stay.
---
And why is that?
---
lol
---
Scratch 'n' sniff cards were an awful trend.
---
Im not low level, 81 I think. But I have spent more time enjoying the game rather than really boosting my character. I JUST started working on getting legendary armor pieces and now have a full set but they are all pretty crappy. I have 1 legendary weapon I got early on and its one I use the least cause its just not that good.  
---
   
---
If you want to play and have some fun, maybe get some legendary stuff, or throw some tips my way Id be happy to play with you. - RideWithDanger
---
Consider joining r/PKOA , joining gave me a reason to keep playing.
---
Same here.  I'm level 255 and I log in for my daily caps &amp; scrip, then log off and play something else.  I pre ordered The Outer Worlds, so will play that until Wastelanders comes out.  Hopefully that will have enough content to keep me busy for a while.
---
If they're unlocked they're fair game, I always check people's purifiers and extractors while hopping, although I personally keep mine locked.
---
Nah, I'm PS4. Thanks for the offer tho. 🙂
---
For me those are too boring to do them only for this. And I was lucky to drop it once from fly swatter and buy it for 88 caps from Morgantown station vendor😋
---
I’ve accepted generosity with my alt, so I offer it to low levels regardless. Plus, 2nd character doesn’t mean they don’t need a hand. I don’t share or mule items between my characters so when I started over the new character is starting pretty fresh and could probably use a stim or a few rounds of ammo.
---
all buffs last for 2x longer.
---
I do like the mining one. weapon durability lasts 50% more, could do that after the mining week.
---
crop yields 2x 
---
scrap 2x
---
pretty much anything in the game you could make a week for.
---
Theres still no way that the "attacker" was trying to use the glitch, not to mention there arent aby spots to do the glitch. Yes the later half of my reply does describe me, I definitely get waaaay too sweaty at this game at times. Nah i aint mad, i just like pointing out stuff like this.
---
When ur hitting the queen how much dps is it showing u hitting her for??
---
I had that happen once...during a remodel I couldn’t delete a wall that was up in the air, had a tree branch going thru it...I moved. But since then I kind of had the same scenario happen so I rebuilt random floor and walls to get the rogue piece snapped into another wall and then I was able to delete it. Try that if you haven’t already
---
Similarly for Plans or Recipes - nothing worse than having to scroll through all the Notes to get to them.
---
Some low levels are secondary toons so I still check the level 10's to see what their level 100 has them selling.
---
Maybe idk why this happens but i also cant figure out why these atom challenges are so hard to get to work right i mean new vegas had challenges and they never glitched for me
---
Yes, if someone spends caps to come to your camp then you should return the favor with some water
---
I’ll give it a go, it’s out of the way and I’ve got plenty of budget left so not too desperate at the minute but just had another idea for improvement so it could get to be
---
I literally only noticed the button prompt for sharing perks today. I have five characters, the lowest of which is level 40.
---
For berserkers can you have iron clad equipped and does that count towards armor?
---
Did you buy her dinner first or just expected her to put out.
---
People already get around competing for spawns with sever hopping. We (as a whole) already know where everything spawns, how often, what conditions for respawn etc. I bet really focused farmers already max out whatever can be farmed. 
---
I see where you are coming from though! I think we will see some unintended consequences no matter what they do. I'm actually pretty curious about how this whole thing is going to shake out!
---
I would rather see some Hazmat mods than legendary ones, but both would be great too of course.
---
Outer Worlds is getting great reviews! I'm gonna buy on release date and after that we have Death Stranding early November. It's enough to stay busy for a while until Wastelanders comes out.
---
“Should” you? I don’t, personally. Even if it’s an open resource extractor.
---
That being said, I leave my purifiers unlocked and don’t mind if people take water from them. So I don’t preach what I practice.  :’)
---
Just turn it on a seek out the Mothman. Give him a rub behind the ears, then decide if the game is worth it.
---
holy moly ahahahahaha
---
Or let’s have a couple purveyors across the map. Have one be a weapons and one an armor but let each have their own scrip/scrap limit of 150 at each location. This 150 is ridiculous.
---
Well at the airport you get a small backpack, similar to the other backpacks, but it’s lower carry weight. I honestly wish I didn’t have to do those stupid backpack quests every time.
---
which should be revealed in what, 3-4 hours now? Yeah I'm a little curious too!
---
Shoot that would be really cool for u can smell the wasteland. So long as u can control the intensity level of the funky smell it emits 😂
---
So I was going to mention this. I've seen some very positive feedback from players now on the raids. People are grinding there more.
---
I feel you here though, I've met some amazing people and they're really why I come on much at all anymore. Just yesterday I was suggesting to my crew that we look into raiding 94 again.
---
We've also had a couple of groups or more hop world's and hit up the encryptid event, announcing the intent to do so to the rest of the event goers afterwards in area chat to encourage the entorage to grow. I know it's expensive but when you've maxed caps on 6 different mules and have all you need, the change and teamwork this involves presents an interesting choice of an evenings activities. (and is a good way to quickly spend caps for a purpose when you're in danger of going over max)
---
There's a bit of a trick to it, but lmk if you'd like to hear. I too am not a pvp style player, and prefer the team aspect of an event as well as helping others. Hope you can find a way friend, I'm pushing L450 and nearly 3k hours in the game. Seen a LOT come and go.
---
I have at least two dozen games I've never touched.  It's a problem.
---
I can't believe I'm about to say this, but why not try New Vegas?  If you're a really big fan of the series, and it's a few months before Wastelanders will fundamentally change the game, why not fill some Fallout time with that?  I hate Reddit's hard-on for New Vegas, but I do think it's worthy of at least one playthrough.
---
(Although part of me feels like maybe you misspoke when you said "only played the Bethesda ones.")
---
How about higher event frequency!  I log in and there is really nothing to do but dick around my camp while I wait for the possum badge event and then server hop...
---
dude this post was -4 points, why would anyone downvote this?
---
Yeah, I'll be losing a lot of regular friends to cod
---
Very cool. I think it scales according to highest building in workshop vicinity - Bog Town and Poseidon have incredible height limits, too.
---
34 per shot gauss rifle
---
I think patch 14, which is today I guess, fixes it to some extent.
---
I mean I'll 99% buy it oh man all that china stuff with activi/blizz is really bumming me out
---
As a fellow VATS user, I second this. I either sell them or give them to husband, who doesn't use VATS, and so uses explosives all the time.
---
You knew taking a pvp zone aka workshop auto initiates pvp. So fair gets tossed out the window. Plus posiden is a hot zone for us High lvls as fusion cores are a def need to have.
---
aaaand blocked for being a @#%#^^
---
I'll have to try those. The only time I take workshops is when I feel like building some whack BS.
---
I love the Sack Hood with Dirty Tan Suit. Just looks creepily classy
---
If they are unlocked, yes. By the time they return it will be full again, it's a waste of resources to lock extractors really!
---
I think that is coming next update, 23rd or 24th of october
---
Totally agree with you, that does work but for me it's just impractical.
---
Would love to see more slots for the fav wheel tho :)
---
Then ya u should of got something. Tho the queen fights are weird on damage. I tried it once with my TSE shotgon didnt get jack shit from her. But i use my heavy guns or my meelee or sniper rifle then ill alwase get loot.
---
The one at the crafting area in the mall @ whitesides usually has one.
---
You'll need a virtual machine. I don't remember thr name of it but there's a software that emulate a second system. Not sure if it'll work but you can search about it.
---
The lesson here, and hopefully Bethesda learns from it, is that story is paramount. A through-line of narrative, a beginning and end, is necessary for almost every form of media. 
---
Fallout 76 doesn't really have that, because it's trying to be yet another "forever" game that you never really put down. Look at all these challenges you can do! Here's the thing: I don't give a fuck about any of it if you haven't given me a genuine reason to care outside of my gullible eagerness to game.
---
Once you get to a higher level they’re barely a threat. I’ve gone afk with two attacking me and came back to over 75% hp
---
All of those bored players who log off to play Outer Worlds (Or other newly released games) talk about “this lame place I came from that had all of these monsters to kill, and now it’s boring there.” And the NPCs from those games hear about that, and over the next few months they migrate to Appalachia.
---
Wastelanders are just NPCs from other games.
---
Don’t think it’s a bug, since a piece breaking mid fight could “strand” a player(weight reduction) If you remove or switch the piece the broken one can’t be reapplied until fixed. Also force removing the armor upon breaking would remove the visual of the equipped armor.
---
This work-around only applies to PC players -
---
mousewheel + ctrl scrolls inventory by page, rather than normal mousewheel which scrolls by single item
---
Works with vendor lists as well.
---
Take your sweet time. Explore the forest (the starting area). It's pretty big. If somewhere seems suspiciously clean, come back another time. It has probably been stripped by another player.
---
Drop off everything you don't need including all junk as often as possible. Scrap the junk first to save space.
---
Go into your junk tab, press the components button and mark screws for search. Never enough screws.
---
Enemies can spawn at high levels because another player passed by, and it can be really hard to flee some of them. The western third of the map is safe, the rest can jump up pretty rapidly. Check enemy level before engaging. Enemies can also respawn because another player passed by. This is a pain in the dick if you just carefully stealth killed them all. They usually spawn in one spot and run to their starting spots like there's a movie crew shouting at them.
---
When you die you drop your junk and respawn at a fast travel point. Remember this if you are in the arse end of nowhere and carrying a lot of junk. This can work in your favour if you want to kill something near a fast travel point. You can totally cheese it.
---
Pay to win? What competitive edge does someone have over another? More ammo? Well you should be prepared for pvp in any game before you engage so if you are both prepared then it shouldn't be an issue. It isn't like I can gain some magick bullet on private servers bring it over and 1 shot everyone with it.
---
If anything it is pay to save time so you don't have 1000's of players taking the stuff I hop servers over and over trying to get. So if anything it will aave time for those willing to pay. Time is money so no gripe here.
---
I wish quick walls, stairs and guard posts would be in adventure mode too. I think it would be pretty fun!
---
Haven't been excited for a game like I am for Outer Worlds in a long time.
---
Isnt this game dead yet?
---
Outer Worlds is gonna be great!
---
game doesn't have any grave mistakes, just continue I'd say
---
If you want to play F76 still I can recommend r/PKOA as we have PC players as well, join introduce yourself and you have new people to chat with from all 3 Platforms and you can join up with players similair to you just for the fun of it mainly
---
Has significant stuff changed since launch?
---
Hahaha, sounds like me...I bet I spend half of my time moving or remodeling. Good luck, let your imagination run
---
I wouldn't say so especially not when it comes to perks/leveling
---
I keep my 6 water purifiers open and my wood extractor aswell for players to freely take. I keep my home at the log mill in the forest knowing newer players will enjoy. Got every crafting station there aswell. And no doors and have a decon shower on a swich.
---
You clearly didn't deserve the gift from Purveyour - go scrip it in the machine :)
---
If you find a Power Armour frame before level 15 you can still use it as long as you remove all of the armour pieces first - at low levels the frame will give you a boost to your STR level and Unarmed damage - it also negates all fall damage!
---
Sweet! I didn't realise I could do it that way. Thanks!
---
hope so man we know there's gonna be a patch on wednesday 23 which is in thirty minutes here in down undah.. and atom shop changes in 2.5 hours so maybe?
---

Yeah I know what you feel, it can feel lackluster for a while, and I don't that Bethesda will make a server based progress system because it would create problems of even lower playerbase per server and a higher ping. What you can do is eventually find some people that you get along with, invite them as friends and play on the same server with them. Or you can find discord servers that sometimes have people who will be willing to play with you. I know the multiplayer aspect of the game seems bad now but at launch it was pretty nice. Seeing as the new wastelanders update will come out a new player spike will probably come in, and most likely after that Bethesda might reduce the amount of servers to make them feel more active and less baron
---
ya i had a pump shotgun, hunting rife and a 10mm pistol, this was my first pvp moment, ive gone into areas with high levels and they where just nice to me, but thank you for the tips
---
you're gonna get a whole lot of downvotes my dude, this here is the land of Bloodieders
---
Oh damn, that Fixer.
---
It’s equally exhausting how people refuse to consider the ways their words and actions can impact people around them and instead get defensive and blame PC culture.
---
We need a whole bunch of extra optional tabs. Sort armour by body part, food, booze, chems, drink, keys...
---
God do I hate scrolling through menus.
---
If its unlocked its for you. If its locked its for me.
---
I would love to see an event that drops legendary effect mods for weapons and armor. 
---
I want to see a Krampus themed holiday cryptid event around Christmas time. Likewise, give us a cryptid Easter Bunny in the spring. 
---
A scavenger hunt quest to build something unique and useful, like a refrigerated vendor for selling food and drink (or a warmer, whatever, I want to sell food without it spoiling in 20 minutes). 
---
A server-wide no-kill PvP event like hide and seek with "paintball" syringe ammo.
---
A Thanksgiving style event like the meat cook except everyone deposits their made food and drink to share with everyone else for a really good food buff.
---
I leave my open with a sign below it that says "FREE" I also leave my Scavenger open too so people can help themselves
---
If you're playing on a paid private server, being able to capture all workshops, hit all daily rare spawns yourself and generally harvest the map without being contested, then transfer those spoils over to public.  That would then give you a massive advantage in trade over people in public only.  Essentially offsetting the economy in a negative way, only truly beneficial to those with a private server.
---
I'm Level 247 and I feel about like you do.  There's not much left to do except for learn all the plans I haven't yet learned.  I've been buying plans for things I'll never make, just because it's something to do.
---
I could still use a really good set of armor, but when I look at the effort involved to get a complete matching set of endgame armor, it doesn't feel worth it to me.  I already have the weapons I want and the power armor I want and the camp I want in a location I'm happy with.
---
As a solo player who doesn't min/max, Encryptid and Vault 94 just seem too resource-intensive for what you get out of them.  Nuclear Winter isn't my thing, nor is PvP in any sense.  Raids are meh.  Grinding for scrip is pointless when you already have the Legendaries you want.  I'm also bored with every Event at this point.  It's not the challenge (or lack thereof) that's the problem anymore.  It's that I've done them so many times.  I need new content.
---
I like bigger, more involved quests and new lands to explore.  I feel like there hasn't been DLC with players like me in mind in the last six months.  Now with Wastelanders being pushed back so long, my enthusiasm for the game is waning.
---
The problem with two shot is that it massively increases spread, which is detrimental to shotgun builds. 
---
I gave my girlfriend a TSE combat shotgun and the aiming retinals were off the damn screen. After adding all the spread reduction/accuracy increasing mods, as well as skeet shooter, the accuracy still takes up half the screen.
---
To make it effective, you have to be on someones grill, which means the explosions can cripple you.
---
That being said, when combined with a tageting system, I've never had a better missile launcher. Lol
---
you succeded in the vault 51 raid? or what is this alien technology that lets you write from the future?
---
Yes. This is all a dream. Wake up!
---
Everything that adds DR counts
---
Yea
---
But wouldn't you have all the legendaries and events on the server all to yourself and have a much higher chance of getting a god roll legendary?
---
Couldn't just selling legendary weapons on the Atom shop also be called a way to pay to save time? After all, anyone could just go get the same legendary by grinding for hours.
---
If anything it is pay to save time so you don't have 1000's of players taking the stuff I hop servers over and over trying to get. So if anything it will save time for those willing to pay. 
---
Time is money so no gripe here. I don't have time to grind as much as someone with no responsibilities in their lives so that is how they balance out. In your logic I should think anyone playing more than me has a p2w advantage over me and they absolutely do not.
---
I'm the kind of person that is really about one game at a time. Fallout 76, with the immersive multi player aspect and team encouraging play style, makes it more of an existence than a game for me lol sounds sad, but to me leaving would be like packing up and moving all my belongings out of state, leaving friends and loved ones.
---
Most people are not only fine with that, they're used to it. So I'm sol unless I can get everyone else to move with me to the same "state".
---
Back in the day I'd found an awesome crew in Delta Force 2 for a long while then Blackhawk Down came out. We tried to all make the move, most of us did but eventually it didn't pan out. The game was very different and we found our styles clashing.
---
I guess I get attached to the people. One of my very best friends today is someone I'd met in DF2 lol
---
all great ideas but those would require new code. I am really aiming for suggestions that will be very easy to program, so mainly stuff that is already in code. Changing a few paramters here and there and that's about it. If the developers do not spend much time on it, they will be able to focus their time and energy on WL and still give us something to do in the meantime.
---
Pick 'em up and drop them into the nearest deep water.
---
Thank you so much. I was really afraid I was overtelling, so I'm glad to see this reaction. 😊
---
I was waiting for it haha
---
Bloodied if fine imo
---
Player vending and being a merchant is part of the game to some people.  This would break that.  From your perspective, I get that you see it as a timesaver.  But in practice, these things always end up worse than that.  If something is exploitable, expect it to be.
---
I see a lot of concern about people using the Private server as a way to Farm resources and affect the game economy, but I just don't see that as a likely scenario (reasons listed below), and if it was it could easily be controlled by restricting workshop ownership to one workshop at a time.
---
* Materials have little value, I've tried running a dedicated Materials Vendor with very cheap prices, and sales were terrible.
---
* Items are randomly generated on the server and refresh at some interval, having exclusive access to a particular server won't change that, it would only slightly improve your chance of finding a static item before anyone else, and that spawn would then be gone for you, just like any other server.
---
* Resources gathered from a private Server could never come close to the quantities dumped into the game by Dupers, even if it was totally unrestricted.
---
I would go play the Outer Worlds, unless you're like me and have an objection to Epic's lame-ass tactics and those who enable them.
---
But if you ever come back to 76, I would recommend starting a new character and doing something deliberately opposite from what you currently are.  I don't think 76 gets any better than when you're in that area between Lv. 35-50, deep within areas you know you shouldn't be, carefully navigating around things you can't deal with while simultaneously pushing yourself to explore deeper.
---
I just ate a future chocolate chip cookie that is from the future and was bought an hour ago, thus also in the future
---
Future is tasty
---
And what about the level 200 with a limb damage vampire telsa vs the level 17? Then by your logic that high level douche is cheating because they can keep killing anyone lower then them preventing anyone else from getting any of the stuff from worskshops. Private servers balances that out.
---
Woohoo! Progress!! 😂
---
Make a blueprint, and when you get more wood, add to it.
---
I would like my american flag paint to work on my hazmat...
---
My logic has nothing to do with combat and only strictly about the player economy.
---
I play solo 90% of the time. Anyone is a group can can do that and roll thru them all before I can get thru one or 2 of them so I see only balance here.
---
This is the best advice for new players. There's lots of content, but it's really easy to blow through it without paying attention, particularly if you end up on a team. Follow the quests, explore everywhere in the lower level regions before heading into the Mire or Cranberry Bog. Read the terminal entries. The story in 76 IMHO is richer than Fallout 4, but you have to put the effort in to get it.
---
&gt; Even if the quest doesn't say to, you have to read the scribe's terminal entry or else you won't be able to complete it and it won't tell you that. 
---
Hah.  Mine keeps telling me to read the bloody terminal, which I did ages ago.  Doesn't seem to matter though, I just dump the DNA in the centrifuge and all is good.
---
Bookmarked, I'd like to know too.
---
Well that sucks. Berserkers is broken I feel. Who in their right mind wants to run around with no armor, it’s like being a bloodied with out the bloodied.
---
If that actualy see that happen ill def be leaving 76 and manny others will leave as well. Thoes of us who play ESO have seen the daamage Bot players do to the econamy. And non of us want it on any other game.
---
I suppose they expect me to find the information myself, but I couldn’t find anything via google which is why I asked here. Weirdos man.
---
So what about that 200's vendor compared to anyone else being gatekeeped. Player economy, are you that level 200 douche just trying to keep that edge over others?
---
If it's open it's open. I leave 1 purifier open and the rest locked and have a nice size garden for a reason. If I'm in another players camp and I see anything open, I take what i need.
---
Nothing they can do right now.  Go play the new 7DTD alpha 18, its pretty good
---
Vanguard BOS
---
Just give the brown sauce a miss.

Id do this but lord, I dont have the hair dye and length. So im gonna do it anyway.
---
Ever since I lost my precious scorched sloth idc about other people's pets :( If I can't have Hubert back I don't want anything
---
HOW TO TAME PLZ lol I've frickin level 440 and have YET to tame! There's so many minute steps I've heard of, rules, etc. I can't even figure which is accurate so I have up. Found someone had tanned a snally yesterday and nearly there my controller (not rly) since I've been wanting a gulper for a while!
---
As dragged out as this game can be lately, taming would be a nice one to make a lot easier.
---
The difference might be in the generator. If the generator is already powered up, you don't have to read the terminal entry. But if it's not, you won't get the option to power up the generator if you haven't read the terminal. And, of course,  you won't know which way to do it until you try. Schrodinger's Terminal.
---
I also have an AFK chair - another nice use for my neon letters :)

I have an instigating explosive combat shotgun and using it is like playing cops and robbers with a spoiled toddler.

"NUH UH."

New daily challenges: play for 25 hours- 10 Atoms. Reach level 2 in the glass cavern- 10 Atoms. Take a photo of a player dressed like Hulk Hogan fighting a Draugr in New York while the Monkey King waves at Master Chief in the background- 10 Atoms.
---
New weekly challenges: do every event 47 times while starving, drunk and dressed like a ballerina- 20 Atoms. Buy every item in the Atom Store- 40 atoms. Get every disease and mutation while dressed like a Protectron- 20 Atoms. Craft 10 fully-functioning motorbikes- 30 Atoms.
---
Don't forget: the reward for playing the game for 7600 hours is 20 Atoms. I'm 7% there!
---
Beth needs to implement a message like: "Contest, run or defend, 30s left til PVP"
---
atm it's just "Someone pushed the r\*\*e &amp; rob button, u got killed while reading this"
---
Maybe try stepping out of your feelings and think logically?
---
I don't get why you've been downvoted for this.  It's like if you live in a desert, you'll take whatever water you can find.
---
This is something that, in hindsight, I wish I would have asked the dataminers about.
---
Some weapons have innate armor penetration abilities.  I'm pretty sure the Fire Axe is one of them, even without the mod, and the two unarmed gauntlets definitely have it.  Hence, an "Anti-Armor Deathclaw Gauntlet" isn't exactly a misnomer, but it's not the best prefix you can have.  Likewise, you *will* do more damage with Incisor, but whether or not it's worth allocating 3 SPECIAL points to that is debatable.
---
And people thought tse used to be overpowered. Its baffling why the bloodied build hasn't been nerfed in some way.
---
because its berserk!
---
Your autocorrect is odd.
---
and with lower damage.
---
Scorchbeast guano pile 😂
---
Who cares about other people’s builds, it is not like this is a pvp game.  Quit you complaining
---
I have 5 industrial purifiers just for this purpose.
---
And don’t get me started with nocturnal
---
I think they just only care as much as they have to. I put in a support ticket ages back because something I paid real money for doesn't work any more. It still doesn't work and I still haven't had a reply.
---
XB1,  Hate that damn queen...lol always something crazy happens when fighting her.  Usually its freezing, resets and server boots.  Yesterday, the insanity was only one weapon would work.  4 out of 5 guns said I had no ammunition left when i had THOUSANDS of rounds. It was aggravating to say the least
---
You could do the same. I'm sure you have 1000's of hours and friends to group with so it is hard to think of the other players around you.
---
Yeah but 5 months is a really long time o.o
---
I have gotten a few decent items that way. So now when I turn in items for scrip if there is a decent one (but not one I want to keep or try to sell) I make sure to do that one last in hopes the next person will see it.
---
&gt; Their health indicator is just bugged, so they "heal" back to the level it should be. 
---
It's not "healing" them, but it is showing a discrepancy between what the client thinks it should be versus the server.  I maintain that the server is wrong and that something is capping this damage.
---
I just went back to a Unyielding armor bloodied build and idk why I ever changed it. I run the Unstoppable Monster, adrenal reaction is a must and iron fist perk. I one shot everything, even my non bloodied weapons do crazy damaged because of the adrenal reaction mutation.
---
Bloodied, junkies, Vampire, faster fire rare explosive :D
---
Change it to a Charging Barrel.  I don't run into this problem on that, but the Automatic Barrel almost always does.  Yes, you'll have to mash the fire button over and over again, but at least it's more reliable.
---
The game needs some balancing efforts for the weapon modifiers and it needs more than we currently have.
---
I'd love to see the whole damage/armor/resistances system overhauled and allow for more diverse builds. More damage types. Less one-fits-all solutions.
---
Omg...
---
how am i supposed to smell the beautiful mutant hound stew i'm making :(
---
Do you have a discord account or do you just use the in game voice chat
---
I have a quad double barrel that I’ve noticed does the same thing
---
Well, we have mics with people belching and farting and wolfing down chips and hacking up a storm.  I’d say it’s bad enough.
---
Well u get a 25% debuff during the day but it does double dmg around midnight so it's not THAT bad
---
bloodied builds have been nerfed 2 times already.
---
you already argued that
---
Med X, Psycho and Booze
---
I would too ^^ haha but hope it’s more like 500 atoms :P
---
yeah pal its so fun when a bloodied explosive big dick predator one shots AWOL 3\* Gutsy right :)) 
---
change tag system or nerf bloodied
---
feel free to downvote me
---
Bored? Do you own any other video games? That usually solves the issue for me
---
For PVP sure but for everything else you will waste ammo and be repairing constantly.
---
Mate I've accidentally forgot to save my ingame screenshots when I formatted PC.

Its all in my head now ;-;7

I bet it would smell like death and radiation.

Different person. I don't expect someone to read another post to see what I am getting at. So, what?

What grinding? With the exception of legendaries because of their sheer RNG nature what grinding actually happens? I don't need junk. I literally have hundreds of each kind of junk in my stash I've collected just by dicking around.
---
Sure, I'd be happy to try a couple of legendary runs with you. The fastest way to get good gear is to vendor hop, particularly now with the Purveyor sale having just finished, there will be plenty of well stocked camps out there if you're quick. I've got about 40 legendary items in my vendors and more sitting on my stash.

It's crazy because when i play fallout 76 is like: "What I'm doing? there's nothing to do". But I don't wanna play another games, I'm to much into the fallout 76 universe and is potential ( sorry for the eng).
---
its not op . its only used in pve and the stuff in pve dies quickly that you only need weapons with high fire rate.. in pvp full hp builds with the raid pa and aid spam is more op. and the raid pa is not bad for pve since you can infinitly stack the acid damage. . 
---
bloodied is just a high damage build that is it. but since the enemys on this game already have low hp pools and low armor the damge is not that importante.
---
you need 6 charisma (i think) for the animal friend and wasteland whisperer (for both rank 3) and go to a random spawn location, like the cranberry bog (i found my little deathclaw there)
---
Me and some buddies have bloodied characters, and I am always amused when they make a new character, get it up to 50 and are like "I'm only doing 300 damage! This build sucks!". I always go, "man that is extreme damage for a non-bloodied build, you are still 1-shotting most things...". 
---
Part of the issue with bloodied meta is that is so good damage-wise that players will often go back to it after trying a new build because nothing else in the game comes close to pulling 4k+ against the SBQ. 
---
Your options, if you are a power gamer, start and end with bloodied. Junkied is good but it will not pull numbers like bloodied (nothing will).
---
I am still surprised that after a year there are still no other builds like this, that the infinite amount of tinkering and legendary gear doesn't allow for other pinnacle builds. It's Bloodied for max dps or nothing.
---
So you take others stuff but you lock yours up?  Lame
---
Have you thought about expanding your horizons and playing something else for a little while?
---
Did more or less the same thing the other week, added a prime receiver to a furious UGL and an AA GL alongside a ton of ultracite fusion cores to bring the total number to 279 thanks to the farming. Still have a lot of the hardened and glowing mass left over, hanging onto them for the future.
---
What pet system?
---
Nice!! Happy hunting!
---
If you don't want it taken just lock It's not even the bounty that deters me, I cannot be asked to go through my specials and swap cards around.
---
Maybe they didn't like the fact I take without reciprocating? I just don't want purifiers and turrets ect taking up valuable budget.
---
Glad you are not salty with all the BS Bethesda has done with Fallout 76. Unfortunately a lot of people are not so forgiving when someone tries to extort more money from them.

You care about legendaries? Cool, I don't. I care about plans I don't own, missions need a note picked up that isn't there so I gotta server hop over and over till it is. I want to do an event and kill more than a couple things before they are one shotted by everyone else. But you know, stay in your element and only understand how things effect you by how you play. Most others play different from you and would like to take over a workshop and actually own it long enough to do the defend part before some pvp survivor orphan missing their servers comes kills me or who ever else they think they need to show their little dick to.
---
Well I know this sounds weird but just take a break man we don't always have to play we are allowed to play something else or just take a break from games if u take a break for like 5 days and play again u will mostly like find something to do like farm ammo or caps.
---
Bloodied, 10% dmg whist aiming, Explosive, faster reload and faster movement speed whist aiming.
---
I did not want to be greedy and have 5 main effects.
---
I am on the same boat with you. When i was new player and i have to complete my story quests and explore the world, the game was a lot of fun ! I had survival servers for pvp and i was really happy with the game. Right now, after so many hours i log in and i don't know what to do. It's one of my favorite games but they need to add more end game content.
---
For that one if you see them outside then they are inside.  When you do see them outside please only kill 1 so others can do that challenge.

Nah stay with it the only content added is late game content anyway so you won’t be missing anything
---
They can spawn by Abandoned Bog Town.
---
Not in terms of leveling. They have added new content but there hasn’t been a shift in gameplay or characterization
---
I'm at max budget, so I only have one that I put out on the roadside.  Even that alone left unlocked is enough to keep me from getting thirsty.
---
thanks man
---
Yes sir!
---
I hope youre wrong, I would not be surprised if you are right, but I sure hope not, I want to join the Mothman Cult. And yeah it is concerning that they made it a "settlers vs raiders" thing, when they have 5 major factions in the game already, and while the screenshots did show some potentially BoS or Enclave NPCs the trailer/announcement made no mention of their role, or Free States or Responders  in the DLC. And they only showed the Mothman cultists shooting at the players, so I really hope they are not automatically hostile.
---
I'm ready for another break. I'll come back feeling fresh. If you've only played one character and don't want to play something else, why not make a new character. I have 5, each using a different playstyle with different weapons.
---
I don't get why people care if others are using bloodied on pve. It doesn't affect other players at all and you don't need a bloodied build to one shot most enemies.
---
Bloodied, Junkie, Vampire, Anti-Armor, Faster Fire Rate
---
If I didn’t want people to take water I’d lock the purifier. Go for it :)
---
&gt;Outer Worlds is out soon.
---
True.
---
I made a video as part of a main quest series that describes the entire process:
---
https://youtu.be/zR3WH1pBQ98
---
Decryption taking place at 36:57
---
but to summarize:
---
For a launch you need:
---
        1. a launch key card 
---
        2. 8 number letter pair code pieces for one of the three (8 for alpha OR 8 for bravo OR 8 for Charlie)
---
        3. The code word for the same silo that you have the 8 code pieces for, generated every week within the enclave bunker.
---
For this example: 
---
Silo Alpha
---
Code pieces: F8, I7, K2, M7, Q9, U8, V7, Y9
---
Code word: QUESTIONABLY 
---
First, remove the letters contained within the code word from the standard alphabet to create a trimmed alphabet
---
CDFGHJKMPRVWXZ
---
Second, place the codeword in front of the trimmed alphabet to create a modified alphabet 
---
QUESTIONABLYCDFGHJKMPRVWXZ
---
Third, line the modified alphabet up against the standard alphabet
---
ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
---
Fourth, compare the letters of the code pieces against the aligned alphabets And extract the letters that align with the code pieces
---
Q9-A, U8-B, I7-F, Y9-L, F8-O, K2-S, M7-T, V7-W
---
Fifth, transfer the numbers to the letters gleaned from this process
---
A9, B8, F7, L9, O8, S2, T7, W7
---
These letters are the used to create the final code order. The 8 letters you translated from the original materials form an anagram.
---
Sixth, solve the anagram, or just use an an anagram solver on the internet. In this case the word is
---
BATFOWLS
---
the reorganized translated number letter pairs being B9, A8, T7, F9, O8, W2, L7, S7 or a code of:
---
98798277
---
Hope this helps
---
Instigating, bloodied, swing speed, vampire and anti armour would be a cosmic deity roll on a super sledge
---
lol I didnt mean for it to be that, but hey it  is so unbelievably rare these days to not only see this type of ambitious game, but also without mtxs or some other scummy aspects. CDPR deserves all the credit they get, it really seems like they alone are standing up for integrity in an industry in heavy decline due to greed and lack of inspiration.
---
Cool, thats nice!
---
It must be tough being so outraged that you don't realize you sent the same reply to the same person in two separate sub threads 🤣🤣🤣
---
&gt;"I'm only doing 300 damage! This build sucks!". I always go, "man that is extreme damage for a non-bloodied build, you are still 1-shotting most things...".
---
I know right?  
---
My main (Non-bloodied) on the charge with some Rads and his Insti-Axe can hit for 2200 at the upper limited and that is impressive, but a Bloodied build looks at that and goes "Dude, those a rookie Numbers, and you can only do it ONCE per target"
---
Someone explained to me once that he doesn't help anyone below a certain level if they've changed their icon. A brand new level 2 probably doesn't know how to do that. But I just help anyone. And when someone helped out my alt I started, I made sure to thank them. It was kindness regardless of whether or not I needed it.
---
&gt;dont know the new meta and the spots to farm legionaries/junk. 
---
there never was a meta..
---
but the best way to get ammo is lucky hole mines for lead and steel west tek. for legenderys just do horde vents awol queens etc or buy them from other players. and rol on the proveyer.
---
You forgot Serendipity. 45% chance for damage against you to just straight up not count. This includes incidental falling damage.
---
I use a Bloodied build because I mostly run around solo if I'm not playing alongside my wife. I run it with her so that I can be sure to keep her alive due to her build being incredibly casual (she runs the nuka cola perk on a permanent basis).
---
My build isn't optimized in any way. I put strength points into support areas, leaving me with only 6 base strength and 6 base perception. Radicool, Unyielding, and BoS Shielded underarmor still nets me 28 total strength which leaves me dealing far more damage than most enemies have in health with my Bloodied power fist. My strength perks are exclusively Junk Rat and Traveling Pharmacy.
---
Broken? Yes.
---
Satisfying, regardless? Yes.
---
It's worth mentioning, also, that Bloodied builds synergize with sneak builds far too well and sneaking is the true broken mechanic, just like in every Bethesda game.
---
Ya this happens a lot but I thought there was any update that made flux not drop on death anymore.
---
I actually don't know anyone who runs berserker's. I just don't know how it would work, having zero damage resistance
---
Play something else if you're bored? It's not Bethesdas responsibility to make sure you aren't bored after hours upon hours upon hours of gameplay that you paid what? $50-60 for. Christ almighty...find a new game, a new hobby, go do something you enjoy instead of grousing about being bored.
---
i kill sorchebests solo in less then 20 seconds. wile alt tabing and watching youtube videos. if you take 30 mins your doing someting wrong
---
With one of the perks you can pacify a creature a lower level than you and send it back to your camp
---
Nocturnal Suppressor Exterminator's Take Less Damage While Blocking Reduced Weight Sickle
---
Actually only 4 charisma is needed, if you have animal friend at rank 3 you only need wasteland whisperer at rank 1 and you can tame both animals and creatures!
---
Exactly this. I didn't move anything to my alt when I started it, so while I may know where to find things, I do still actually have to go find them. It keeps the fun challenge in the early game. I want to be nervous to go into the ash heap with a level 10! That's the fun!
---
legendary effects which require something like X time of day are really bad.
---
Need things you can control, like radding to 20% life, etc.
---
That's all I've been doing lately. I'm level 134 and 50 and I haven't even wanted to level up my 50 any more even though the build isn't even close to done. Plus, it seems like there isn't as many people. Some servers I get into have all low levels, and some have all high levels. Maybe I burnt myself out too fast. Idk.
---
dont take workshops if you dont want to pvp.
---
All games run out of content eventually. Sounds like you had a good run and it's time to find something else to play.
---
Agreed, every market will start to tank and rares will skyrocket to stupid values.
---
I enjoyed placing them on the bottom of my pool for my friends.
---
Yes, sorry, I dont speak english that well to know such idioms as discrepancy. Hence I've put the "".
---
A fair comment, I wanted to keep my post somewhat focused, it was already.....wordy, but trust me I have no illusions when it comes to Beth, my post history shows that I am hardly a shill for them lol, I definitely call them out when they do things that piss me off. I just thought that this could be a good sign, thats why I chose my words carefully, I didnt say that this solves all issues, but that it just might be a good sign, it remains to be seen if I am correct, but there is at least a very small glimmer of hope.
---
 F
---
I re-read that line. You're pretending a glorified skin for a weapon type that nobody really uses is a slippery slope to selling weapons in the atom shop, directly.
---
Stop it. You're not being clever or helpful in any possible way by over blowing such a minor thing. The name of the item even tells you it's just a combat knife in the shop. If skins are okay then The Invader is fine, on principle.
---
Hang on. You can put an an extractor on wood?!
---
Good call. Didn’t think of that!
---
More people to see then. Oh my. I am not outraged I just don't look at who I am replying to. I just put the info out that I am wanted to get out. So if there are copies then more chance to be heard and replied to so I can say it again. I think I will buy a private server for 5 accounts and supply them for 6 months. I will find some lowly solo players that just want to experience a solo 76 with the option to have multiplayer if they choose. Don't think you are in the running for one tho because I think it will grind your gears. If they transfer private to public then I will have a ton of crap to gain over you in my wee little camp I don't use to sell anything in anyway.
---
Less than 5% of players use reddit, you are a clown if you think either of our opinions matter. They already release today.
---
This is beyond the best thing on this sub, take my orange house.

**Gamebryo** AI attributes
---
The following statistics govern the behaviour of creatures and characters in Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4 and Fallout 76.
---
So this would mean Fallout 76 AI is still basically inherited from Fallout 3? Released in  **28 October 2008**
---
[Gamebryo - Wiki](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gamebryo_AI_attributes)
---
I actually just got the Anchorage haircut the other day, as it's my favorite in the game. I need to get around to styling it and posting a picture of it in here sometime
---
Whoa, nice! Did you actually use stairs? I just stuck wall clocks in the corners and hopped up.
---
I just want a legendary hazmat suit so I will not accidentally scrap it [again]. Yes I have it as a favorite; yes I get a pop up confirming I want to scrap it; yes I keep clicking the same button without paying attention.
---
Honestly, because Bethesda just aren't good game devs and they're using a severely outdated engine
---
I’m currently building a Weightless Raider armor set and a Vanguard BoS combat armor set.
---
if your planning a rifle build early game you can farm for mods for the hunting rifle by hitting a place called West Virginia lumber. Gather all the rifles scrap them to learn mods
---
Dont be afraid to interact with higher levels most of them are pretty nice and sometimes will even give you free supplies. 
---
There is a map online that shows spots where you can build camps to set machines to farm items such as steel, lead, copper. I recommend lead but definitely put a camp on one. 
---
Aaron holt farm is a good place to set up a camp. Near a broken house with a beehive on it their is a junk extractor spot. Its a relatively safe area. Just make sure to set up a few turrets
---
&gt;You forgot Serendipity. 45% chance for damage against you to just straight up not count. This includes incidental falling damage.
---
You're right I did forget Serendipity, but I was running that months back on this character long before Fridays Radiation accident.
---
I deliberately don't run this character with my wife (Who like yours, is very casual) because the things it can do is very immersion breaking for her (Again, this was before Friday)
---
\&gt;&gt; It's worth mentioning, also, that Bloodied builds synergize with sneak  builds far too well and sneaking is the true broken mechanic, 
---
I did mention the Sneak bonus AGL, but it just highlights the point, the build just does too many things too well to be good for the game.
---
Any five? Well if we're full-on cheating I'd go with: 
---
1. bloodied
---
2. bloodied
---
3. bloodied 
---
4. vampires
---
5. faster fire
---
...and I'd put it on a Fixer for a "sixth" affix. 
---
If that's too much cheating, I'd switch one to anti-armor and one to quad.
---
Which is why my character wears a bandana or the flight helmet lol
---
clickbait rage for youtube ad revenue.. it gives them money. just creat a new youtube account and do avideo on it saying it pay to win etc. or the game is bad. its free money.
---
That's insanely cool.
---
Yes as you can put one on a junk pile. Or on fosfate. Or copper. Lead. And all the others.
---
I'm with you, I was hesitant at first and now it's my favorite build so far. I was like "low health is so stupid who does that" and now I'm just like wow.. the damage God's love me
---
You should be faster on the draw then , instead of trying to make every one conform your handicapped trigger finger.
---
Base definitely looks like a trap but I like the one way pressure pad door. Dressing the part and using Nuka-World music definitely earns extra points. 10/10 would walk in there with 300 screws on me and thumbs up as I fell the ground.
---
I come across them all the time, now that mothman wants nothing to do with me. 😂😂😂
---
&gt;then refridgerators giving an obvious advantage. 
---
you can allways 1v1 people taht have refridgeratos and see how much you win.
---
Do whatever the hell you want
---
It's the wasteland🤘
---
What's killing it for me are the weight limits.  I logged in after not playing for a couple months.  I was sitting in some random town next to the train station.  You guessed it, full of loot to sell and was overweight and must have hit the cap limit again.  
---
So I sold it all and went back to my base.  For the life of me I can't understand it.  My character weight is 300/380 and I have like every weight perk.  Between my weapons and armor I should weigh like 65, I was carrying no missiles or heavy ammo, only ammo I actually used, .44, .45, .38.  I had weight perks for those too.  No crazy amount of meds, no weight perks for those too.  Sorting each category by weight revealed nothing special.  
---
I sold meds and dumped other ammo and things and got it down to like 265.  I almost wanted to dump everything in my stash and pull them out and figure out what was causing the weight, but go figure, I have no room for that too because my stash is around 700, and full of a lot of rare components.  
---
So I spent 2 hours trying to sort out my carry weight issues in my base, failed, and just looked at the map and said fuck it.  Idk where to go or what to do if I'm just going to fill back up in a couple zones and have to head back again.  It makes playing the game super tedious, to the point the whole thing is just agitated feelings no matter what I try to do.
---
So play something else
---
Heavy raider and trapped chests go through clothing. Vintage football under armor clips through all armor and is horrible.
---
Institute replicants (synths) were waaay smarter and frightening. And some gunners were also better in terms of fighting. 
---
Fallout 4, of course.
---
Next-Next Gen technology. I think the brotherhood was researching it
---
I've noticed an increase of players placing mines and using Fat Man during SBQ event. You get killed from the explosion even if you have pacifist on.
---
I didnt take your comment that way! I definitely did not expect everyone to 100% agree with more, and obviously my post, although wall of text, was narrow in focus mostly, which understandably made it seem like I possibly was ignoring the bad things going on. I guess coming from GTA Online, the overhyping, overmonetization and generally annoying marketing strategy with that game, has made me have more of a tolerance for that sort of thing, not that I accept it, but Rockstar set the bar so low in terms of greedy practices, and shitty marketing, that even a fuckup of Beth's scale with 76 seems not so bad by comparison. The secrecy and tight lipped marketting of Rockstar in the past worked, because they were known for anti-greed practices as well as innovation and always pleasant surprises, GTA online was more negative surprises and IMO their monetization model (make the game pvp focused and intentionally unbalanced/frustrating/tedious to force people to buy mtxs, that game IS pay to win) is worse then lootboxes, at least AS bad. When thats what you start becoming known for, then secrecy and silence no longer works as a marketing strategy, bc you are left guessing what the latest disappointment will be. So perhaps my standards are just slightly lower bc of Rockstars fuckery in recent times.
---
Please please make it a base that flings you off on the top floor.
---
In addition to what u/mutexl0ck and u/PoshPopcorn have already said (excellent advice), I would find yourself a good well stocked vendor, especially one that has low prices on ammo and chems early in the game, and remember their tag.  I remember always being pressed for them in my first 20 levels or so.  Also, spend a few minutes in Flatwoods collecting plants.  You can make yourself a good number of disease cures and healing salves pretty quickly.
---
Yeah, the AI in FO was in its peak in 4, but severely downgraded in 76
---
I agree that bloodied is OP compared to other build options but I'd much rather see a diversity of options instead of just nerfing bloodied into the ground. Beth seems to go overboard when balancing things and I'd hate to see only one other build being viable (e.g. junkies) if/when bloodied gets "balanced".
---
Why aren't we allowed to talk about the trading sub 😲
---
completely unrelated, but Square Enix's censorship in FF7 and FF8 remaster piss me off to no end, it is so unnecessary. I sure as shit dont want every (or any) game to have some sort of right wing political message, but pandering to the PC crowd is equally as horrible, and they arent even consistent, anyways, thats a rant for another day lol
---
Smelly teenagers? No thanks
---
Yes as you can put one on a junk pile. Or on fosfate. Or copper. Lead. And all the others. The extractors are under resorse in ur camp and been there since beta.
---
You already have junkie's prefix. It Is already overkill in most situations.
---
&gt;You care about legendaries?
---
I don't but acknowledging the fact legendary drops are RNG on top of RNG doesn't make me obsessed with them.
---
&gt;  I care about plans I don't own, 
---
Which plans do you need? I say need because need and want are two different things. I want the plans to all power armor but because I already have full sets at max level I do not need it. 
---
&gt; missions need a note picked up 
---
Quest related items are always instance. My wife, me, and 4 friends never had a situation were anything quest related was already picked up by another player. Even when there are multiple players in the same are doing the same quest. 
---
&gt; I want to do an event and kill more than a couple things before they are one shotted by everyone else. 
---
So how is this grinding and not having a life? This is basic common courtesy that most players have but a few A holes lack. 
---
&gt; Most others play different from you and would like to take over a  workshop and actually own it long enough to do the defend part before  some pvp survivor orphan missing their servers comes kills me or who  ever else they think they need to show their little dick to. 
---
I've literally held workshops for hours at a time. One day I literally spent 8 hours on a server farming fusion cores for myself and my wife.  But beyond that you build a stash box and a chem station and craft and store all your junk and then you avoid the hell out of the place save only to grab and stash the junk made. So if someone wants to kill you they will not be able to.  
---
I genuinely don't understand this complaint about workshops.  
---
But beyond that none of this is no life have 1,000 of hours advantage stuff. Literally the only argument that this can apply to is legendary weapons and armor.
---
The only issue with Bloodied ranged builds is that it highlights the tagging issue for legendary monsters in events.
---
Don't mistake bad game design for an overpowered build, you can reach the same numbers with instigating for a hit, if Bloodied was nerfed, people would just move over to junkies and run the same lowHp builds again, or Instigating.
---
The event tagging bit is coming "soon".
---
**Melee Bloodied builds combined with Unyielding gear needs a hard nerf. Or a softcap on STR = Damage benefits, however.** Noone should be able to oneshot the ISS or the SBQ before other people have time to put in some work.
---
That being said, No downvote from me :)
---
It’d be a lot easier to find Megasloths.
---
Didn't know you could send them back. What other commands can you give?
---
haha, Niiiiiice. Very therapeutic, or something. If it will blow up, I'm going to blow it up.
---
Won’t it smell the same as a junk yard or smells like a dead animal
---
Nicely played...
---
Maybe this is the use case I have been looking for to get the dust off my Dragon.
---
It not just a skin. It is literally the weapon. If you read the descriptions of the rest of the skins they say explicitly they are skins. This one says it is a weapon. I am not pretending anything. You are incorrectly conflating two different things. It IS what I claim it is. Because you are hopeful that it won't continue does not make what I claim incorrect.
---
Oh god thats worse than i could have possibly imagined
---
That’s not really true. 
---
Nukashine quest: low level quest 
---
Sheepsquatch quest (mid level; though event at end is def high level. Really comes out of nowhere .)
---
Pioneer scouts (start as low level, I am of the approach to complete this passively for maximum enjoyment but even if you try and binge the challenges it’s probably low-mid level. 
---
I agree they aren’t missing anything though by continuing level 25 character.
---
I’ve got a bunch rn
---
There should be a challenge for slaughtering people’s pets
---
haha, for some reason this reminds me of that old Twilight Zone episode with the gremlin on the wing of the plane just tearing S up.
---
And you can do all of them at endgame and you loose nothing
---
I’ve bought a few until I learned you could get Improved ones from the Queen. Never bought one again after that.
---
Wow a whole 8 hours. I get that in a week and private server will ensure I get the gaming experience I prefer over the one I have been experiencing. So go play with people while others have a different preference.
---
Bloodied builds have turned absolute slogs - like the SBQ event for instance - into farmable instances.
---
These days the fight hardly ever lasts more than 5 minutes, and that often is due to the people running the silo actually holding back to give everyone a chance to farm a few adds and get their shots in so they get loot from the SBQ herself. I have been in many fights that could have lasted less than a minute, people who launched the nuke actually decided not to make it so.
---
I for once do not want to go back to the 29m 54s SBQ 'fights' thank you very much.
---
Been there, done that, we do it better now.
---
We will see what happens with the announced 'balance pass' that will come with Wastelanders; until then I hope they leave it alone.
---
Being able to farm certain events like Encryptid, Scorched Earth, Project Paradise etc I find a gratifying experience.
---
EDIT: I read some comment about 'bloodied people one shotting things'. You can still be a one-shotting clown with an instigating gauss. You won't be a bloody clown, but you will still be a clown. Changes to the bloodied 'build' won't turn clowns into well adjusted individuals.
---
It's going to be a long, itchy weekend for us reggie
---
\*ding ding ding\* Dinner is here. Come out and pllllllaayyyyyyy.
---
Sure
---
I was referring to  the overall history, from my first Bethesda experience with Morrowind, up through Skyrim (which for me on Xbox wasnt nearly as annoying), during the Morrowind, Oblivion, Skyrim, Fallout 3, the company still seemed to have some vision, they were still innovating and pushing the standard higher for open world RPGs. I always chocked the skyrim DLC issue up to contract stuff between MS and Beth, not Beth acting alone, and since Sony has their fair share of contract monopolies, I felt like Skyrim DLC was a good move for MS. Hopefully that helps clear up where I was coming from with the "good old days" comment.
---
The collectron is "pay to hear dad jokes".
---
I found the tesla rifle is what causes the damage bug to occur where you can no longer do any ranged damage to enemies until you relog
---
You just opened my eyes into thinking that I'm a child of atom. I never really thought of it like that. Least I'm not an asshole like most children of atom
---
Actual horde events - Groups of gouls or scorched closing in on a city that if they all get there will spawn legendary enemies in a mob. Players have to decide if they are gona let them all make it and have to handel all the adds, or pick off one or two groups before they meet up to make it easier but only spawn a 1* or 2* legendary
---
I Will add you i also have no friends that play
---
Level 250 and you’re bored lol. Maybe take a break and try something else?
---
Idk. I just really want the vault dwellers to reform factions. We know there will be new cultists and I'm absolutely certain the BOS will return considering they still live on the west coast but I'm hoping that us vault dwellers can reform the others. I agree that there isn't much of a reason to reform the free states as opposed to the others but it makes sense just to take up the name if we start using their bunkers/fortifications.
---
Great way to save a few caps from fast travel! About as useful as [this guy's advice](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dhxrq6/really_good_advice_quick_caps_and_food/).
---
Today or 24th?
---
No, they don't deserve any credit. The World is the only thing they got right.
---
Yes it's beatifull with its biomes, mountains and locations. It'is really cool, that it is 4x times bigger than Fallout 4. Probably more like 5 times because there so no ocean. It is more immersive, in that sense that it is less dense. Not so cramped with locations like Fallout 4. It feels more natural. It is colorfull and very diverse. I had about 100 hours very fun to level up, explore all the locations and enjoy the world. I would be great to have the Fallout 76 world as mod for Fallout 4. I don't even bother that they re-used so many assets from Fallout 4.
---
But, in every other aspect Fallout 76 is a big dissapointment and scares me of the next Bethesda game. This game really managed to kill every ounce of respect i got for this company. It is a minimum Viable Product, buggier, emptier, grindier and shallower as every Fallout before. I paid 90 (tricenntenial edition and 10 bucks for atoms) bucks for a a really shitty, unfinished, very limited Fallout 4 Multiplayer dlc. And now they ask for additional payments to make it better. For me they only delivered half a game for 90 USD and i'am not willing to pay 150 USD or even more to get a full game. 
---
But hey, it has a beautifull World....ah fuck it, i am doing starting another Fallout 4 run until Cyberpunk 2077 hits the shelves.
---
That's why we leave em unlocked.
---

I am sure one of those would be able to help you through your dark times.
---
Here's an idea for you, play another game. Shocker I know
---
I stand corrected
---
nocturnal, hunters, ghoul slayers, exterminators, zealots commie whacker
---
Quad, Bloodied, Explosive, 10% while aiming, 25% less VATS Cost the Fixer
---
looks like I was wrong, Obsidian is made up of former Interplay staff...dont know how I missed that
---
We don't need Junkies to be another Bloodied mod where you get insane benefits from stacking mutations, perks, and affixes.
---
You don't need to be able to switch between a private server and a public to do those things. In fact, it sound like you just want to on a private.
---
well if today is 23rd for you too then yes, they stated it was today. Dunno when&amp;what&amp;why or anything else really about it tho.
---
Do cranberries smell bad or is it from the queen cropdusting?
---
I'm online now, if you're willing to help me out. 
---
Psn is DbLoki
---
Yes, pop on that double plants perk and stock up on healing salves.
---
If she isn't a child then maybe I will give your girlfriend a chance at my privates servers lmao. Only 5 people of my choosing and I will make sure all can see how real this is.
---
i raise you this [atrocity](https://eumerch.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout/879-fallout-candle-vr) . it smells like burnt popcorn and bad cologne.
---
I agree with the Instigating point (mostly) as my main runs Insti and I have to swap down when in events and such, BUT that being said, Bloodied still hits harder (But, overkill by 1 or by 500 it's no difference)
---
Your Junkies point is interesting and I would curious to see what would happen in that instance.
---
the answer is not well
---
As much as I like the turn out at events under the new system, I would rather they left the frequency of events alone and simply highlighted a starting event every 5 or 10 minutes.
---
It is such a shame this post got so little response. I wonder if this reddit just isn't giving a shit any more or is this more a result so many people are had enough with this BGS horsecrap.
---
I'm glad I'm not on the same server as you! Even before push to talk all I had was people chatting away to their partners unaware we could hear them. Nothing as bad as you.
---
I'm not the handicapped one when a miner spawns in UF and this big shot just decides he'll be the only one getting the drop.
---
I do. I might play Fallout NV or 4 if they mess up private servers by breaking them or goin by doing what Conan does.
---
I don't think Ghouls actually smell.
---
Yes it is called a day off and every now and then I get to enjoy them.  It is also an example of being able to hold the workshop for extended periods without a PvP player attacking me just for shits and or giggles.  
---
Do you not build turrets? Because maybe it is the ass load of them that I have build that makes people think twice given they will attack them if they attack me. Or do you stand out in the open like a fish in a barrel when you are at you workshop? Because I will build a small hut to sit in so I can not be shot by other players easily?
---
That sucks. I tested leather (sturdy or heavy, it was legendary), marine and metal. The metal is all on the side, so it just looks like a gap. The other two look awful.
---
I am currently sitting on 20+ 3* legendary armors I would love to just dump into the legend-o-matic, but I am limited due to the script cap. Would letting me dump all of that today really shorten the grind?
---
Theres an interesting post gathering evidence that apparently ghouls would smell more like burnt meat than rot
---
Perfect.
---
Nice.  I drank an energy drink and had a processed ham sandwich today, and also I'm sitting at work for 8 hours.
---
Lol that's horrible when the game community tells you to play something else for a game thats online and meant to be played extensively
---
I only wear BOS combat armor. Unyielding. Go with like... half health. The stat boosts outweigh the penalties for the addictions.
---
isnt it patchday/maintenanceday today, in like 1h or so?
---
The worst is when you got a team of 2 people and one person is on area chat and the other is on team, so you hear 1/2 of the conversation. I actually had a guy get mad at me because I wouldn't answer his friend's question I couldn't hear once. I didn't have a mic attached anyway.
---
Nice, will be looking for it mate
---
It'd be cool if they'd push an actual effective combat pet build.   I'd love that.
---
That looks very useful, thank you. Going to have a play with that and see if I can get controls working.
---
That sounds like an excuse as to why your not faster at pulling the trigger.  Keep practicing you will get better or bloodied.
---
48 hours iirc, im pretty sure the last ITV said the 24th.
---
Well, I'm talking about EU servers but good to know.
---
Today is october 22th, they sayed it was on the 24 th... So Thursdays
---
*-No, you.*
---
Think they said Wednesday this time, soo , tomorrow :)
---
&gt;Bloodied builds have turned absolute slogs - like the SBQ event for instance - into farmable instances.
---
I understand your point here, but the concern is that 
---
1. Your relying on the fair play of others in an online game (Not something to point money on)
---
2. You can't balance events for both groups
---
3. Granted I don't want 11th hour SQB fights either, but 15-20 minutes I think is a good place, I'd rather it be an event you to "gear" for (Ammo, Stims in the right numbers) than Metal Gearing Morgantown with an Insti-10mm
---
okay, so they restock the atom shop today, patch thursday?
---
you'd get about a 31% loss in dps at the most, the problems would remain the same. Overall, i'd be a fan of buffing lesser options and **promote build diversity** that way instead of hardnerfing one legendary roll, making people move to the next best thing.
---
I'd say the tagging requirement is the cause of the issues, Bloodied builds being a symptom of it overall.
---
Very useful thanks. How do / can you control the second account?
---
most of the info is in the last momth or so's ITV articles, they gave us a glimpse of the event, talked about reducing public event cooldowns by at least half, and some other things mixed in. (not counting the x is delayed ones)
---
Also the wood mill...lots of boxes ..type writers ..stimpaks..mutants drop stuff..
---
A bloodied anti-armor vampire's two-shot FFR anything would be nigh unstoppable.
---
I totally agree, I recently started replaying new Vegas and am just now realizing how much I miss finding bits of lore in buildings explaining their history
---
There is no, need for that comma.
---
you will find info like this posted in the different "Inside the Vault" on Bethesda twitter page
---
Meh. Don't worry about it. In the end, you still helped the community.
---
They have commented that it will dropped on the 23rd which is tomorrow, odd because they USUALLY update on Tuesdays.

I was given a preserved pie when I was a low level. I ate it without realizing the value lol
---
Last Saturday was my tipping point. I logged in, did some scrip, logged out, bought another game. It's just gotten too stale. Not nearly the same re-play value of FO 3 or 4.
---
roger that
---
None, sadly. They chill around your camp but you can't really give them any commands.
---
I have a furious faster fire gatling plasma. I Will not compare it to legacy weapons because it Is not fair. They were removed from the pool.
---
that was me friend!
---
1. comments made by devs in the last thread about ITV state patch is due to 23rd
---
2. [nukacrpyt.com](https://nukacrpyt.com) tracks dev comments and such, and I happen to check it from time to time. I remember some comments about fixes devs specifically confirmed, for example Grafton's mayor will be fixed and event timers are gonna be shorter too! 
---
3. thats all
---
i was wrong, apparently its tomorrow according to the other users link.
---
id imagine they will just do the AS tomorrow with the big patch, doesnt make to much sense (to me at least) to drop servers twice when they could just do it once
---
Classic WoW awaits you.
---
I kind of really like this idea. another system that flags people that WANT pvp. and a way to recognize others. even if it's just on their health bar.
---
They still said that is not why they created this game so it doesn’t really matter.
---
But the mentally unstable player camps can be fun too... confusing, but funny. Like the other day when I bought really cheap legendary weapons for scrip while the owner constantly tried to trigger pvp with his meathook, while dressed as a maniac. He then stopped and gifted me 50 stimpacks. I mean, why.... but also, thanks, I guess?
---
cool! I wonder if private servers would allow us to save builds on settlements.
---
I think it's just attention span-- a shorter post on the same topic got a lot of support from the community.
---
But yea, I do think the less tolerant players are leaving the game between the Wastelanders months-long delay and this Atom Shop turd.

At the top of west tek on the roof is a lounge chair with an umbrella and a piece of perfectly preserved pie sitting on a plate that respawns for your character every couple weeks.  
---
Go find it and load back up :)
---
Stairs from bottom to up... That wall clock trick might shave a lot of resources from the limit, though. Will try.
---
☝🏻 this guy has it! Berserkers needs to have a better buff for no armor or allow a +5 Str/End/AGI buff and -5 int/cha when wearing clothes since there is no DR resistance.
---
I'm with you OP. I have played 250+ hours, completed all quests, explore all map, collected all gear, gathered lot of caps and get bored.
---
I just stopped playing a few months ago and wait for Wastelanders, because it seems like there will be a ton of new content
---
Camp placement can make a big impact, I recently moved my camp to a location that had a lead deposit and now I crank out as much ammo as I can. Use the environment to your advantage but remember high level areas will make high level enemies trying to take down your camp.
---
Like that guy that built a Brahmin catapult and threw Brahmin at other people's camps.
---
Yea I skipped GTA online for two reasons: Forcing me to repurchase the game for PC when I had a PS copy, and the horrible monetization. Rockstar were completely shameless with that game and I'm not sure I'd buy another of their products.
---
I just scrapped a hunters long coat...
---
well i mean its 44 minutes past midnight here in OZ so maybe once they were thinking about us lol?
---
I keep 2 of my 5 Purifiers unlocked. Used to keep them all unlocked, but too often I'd come home to find them cleaned out, and since I make tons of diluted Stimpacks, I need the water... Also keep my collectron locked.
---
They could do something different. 
---
Berserkers in mythology/history are batshit crazy and fast.
---
Maybe have berserker's legendary effect be a small damage boost + chem effect boost or attack speed boost. Make it different than a raw damage increase.
---
I dream of lode bearing! It's dogwood bloody die off every 10 minutes for me.
---
Yeah, i typed that wrong. I meant rifle.
---
any news on when that update is out?
---
Then it will be tomorow, 24 hours from now. It does not matter what time it is where you live, it matter the time it is where they work, and is still 22 there
---
the people left in this sub are a special breed.  upvotes for anything that hates on bethesda even if it's not true.
---
Next year, not sure though
---
Probably the bog part that smells.
---
You can change the button layout in the settings menu
---
How much value do they even have?
---
Agreed. It feels like the forest has a good amount of lore that ties in multiple locations but so many other parts of the map are only used for fetching a single item for a point in a quest. I'm not super into fallout lore like the Enclave or BOS but I occasionlly find a few tangents interesting, some of my favorites being Arktos/Project Beanstalk, the cultists, the VTU guidestones, and the Sons of Dane although there's not much to the latter two. The three Black Mountain Ordiance "treasure trails" are also fun if you haven't got to those.
---
Furious AA explosive ffr extra 10% whilst aiming 
---
Think this would be amazing on pretty much any auto/heavy weapon
---
Just alt tab. When I sign into my first instance, I windows key out to the desktop and then load the second. After that I just alt tab between them. If you try to trade between each account, make sure you use the right ALT orherwise the left ALT cancels trade.
---
Quad, bloodied, anti-armor, junkies, explosive harpoon gun with a flechette mod.
---
I wonder if there is an active duping process that crashes servers again, i also noticed alot of disconnects recently
---
im also in gig fiber hardwired
---
one of the reasons is 95% of the locations have random loot containers and enemies, stripping any chance to tell a coherent story.
---
Dang! I have about 15k caps but I'm pretty stingy with them lol. At the moment I'm in school so I can only play Thursday-Sunday but I'll hop on and we can do some legendary runs and just have some fun.
---
"shorten the grind" might not be applicable for that, no. 
---
But it would be an incentive to go online. I have one mule full of legendaries and scrip and two accounts I play with that are also full of scrip because of the Purveyor event. I log in, scrip as close to 150 I can get and find myself still to heavy. For me, that means I'm done playing with that character for the day, since transferring to my mule is no option. If I could scrip them all at once, I would play more. Now I basically sit around until the scrip refreshes. I'm sure many have this problem. Even if I manage to get below max weight, after a few hours, I'm in the same situation. So a no scrip limit event would mean for me "Yeey, I can play on all my characters with getting to heavy" and "I can finally clean up my characters scrip in one swift session". It is not a good feeling to know in advance your gaming session will be just logging in, scripping and logging out.

This weekend I drove through Iowa through this fog that smelled like it was made of raw sewage and honestly I'd rather smell a scroched's b-hole than endure that again. But your general point is taken.

As soon as i get home :)

Tinder?
---
i agree is ridiculous, but some whales MUST be doing it so they keep raising the prices
---
i just wait for things i like to go on sale heh, highest price ive ever spent my in game earned AToms on was 500 atoms
---
I got a berserkers explosive handmade from the purveyor and I decided to start a new character to try it. I use it like a bloodied build at low health with adrenal reaction, serendipity, other perks and broken armor so I can use the legendary effects and no enemy can come close to me. If they see me I'm probably death but nothing happens in this game if you die. 
---
I like it because it's hard mode and can use the hooded rags.
---
I laughed. I cried. I realized I didn't finish Site Alpha.
---
Must Nuke Appalachia later.
---
Thank you. You brightened my day and gave me plans on spreading Radiation and Democracy to this godforsaken land like any red blooded American!
---
On the contrary, we need every other line to be comparable to bloodied in terms of both damage and defensive strategies resulting from given approach.  
---
Junkies should be able to enhance their defensive and offensive capabilities further via drugs, yet have it harder to benefit from regular aid items when they choose to superspecialise.  
---
Medic should work per shot not per critical shot, and should heal based on the damage dealt and distance between the healed players and target.  
---
Berserker line is currently the most dangerous one to those that select it, not to their opponents  - bloodbuilds are vastly more resilient than berserkers. It needs perks that increase the amount of allowed DR/ER before the reduction of damage kicks in, damage negation perk like serendipity but giving a chance to dodge attacks based on number of armor pieces the user is NOT wearing, and its current damage modifier, 50% tops, should be buffed to the point that makes bloodied secondary. Otherwise, its simply trash.  
---
Nocturnal, combined with appropriate perks like covert operative, should outperform all other effects at nights.  
---
Zealots/Troubleshooters etc should make it so that if you are PvE focused and you have Zealots, Troubleshooter, Ghoul Slayer, Mutant Slayer and Exterminator weapons, you're as prepared for PvE as you could ever get. Conditional, and best in their league - they should be that.  
---
Assassin should be buffed to become the default choice for not super-specialised PvP builds, lessening the price impact of PvP on rest of the market, and reducing the prices of PvE gear.  
---
Mutants should benefit a little for each used mutation, mutant-slayer effects should be applied on mutated players, and there should be added perks and modifiers for being "clean", so that being non-mutated can be tactical choice, not only a role-playing one.  
---
Two-shot accuracy penalty should either be severely reduced, or it should regain 100% of bonus damage (if both bullets hit). Right now its simply weak corpse of its former self - and it was still #3 best ranged prefix when it was 100%, surpassed by bloodied (average 80% bonus all the time for 19% playstyle, no accuracy penalty) and quad (with Quad Explosive harpoon being the most powerful weapon at that time, and the perfect counter for ASS/Sent TSE pvpers jumping in place).
---
im sorry it happened, BUT! congrats on your first solo kill!
---
What outfit is that?
---
Honestly IMO it's fine. If it's unlocked it's free.
---
Me? I have it locked but my vendor has a sigh stating free water so I make sure you have the water to drink.
---
Just don't trash my house plz.
---
They prob smell like rotting ass checks
---
Fresh leather.
---
Thanks, but that website isn't even loading for me *shrug*
---
hey we got free stuff from the ATOM store and a nice discount at the purveyor! that is good for everyone!
---
besides, i thought it was neat to see the community pull together to achieve a goal!
---
Ha! You know, I have never thought of that, but you are totally right!
---
Do you actually get possum badges from pioneer scout dailies? I’ve run the dailies daily since they dropped and I haven’t got one. I don the same thing where I just hoard stings and things, but yet nothing. I heard campfire tales is supposed to drop them too, but I’ve run that about 300 times and haven’t got one from that either.
---
I’m still doing the badges. That keeps me going. That plasma grenade plan May drop if I keep hoping. 🤞🏻
---
i highly recommend starting new characters - i have 5 and they all have different backstories, use different weapons, eat different foods, serve different purposes (PvP, PvE, medic/support, etc.), and utilize different perks. This keeps the game fresh every time I sign in
---
PvP is what I consider end-game now. Only thing that really challenges you
---
I have that mutation but i also use 1 peice of chameleon armor so even in full armor i go invisable.
---
If you want to run with that mutation, you can only use weightless armor .)
---
That was the inspiration for the comment heh. "free fast travel"
---
Ok no life

TL;DR the story is funny 'cause the squirrel gets dead.

Isn't this exactly how it's supposed to work? It's only when you have 0 Armor DT excluding "Weightless" legendary items.
---
please re-read my first line of my post :)

F!

---
If you have to diminish the enjoyment of fair players in order to force unfair players into playing fair you are letting down the former and you will not change the behaviour of the latter. Is a lose-lose scenario.
---
Almost a year into the game regressing in terms of efficiency six to eight months... we will have to agree to disagree.
---
15-20 minutes SBQ after 30 minute silo runs... that was in March. We are in October now, we left that behind. I won't resist the change if it comes - mostly because is futile, the devs will do what the devs will do, I will just stop running silos or joining SBQ fights and find something else to do.
---
Happened to me yesterday. Was gonna farm her, but aside from the first kill I never got anything.
---
Depends on what a buyer is willing to spend. Some people like to display a bunch of them in their display cases.
---
Outside of that they have no real value.
---
Bugs me since long time, even more since certains are in the new public event pool.
---
Have my up! Thank you.
---
There are small things in some locations. In the asylum there is a cell room with wood blocks that spells out "REDRUM" and some of the homes have meals on the table or games out in the living room.
---
Not all locations, but some show life interrupted. It's subjective. Some places are truly empty but others tell a silent story.
---
Also go back and visit places you haven't been in a long time. Once holotapes are picked up they are like loot and missing. I've found a few holotapes I've never heard in the last week.
---
Check out the observatory. It's a great set up for future quests with all the terminals, locked doors and levels. If they don't add something there it'll be a shame.
---
I have been playing since February and am a level 170.  I look on the top of West Tech every time I farm it and never have found the Pie.  I got one out of the machine but never at West Tech.
---
Guess we will see soon enough.
---
To be honest this private server thing feels like something picked out of the blue. Do people actually want this? Granted I havent been following the news that much lately but it surprised me.
---
Negative, bethesda is EST based company. Please rotate your analog clock 180 degrees for the proper time conversion.
---
Vanguard baby!
---
Each archetype is an ocean of variance in itself. I myself play "80% bloodied" :D
---
The game is being continuously adjusted for difficulty and the targets that died easy and did little, die harder and harder and hurt plenty. This is a good direction.
---
All the things I mentioned are still less OP than Strangler PA, if they fix that thing not to fry CPUs.
---
They all increase build diversity too.
---
I came outta my shell for the first time by dropping a few level 45 handmades for some dudes chillin around grafton, i hope they got upgrades before they hit 45.
---
I always thought the toxic lake behind Grafton Dam must smell like battery acid and dead fish.
---
If you liked 4 you should like this a lot.
---
Oh my god its yesterday again!
---
Well see ya later I got a certain horse race to catch!
---
Honestly I have three workshops I always take, set up extractors and then just use them as free tp spots. 
---
Two lead extractors and I get 1000 ect ammo every hour 50 cal
---
my advice: do like I did and just stop playing 76 until something of substance is available. 
---
I uninstalled this game a few months ago now because it grew boring and Beth keeps pushing back content and not fixing bugs that have existed since I played the BETA. I still check this sub hoping that some miraculous thing happened in the game, but it's usually the same ol' problems.
---
Destiny 2 has been feeling great - ironically stopped playing that to play 76, so now I'm back to D2 and there is SO MUCH TO DO it's almost overwhelming. and as you mentioned, only a few days until Outer Worlds, which according to like.. EVERY review I've seen is amazing
---
It takes nothing away from single player games. You can play solo easily. Really good game to relax with and sink a lot of hours into.
---
I guess it will be tomorrow too?  I don't know why they just didn't release more details last week, after the Inside the Vault article.  All they did by not releasing info is drive speculation through the roof.  Maybe that is what they wanted after the downer delay announcement?
---
Really?  Well that's awesome, and totally not what we're talking about.  We're talking about provided servers.
---
I think its just under a lot of stress from people confused and looking for dev comments for why there isn't a patch today. Dev tracker is great since it takes like 5 mins to see all dev comments on reddit and the official forums.
---
Im already playing groknak the barbarian on my terminal... storing the games on there would be awesome. Like a disc changer, just for holotapes or sth
---
Junkies, Instigating, Quad, FFR, 33 Railway
---
That's exactly why I dont trust new players anymore. My gifts are for brand new players, not new characters. ..
---
The issue is that the other players are doing ten to 100 times more damage than that and usually at a high dps. Essentially you are at the low end of the damage output,  so you aren't getting loot
---
hah! That's actually a very good test - i'll be doing that myself from now on.  
---
Although i'll help both like the original poster it'll help you discern who's who.
---
I saw the REDRUM thing on the balcony on the second floor of Torrence Mansion too.
---
5x Extra 40% bashing against murmrgh 👌
---
Yeah, they’re not zombies, so they won’t smell like rotting flesh. They’d smell like a burns victim if anything.
---
I guess it's probably the same bug as the Trapper chest piece. My backpack isn't showing up because the backpack on the Trapper chest and it also clips to my outfit.
---
I heard turning in 5k in candy gets you a pencil which is like one lead
---
Nope update file is tmr which means halloween stuff is next week
---
Why dont you guys just play a game, and then just stop playing when you are bored? Do something else, play a new game. Nothing has endless replay-ability. You got to level 250 dude you got your moneys worth
---
If one the community people would reply to this with 'Hi bored, I'm Bethesda.' would be great.
---
To outer worlds we go!
---
no ill just pay to skip all that extra grinding for materials. i make plenty of money. your the one who needs to get good and pay with cash. cant wait to see what else bethesda sells to make my life easier that i dont have to grind for.
---
Thanks for the info
---
So, you would rather buff a unch of other builds, risk failing to balance them, then buff  a bunch of events to the new power level (Otherwise they are too easy) than re-balance 1 build that it out of balance with the rest of the game?
---
Exactly, which is why I'm hoping for some acknowledgement, even if it's something at the main menu.
---
We need ScorchBeast King, much tougher than the queen; and he should drop level 4&amp;5 legendaries.
---
Aren't private servers coming this week? At least news on that
---
Aren't private servers planned for this week?
---
Np, I’m in the same boat!
---
Maybe it'll get better when raiders come back?
---
ANd it sucks for PVP.
---
Plays game for hundreds of hours.
---
Is bored.
---
Obligatory no shit sherlock.
---
Hopefully tomorrow as well.
---
From what I thought they are more like burn victims than rotting flesh.
---
Yeah, I'm good with people taking water from my purifiers.  If I REALLY needed it, I would lock it.  It replenishes quickly enough that I rarely notice if people are doing it.
---
If its not locked  its public domain.
---
Considering the patch isn’t until tomorrow and there was never any halloween stuff datamined, it definitely won’t be until next week. There’s still a couple more unreleased Raider things so my money’s on more of that.
---
Hopefully tomorrow with the way they worded their last ITV newsletter.
---
That isn't an improvement.
---
I've lost so many pets. I've given up for the time being. I miss my Snallygaster; Smelly Gaston!
---
Holy crap Ive never even thought about this aspect of private servers. Itd be cool to have every workshop built up, and make it feel like youve dominated the Appalachia.
---
Ya i hear ya but seems bethesda only pays attention to twitter vs us all here.

Bethesda: Hi bored!, I’m dad!
---
Me and my fellow teammates actually talk about this, ALL the time. Especially up where Grahm's meat cook is located.
---
That's a great name! It's sad to see how many people lost their pets already.
---
Berserker's is so bad I don't try to sell it. It goes straight to the scrap machine.
---
The CMs seem to be pretty responsive around here, maybe they started slacking and I just haven't noticed.
---
[erm](https://eumerch.bethesda.net/en/games/fallout/879-fallout-candle-vr) 
---
I actually own one of these and it just smells mildly displeasing, a lot like dirt and must with a bit of rot
---
Ouch!
---
You saying people are spending $100 or the game cost $100
---
The option to increase the power and synergy of perks with other builds is an option for them, but nerfing is easier I guess.  I think people who have not run a Bloodied build also don't get how quickly you died if you allow yourself to get mobbed, when I ran a full health tanky build I just stood there getting whacked and didn't care, with low health I have to be involved in surviving.   I find it much more fun and engaging, they over nerf it I guess it will be time to look for a new game.
---
You can take from mine. That's why I leave them open.

seriously your complaining about monetization by a business doing stuff to make money isnt that the point of a business? Its seriously a problem when people bring up monetization and think a business is out of line trying to make a profit on their product its ludacris i tell ya /s give me a break people like you is what wrong entitled and expect everything to be free and complain when a business tries new ways to make money.  The fact is 1. you either like the game and want to support it or 2 you hate the game or hate the practices by the company you feel are not "OK" and you dont buy their games anymore its simple. You dont come here and complain WAAA WAAA they have a skin i want and they are charging me to get it WAA WAA please its a fucking joke grow up stuff costs money its not a new concept.
---
Steamlink will change your life on those boring days.
---
I suppose they're trying to control the economy, but the economy is already starting to bypass caps and use barter or ammo as currency for expensive items. Ammo for currency is potentially terrible for inflation as there's no control over the creation of it.
---
I think they say they smell like rotting flesh constantly in tenpenny towers caulf remember wrong though paladin.
---
Weightless, AP regen, sentinels/cavaliers
---
Completely disagree. You are missing the lore somehow. The environmental story telling in this game is top notch.
---
I just recently started a new character.  I don't mule things between my high level and my new character, so I do appreciate it when people drop extra plans or materials they don't need.  
---
So far, I've found stuff people have dropped in suitcases at train stations twice.  I got a few things I needed from those.  Another time, a guy dropped a bunch of plans and did the gift emote to me.  Got me a bunch of ultracite PA plans from that.
---
Impossibile, il potenziale che ha fallout 76 ci tiene tutti incollati come mosche alla merenda
---
Not trying to be a smart ass, but at level 250 you probably should be bored. We gamers can't put that much time into a game and not be bored of it at some point. I'm about 340 hours in, and I just keep playing because I love the Fallout world, bugs and all.
---
I mey not do pvp myself but i do enjoy watching RageChronicles video's
---
In Tenpenny Tower they also say they eat brains the whole point of that is that they are prejudice to Ghouls without knowing anything about them. If you play it perfect you can have them coexist in the tower.
---
Also in the hedge maze behind that mansion you find jack wielding an axe! Or his skeleton at least
---
Honestly this'd be so easy for me since my character just has the winter jacket and jeans and glasses. I literally have the entire outfit already
---
Scrap Kits changed my life. I used to walk slowly around encumbered with a full stash budget and now I hobble around encumbered with a full stash budget and a bunch of scrap kits taking up even more weight, but I have less real money in my wallet so it all balances out. Total game changer. I really hope Bethesda makes more utility items like these for the Atom shop.
---
yeah, lots of questions too on what it will entail.
---
I keep two open and one of them kept further back with a lvl3 lock
---
So I gotta question, how do you send the tamed pets back to your camp. I’ve tried and all they do is just sit around and then wander off
---
Go for it, if they are unlocked. I keep my purifiers and junk bot unlocked for anyone to use. I also never lock resources at workshops. There is plenty to go around after hitting a certain level, so why not share.
---
This is what always gets me. When I buy a game I don’t expect that I’ll only be playing that one game forever. It’s okay to just go play something else instead of playing a game that bores you.
---
Besides, this guy is complaining about being bored at level 250?! Like, you’ve clearly gotten more than enough playtime out of it. Just play a different game for a little while lmao
---
It’s called being done with a game. Go enjoy something else and come back for fresh content later. I don’t get how people think it’s the developers fault when they’re bored after 1000 hours of gameplay
---
If its not locked its fair game.
---
It's the POINT of the thing.
---
i'm saying i spent around 100 bucks on preorder. as most larger games cost around 100 bucks for preorder these days.
---
Tomorrow they say on twitter.
---
Does verdant season even change anything in the game? I never felt like when I walked into a biome and the notice that it’s verdant season and to enjoy the abundance I never seen more enemies spawns or greater loot drops or xp buffs or more flora pick ups so I don’t know what it means even a year later.
---
Also haven't dropped for me ...
---
Was going to mention this too. I don’t have it but I was tempted to get it!
---
Verdant season gives you double drops off plants and I believe more meat from animals. Its pretty crap unless you're flux farming.
---
I'm a full on melee build, never fought one before, and the stupid thing wouldn't land so I could pummel it. All I had on me was a Marksman's sniper rifle, so I went in totally unprepared and unqualified, but sometimes you just have enough of the things shouting at you and you realize today's the day it dies.
---
AHH, bugger. My plan is to have two examples being used at once.
---
seriously as a consumer you're defending hyper monetization by a corporation? i'm all for good products making money. but at no point during fallout 76 life so far did i think this was a 'good' product, i merely put up with the bad graphics, reused assets, clunky gameplay, etc....because I love the lore behind fallout. It's not your job as a consumer to champion increased pricing, it's the role of the consumer to speak up when pricing gets out of hand and reign in corporate greed.
---
Outer Worlds in roughly 48-hours!
---
Well, I'm around level 60 and I try to farm the Encryptid event, but 1 low lv player shows up, a level 150 and 400 that just farm the other legendaries and don't care about the imposter sheepsquatch (Also, i had to be the siphon for 2 pylons and I kept dying). So, i could always use some extra help
---
There was a period (until recently) when possum badges were completely broken and not rewarding from dailies. 
---
I can confirm that they are now rewarding badges for completion, but you do not get the "possum badge pop-up" even if you receive a badge.  You can check your PIP &gt; Stat &gt; Collections and they should increment there.
---
Thanks for your input, I'll relay it straight to the devs!
---
Because they know we’re going to riot about the outrageous price and the zero control we’ll have over our server and the continued instability along with it.
---
Scrap Kits.
---
Thank you! I don't know why people seem to be taking it as a personal offense or something that I wanted the loot or that it took me so long to kill but honestly, my character's not built to fight these things while they're flying?? So...
---
Yeah, the FFR Plasma isn’t even close to a legacy one.
---
So you spend a few days bitching about the pay to win, then when provided with another option, throw it back in  my face and  then claim you will just buy it.
---
Hypocritical much.
---
78 I think?? It's been a hot second since I checked. Ever since 50 I just don't see the point. But yeah, I'm a total  melee build so super not good with fighting them in the air!
---
because making a quest for an item is more work and less profitable than an item at the atom shop. ;)
---
I'm a full on melee build so I'm super not suited to fighting them when they don't land.
---
I am level 23 on PC and would love to get some help leveling and team up.
---
I just started fresh and find myself having a fantastic time. I'm going it alone which allows me to concentrate on reading terminals,  exploring random locations, and keep better track of quests (I had so many last game I was overwhelmed). It just feels better now, feels more my own. Heck even my photo album is shaping up a lot better. And there's so much to do I'm no longer feeling jaded. I honestly feel like restarting for me breathe new life into 76.
---
But you have to keep up with repairing and breaking it again if you put on a hazmat since the hazmat will remove all armor and you can't equip broken armor. It was too much trouble for me to worry about with my Berserker character. Plus I created my Berserker for the aesthetics so that she could run around in underarmor without the armor covering it. RP purposes.
---
\~ 24 hours.  Then the scrip timer resets, and ye shall be free.
---
  Meantime, there is a tinker bench in the station.  You can always scrap some junk.
---
Yes it's bad for pvp now
---
It's the POINT of the thing. After spending so long killing it, you better believe I wanted that wing.
---
your so close to getting the point.
---
Roll a new character or play a different game for a while. After several hundred hours of game play it's weird to be complaining about the game being "boring".
---
I’ve never noticed so it’s pretty much shit.Flux farming is beneficial too bad finding high rad fluids is a bitch to do and your best chance is whitesprings
---
Yup.
---
I think this game really is a matter of taste.  Not all people like all things.
---
I personally love the SP Fallout's, but I also loved 76 for every minute I put into it.  But they are not the same.
---
It's fun to play. A challenge. It works well in sneak and with the right perks. I think it's called berserker for a reason -- not in their right mind.
---
I think we need an official statement on the ‘rename limit’
---
Is this to limits server load somehow? Seems odd though as the NPC models are still all loaded and running.
---
I have the point thank you. 
---
Your just trolling for a response because your a selfish, angry waste of human existance.
---
At least it wasn't the Queen... Its corpse will probably follow you around for a while anyway, randomly falling from the sky every so often.
---
I suspect they picked wednesday because it's A) the date the bombs fell in the game, and B) it's the 1 year anniversary of the beta launch.
---
There is actually an attachment for Virtual Reality headsets that lets you smell in-game stuff.. whether its good or bad is up for debate lol
---
Everyone does
---
I’m glad to see I’m not the only one who feels this way. Level 250 is a hell of a lot of time to play a game. Go outside, live a little
---
Sort of the same thing happened to me when I was lv 30. A high lv player came in asking if I needed help, i did the thumbs up. He helps me with the robots ( i had the code and keycard) and he teached me some basic things. He crafted me a set of Excavator power armor ( I still have it) and sold me some serums.
---
(Completed) Confidence Man
---
Look Kim not trying to attack you or your post but how exactly is this pay to win?
---
i feel kinda like a legend running around in a prototype hazmat suit
---
It's on the 23rd us time, i.e tomorrow
---
actually I'm saying enough with the whining..
---
what idiots paid $100 for a game ? what monthly service billing are you referring to???? def not FO76.
---
Show me one item in Fallout 76 that costs $20 worth of atoms that I can't get for free by earning atoms in game. didn't think so.
---
They haven't monetized the game, they have monetized your need for a skin (or whatever little shiny thing you want) immediately and a "mum's (as you say) inability to say no to their children. I would think it would be an excellent opportunity to teach your child patience, or how to earn something by working for it, but these days most parents have yet to learn that.
---
Bethesda doesn't make you spend one cent for anything in the atomic shop, your need for things immediately does.
---
i started a new character (my main just finished collecting all mags, (thanks chickady!)) that will specialize in alcohol so ill plant him right next to biv.
---
in this playthru, its striking how diff the experience is compared to day1.  the thing i'd note tho is the quests system/ui could prob use an update.  there's a confusing conflagration of daily events, miscellaneous main, side, daily, sometimes the dailies don't pop up like they're supposed to  (is there a max quests like eso?).
---
playing consistently i worry that ill not "see the forest b/c the r trees in the way" when evaluating my experience with this title.  surely, the game is much, much better than release, but still have some crucial issues to resolve.  (has anyone been getting the Appalachia Limbo Champion glitch?  where the enemy dosen't get up from their "resting" position to attack u?  thats a new 'fun' one that popped up.)
---
LOL nothing in atom shop is necessary or a forced purchase. I have not spend a dime beyond my initial 25 dollars.  Please tell me how they are forcing monetization, tell me who forced you to buy the 100 dollar version. What pricing is out of hand and in what way do you feel they are forcing you to do anything in the atom shop. Nothing in the atom shop is game changing or gives you advantage. The mentality that you spend 100 dollars give you the right to dictate anything is also kind of entitled in my opinion 1. not everyone feels like you so you cant dictate the games direction or decisions based on what you enjoy 2. You don't own the company you don't own the IP and your $100 is a drop in the bucket when it comes down to their cost. 3 the game has come a long way and they have improved a lot of things in my opinion yea i get disconnect now and again or a freeze here and there but i get the same in other games too so the point is mute. Like i said if you dont like the business practices no one is forcing you to support the company take your money elsewhere dont come here bitch and complain and then as soon as their next game comes along you pre order again because at that point you being a hypocrite and you've lost all credibility.
---
The default in Fallout 4 is 20 according to what I found searching for "fallout 4 time scale", although I did not verify it myself.
---
Love the Lorax attitude
---
Same with addictol, it's near the purified water in the italian version --&gt; aqcua purificata - addictol
---
And what exactly is being won?
---
Preposterous!!
---
People in private servers can farm any rare item they want and sell it in the public server for huge profits. They can just nip to their private world for junk while public people need to go around the world looking for unlooted places. They can claim and farm workshops for Fusion Cores, ammo etc. without the fear of having the workshop contested. How does this not make them have an extreme advantage?
---
Never be afraid to ask :) 
---
Scrip is what you can cash in Legendary items for at the Legendary exchange machine at every train station. You can also earn it during Meat Week events.  Then you use Scrip to purchase Legendary wares from Purveyor Murmrgh at the Berkeley Springs train station.
---
go talk with mi tia, Murmurgh, near Berkley Springs.  she'll explain in detail.
---
Because you pay for servers I am guessing? But we know almost nothing about private servers at this point. Not sure why s/he couldn’t wait to complain until tomorrow lol
---
Why are, you, talking, like William Shatner?
---
Same lol but I use the normal one
---
What advantage do you gain? It's not like drops will be any different than they are now.
---
yeah they sure arent controlling the economy when people are expecting max caps on 5 different characters for a single item lol, thats just more tedious than anything. IMO if they wanted to control the economy better, caps should be shared across characters, at least that would remove a level of tediousness from the whole thing.
---
 same with addictol, it's near the purified water in the italian version --&gt; acqua purificata - addictol
---
Developers rarely create new engines from scratch, modifying and improving the old engine is how devs usually work. Just because it's "the same engine" doesn't mean the code is the same, or even similar.
---
It's like that dilemma with an old car, say you replace a part of it every year until every single part of it has been replaced, can you still call it the same car? And if not, at what point does it go from being the same car with new parts to being a new car?
---
Seriously? Who taught y'all that pay to win means winning in PvP? P2W is defined as paying to have an advantage that non paying players do not.
---
The lack of information seems somewhat worrying, I have a feeling this patch might be controversial, so the details are not revealed until as late as possible.
---
Here's my 1H Berserker build alt. She's lvl 70 something. I stopped playing her to build a new character but if I ever come back to the game, I would play her again. She can clear Whitesprings by herself, and does queen fights. Much easier to play solo than on a team because of sneak. Of course, not anywhere near as powerful or damage resistant as other builds, but viable if you play the character right. She has all classes of Berserker weapons since I asked people to keep an eye out for them so they wouldn't get rid of them. I had fun playing her.

---
me too, its just a waiting game for it to land sometimes
---
Same, never once got a Possum badge from a quest.
---
corporations hurt me but atleast i have enough of a spine to stick up for my fellow gamers when changes could effect their enjoyment of a fair game even if it doesnt effect me.
---
seriously your talking about a collection of  stuff i basically get free by walking around and collect daily is an advantage. Wow....
---
Yes but imagine farming for FCs at Poseidon all day with no fear of having the factory taken from you. You may argue semantics but that's a clear advantage.
---
lol.  we're friendly, and concerned for OP's health.

---
He asked for something that is available in the shop that's not available in the game for free. My answer is scrap kits. There is no equivalent free functionality in the game.
---

Jk lol

Alt currency from scrapping legendary kit. Newish machine at train stations.
---
I run a junkie rifle build, and most things die before they get close enough so I can afford to go with a "quality of life" assortment. I have 2 pieces with bolstering, 2 vanguard, and 1 chameleon as primary effects, and for 2nd/3rd effects 2 have AP refresh, 2 with fall damage reduction, and 1 poison resist.
---
Think you will find that workshops and public events won’t be on private servers.
---
i'm not actually coming here to bitch and complain. i just made a point. you're the one with the almost unhinged rants. it's just odd to me that a consumer would spend time on the internet working pr for a corporation. bethesda is not hurting for money ya know. they're doing fine. and maybe if some of these cheaper attempts at blind profiteering failed, maybe they'd be forced to actually make good products that folks will be happy to spend money on. but do you, you're tirades don't appear to be adding anything to the conversation.
---
Do it! It's a blast. All the work was 100% worth it
---
We don't know that yet.
---
Absolutely!
---
ummm i collect scrap the whole time im in game its pretty much an equivalent
---
My son also lost interest after playing for a while and complains that there's nothing to do. We used to play together from time to time. I think the biggest deterrent is the slog from level 30 to level 50 where you're not good enough to do the fun hard stuff and where the easy stuff has lost interest. It's why I always encourage people to take time with the low level stuff so it can carry you until you get to the high level stuff. There's tons of content in the game, I'm still discovering stuff I haven't seen yet at level 118. 
---
Also, Fallout 76 is easy compared to other Fallout games, particularly if you played survival mode on them. Fallout 4 on survival is no joke. Coming to 76 after that is a cake walk. I think they made the game balanced with the idea that PvP would add the extra challenge, but it didn't work out that way. After level 100, pretty much the only things that are challenging any more are Arktos, Encryptid and Scorched Earth. And I even went into Arktos yesterday and forgot to swap out my camp perks and still only died a few times.
---
Do you even know what scrap kits do?
---
But im curvy and my character is an anorexic lesbian ;-;
---
Doubtful. They're dropping patch 14 tomorrow, so it doesn't make sense to do any maintenance today.
---
haha jokes on you i cant smell anyways but jokes aside yea it would be pretty crazy
---
It's the Stalker outfit from the atomic shop, along with the pirate hat.
---
Normally I would agree with you, but this is supposed to be a "live service" game, as in constantly updating, as in, could be (almost) the only game you play for years, as with some MMO's without the lifesucking commitment of an MMO. If we are at a point of saying "time to play another game" then they really fucked up the live service game concept, not the monetization though of course, no surprise that the one way this game "sets a standard" is in how expensive the damn MTXs are.
---
ok ill pat you on the head and move on
---
Yes, the xbox has a bad reputation for me with scrolling menus. Sooooo slooooow
---
Doubt it, probably so its easier to play, accessibility and all.
---
I disagree that a lot of stuff in the atomic shop is p2w but if people can pay for their own servers that can boost their character in any way, adding OP weapons or increasing attributes pass 15 and then be able to transfer said character back to an official server than that is pay to win.
---
Basically just ask for no transfers from private servers to adventure mode.
---
Scarecrow from Batman Begins.
---
Ik it's viable but it could still use a buff, I also don't know anyone who runs this build except myself, im trying to be original lol
---
I wouldn't put my money on it :P
---
you're right, im sure if Obsidian really wanted the rights to Fallout IP, they would have got into a bidding war for it, sounds like they were more than willing to "give it up".
---
On my main, I never pulled frog legs from a random card draw until LATE into the game.  I did finally get it as a random draw instead of spending overseer tickets on it.  But I still don't use it.  I have enough agility for it, but it would end up being my only agility perk.  I don't regret it, for the most part.  
---
I do remember, early on, being envious of those that had frog legs - I love having marsupial in the main game, so I get the attraction.  But I learned to adapt - I do pretty well in NW - I tend to focus on sniper rifles and pistols - and I try to pick my battles carefully with distance being my friend.
---
Berserker does nothing for melee unless you are a sneak and in that case it should be ninja lol
---
i paid 100 bucks for the game. as most games 'ultimate' editions or whatever preorder costs around that. i'm that idiot. monthly service fee is coming with private servers. which i will probably pay for because i'd like to use the mods. liberty prime skin cost about 20 bucks. beth doesn't make me spend money. no. but it's a product i have spent money on, and so i have the absolute right to complain all i want about the cost.
---
Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long.
---
everyone seems to ignore the fact that you can get everything in the atomic shop for free with a little time and effort but in today's society everyone need instant gratification.. 
---
**THAT** is what gaming companies monetize.  They are selling you a shortcut.
---
No one has the patience to work for something anymore.
---
Nothing new there
---
With a private server drops can be altered to give high end items easily so it's not the best idea to have that character transfer to adventure mode.
---
Burn victims with large surface area affected and no medical care out in the wide world? 
---
That would take about 48 hours to start to smell of rot. You'd be looking at serious tissue decay and oozing infection within two or three days, which comes with smells aplenty. 
---
There is a good reason people with major burns are stabilized and then transferred to hospitals with dedicated burn units, and it is almost entirely infection control and constant removal of dead, decaying tissue as it releases from healthy tissue. Burns are... pretty freaking gross.
---
I can see allowing a transfer to the private server, just not back. I'm sure a lot of people want to play with their partner or friends but don't want to abandon their character. 
---
I think the duping nightmare is going to roar back. I was on Ebay the other day looking for a Chiltons or Haynes manual and was getting ads for FO76 stuff. Have you seen this stuff? People are raking in cash on there. $150 for full bobbleheads &amp; magazine sets. $50 for weapons. The prices are outrageous. I looked at one seller, the bobblehead/mag one and they've sold dozens of sets! Private servers are going to make some Ebay sellers wealthy. I have no idea who is buying this stuff. It's crazy.
---
So you're saying we just need to Chernobyl the entire earth, wait around a couple million years, and then we'll have entire of planet we can mine for coal?  That seems like a winning situation right there.
---
its craps everything in you inv and puts in it the stash. its really not a big deal was my point i walk around and collect scrap all day and can scrap anywhere also if your stash is full it will not store the scrap. it will promt and tell you so, the point it does have a semi equivalent and its not a game changer
---
Ha ha that's me lol
---
Anorexia isn't good for your health any way, so don't worry about it
---
I'll take an instigating, furious, explosive, vampires drill. Turns all enemies to chunks and heals you at the same time.
---
You're a toxic blowhard that seems hyper offended by people being critical of a video game. i'm blocking you now. peace.
---
But burn victims aren't constantly being healed by fire where Ghouls are constantly healing from radiation.
---
Yeah, yeah, Im getting better at it. Recovery, I mean. I based ym character off how I felt at the time. I think its time for a new one. 
---
Also im too fUCKING SHORT AND EVERYONES THE SAME HEIGHT.
---
Yes there is.  
---
If I do my dailies and weeklys I can buy scrap kits with atoms. 
---
They cost atoms, not dollars. 
---
Atoms are acquired by doing in game challenges.
---
Do you want to trade?
---
Crap sorry meant to press the "fix the damn trading glitch, this has been going on for too long" button
---
To be fair p2w stems from paying for something that is only available through real money and that is better than anything in game.
---
But yeah allowing a possible boosted character from a private world into adventure mode could have severe repercussions.
---
Completely agree
---
I keep checking them just in case got nothing else so far though 😜
---
Si, biscotti di mierda! Que dulce che!
---
scrap kits cost atoms, just like everything thing else in the atomic shop. Atoms that I can get for free in game by just playing thus they are free. You'll have to do better than that.
---
I imagine it wouldn't be too bad. I think the worst smelling parts would be super mutant camps, but overall I imagine it would smell really fresh. Think about it, they'd have been using nuclear fusion for power, so less pollution for one. Fallout 76 is long enough after the war that things would've been making a noticeable difference with less humans, so the air would be much fresher. If you're talking in Fallout 3, 4, NV, then they're much longer after the war, so it would have even more time for the world to have essentially cleaned itself from humanity... I think the air would smell nicer and cleaner than any of us have ever smelled irl.
---
Honestly I didn’t get this at first but then it came to me:
---
YES!!!! omg its so freaking annoying I will constantly miss because I cant see the stupid dot
---
Exactly!
---
Dude, go back to English class and learn how the comma is supposed to be used.

I mentioned this in the above -- it's not that simple of a solution -- see the third paragraph.
---
I just use my banjo when AFK. Provides music for visitors and gives me the well tuned bonus when I get back.
---
I think it should become a feature in the game where they stay in the machine for a hour after someone has scrapped it. 
---
Or even better The Purveyor has someone who works with them and goes around station to station collecting the weapons and armour back up for The Purveyor to sell again.
---
lol entitled as i thought

I can see events not being available but workshops will definitely be there.
---
You have Todd saying one of the reasons they like the engine is because modders know it so well.
---
The changes have been superficial at best, thats why you still have bugs from previous games.
---
&gt;modifying and improving the old engine is how devs usually work
---
Understand that this engine is almost 2 decades old. At some point its time to move on.
---
&gt;say you replace a part of it every year until every single part of it has been replaced
---
That isn't the case.
---
And sure, it takes work  to make a new engine, but its worth it. Not to mention, if you don't wanna do that, you can you know... just use Unreal. &lt;-&lt;
---
I can do all of that on the normal adventure mode servers too. It just might take me a couple server hoped to find what I'm looking for. I'm also not afraid of having a workshop contested but even still I can't see that as an extreme advantage. I get fusion cores from doing events quite often. Certainly frequently enough to cover running around in pa all the time if I wanted to as well as having some to sell in my vendor
---
Yes, you can get, like, 20 a day realistically. Add to that the bug that challenges complete and give no rewards if you play NW. Sometimes challenges don't work, are impossible to complete because they need you to things not in the game (eg Camera challenges for a week), Vault 94 challenges don't give Atoms, etc), while items cost upto 2800 Atoms or more, which means I'll roughly need to grind for 2-3 months, assuming weeklies work (which they don't often, like the SIlo code challenge, and also auto complete in NW without giving rewards).
---
This game has been out a year+ and its not a sub based game. I would guess, and this is just a guess, I could be way off here, that the majority of the income for this game has been generated by box sales, and not people buying atoms. Few reasons for this..one is that atoms can be earned in game. After a year, most people probably have earned a good deal of atoms. I think its possible I'm wrong here, and I've mentioned it before, because Fallout Shelter has a similar model setup and its free, but has been around for a very long while. So its possible there are enough people buying atoms with real cash..impossible for me to know this though. If numbers are available to contest that point, i havent seen them. 
---
Secondly, its mostly cosmetic items in the atom shop and so the lure to purchase atoms with real cash is much lower for, I'd guess, the majority of people. 
---
This leads me to the third hunch..Bethesda saw how many people bought the junk bot and fridge and have decided more utility items can be introduced. Its not a coincidence they've announced that. They want to drive more people to the Atom store to generate potential revenue because box sales have dried up. And so I agree, it behooves Bethesda to keep people interested, but again, this particular community is not representative of the whole...or even close. This is the vocal minority. Bethesda would be foolish to take what this community says as gospel. They should mine for valuable feedback and suggestions (diamond in the rough), but filter the rest of the crap right on out.
---
All of that said..I personally dont give two shits how Bethesdas (or any game company) finances are or what they need to do to achieve interest in the player base. I understand them, but thats of no concern to me. The game is still fun/interesting to me, so I will continue to play. When that changes, I'll move on.
---
On top of West Tek
---
no they don't.  base games are for the most part $59.99.  your referring to the gold/premium editions (or whatever they call them) that give you extra crap and access to the beta a few days early.  No one forces you to buy that.  YOU  choose to.
---
I have a spine.  
---
I just agree with everything Bethesda is doing.  I am sorry you are not intelligent enough to  understand capitalism and free commerce.
---
touche....
---
I could easily make $1k selling my gear on ebay but I'm not savy on how that works. Say I sell you a weapon, we meet up and trade then they dispute the charge. How does that work.
---
You are doing it wrong then. 
---
I regularly bring in 100-150 a day
---
I'm a low-level player on PC and I'd love some help! I want friends who don't just carry me through everything. I'm currently level 50 and have yet to defeat the SBQ.
---
yeah I do that too because it's right next to the "fix the damn trading glitch, this has been going on for too long. button.
---
That is literally how p2w is defined: paying to reduce the grind.
---
He is retired
---
I really wish you didn’t have to physically pick them up for the achievements, my comic book store would finish the achievement for tons of people. I’ve been hoarding them for months running the comic book farm loop is basically all I do these days
---
Use the triggers to scroll faster..
---
 Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
Disco Elysium is getting incredible reviews
---
LOL what really sucks and would be highly controversial is I think Whitespring and the cliffside all the way up to Blackwater Mine are a perfect PVP zone. 
---
I'm realistic, that would create a ripple and divide in the community so big....just yeah. But if they could design something with similar elements where there is both open space and cover that would be amazing. 
---
In survival I had few experiences with prolonged battles in Watoga but it also seemed pretty awesome.
---
Right. So, as someone who spends more, any complaint about future pricing is even more valid. Thanks for your time. You seem really set on defending micro-transactions, coz I guess making billionaire corps marginally richer is important to you. I don't care about the topic enough to continue the dialogue. Have a good one. Blocking you now.
---
Hats are in general easy and not worth much.  Uniforms I believe red is rarest followed by forest (not green).  White is most common followed by brown then blue.  Others in bewteen.
---
There was a post recently in r/falloutlore that mentioned that the ghouls don't smell bad
---
If they gave players enough stuff to do outside of getting a slightly better gun maybe it would be less of an issue.
---
It makes a SOUND?? See, that would have been a relevant piece of info on the shop page!
---
Using rads to keep health down, or just a bit of rads and let the bar fluctuate?  I've got a mix or armor from the sale and a JE minigun I'm itching to try out.
---
It's not possible. There are 3 daily challenges each day that give atoms each, giving you 30-40 atoms (usually they are 10 atom each). Other daily challenges don't give you atoms. You are adding the weekly challenge atoms to your count as well. All this, assuming the challenges don't bug out at all.
---
Best single letter comment ever. And very appropriate!
---
Red outfit, all colors of the hats are freely available.
---
I'm in a similar boat, however I actually stopped playing around level 185. I was very late in getting into the game (first meat week), but within a couple months I felt like I had not only done everything, but the game was getting tedious to the point it stopped being fun. Albeit, the main issue I had was my Mega Sloth was randomly dead when I returned to my base one day, and it took multiple different days of server hopping to get another. Once I had another, that was kinda the last thing I really wanted. That, and not being able to do the scorchbeast queen with friends who didn't have damage based characters made it boring overall. I hope with patch 14 at least a good amount of QOL changes improve the daily gameplay, because I haven't seen a real reason to log on in a couple weeks, for me personally.
---
With how it's likely going to come out, the only thing you will be paying for is peace &amp; quiet.  The odds of getting any drop for anything will be exactly the same - without some toolbag one-shotting all of the legendaries, griefing events, seal-clubbing at workshops, etc..
---
I hear ya. I own each magazine many times over, but have just a few that I need to pick up to complete the challenges. I've done the loops soooo many times, getting dizzy over here.
---
After FO4, I promised myself I would take my time. I'm one of those people that remember most everything once I've done it, so a second character is not too fulfilling.
---
I have Discord, but I usually just use the game chat. You?
---
lol, what do you want?  A congrats for being a douche medal?
---
Not having to compete with others effectively increases your drop rate chances. See the problem?
---
correct, with the weeklys and unfinished other challenges, I average 100-150 a day.
---
You have to look at all that is available, not just the 30-60 you get from dailies.
---
Good point. Same with the ammo factory. Just let it run all day. You would never need ammo again
---
red my man
---
all hats are same, equally worthless
---
they dont ignore it it just doesnt justify their point of view so they completely disavow it.People will complain no matter what, certain people want everything handed to them on a silver platter and if it isnt the way they picture it they feel like its their duty to make others understand they have been wronged.
---
Then my point remains valid. It is 30-40 atoms a day, not 100+ as you were claiming.
---
Some people love the challenge of leveling up a new character while others prefer to continue building on what they have.  I have a strength build, a perception build and a pistol (agility, luck) build.  Each one was fun to bring along through the ranks in their own way.  Also, I learned from my first build which perks are important (for damage) early on and which ones are just quality of life and can wait until later.
---
In the end, it all comes down to what you enjoy.  No reason you can't start a new character with a different build out, and return to the original when you feel like that play style.
---
I knew you could with everything else, but where do the wood extractors go? On the wood piles? And I would get that robot just for the dad jokes...
---
You can only tame the lone random encounter animals. The others can only be pacified.
---
If they can be tamed you get the option right at the beginning, to either tame or pacify.
---
How many challenges have you completed? Because those free atoms dry up pretty fast.
---
Can you do a mirelurk king? Nothing would need with me lol
---
how would u feel about being able to "save" pets at camp being like an atomshop item?  or buying pets directly from atom store, (as opposed to only allow pets "found" in the wasteland)?
---
not looking to pick a fight or anything, but a sincere evaluation of differing opinions on the matter in this thread.  what do you think are the allowable/nonallowable aspects of pet ownership that can be monetized?  if we don't make an effort to define it, then they'll just repackage it as whatever or even reduce base player functionality (eg wasteland whisperer perk behind paywall)
---
Yeah, workshops are the real problem with this. They would have to limit them on private servers somehow, whether it's more waves of enemies, less resources or time limits, but basically in one day you could set up all the workshops on a server and get them to farm, then have all the resources you want whenever you want. Player vendors would become mostly useless to anyone with a server.
---
Ha read it and thinking the same. Least he knows how to juice the purveyor. If beth would add some sort of penalty for dying, like xp loss. Maybe huge xp loss. That would stop a lot where they die, wipe a bunch, die, and xp rolls in either way. I've always loved glass cannons in all mmos, but there was usually a xp penalty.
---
Like in kalonline you could de-level and the xp loss was huge. I used to troll so bad in that game kiting a lot of mobs and then they'd lose aggro if you ran into the water. Then ai would turn on nearest guy. Lineage 2 remember had a level cap, you could die back to the starting xp of a level but not de-level.
---
At least they have junk dropped and that does rage some people, but they took it out of events!
---
what else did you want, you juiced out the game beyond limits.... it also means you loved it and the money you spent for it was well worth it..
---
I really dont care because there constantly full when i go to get em and i have 8 industrials
---
Lmao I put a 1000 hours in a game now I’m bored   You’re a fucking moron
---
Actually Scrap kits can be obtained by digging treasure, its not 100% but it is obtainable, the only thing that doesn't have a free alternative are collectrons and refrigerators.
---
It is $15/month.
---
Nope, they are not. Urban myth just like "SBQ scales with players".
---
I just remember release dates being repeatedly bumped only for use to get a laggy, buggy dlc. I know it's been years, but it makes me VERY nervous that a game with the bugs we have now is having a dlc delayed...
---
Yes it is. No game is going to stay fresh forever. If you’ve played through everything the game has and are done, play a new game until they add stuff. They’ve already announced when new stuff is coming, what more do you want them to do?
---
Maybe someone else had a camp there also on the server you were on before you logged in and they scrapped that stuff and the server hadn't reset the objects yet. I'm just speculating though. Did you try server hopping to see if they come back? I've seen the PA station missing at the gorge junkyard down the hill because the previous owner scrapped it. Maybe that's what happened.
---
I don't know what you do when you play but I average 50 atoms each time I play and I'm not trying to get them.  when I do I can easily clear 100 in one session.  
---
what item cost 2800??  or more??  the most I saw was armor for 1800.
---
But your making my point for me. your saying your not willing to earn the atoms for free you would rather pay for them.
---
Yeah! I forgot about this ...
---
Usually I'm trying to find camp owner on the map but it is time consuming.
---
That's a risk they are taking.  I'm amazed Bethesda isn't doing something about it...its pretty rampant and against the TOS
---
Thats when the bombs fell.
---
Would be nice if we could use atoms, and that we could buy bigger servers with more currency/atoms. Eg 10 slots = 5.99 a month. 20 = 9.99 a month
---
Shhhh, they must not know you know
---
The first fight I remember was just so awesome as a low level and long fight, this time he melted in like 4 shots 😂 kinda wish it would scale it up with level a bit more
---
Would that mean Fallout 76 would be broadly open to modding, I have a few cosmetic mods running but nothing major *(glowing ore is my favourite and plants, they are so pretty)* as I'm always a bit worried if they decide to pull the plug on everyone using them.
---
Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
Source?
---
so you agree in a decline of players that comes from people looking at those who just pay to get every edge possible and realizing that in order to also have similar progression they have to buy things too. but instesd they realize whats the point of me putting effort in to collect things if someone can just pay to skip it and they didnt have to experience the game the same way i did?
---
One question after having a quick look, wouldn't life giver be a good quality of life perk to have for that kinda build/higher endurance? Since you have little to no DR, I thought health perks would be better for a build of that. I've been tempted to try something like junkie and all, but I don't want to have to manage chems and what not.
---
What places do you hit ? Wanna trade location tips ? Do you hit the meat shack ? Lots of people skip that because of the three critters but it has two spots for magazines and they tend to be the harder to get ones
---
You get no argument from me. They are great for passive resource gains while you are doing something else. The only thing I push is that you have to accept that risk. I don't want people to stop using workshops, I want people to stop complaining when they do get contested. 
---
A low level grinding their first character is a prime candidate to get absolutely steamrolled and lose a whole days worth of junk simply because they didn't know any better. That's what I hope to prevent. I'm not going to take a workshop from that guy, but somebody out there will.
---
You will eventually run out challenges. Many players have. Many of the challenges are bugged and don't give rewards.
---
There have been a few bundles at 2800 before.
---
That's how I price my stuff in the vendor to be honest. I would never pay that much for stuff. It's kinda crazy
---
If that's true then how do I have 6 scrap kits when I never bought a single scrap kit?
---
I only have myself to go on and althouvh i buy more than the average, its certainly nowhere near the big spebders and i have probably put in about £100 into buying atoms, that was with me puposly not buying them for ages and also limiting how much i was gonna spend at any 1 time, i get a lot of camp items though but im nowhere near the levels of the completionist players who will buy everything that comes to the shop.  
---
So off the bat from me alone they are losing what would pribably be around £30 a month in atom sales (since i didnt start buying until a couple months back)
---
South Park game had a smell-o-vision device to smell all the fart jokes.... So.... They do exist. 🤷
---
Yeah moth man is supper skittish most the time, startle it at all and it’s gone in the wind 😂
---
But know what, that is the question, sometimes this game is creepy.
---
It is for me. 100-150 a day is my average.  If you cant do that, im sorry, L2P 
---
Maybe you should save your atoms better then instead of buying every cheap item that pops up just to have it.   Save for what you really want then.
---
That's racist
---
Did you buy any of the FO4 costume bundles?
---
That flavor -- so sweet, so transitory.  Now, the only thing that will last forever is the memory of that fleeting, winsome delicacy.
---
You have my condolences.
---
Yeah, I have looked at "completed auctions" and seen single guns go for over $100 or armor sets for $250.  Who the hell has that kinda money to spend on a digital item in a video game?  And why?  Doesnt make sense.
---
No, to be or not to be. THAT is the question
---
Wow, quite the collection.  Some of the shots can't possibly be duplicated!!  Memorable times.   Thanks for sharing.
---
30,000 caps.
---
Since this last conversation, I have begun using it again and I’m kind of reluctant to sell now.
---
I'm fine with either, don't have a preference because only one person has ever talked to me in the game before, so I don't know how well the in game system holds up.
---
Maybe it functions as a “live service” game for people who actually have “lives.” 
---
For real, no offense but we live in a time where we are bombarded by games, there are so many games out and constantly releasing.   I struggle to keep up and I can usually play about 2hours a day + more on the weekend! (That’s a lot of time for an adult with a full time job) 
---
You aren’t being required to pay a monthly subscription so if your bored, find another game!
---
Use 3* butcher's bounty to farm tick blood. I get way more blood from that perk than standard drops.
---
xD My bad I'm an idiot
---
I'm at the point where I'd find any mod that seemed interesting and load it to get weeks more gameplay out it.  But we can't load mods that add new areas or challenges to FO76.  I fired up Cities: Skylines for the first time in a while yesterday and have been comptemplating taking another shot at completing an Angels/Bobs Factorio run.
---
I'm personally disappointed that there has not been much content released for adventure in a year now. Wild Appalachia was great, we needed more stuff like that. Instead we got a battle royal full of cheaters, and a delayed release. Don't get me wrong I'm fine with wastelanders being pushed back if it is good. But my gripe is that it feels like more work is put into the atomshop that making a quality play experience. The devs just need to put a little more polish and less jury-riging and this game would be ten times better. Hopefully next year will change this and will draw back more people wanting a better ppay experience. I have no doubt private servers will help.
---
My wife wants me to sell everything lol
---
That's OK - I've been in your camp few times ;) But I think it can be much more convenient if we can see it on the map.
---
Get Butcher’s bounty max level, go to Vault 76, kill ticks at the moonshiners shack and lumber mill, Search every corpse. Usig Butcher’s bounty on ticks gives you blood and theres plenty of them in these two spots, making it great for farming
---
Bought one for 7k caps 28 minutes ago, good luck though, sounds like you've got somebody who really wants it.
---
Usually weapon requests here are annoying or impractical so believe me when i say this - a belt fed shotgun sounds amazing.
---
I feel like you'll hit the build limit before you hit the height limit there. I'm tempted to go try it now...
---
90% chance it's private instances, not private servers.
---
Sounds like DLC, which is still totally a thing. Usually get way more for your money with traditional DLC, though, the pricing on the atom shop is what's really wack
---
I always carry my VE handmade. Kepts me alive through nearly all encounters. Came in handy when doing the raid forsure. 
---
Best gun IMO
---
It all depends on the multiplayer framework part. I never tried using mods with 76, but since cheaters are rampant, I don't know what kind of file/process verification the game does.
---
You'd def be able to extensively mod it if you could host the server software, the way it stands now, I'd be careful in using them in fear of a ban.
---
And you just know they won't let you host because they wanna sell you their verified mods.
---
Fun fact in a bit of lore reading I did on a Reddit post the other day, in one of the older games you read the logs of someone from right after the fall and he says that although they look like walking corpses they don't smell of rot or anything. It doesn't say they smell good obviously but it says that they don't have a strong enough smell that it's noticeable, and that's coming from someone who's new to the wasteland not someone who would have already adjusted to all the smells. I assume the lack of smell is because they're not dead like zombies, they are technically mutants. Also as we know ghoulification makes you live nearly forever so even though you'd look like a 2 month old strawberry, your body is actually preserved quite well. PS the lack of undamaged skin probably prevents sweating so no BO!
---
I would be too worried that there are Bethesda people buying stuff and then once there in game Banning the account.
---
Well I think thats mostly because of the bugs. By that I mean that last week we did some quests for a friend new to the game, and from Vault 76 to the Enclave's questline, there were only 3 quests that didnt required us to hop server hoping that it would work.
---
Dam right, imagine a 40mm shotgun shell mod for the auto grenade launcher.
---
This is the only way
---
Yeah I won't sell anything anyway. I'm a terrible seller of things
---
Start over.
---
LoL, seal-clubbing.
---
The resorse extractor goes on the front of the wood pile.
---
It is exactly what most players do - including me ;)
---
Folks can still effectively get enough shots on things to get a drop from a legendary - if some fine and upstanding player with a great build allows you to.  In Fallout 76, if a player can be a dick, there is about a 50/50 chance they WILL be a dick.
---
I don't see a problem at all.  If people want to pay to be left alone, I think it's much better for the game (in-general) to keep people playing.  There are so many more (multiplayer) games out there where this is not a problem.
---
Now when mods come out for these things... yes.  That's a different story, and we will definitely need marooned characters for those.
---
New character time
---
SO you chose to pay more (didn't have to) so your complaint is more valid??? do you listen to yourself?
---
how exactly is getting everything in the atom shop for free making "billionaire corps" richer????
---
Everyone wants to bitch about stuff in the shop costing too many atoms but conveniently ignore the fact that you can earn atoms for free in game, thus making everything in the shop **FREE.**
---
The only thing they are charging for is your need for instant gratification
---
cool.  Thx for the list!
---
BTW, there is a 20th bobblehead : melee
---
Please share your source because as far as I can tell this has not been made public. I want to be wrong though.....
---
what? were any of the pvp triggers met? you didnt mention that at all.  it sounds like it wasn't contested so it wouldn't start pvp.
---
whos workshop?
---
was someone contesting the shop at the time?
---
was he a 3rd party just visiting?
---
Thanks. I'm German and probably used the comma on the German sentence I thought of before translating it.
---
I alternate between fo76 and Battlefield One.
---
thank you good sir, you are a true gentleman
---
Literally me too
---
Unreal isn't this Holy Grail people thinks it is, especially for an open-world game like FO76. Just take a look at PUBG and all the problems they had, and still have, by making huge maps on UE4, and those maps are nowhere near as big as FO76's.
---
I do agree it's time for Gamebryo/Creation to go, but UE4 isn't the way. ZeniMax have Id Software on their portfolio, and these guys know a thing or two about game engines...
---
It takes resources, server capacity and traffic. Because it's bound to your account and not to your device. Same with camp limit. They have to set a limit.
---
I stop by the Meat shack every now and then when I'm in the area, open up that level 3 safe too. I like to find them in "clusters" and I made a few farming routes and shared them a while back [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/diwvfa/calling_all_magazine_collectors_here_are_three/) that I usually have a lot of success with, especially the Summersville route. I also like to hit up the cluster of 4 at Mountainside Bed and Breakfast, though lately, only one has shown up for me. And the three at Lewis &amp; Sons seem to be there often. I usually don't bother with the 4 at Sons of Dane, as that's a pretty popular spot that gets cleared out quite frequently.
---
I'm looking for a good spot in an interior location that has three or more if you know of any let me know!
---
Pay all the money you want, that is the beauty of a free commerce market.
---
If you choose to drop your money on something you can get another way with a little more effort, go for it.  
---
But dont bash those of us that choose to play the game instead of paying our way through. 
---
If you want to pay your way, go ahead.  You know you didnt earn said items through playing, just like most people who play with you will eventually realize. 
---
If people are just jealous that they cant,  well life isnt fair.  Best to realize that while playing a game instead of finding out in the real world  where the consequences are far more dire.
---
Unless you are a hardcore PVP player (in which case you shouldnt be playing fallout) then someone elses gear has no effect on your gameplay.  
---
You cant buy armors or weapons or stims or meds or chems or serums or ammo from the atom store.   So how is this pay to win again.   
---
Oh, right, you are probably referring to the people that break the end license user agreement that states you cannot sell in game items for monetary gain (Ebay, ect).  These sales are not bethesda endorsed.
---
Because the point of Bloodied is that it works very well with all the perks that kicks in while at low health.
---
This buff gives the game two glass-cannon build options, Berserker with its higher damage or Bloodied with its perk synergy. To sweeten the deal for people to try the Berserker build, the chance of Serendipity should be changed to go up the higher your health (bottoms at the current 30%, and tops at 45% at 100% HP).
---
I don't get it lol

Ok, this has got to be the funnies post I've seen on FO76... "He nuked my camp.."
---
I'm glad you got the joy of being an extravert!
---
FO76 is ALL about the communication.. even if to say "WTF... you just nuked my base!!!!!"
---
Yes, I have my stuff open for a reason. Help yourself.
---
Because I'm German and all Germans, talk, like William Shatner.
---
Fixed it, thank you!
---
Did they have the damage bug?....and does the damage bug make you immortal outside of pvp or is it pvp only? Had it happen to me last night and it ruined some really good pvp.
---
I’ve not been offered that, I deliberately gave you a price tag you couldn’t afford. 
---
Glad you managed to get one somewhere else. 7k though....you were robbed. 
---
I saw one at a vendor yesterday for 700 caps.
---
I saw estimate was 40 hours to finish on the slow end
---
Instead of having a script limit why not limit scripts sold to vendors for legionaries so we don't have a stash full of weapons (as well as increase the cap because 150 is nothing when a weapon costs 100).
---
Also why do we spend 100 scripts for a level 45 weapon?
---
_Liberty Prime likes that._
---
Sike.. we fixed all the bugs... woo hoo..?
---
Not to mention if they farm .556 this way, that is seen as currency to some sellers
---
I think there is plenty to complain about, the game was sixty bucks, eighty if you got tricentenial. Then we get a meager amount of content released in one year, despite the constant cash flow through the atomshop. Meanwhile the atomshop has gotten constant attention. Something gamebreaking in the game? Patched in a week to a month. Something broken in the atomshop? Patched the next day. Its not that fact that people have to work to get things, its the matter of how ot feels that bethesda has done more to the atomshop than the actual game. That being said I've spent money on the shop and personally dont mind it. I just want more ingame than in shop.
---
They told us it’s the 23rd
---
Pricing isn’t the issue it’s what you can do with them.  If Bethesda has any sense...  you’ll have tons of options for controlling the server and a clear line between adventure mode compatible and not.  
---
However it won’t be the price that sets people off.  I’m betting they make it to where servers can be PvP enabled like survival was, and people will lose their shit over that.
---
Uh thx I didn't recognize! And it's the first time that there's a regular maintenance/update on a Wednesday. 
---
Hopefully they won't do a one-day-only thing, I can't play tomorrow.
---
Hello, Ms. Wickedy. Love your videos. Just something to add to your checklist, I believe you are missing 3 games: Zeta Invaders, Pipfall &amp; Atomic Command (last one is Atomic...something, pretty sure). keep up the good stuff! i love learning new places to collect things in the wasteland.
---
I think we all know there are other games to play. This post is making a point about Bethesda’s lack of output.
---
I don’t know any interior locations that actually work , even the highschool that supposedly has 3 never has any when I run for plastic
---
Thanks so much!!
---
waiting to find it on sale.
---
Sorry but I don't see how. Please elaborate I am willing to have a mature discussion about it and even willing to concede to solid arguments. 
---
So you can claim workshops without fear of being contested. I can still kill supermutants and mole miners and accumulate more steel in an hour than you will all day with workshops.
---
Ditto for lead
---
Ditto for acid
---
For legendaries, you can still only be at one place at one time, don't see how you can farm more.
---
Make the Crimson Bog dangerous again.. Everybody is getting level 100+
---
Combined with the camp budget it takes....
---
I'll give you an upvote.
---
Hell yeah it is
---
I mentioned it merely as an option.
---
Oh yes, that would be a bit more challenging. I would really appreciate this. My first mothman fights were pretty hard. This must have been some whare between lv 20 and 40. Now there is time to take pictures 😁
---
no.. that would be pay for convenience
---
imagine they introduced a boost that lets you get to level 50 instantly. that would be Pay for Convenience. it literally just saves you time, yet you have no advantage.
---
now imagine they introduce an armor set for atoms with perks, that would be pay to win.
---
Level 250? Damn...
---
he deleted it, but i think OP had a npc reclaim quest not a player one, so it wouldn't enable pvp.
---
&gt;They however took damage from super mutants attacking the workshop
---
Dolly sods is another good spot for ticks usually 2 sets of spawns.  It IS a server hop thing but you’ll be swimming in stimpacks in no time.
---
I have 30k caps hundreds of serums and 6 figures worth of legendaries. I can certainly afford it lol, no need to be insulting. Yeah I felt like 7k was high tbh but I liked the seller and it wasnt too much more than the 5k I wanted to spend on it. Sounds like you missed out on a 700 cap mask (or another 30k in your book), my man!
---
If you go to the queen of the hunt shack, there's always two ticks.
---
That's low considering today standards. I hit her for 9-35 with my commando Fixer modded to .38, but I put maybe 1000 rounds on her. My role Is to kill the Minions, scorched, yao guai, sloths, etc. 
---
I always get loot unless I arrive late to the event.
---
Awesome info tho , you are a hero!
---
I've gotten enough out of the game and should just move on? That's the whole point of my post, way to miss it. I'm moving on because I'm bored. Except I didn't buy and invest over 500 hours in FO76 because it was marketed as a single addition, stand alone game, but because there is meant to be a working long term strategy, Bethesda want it to grow, I want it to grow, but it isn't. The players Bethesda want to retain are leaving because the game has stagnated and that's sad.
---
I've finished all my challenges. I cap out at generally speaking 250 atoms per week. Lets say 300.
---
Oh and I've only bought the bot and have 6000 atom saved up, if thats somehow relevant?
---
How much do I make daily?
---
Details will probably be tomorrow with the patch notes. I’m concerned that they’ll release private worlds only on PC first, like they’ve done for other additions in the past. Hopefully that won’t be the case. No way of knowing, because they don’t like giving us a heads up about anything.
---
It's a joke lol, everyone makes Todd Howard jokes, and he himself even recognizes them and pokes fun sometimes
---
Would be easily abused. Want more stash? Put it on display. Just put all your scrip weapons on a wall until the scrip limit resets, for example.
---
Berserker doesn't give higher dmg than bloodied
---
I’m assuming to stop farming of cores etc they won’t be
---
Shills that still play Fallout 76 are now desperately trying to justify non cosmetics items in but they said basically just ignoring their promise o-only Cosmetics which the shills used to justify the atomic shop in the first place
---
Awesome, thanks! That's what I get for going off the wiki and not the in-game list I guess. lol
---
You know what would *hugely* make the game more replayable in my eyes?
---
Properly balancing all the gear, including repair and ammo requirements.
---
Because I don't want to spend half my time in lucky hole mine, but do kill a hella lot of things, I'm literally constrained to melee because every ranged weapon consumes ammo far too easily. Some are hilariously expensive.
---
Then just balance as a whole is tragic. Handgun build would be awesome if there were any good handguns. Energy weapons. Explosives. Snipers. All not viable in terms of damage or upkeep.
---
Armor is more reasonable because the legendary effects give viable choice.
---
Perks aren't too great either cause so many are just laughably useless (ie most of the endurance tree)
---
It started to me last week right after someone dropped a nuke on Morgantown and I was there farming Ghouls for fluids...
---
the place where it shows to get tick sacks for the stings &amp; things quest in the mire. there's like 9-10 of them in that shack. if you do not have that daily quest, it's somewhere west of harper's ferry. sorry, but i don't remember if you can fast travel directly there.
---
Totally valid points im with you on those facts.
---
Ugh, put some damn clothes on! :)   
---
Lots of possibilities with no height limit thanks for letting us know!
---
&gt; A buff making it deal+200% damage
---
Hence this triple-damage buff to Berserkers. Right now, Berserker builds are shitted on by Bloodied builds.
---
The "AAA" game industry appreciates you turning a blind eye to developers adding freemium gameplay mechanics to retail games you've already paid for. Pay no attention to the developers making these games more grindier and more frustrating in order to push people to macro transactions of those very items apologists keep saying can be gained in-game. These developers also appreciate those people that love to purchase additional game content that was originally part of the original game but has been pulled out in order to sell them back to you later. Feel free to keep carrying water for these game devs. Others won't be so forgiving.
---
Check Amazon
---
This is the comment I was looking for. At level 250, you got your money's worth by any stretch of the imagination. Other games exist.
---
Yes, I have a few pieces. It doesn't say heavy in the description... you just have to put it on and check or look at the DR values.
---
I was bored before level 30 and still havent touched the game since. The game just feels lifeless and way too grindy for me and my adult life to handle. I have shit to do and places to be, I cant be bothered to sit there and worry about juggling all these resources just to stay alive or well enough equipped. I just want to hop on and explore and shoot enemies that arent ludicrous bullet sponges and learn the lore of WV.
---
What 200% buff?
---
Bawn Journo
---
I didn’t say they were handling it well but until they handle it differently it’s still required
---
Why were you carrying them around? Just throw them in your stash.
---
I’m lvl 67 and I am bored. The missions are boring af
---
:/
---
The one /u/Z0MG_H4X [proposed.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlglk4/berserkers_effect_needs_a_buff_also_i_want/f4q85gs/)
---
I think I get the OPs main point, that all significant content had been done at this point. He's not complaining or not saying he won't play another game, he's saying if you've been here awhile this game is now stagnant. 
---
I log in do get daily atoms. I have stuff from the shop that I didn't even build in game because I'm just not motivated. I was super into NW when the new map came, but that mode continues to annoy me with the long waits in between rounds. 
---
What killed it was the purveyor event. I blew threw my 1k script in 5 minutes with nothing good. I'm very unmotivated to log in for 150 scrip to do the same. Also, as someone said weight management has me stuck. I'm not a hoarder, but near 800lbs all the time. I have maybe a dozen weapons I don't want to part with which means no room to collect much anything else. It will just be stagnant for next 6 months probably.
---
My group is very vocal about what is being shared and what is needed.  Makes the benefit of being on a team so much stronger than going it alone.  If someone is overencumbered, another might share traveling pharmacy is help reduce everyones weight.  A couple days ago, a team mate shared profesional drinker so we could all consume 10 alcohol for the 10 atom challenge and get on with the evening.  
---
Sharing perk cards is an important part of team play.
---
and what will you say if stimpacks,drugs, special ammo is sold what then.
---
From what I have seen, it is fairly common, maybe normal even for maximum level combat armor from the purveyor. If you are getting a lot of light armor, perhaps your character or the enemy dropping the armor is low level?
---
The base dr/er on level 50 heavy combat is 50/50, you get a guaranteed 2* drop from defeating the sbq so is a lot around!
---
I hate giving secrets away but I'll do it anyways 🙂 Fast travel to Big B's rest stop follow the road north. When you get to the train tracks follow the stream to the west there is a small trailer with a fence around it. There are at least 5 ticks outside of the fence and another 4 inside the trailer. JACKPOT! sometimes there is a fusion core in there as well. Also where the train tracks meet the stream I've run into a few legendary sheepsquatch and death claws. I do that run along with the other 2 places mentioned above when I need stimpacks.
---
Idk I’m almost over level 50 and in the cranberry bog all the time
---
Fix the damn trading glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
https://i.redd.it/sihoyun3o1921.jpg
---
In case you needed a chart.
---
Well.. What do you expect being level 250? Of course theres nothing for you to do. Go play fo4 nv or fo3 or shit outer worlds releases in a week.
---
It just fix the current beards so they render correctly at a distance
---
I’m lvl 253.  Have acquired the best weapons and armor the can offer.  I go seeking a few other items to acquire but honestly getting rid of survival did it for me.  I was going to hang in there for Wastelanders but now that’s been pushed out I may just bounce.
---
Yes, just have to look up its values: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/htmlview#
---
I server hopped a couple times, I'll try it again later. How do you scrap stuff like that anyway? It would be nice to clear out some of the junk and debris.
---
Sounds like it's going to be 7 people max per server
---
Oh i thought We are talking about another bug lol, sry
---
Weapon mods do not get reduced weight.
---
It's 50~ stories on the main area. You just ran of wood. Still incredibly high and awesome. 
---
And yes building is amazing in workshops. A very under utilized mechanic of the game unfortunately. Can save entire base builds there and PvP is 100% broken.
---
As others mentioned, it might not actually say "heavy" in the name of the item, because that is replaced by the legendary prefix, so check the weight and the DR to find out what type of combat armor it really is.
---
???
---
When were workshops that wonderful in terms of getting resources?  Fusion cores grow on trees, and you can find them for next to nothing in player vendors all day long.  Ammo is still worth a minimum of a cap a piece in vending machines.  
---
Most of the other things you are talking about involve server hopping.  How would that work on a single private server instance?
---
If you want to waste your money, go right ahead.
---
Its your money.
---
Winning!
---
I thought beta day 1 was the 27th. Was the 23rd the stress test date?
---
It is a stimpak that heals you and nearby teammates. Basically the same as the team medic perk 
---
You get it as a possible reward from project paradise event
---
Ok thanks. I did mod it.
---
Still see it as a bad way to sell game changing items in shop without alternative via in game without going through atoms store, rather they make it a super hard questline for collectron or just buy it with money. Just dear god no fetch 100 keycard quests using instancing technology.
---
I would pony up $4.99/month for a private server.
---
Only the base weapon wieght is reduced unfortunately, greatly  reducing the value of that effect on ranged weapons.
---
15-20 a month.
---
Todd is going to need about tree-fiddy
---
10$
---
If you play on PC get the Better Inventory mod. It's a life saver. You can see how much each tab in the pip boy weighs with additional filtering and sorting etc. If you play on console.... I don't know what to say.
---
so your not gonna mind when fallout 76 only caters to people with money.
---
If your on Xbox I can make them
---
The plan is a rare drop from project Paradise or you can sometimes find them in player vendors.
---
Thats how games work. Eventually you did everything. Its the same for every game, MMO or not. If you play it that much that you've done EVERYTHING then you just move on to another game and maybe come back later. I personally never try to play a game to much. I always play multiple games at the same time.
---
Since the people with money are the ones that keep the game going.  No.
---
Yeah I get it you need to cough or burp but got dammit mute your mic!  I don’t need to hear your screaming 2 year old in the background either.  Or you binging on Cheetos. 
---
The mics are fun like when you PvP and a team gets salty when they get killed and then start yelling at you calling you a griefers despite their teammate firing on me first.  Some old bitty was reading me the riot act about it.  My only response was “invite more of your teammates and I’ll kill them too”
---
Perhaps you can retire and focus on your singing career...
---
Fair is whatever Amazon charges them plus a nominal fee to generate revenue for continued development and support. 
---
It really is not up to the community to set a price point beyond binary actions of "yes I will pay" or "no I will not pay."
---
We can only speculate what their pricing will be until they actually put a number out for us. We have no idea what kind of rates they are getting from Amazon or how their billing is structured. Amazon offers numerous ways to go about it and there are different price breaks depending on a lot of variables.
---
I'm not sure, never found one but I thought I've seen people before who had one
---
Nice :)
---
If it’s unlocked, I’m sure it’s fine. You could always take half if you have a guilty feeling.
---
Fallout 76 needs a Chiliad Mystery
---
Stash increase is not likely any time soon. In the meantime, purge your inventory of all of the following:
---
1. Extra Armor / Weapons (Especially ones you aren't high lvl enough to use yet, you will find replacements in due time)
---
2. Aid Items - Do not hoard aid. This is especially true for Radaway and Stims, as they weigh quite a lot. Sell all excess aid items, as they are easy to obtain.
---
3. Junk - Some junk is worth keeping, some is not. If you find you have an excess of 20 bulked junk, consider selling it to NPC vendors for caps or throwing it in a vending machine for about 1/3 - 1/2 of the "suggested" price.
---
4. Ammo - Ammo worth keeping / selling is as follows: 10 mm, Shotgun, 5.56, .308, 5 mm, .45, and Fusion Cells. Sell all of these for 1 cap each and \*drop\* everything else. Fusion cores are also not worth hoarding at low levels either, drop them all.
---
Inventory management is critical in this game. You will learn in time what you will consistently run low on and can stockpile accordingly - but virtually everything you get pre-50 can be considered expendable so try to kick the hoarding habit early to prolong your stash's lifespan.
---
I am sure that is exactly why they have done this.
---
Point taken.    
---
Wasn't thinking about heavy weapons, given my display items are bobbles, magazines, bears, and other stuff thats relatively lightweight junk.
---
Yeah, lol.
---
Tomorrow I think.
---
I do this, but with my scrap collector robot. No rebuild cost, and he respawns sometimes with broken legs and he crawls around.
---
&gt;"We are also planning a second phase of Public Event improvements that will bring additional cooldown adjustments, performance-based loot, and remove the need to tag legendary event enemies to claim their loot."

-From [Inside the Vault, September 26](https://bethesda.net/en/article/3I7i5lFBPRAUtXcNCZWYFJ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-meat-week-begins-again)
---
You found it that important to post this.... what other things are you giving up so we can save reddit space and clear them all out here. /s
---
Put it down and come back to it later maybe
---
They have a 50% Fallout sale for Fallout 76 and Fallout 4 on the Xbox Store.
---
Boy, I sure do hope they fix jet packs finally. I’ve been dying inside for two months.
---
The coveted black asylum worker outfit.
---
So rare few even know of it's existence
---
PC xbox game pass, $1 for the first month, $5/mo after
---
Okay thanks guys. I'm really upset because I just got a bloodied faster swing speed spear and its nuclear strong with my build but it just doesn't work right in power armor.
---
Just did a Price Check and the Pink uniform is going for 10-15k plus. Would 11k or the Forest Camo Jumpsuit work for you?
---
I didn't want to say it out loud but honestly I'm pretty sure that if this idea was implemented it would be in the Atom shop.
---
Personally I don't mind, I have a lot of atoms saved since I don't care about skins or suits, but I get that a lot of people wouldnt like it.
---
I would rather have it in the store than not having it at all.
---
Sukakok
---
Radiation is odorless
---
Its fine if you don't think the blast wave was as strong as shown in the trailer, but I feel that would be incorrect. 
---
The most logical explanation is that whoever placed tje skeletons around did it to make them interesting and there is little regard for sense or continuity.
---
Would love multiple maps to visit but can't see Bethesda being able to do it, maybe Zenimax as seen by many maps in ESO Elder Scrolls Online but Bethesda sucks at adding basic content like in game chat or paint skins working like camo paint for combat armor still not working. Heck Bethesda can't even fix Lever Action Rifle reload bug on Fallout 4 because it doesn't generate a lot money to fix bugs in an older game.
---
Go ahead, nerf bloodied builds and watch as 1/4 of your players quit the game forever.
---
im sorry but we all paid the devs already to play the game. plenty of mmos stick to cosmetics and only charge once to play. this is whats called double dipping and would have been considered such 10 years ago. but you seem to defend this in the face of reasonable examples and claim its fair cause life isnt fair? i dont even think your arguing in good faith.
---
Possibly, either way we got to get our hands on the game for the first time on the 23rd.
---
RiP
---
I left the game for 2 months and came back. Enjoy it even more than before
---
What I believe is going to happen is that the two-minute warning we get before the nuke drops is the time it would take for the NPC's to evacuate the surrounding area and once the nuke is over the return back to their homes
---
Someone said for some things you can put it in a works container and then pick it up from that and it’ll count as picking it up. This had to do with technical data but might be worth a try. I haven’t tried it myself.
---
I know it’s not DLC but I can bet it’s not going to have much dedicated support or options. You would be okay with $20 a month to only play with just who you invite and the likelihood that your server can just crash every so often? How much would you pay with admin controls, dedicated support team to help resolve issues quickly and the ability to have a publicly open/closed server option?
---
The Outer World's drops midnight of the 25th. You can get it on the microsofr gamepass for basically a dollar.
---
What’s your means of getting possum badges?
---
Everyone has there own favorite farm way. Mine is I fast travel to the moonshiner cabin just below vault 76. Kill the 4 there, also a boss always spawns which normally has stimpacks anyway. Run down to the lumber mill, kill the 6-7 there. Server hop and go in reverse.
---
Once you tame them it's best to fast travel to your camp, normally they appear after a while. If you stay with them there's a higher chance they get attacked or killed along the way.
---
Time to put it in vending for max caps
---
But do they still have the sense of smell? From that info they might as well not smell anything bad becouse they cant register smell at all anymore
---
Good work soilder
---
Where is this info from?
---
I only display 90% RW weapons
---
I'm just interested in server base dedicated camps that would be sweet teets for you and your friends to build a town
---
If you don't wanna hear people rant about problems with the game when we all know bethesda is dropping the ball then you shouldn't be on this sub buddy.
---
I leave my 7 water purifiers unlocked. It’s not a big deal if someone takes water.
---
There really a black one?
---
Thank you!!! 🙂
---
Inside source (\*Could be hearsay\*)... cost 10650 Atoms ... max persons allowed 7 - Waiting for announcement tmrw for official word... really hoping it's hearsay :/
---
In all fairness, I think once you played a game to the extent of this, it’s better for you as a player to move on over to a different game until Wastlanders. I still have a bunch of stuff I need to do, like get an actual build going but I fell out of the game cause playing solo just sucks imo
---
Thanks so much!
---
Amazon AWS is $5 a month. I would assume BGS would probably get some kind of discount for buying so many servers. Now knowing this what would you say would be a fair price for a server, Bethesda making $3-5 a month or $13-15 a month in profits?
---
$10-$15 would be great.
---
He does! lol
---
I feel like the op wrote this story about me! Level 260 and feeling really fed up. I really wish we could redo all the story quests as a high level player again with scaled up difficulty. I know I could make an alt but I've so much time invested in Ted (yes that's his name).
---
Tried the vault 94 raid twice on medium with another high level friend and found it confusing and overly difficult. 
---
I wish for more story driven content. The world is amazing but seems somewhat empty now. Send us on a wild goose chase all over the map hunting down clues - like the original sheepsquash event maybe? Remember running around the taxidermy place when that one dropped? That was fun. More missing hikers etc. 
---
The daily missions are so short and generally pointless. Why not let us repeat everything? I'd love to do the mystress of mystery again for a random 3* or custom weapon.
---
I just think "SCREWS!"
---
Fast traveling to an event and then back works sometimes
---
I don’t really understand this sentiment at all. 
---
“I’ve poured tons of hours into this game and now that I’ve done everything I don’t think it’s as much fun to play”
---
Yeah... that’s literally every fallout game. I played the crap out of 4 and I love the game to death, but now that I’ve played through it so many times and done so many different things it has to offer I’ve taken a break. Maybe one day I’ll go back and play through again.
---
By the way, this is incredibly fun when messing with Nuke mines
---
No you're right, I don't expect it to last forever but we're not even at the end of the first year and the game has ground to halt. The thing is i really love the game and I'm worried Bethesda are driving off too many high level players with lack of content, they've made a huge deal about this being a long term game with big additions, but we're just not seeing it. The vault raids are a disaster, NW numbers are dropping, Wastelanders is months away and as the players who leave won't all come back. It's sad
---
Well, I've been there!
---
Yeah.  I mean, by the time you reach Lv. 316, you know the world backward and forward.  But that familiarity can only help you so much when you're Lv. 36 fighting Lv. 68 Super Mutants at Sunnytop Ski Resort.
---
Me too, my friend, me too... =]
---
What would you want out of your $10-15 a month or expect to get?
---
Alot of time for this. Comments that bash people citing real issues always bug me.
---
dude they \s.  it means sarcastic in reddit.
---
I think so, even though it's not exactly reliable I'm pretty sure ghoul npcs use dialogue suggesting they can smell. But I assume they do because when they go feral that would be a good way to detect prey and their brain probably keeps that sense intact
---
A private server to RP and have fight clubs.
---
Maybe they have statistics that show that hair styles aren't big sellers (although, of the choices we've been offered, I'm not surprised), but I am surprised they don't offer more options.
---
More importantly, hazmats ~~should have a Fire Breather skin~~ shouldn't count as armour for the Chameleon mutation. That seriously makes no sense whatsoever.
---
its not double dipping.  I paid for the game. 
---
They want to monitize new features and products that were not part of the original game.   Well, those features cost time and money to create and implement, they need to get paid too.
---
In a perfect world stuff wouldnt cost anything.  Unfortunately we are not in a perfect socialist utopia.  The world is capitalist  by nature.  Capitalism  fosters progress.  Without progress we would still be farming with horse drawn plows, and walking to work.
---
I think I agree... I just wished they would be a bit stronger... or had some stronger variation.
---
deal
---
lol, ready to storm Area 51 to see them zetans!
---
Appreciate that, I'll try it next time it does it. I got so fed up today I just logged off early
---
Yeah a few people have missed the point, but that's ok. They were always going to miss it due to the big chip on their shoulder blocking their view  🙂
---
Its because they took out a ton of stuff to gives us back as DLC.
---
Thank you very much! =]
---
Shit didn't even notice it, my bad honestly.
---
Yes. This. I'm holding on for similar reasons. I have 16 builds on 4 accounts to go at it from as many angles as I can think of. I'm not bored yet. But I can feel the inklings of boredom starting.
---
and work with the wrapped cap
---
It depends also on what the private worlds offer in terms of features. Is it just adventure mode where the world does not have to be shared with random players, or is there extensive customization, persistent world, or other advantages?
---
i have reached this point. I believe it's something like 50 items that can be named.
---
That's the way I look at it too. If I come across a resource unlocked I'm taking it all, sorry but you should you lock your resources. 
---
if there's an issue with that the camp owner can PvP me [and see how that goes]
---
Order of rarity so far as I understand: Red, Pink, forest, blue, green, brown, white, dirty.
---
I spent 7 hours server hopping the other day and found inumerable white and dirty ones, 3 browns, 1 green, and finally gave up for a while lol.
---
aww thanks, but my health is just as bad now as when i bought the game.
---
Yea, I believe its in one of the quests or a quest leading up to Watoga, but they state that people couldnt stand the smell of Cranberry bog. I would have to find it again in game. I come across it every so often.
---
yut, that's where I see em.
---
That's an AWESOME shot, man!!! 👍 👍 👍
---
Atomic Shop prices are adjusted to the idea that you can earn Atoms in-game though.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if it was $20/mo though, because it feels like they want to squeeze every last penny they can and I can't help but feel there's a reason why they *haven't* mentioned it yet.
---
I guess it's still useful with heavy weapons especially if paired with bear arms
---
$15 is pretty reasonable
---
what about clean vs dirty?
---
It's going to be a long five months...
---
Lol my dream weapon!!
---
So if you got no admin controls (even a minimal of being able increasing spawn rates or difficulty) and nothing you built in your workshops would save to the next time you start up the server that you would be okay with that?
---
Nice this is the kind of little know game mechanics I like to learn about, thanks man for sharing...
---
Thank you very much. Yes there were some very lucky 'one-time' shots, you're right. :)
---
Berserker should give 200 percent at Zero DR, and broken armor should unequip itself. That's close to balance. 
---
However, berserker Rocket launcher Is still crap compared to a nocturnal combat knife, so... Balance.
---
Fingers crossed for working content
---
Exactly in same position as you. Waiting for wastelanders (now waiting 2020...)
---
At least I got more time to play Remnant from the Ashes... ;)
---
It’s sad...
---
Yes, the glowing ones are perfect for some nocturnal photography!
---
Hey, you need hydration, dude.
---
Yes. It’s for RP and fight clubs not mods.
---
Try Remnant from the Ashes :)
---
Same, except I have never gotten anything I wanted from the legendary vendor after spending tens of thousands is scrip across 3 different characters. All my time spent in gameplay should not equate to luck drops where my luck has been zero. This coupled with the constant crashing, laggy servers, atom shop greed and now the delay of wastelanders has me gone from the game and doubting I’ll come back. If wastelanders isn’t phenomenal I’m gone for good.
---
It's supposed to release this week so yeah kinda weird that they haven't shared anything yet.
---
Oh, it took me forever for that to work! Fortunately, that damn challenge is behind me now! =]
---
Theres more to it than adding mods, an unmodded "normal weight" dragon weighs 7.8 and an unmodded "weightless dragon" weighs 2.4, I just like to see all the downvotes when I post this fact every time someone posts this same confusion on "weightless". The effect is not working correctly even on unmodded weapons, that's your answer.
---
You can target mines and grenades in vats as well to detonate them as long as the shot hits.
---
Yes...yes you should.
---
Do eet!!! 😁
---
I’m feeling the exact same way as the OP.  I’m almost at lvl 200, and all I seem to be doing is just grabbing my 150 scrip and 1400 caps each day, and maybe taking on a quest or event once in a while.  PvP just isn’t my thing.  I do enjoy exploring and creating my own scavenger hunts, but I’ve explored every location so many times I can recite most enemy spawn points, and magazine / safe / plan /bobble head locations by heart. The game has gotten boring to me, but I’ll hang around for the NPCs to arrive...
---
Not to turn this into a “Bethesda please” post, but I won’t argue if the playable area was pushed out to the map screen boundaries, with new locations.
---
Yeah, other resource extractors might be more problematic, but as people around here say, I leave my purifiers open for people to access :D
---
Hmm good point. That’s hardly 90%!
---
What do you mean by the last content they would add to the game? You know they plan on continuing to add stuff for years to come right?
---
it's easier to see if you nuke the mire north of harpers ferry
---
Not when you are f*cking bleeding through your nose and your hair starts to fall off. Lol
---
Ah, my tank build makes them mere annoyances now...😋
---
I’m fully expecting it to be paid for adventure mode. No game options. Same crashing rates. Workshops not saving when you leave the server. I know there’s no info if any of this is true, after a year this is the only thing I could expect that we get.
---
I hit this at lvl 100.
---
If you want something to help you work around, Reduced weight Legendary effects actually affects this. I have a friend, he has a nice gun shop and bought any cruddy effects for 2k as long as it has Reduced Weight. Imo it could almost be a chase rare effect if this takes off
---
Yes. I run a complete set of Legendary BOS Heavy Combat Armor. I modified the limbs to Ultra-Light for AP reasons, and I’m counting my BOS-upgrades version of Stand Fast as legendary (for enhanced sneak). Two limbs are Chameleon (again, Stealthy Commando build) and two are’s Zealot’s (for extra protection against Scorched, which is helpful in SB battles outside of nuke zones; also because Vanguard sucked!!). 
---
Best sites for them has been player vendors or as awards for repeatedly doing “Forbidden Knowledge,” because - even after over 100 runs - I still don’t have the BOS Shielded Underarmor Plan!!
---
Then that’s just the smell of blood..
---
Could be if we get a patch tomorrow then new art assets are coming tomorrow too.
---
Hehe, thanks! 😋
---
Did that last night after I saw a 'supermutant stomp' in someone else's vendor for 25K caps, I thought....'Hey, why not.'
---
It does usually update by now.  Maybe they are waiting until the new patch tomorrow.
---
Yep this works great! Such a good workaround. I'm gonna put a few pieces on display for my Gun Runners shop
---
How do you have any idea what AWS charges them lol
---
I’ve thought about learning all the plans, but then I realized I wouldn’t use most. I didn’t buy this game to collect stuff, I want some interesting gameplay.
---
I think it’s assumed thy private servers have permanence..
---
Yeah and I would expect mods to be after that.
---
"Hey you level 567 vault dweller, happy reclamation day! It's still the same fucking day you left the vault! Visit the Atomic Shop for non-survivalist looking apparel and camp items!"
---
It's called life; get a thicker skin. That individual didn't make the comment maliciously, so get over it.
---
There's definitely something to be said about people that need to be told what to do in order to have fun with something. If they don't have quests or whatever 24/7 they think there's nothing to do. Fallout games have always been about exploration as well as quests. 76 doesn't force feed you, sometimes you have to just get into the joy of discovery and let yourself explore the entire map. If you start exploring and still can't find anything to do? Game probably isn't for you.
---
You can google search it. And you can buy them yourself.
---
no worries.  good hunting bro
---
Getting good reviews tooo so yay!
---
Maybe a butt pic??? lol  😅
---
You forgot Yellow mate?
---
Thank  you!!! =\]\]
---
Your captivity can be over in moments. 
---
Go vendor bot some of the junk.  Thats what I did on day 1 of the sale when I couldnt move without Excavator and Bufftats.
---
Got a bit of heat too, but I can move now.
---
Well i know what i'm doing when i get off work
---
They didn’t do a good job informing us in the pip on what’s actually weighing us down. Sorting by weight only shows individual item weight, so if you’re carrying tons of stims or gunpowder etc it’s hard to tell what they add up to without going item by item with a calculator. We should NOT be having to do this because THATS WHAT COMPUTERS ARE FOR. They could have easily made it better a loooong time ago
---
On weapons with not a lot of mods certainly better.
---
After what? 5 years down the road? Lol. They already said mods are coming next year.
---
The scrip limit is what makes everyone quit early.
---
I don’t think you understand how AWS works lol
---
''The Inside the Vault was a lie, here's Wastelanders"
---
Hopped to a station to claim your daily 150, of what?
---
This is the best place. I normally ft to treetops and walk up the train line. It’s not on the map.
---
Now guess what they will nerf next
---
Well that's just it most heavy weapons only have around 1-3 mod slots anyways so if that's where all your weight is coming from it shouldn't be much
---
This I have done...Twice!
---
And my Bloatfly Syringer, but I still have my 20 Pies, I give all the new ones I get to friends.
---
Sure seems like it.
---
Patch 14, theoretically on the table for tomorrow, sure feels like an unknown.  Part of it is because they spend the last Inside the Vault dwelling on how Wastelanders was going to be pushed back, but I don't think we've seen much discussion of what to expect in 14, other than a shortened Public Event timer, private servers, and a boatload of stuff for Halloween.
---
Would appear so.
---
has to be scrip for turning in legendary weapons
---
what?  you can do whatever you want to do.  I was only offering FC as a know place for positive fallout interactions.  FC isn't an insult it's just slang for non-hardcore basically
---
good to finally have an explanation for why I always blow myself up when trying to set up a trap
---
When I'm bored I put nuke mines on the floor by the vendor bots and then do this when people walk up to shop. I have pacifist on though so it's not hurting anyone but it is hilarious to watch people react to the unexpected explosion.
---
If you are referring to their Lightsail virtual machine option which does indeed sit at a price point of $5 per month, I caution that the hardware from that offering is likely not enough but certainly cannot say for sure. 
---
AWS is an umbrella for core offerings of many cloud based services with their own independent pricing tiers. We do not know what services are in use but I am going to guess at minimum EC2 and S3. I strongly suspect they are using at least one database service, but have no way to know whether it is Aurora, RDS or Dynamo. 
---
BGS is not going to have somebody sitting at a computer with the AWS console open adding and removing pre priced virtual servers on their monthly statement. That also means they are making use of various Amazon APIs to do stuff on the fly, which in my experience also carries an additional cost depending on usage. 
---
Their EC2 structure is going to be tuned to what they think they need virtual resource wise and unfortunately we are not privy to that information. I'd bet every spare penny on my desk that they are doing time based billing because the number of online servers is constantly changing to meet demand but not exceed.
---
S3 is going to scale based on exactly what and how much they are storing, which we also have little knowledge of. 
---
So that out of the way, I'll actually answer your question: I anticipate somewhere between $15 and $25. I think that is fair to me as a consumer but I know my neighbors and/or fellow gamers will not. I will say this, if characters and inventory all transfer between private and public, and I can in fact do lag free vault runs in my private server, I personally would be willing to spend $50 a month as long as my wife and I wanted to keep running the vault. $50 would be my no brainer number, higher and I would have to start weighing how bad I really wanted it.
---
try harder.  I feel like a lot of people go there, inflict a pittance of damage and then sit back waiting for everyone else to to all the work.  
---
Meanwhile everyone else is unloading on the queen every moment she's on the ground and often piling on even as she strafes from the air.  
---
Stop looking for a handout and earn your rewards.
---
oh I see what you mean now.  it's all good there, nobody is saying your not good enough to be here.  FC isn't the kiddie table or a penality box.
---
Tomorrow
---
Makes sense.
---
Clean is rarer than dirty, but both are common enough to be worthless.
---
It has been an awfully long time since the last major patch.
---
Which would use some action points.  
---
This is both sneaky (enemy does not know where you are) and doesn't use Action Points.
---
Here’s a serious quest for the OP and everyone else. At what point do we say a title did their job? What your post, it seems like you more than got your money’s worth. Given the style of game this is, I wonder how realistic it is to expect its developers to sustain your entertainment indefinitely like a WoW (and even then, players could get to the same point). 
---
Not belittling your concern or saying FO76 has delivered on content... I just wonder at what point do we say it’s time shelve a game for other games, even if temporarily.
---
Probably delayed as it costs $$ to broadcast an update on xbone and ps4.  As they plan patch 14 for tomorrow anyway, they will just lump the atom store update in with it so they only need 1 update instead of 2.
---
Gotta bring back the fruit hat and the  black and white cowboy suit
---
The only real advantage I see anyone having is the ability to actually use workshops for resources—because they won’t get murdered constantly. Aside from that, there really isn’t anything players are competing for. They’ll still be time consuming and tedious, and yield less than simple junk farming does, so I don’t see that really affecting any significant change. 
---
I don’t see how they could implement private worlds without letting characters transfer. If I get a server for example, and want my friends to join me, would they need to start new characters? Or lock them to my server? For a game that involves jumping in and out of friends’ games so often, that just isn’t going to work, no matter how well intentioned it might be.
---
The purpose of going with a bloodied build is raw damage. 
---
If you want to be tanky, dont be bloodied.
---
I use 2 defensive perks on my bloodied build.   barbarian and fireproof.
---
Everything else is a damage perk.   
---
If you want to be tanky, be junkies or vampire full health.
---
thnx
---
Had it the other day with a nuked Legendary Sheepsquatch took a whole fusion core to down it with a laser and I have power user maxed.
---
Don’t they always release the notes at the same time as the update?
---
What the Halloween event level 7 here
---
I just use all the damage reduction I can like the 5 cavalier pieces to reduce damage while I sprint. Then I also use dr perks like ironclad.
---
Totally agree!!!
---
Start a new character mate. I have 4. It's like playing a brand new game every time. My highest level is only like 90. I haven't even broken 100 but I have 4 characters over level 50 and have beaten the story 4 times now too. Saving the 5th slot for wastelanders.
---
So you're talking about unyielding v bolstering. I've run 3 uny with 2 bolst before and loved it. It worked very well. If you can do a set with rad resist modded (instead of deep pockets, with the high str and some management you can use the rad res) into it then it's a very nicely balanced option.
---
I personally am a melee/big guns build. I've done others but settled on this (440 levels). Currently I'm running full unyielding sucessfully because I can (though it's not necessary to get the damage needed to one shot a 90+ deathclaw with a good melee) with my mods and play style. Yeah, i die more than a full health, but not a lot. But play style has a LOT to do with it.
---
I just helped a rather new-to-bloodied friend with a full bolster + ap refresh BOS mod set. He's basically a low HP tank. His armor resist is more any than PA and his cards set him up for really nice damage with the best weapons.
---
He still dies every 5 seconds. His gameplay has to improve to fit his chosen build. Running in like a sentinal tank isn't best for bloodied, but if you can play it right I'm sure it'd be epic
---
TLDR: Full unyield is highest damage ofc, but you're a glass cannon, unless you can get your play style right. Full bolstering is highest resist, you're a veritable tank, but carry weight and damage output lower. I recommend 3 uny and 2 bolst.
---
For example my m79 launcher has weight reduction, plus my bear arms 2 makes it way less than a pound. The default weight is also only like 8 or 9 lbs but still think of that ratio
---
Dont forget about a vampire's minigun while being bloodied it's fun
---
Sounds like you need a challenge. Bring a paddle ball to a scorchbeast fight.
---
How dare customers be upset about a product they purchased. They should just be good little consumers and not complain about anything.
---
quad, instigating, executioners, vats crit,vats cost Harpoon
---
for funsies
---
I'm lvl 200 and i have the same issues. When i completed the main quest i already started to get bored. I tried farming but there are very few farming spots and legendaries so incredibly rare, it's just not fun. But then i found the trading communities and it was so fun to get all of the cool weapons. Basically the trading saved the game for me. But then at some point i got everything i wanted and now i'd like to use these weapons... But there's nothing i could use them for. Sure there's the scorch beast queen but i hate the silos and the fight itself is just not very thrilling. This game needs more endgame content. More high level areas. 90% of the map is a complete waste because of the low lvl enemies you won't visit it twice.
---
If it's not locked it's meant to be available for visitors.
---
I'm a bit bored with Adventure mode (lvl 192ish), but I've focused more on Nuclear Winter. I have another post on here with Nuclear Winter suggestions (if you're interested, just click my user name and find the post; I'm a bit lazy atm to link it, lol). But in that post I mention my  transition to playing NW almost exclusively...at least until Wastelanders, anyway (when/if it's ever actually released). I find NW has reasons to communicate with other players because it's a team-oriented game mode, and I've gained several friends I otherwise would not have, through Adventure mode. There are "raids", sure, but those would be few and far between. Anyway, I find NW still has enough flavor that it's not become bland like Adventure mode, although I would like some improvements.
---
You would think it would make PvP people really happy though. Especially if the servers are persistent and keep all your built workshops and your camp there 24/7. People could buy servers for their clan and build the workshops and camps up and invite other clans to their server for deathmatches.
---
Have you tried using 90% of legendary weapons? They do such little damage that it's almost negligible and why everyone wants specific things. Junkies gets a 50% damage boost and you can have basically no side effects if you take the chems. Nerf bloodied then people will complain about that. People will always complain about one thing or another.
---
I pay $450 a month currently for such features on my business dedicated servers.
---
There’s not going to be new content 5 years down the road. There’s going to be a year of content left and then you’ll get your mods at the end of next year.
---
Don’t like them don’t read them, the term practice what you preach comes to mind.
---
ok how many hours have you played???? please answer
---
Did they fuck up? Someone being 200+ level is probably not the norm. I pre-ordered. Played since beta. I am around level 110. I never played it daily. I only had a few 6 to 8 hour sessions on weekends, with the majority being more like 2 to 3 hours. I don't think it's reasonable to say that they aren't making content fast enough when someone plays it daily or almost daily.
---
Then leave
---
Are we talking about the Vendor bug or the damn trading glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
Berserker's should do more damage than Bloodied, but even broken armour shouldn't work with it.
---
Nooooooo! I live there!
---
It starts next week, itll be at White Springs. Dress in a costume and vandalize the resort. It's a new seasonal event and will only last one week. Usually we'll get some unique camp plans/rewards for doing it. Spend the next week leveling up so you can join in!!
---
Sure buddy change the whole games mechanics because you want to camp at a Specific spot....👎
---
Claps totally agrees.
---
Don't forget about the buff from a full unyielding set - this makes bloody melee super powerful when you factor in adrenal reaction and nerd rage with a little radicool sprinkled on top
---
Saved your post. I’ll add you when I get off work, I’m only level 26 and have very few people to play with as well!
---
Do you have to have the weapon equipped or just in your inventory
---
They're dropping it on the day the bombs fell. So that could mean something... or nothing.
---
in fallout 76 mines are not the path to diamonds they are evil and must be destroyed.
---
why dont you leave and start a bashfo76 reddit leave the fo76 reddit for people that enjoy the game and want to share their experiences.
---
Yes. If it isn't locked it's there for you.
---
29.99$. 1$ per day.
---
On my own private server with its own rules why cant I?
---
10 a month woudnt really be bad at all.
---
&gt;The "AAA" game industry appreciates you turning a blind eye to developers adding freemium gameplay mechanics to retail games
---
Ok comrade! I'm not sure what planet you're on but on this planet everything costs, period. They could have gone with a subscription model, paying monthly, in addition to the initial release as well, but they didn't. The content updates will be delivered,  albeit delayed, for free, to everyone. AS purchases are an option for people who either have no concept of saving their atoms or who need immediate satisfaction now. That's on the player, not on Beth, they just give you an avenue to scratch that itch. 
---
I realize I  started out snarky, and I do apologize for that, but even in China, the last bastion of communism,  they have a market economy.  Because giving things for "free" is never free, ultimately someone else pays...
---
What a helpful and fun reply!
---
Yeah, I can't imagine these players in the 16 bit days when games that were classics like Super Metroid, Super Mario World, A Link to the Past, etc, could be beaten within 5 to 10 hours. What would the internet would have looked like back then with these entitled fanbois who can play for 250 levels, literal 500 hours or so of gameplay, and whine about being bored? Or having a bug that affects very little of the game be "game breaking" and ramble on for eternity on how it ruined their AAA experience?
---
There are literal thousands of games to play that aren't Fallout 76. If this game bores you, find another. Simple.
---
Yes. Ran whitesprings and got more ionized meat than hardened/glowing mass and high rad fluids together.
---
The ionized meat sucks. When consumed it gives a shit ton of rads and there doesnt appear to be a recepie for it.
---
haha, I live in the blast area on one of my characters, my other two are north a bit more
---
I can see them doing that for story mode if story mode is going to be at separate game mode
---
Also, the best way to defend it from PVPers is to just spam the elevator buttons and ride on spawn invincibility. Oh look, you'll never kill me nor take the workshop.
---
Your hyperbole isn't much better than OPs.
---
amen
---
Don't let this comment above get overlooked. Vampires stuff is highly underrated. When I run the vault on my bloodied heavy weapons I trade my BE gatling for a VE gatling and it allows me to run at lower health while also using fewer stims. There's always something to shoot at in there.
---
I am hopeful that there will be a per session option vs per month.    I would love to try to solo the queen,  run through a farming run without all the goo piles, etc.   beyond that as a solo player most of the time a solo world would be boring after a few sessions.
---
Lastly it would be great to be able to pay for the session via Atoms.   That way you could play the private server "free"
---
I’m replaying FO3 right now. Finding some new stuff in there I hadn’t found before. Especially with unmarked quests.
---
Of it can be PvP enable it would be very fun
---
I worked in nursing homes for 6 years on and off. The real smells are hidden from visitors.
---
I think you're right, because I went to Whitesprings for about a half hour and when I returned all of the missing stuff had reappeared.
---
Get in to pet tameing  it is my personal favorite things to do just find one of the community made randon event maps and travel between them trying to get the most coveted 3star legendary pets rebuild your camp with your pet in mind and enjoy your new best friend!
---
Say's he does it quietly without shitting on everyone's parade  
---
Writes a post in attempt to shit on everyone in this Sub-Reddit's parade  
---
Seems legit
---
From the rumor mill:  
---
**Monthly cost of roughly $15 It comes with 1650 atoms per month, some cosmetic shit, a ranger armor and a scrap box that makes scrap/junk weigh nothing. Servers will hold 7 people and can only be accessed by invite from the server owner. If the server owner leaves you can still play until you leave the server, but there is no connecting while they are away from the game.**
---
You don't have to have it on your person, its weight is reduced in your stash. This does not work with the perk cards. Only the third legendary effect
---
dude just go to r/fallout76filthycasuals
---
basically what you are actually seeing is the server thinks you are doing too much damage too fast and disallows some of that damage
---
I bet much of the old settlements smell like dead bodies and rotting food. Toxic Valley I bet smells like rotten eggs all across it.
---
I hear ya..i dont lag out as often as I use to but i know the feeling. Wonder why it happens to you so bad. Any chance your internet isnt real good? Maybe plug your ethernet cable in?
---
There are lots of valid criticisms about the raids especially the server lag but we've been grinding raids every night for over a month now and having fun while doing so. I'm in the 400s also and I've had fun trying different weapons and builds to refine certain aspects of raiding Vault 94. The best part is seeing how communication has improved within our group over the past month. We've gone from barely squeaking by Expert Washout to clearing it almost every night with minutes to spare.
---
If private servers mitigate the lag issue, definitely give raids another try with your group.
---
The huge amount of Gunpowder, Bulk Ammo Scrap, Stims, and Radaways you receive is almost comical. I've resorted to making Plasma Cartridges and Cryo Cells to use up the extra junk I get from raiding.
---
Yea, I bet my balls thats a bug lol
---
yeah, but you probably actually make a profit on your business
---
Yes dont allow transfers from private to public servers.
---
I will pay 10 or more if it a server that is exactly like adventure but only i can let people in.  I would imagine things would run a lot better less lag more server stability. It would make the experience 10 times better.
---
Definitely. It’s its own thing
---
Yeah, because all complaints are equal.
---
Have you tried in game roleplaying at all? Some of favorite moments in this game have involved Role-playing with other people and it had zero to do with Bethesda provided content.
---
Woah where is this from?
---
0$
---
LOL you can't host 76 on their free tier
---
AWS is outrageously expensive to host a 24 hour commercial service
---
Live service doesn’t mean be on it all the time at the expense of other games. It just means they’ll keep updating. It just means the game should look different from time to time. Unless they added a complete new quest line to replace the 80 hours of the original, which is an unreasonable ask, your bound to get bored.
---
I think the only problem here is people’s expectations. Bethesda could probably control those a little better,  but I think they’ve done ok with this games content, I mean Jesus, most people don’t spend money on micro transactions, which means your £10-50 quid or whatever you paid for the game originally has more than been worth it.
---
I paid 11 quid, got around 100 hours of good fun out of it. I can’t argue I deserve more.
---
K thank I'll let my friend know thx
---
From the rumor mill:
---
Those scorchbeast guano piles have to be awful
---
Cool I'll definitely keep eye out for these then
---
Maybe if they adding mods and all that shit but other then that not a chance....mise well ask for them to all gift us 100k caps and a Full set of uny sent powered armor for anyone buying a private sever
---
gotcha, but in any event you'd need to have a tse fixer to compare to the tse combat rifle.  
---
That said what you would find is a modest DPS increase and that's it.  It's not like a fixer will be dealing double damage.  But people always gravitate towards the best damage no matter what.  
---
Using  [https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/weapons.html)  it looks like a tse fixer would deal roughly 22% more damage than a comparably modded combat rifle.   
---
It's even less of a difference compared to a handmade, around 8%.  It's kind of funny that people are trading legacies for god tier fixers when they are very similar to handmades which are much more plentiful.  If I got a really good fixer in a drop unless it was just 100% perfect for one of my characters I'd just trade it.
---
You’re willing the pay 3 times the current value of the game ($16 Wal Mart online) to be able to run the Vaults without lag. Do you have Stockholm syndrome? Why is that okay? Someone like me who buys the game, buys the Xbox live service to play the game, to pay for high speed internet to run the game smoothly I don’t want to pay even more to be able to run content better. You had great explanation of AWS and you know that they’ll get business based pricing and will double or triple that for gamers to play and you would pay like 5-10 times that to run vaults. Their lag might be to shitty to play, but their concepts of how they are ran are also shit. You probably thought the burrows was great and was worth the hype and probably love buying scrap kits.
---
You ever go to a Cex; the regular customers are what I imagine Ghouls smell like.
---
Ive got to. One of the players I play with is The bloodied build and Rad sponge doesnt exactly work very well.
---
My melee PVE build is pretty tanky and I still put out 7k per hit on the queen. 5 pieces of armor with +strength. One is bolstering and one has poison resistance and I also use the first aid perk to make my stims super effective while doing boss fights. Use dodgey, barbarian, serendipity. In PvP bloodieds just can’t handle the meta of assassins sentinal quad teslas unfortunately.
---
Very true. When I was doing the quest for rose that had you make bait to attract a death claw the death claw would “spawn” but I couldn’t see it. It was invisible and not invisible in the sense that you could see the blurry parts so you can kind of see it. I mean it’s character model wasn’t even visible and I couldn’t vats it so I kept dying
---
Welcome to the club.   Here is your tee shirt and juice box.   :-)
---
My post was meant to convey the reality of hosting prices though I intentionally kept it brief and to the point. It is my opinion that most people raising a stink about all this are not exactly in tune with the hosting market bet it dedicated servers or virtual services.
---
Youll always get a 2* heavy combat drop from the queen
---
I think too many people are imagining a BGS employee picking up a cart full of Raspberry Pi's to plug into a switch and getting some kind of a bulk discount.
---
Some have issues while others dont have any crash disconnect issues. So dont point fingers at bethesda.
---
The full notes are indeed usually released during maintenance, but this time there was very little in the ITV article, only the confirmation that there will be more utility atom shop items in the future (so I would expect some with tomorrow's patch), and that private worlds are coming and they are going to be paid. But no specifics about the features or pricing of private worlds, nor about the utility items. In any case, we will find out more tomorrow.
---
Perhaps your real gripe is with social media in general?
---
They should bring back legendary item challenges like they had in survival.  Add in a new piece of armor to a set each week with an objective to obtain it.  It would be pretty fun to be able to get a full suit of Unyielding armor with one piece given out every week.  Or just give out a new weapon each week.  They don't even have to be named. Just pick out something with good effects and put it behind a challenge.  Heck, have a grindy challenge that awards a whitespring jumpsuit or traveling leather coat.  People would love stuff like this.
---
&gt; vault raids are a disaster
---
As someone who has run Vault 94 close to every day since it released, going to have to disagree with you there.
---
Of course they will do something. And that something is called maintenance. [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/369662/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-october-23-2019?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/369662/upcoming-fallout-76-maintenance-october-23-2019?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Enemies can drop only to the amount of stars they themselves have so a 1 star cannot drop a 2 or 3 star items.I think it is a bit unfair that a 3 star enemy can drop a 1 star item tho.I understand it prevents farming for godly legendaries,but sometimes killing them just isn’t worth the reward at all.
---
&gt;keep taking the side of corporate billionaires, and keep whining like a bitch about folks who criticize the direction of micro-transactions
---
You always have the option of creating your own world and giving it all away for free...of course, you'll not be able to hire any devs or analysts or PMs or server engineers or even a janitor,  but hey, it's an option. 
---
In the real world everything costs, be it electricity, servers, facilities or employees (and their health coverage for them and their families, not to mention all the other benefits a company has to provide). Even water and air costs. Your entertainment is not a welfare benefit paid for by the government (who doesn't generate cash flow at all, they take it from those that do earn a living and from the companies that they work for), at least not yet, so play or don't,  but quit with the damn whiny siren call of the evil billionaire companies.
---
Paying for it with atoms. Bethesda would laugh at you so hard. I would like that to but it will never happen.
---
Well with servers being expensive to run. I think they will price it at $30.00 per month.
---
OK I'm going to do some of what you said like getting rid of high lv weapons
---
I would not. I wouldn't pay a cent because I don't want them.
---
I dont have a vampires mini.  Its the last one I need to complete my collection.  
---
(yes I collect miniguns, no my stash is not happy about it)
---
Then I guess you'll deal with the heavy lasers and rocket launchers
---
They are adding mods, it's been confirmed.
---
They ended yesterday
---
Yeah, and that was this kind of bug, with the server lag, that we had all day. How could you expect someone that has been told to hate the game every weeks since launch to stay when seeing this ? Thats a real problem since the quests arent that bad, but the bugs make them bad, which completly ruins everything good about them for a player.
---
then why are you still playing? i played maybe 50 hours and moved on.. it was fun.. but at this point go play something new man.. you got your time with this!
---
Really? I just had someone log in game for me and send a screenshot. The first step of the challenge for Diploma is there.
---
you sound like you are a lot of fun at parties
---
Oh yeah, yellow. Well whatever, it's middle in there somewhere
---
Ooh it looks better than it did in the store
---
This is why public server characters and private server characters should be separate and no crossover, this would be borderline cheating in my book.
---
Alright, I'll put you down for the ad-supported $0.00/month option. Now please drink your verification can.
---
Problem with this is there is no real rewarding feeling when it comes to exploration. Everything is more of the same. The reason exploration is amazing in other fallouts is the prospect of finding a new unique item or a interesting side quest. Here you quickly realize that every single area offers more of the same and leaves no reason to become invested in the new areas you discover, and makes it all feel very shallow.
---
This is an over exaggeration of my point. But nice try.
---
Says earn 250 Overseer Xp for diploma.
---
Welp, I hope for some legendary mod changes.
---
Yeah, it's got to the point where I'm in a party, someone yells out legendary over here, I ask how many stars, they say one, I say.. nevermind.
---
Why tomorrow. Its usually tuesday
---
&gt;Because those free atoms dry up pretty fast.
---
No, they don't,  they are there perpetually.  In addition to the daily and weekly challenges there are the world, combat, character and other challenges that repeat, albeit at a higher value, each completion.
---
I have, but it is rare. There are days where doing both of them gets me 2, and then another week of nothing from Stings and Things and Project Tidy. It is a low low drop rate.
---
Can't say as much for Campfire Tales as that's so rare to see pop up nowadays. I believe on the first day of them fixing it so they dropped badges again I did get one from Campfire Tales.
---
you do realize fo76 is one of the worst launched and managed games of entire gaming history right? especially when paired with the fact that its a bethesda game, a company that was famous for its quality releases
---
Well that certainly isn’t the plan they’ve communicated. Where exactly do you get your info from? They said they would continue to add new content for years lol
---
I feel as though you might fit in nicely with the good people of /r/The_Donald. Their bandwidth for tolerance of opposing view points is well document.
---
It’s gonna be raider stuff, Halloween next week
---
Any idea why the patch was delayed a day?
---
Wait VATS works in NW?
---
Junk is already scrapped. 24 hours wasn't enough. 48 hours doesn't look likely either. I'm betting I'll be out in 72, but we'll see.
---
When’s that? Be bad ass if they do that. Fallout 4 so much better for it
---
i completely understand your point man, i do. right now i actually took a break from 76, i've been playing the last of us , overwatch and borderlands.
---
maybe a break is nice? every time i go back to 76 after a long break i seem to enjoy "more"
---
If there was a open PvP server, I would play. Otherwise 0 interest at all, especially without modding. Pointless af imo.
---
I'm hoping for a solo mode soon. It fits in better with the idea of "whoever wins gets to be the overseer"
---
I hope you get to. I'm not a private server player but I would think if you're going to pay extra for it you should get to do whatever you want. Set PvP parameters, build wherever, things like that.
---
Why? If you go from a private server with your camp somewhere you can't in a public server, you'd just have to move your camp.
---
Junkies
---
It should just work like Minecraft realms, accessed by anyone on the list at any time.
---
Also any more rumors about a scrap box?
---
It's a slot machine mechanic for re-rolls of weapons and gear. So if you have crappy legendaries you don't like or you feel are useless, dump them into the fancy looking machines at every train station (yellow and red, makes a whole lot of noise when you interact with it). This will convert the item into scrip, where each star on the item will get you more scrip. You can only get 150 scrip per day, 1000 total per character (that's the cap).
---
Going to the Berkeley Springs train station by Harper's Ferry there is moleman vendor who will accept scrip for a random roll of legendary weapon or armor (from 1 to 3 stars).
---
His name checks out.
---
Over 200. I purchased at launch for full price(basic edition) and personally i think i got my money's worth. I played a lot till about late November and very sparingly since(less than 5 hours total) but without some kind of big change i don't see myself ever playing again. Maybe wastelanders will do it but I doubt it. I know it sounds like such a small thing but what made me quit was energy weapon durability. I laser rifle with a beam splitter breaking in 2 magazines from 100% is frankly unacceptable. And sure, they buffed durability a little bit and fixed the 200% durability perks so they actually work so it went up to like 6 magazines when I last played but that's still ridiculous. I think this is the most important thing you have to remember about most people when you see them complain like this, they want to play, they want to love the game and play 1000s of hours, but something is stopping them and complaining is their only way to attempt to fix it. Sure, some requests are unreasonable and the outrage bandwagon is a real thing, but people who complain about gameplay for the most part want to play the game,  if they didn't they wouldn't say anything and just play another game.
---
Junkie’s but legacies are very likely to be nerfed and rereleased into loot tables at some point
---
So you’re acknowledging this sub is basically a collective bitch-fest? If that’s your parade then fine, have at it
---
I agree it would be abused, but you could solve it by having a limit to the amount of displays. Or, a better solution I think, just increase the stash limit. You give us tools to display things but not the room to display them.
---
Wow, we have an ammo maker in our group, and a cryo user, they'll both be tickled to hear this!
---
I think you meant "change", not "fix."
---
You asked, I answered. I very clearly stated that I knew my fellow gamers would not be of the same mindset. I suggest you take the same approach. The fact that you and others are not willing to pay as much does not upset me, nor do I have any names to call you or boxes to put you into because of it. 
---
I have a thorough understanding of what I enjoy and what is important to me, beyond that I just have to put my price on it, which I have done. My price is equal to what I am willing to spend a month on atoms if there is something really good in the shop (which is rare). If I shelled that money out for a server, my monthly atom price would decrease proportionally. I play games that I enjoy, and I'm not opposed to supporting them financially to keep them online. 
---
You want to know what really blows?...Playing a game for several years, accumulating piles of phenomenal gear and resources,  then seeing the cord get cut because it was no longer financially viable to keep it running. Sooner or later that WILL happen with this game. I'm invested enough and enjoy myself enough that I would prefer it be later. 
---
Just because you bought the game, Xbox live service, and pay a monthly fee for internet usage does not mean that you are paying for continued evolving support of a new private server service, which already has a time investment into making it possible. In addition your payments have not done anything to cover the bandwidth required on the hosting side. Unfortunately inernet usage is "taxed" on both ends of the connection.
---
Totally disagree. I've fully transversed the map multiple times, and love it every time. I always find some new little thing I missed before. The stories Fallout games tell with placement of objects is superior to nearly every other game. You can learn so much on placed objects, notes and holo tapes. If you don't explore, you'll never get that feeling of discovery.
---
You’re not entirely wrong... but social media and it’s effects are an entirely different conversation.
---
That's generally how it works, if people like something, they like it. If they don't like something, they don't like it. Would you like it if people spiced it up and said something along the lines of "I ABSOLUTELY HATE THIS FEATURE HOW DARE THEY DO THIS TO US, PLEASE ADD MORE I LOVE THIS FEATURE."  
---
p.s. I don't really have any opinions on private servers until we know more info
---
Dump shit from your stash, junk can always be gotten again.
---
Part of me wants to say this is so unfair but also the part of me that wants to pay for it says I hope this is true 😈
---
God I hope so. But I'm not gonna bother preparing for something thats gonna happen in Q3 of next year since Wastelanders is already pushed back. 
---
Plus theyre a lot of fun.
---
yes. silly. cost value ratio is something we all decide upon every day. apologists for hyper monetization only drive more hyper monetization and promote profit first product second (minimum viable product) business models. but sure. plant your flag on the side of the corporation instead of the consumer...and you'll create (or continue) a world of clunky glitchy games that release unfinished, over priced cosmetics, monthly service fees....etc etc. way to champion the worst in gaming.
---
Why are there do many stars in the sky, so many beasts in the field, and so many fish in the sea? 
---
Only Todd knows for certain.
---
There’s not a single reason this right here should be downvoted. Fallout 76 didn’t become an MMO to get 300 hours out it. Fallout 4 is single player and most of us here have put in like a billion hours in that. So, no, it’s not crazy that OP feels the way he does.
---
"Don't ask questions, just consume product and then get excited for next products."
---
rng...
---
While you skim all the 1\*, I don't know where to put all the 3\*. So thank you.
---
What just happened!? Did I hit the wro... Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
Exactly, this happens with any game you beat. We are lucky that updates will be coming with more content
---
Sorry, I’m a dick haha.
---
No release date yet, it may have been pushed back with wastelanders. :/
---
I wasn’t going to pick it up until I found out it’s on Xbox game pass for $1. I think that game pass works on PC as well so there’s 2 platforms you can play it on
---
😁👍
---
copy/pasta click bait article
---
No
---
Your post is an example of what is wrong with gaming culture
---
They dropped the ball when they launched the game, about as hard as they were dropped on their heads when they were children.
---
Personaly i dought you will be able to do any of what some are wanting. Hell just look at players who have mule toons. They cant acsess anything from there bigger toons box. So dought bethesda would leave a loop hole open. That would allow anyone to hoard.
---
He’s crashing, not disconnecting. That’s a problem with the game itself.
---
craft a camera and take pics all over appalachia
---
Yeah, he is probably a russian bot as well
---
He’s pointing his finger at Bethesda because it’s Bethesda fucking fault. People have different computers and operating systems.
---
I think ur boss at bethesda yelled at u and now ur taking it out on us. How about u get back to work fixing the bugs and making the changes i want...lol
---
I completely acknowledge there is a difference between camps of people who want to love a game for its lore and story, but have trouble getting past some “features” versus those who just have an insatiable desire to complain and criticize. My point is that this sub feels like it has basically become the later.
---
If u call this click bait i would wonder how is any of thease posts actual fact. As all we the players like the news is left to speculate.
---
Yeah, you'll find better ones very quickly once you get high enough lvl to use the ones you're holding onto. It's pointless to store them ahead of time, especially if they're &lt;45/50.
---
3\*s have the -potential- for a 3\* item, but it's RNG. 1\*s can only drop ones 2\*s can drop 1 and 2 star items. It's RNG. If a 3\* always dropped a 3\* that'd be great, but then they'd lower the amount of 3\* enemies, so it'd all come out in the wash anyway. 
---
1 and 2 \* items aren't useless. You can scrip them, or sell them in your vendor. People are still just starting the game, and some level 50 might be hella happy to get a 1\*whatever.
---
Hey I just did the same, since the clean Appalachia events I noticed the amount of nuke drops has declined significantly. Also is it just me or are silos much easier these days?
---
First stop using ‘lol’ I can’t take anything you say seriously. If you think Bethesda will add real content for years, you are blind. Would you call the camera they added content? Participating in scorched earth isn’t content either. If Wastelanders doesn’t get the good reviews it needs and doesn’t bring the player base back then this game is dead, they won’t support new stuff and the only new content is shit like the camera and scorched earth. They said early on they would keep adding content if there are players playing the game. That doesn’t mean a few players that means enough that they can greatly profit off of. This game is unfortunately dying and dying fast and will die even faster with Outerworlds and Cyberpunk 2077 releases. Then there’s the next gen consoles coming out next fall, if they don’t port the game over to be able to play on the new Xbox and PlayStation then it’s most definitely dead. ‘Lol’
---
I’m becoming a water salesman so I can reach cap limit
---
The only issue I have with updates, is the unasked for changes that make the game worse. 
---
Everyone asked for event timers, travel discounts, and notifications. Good!
---
Who asked for events to be chained, with 45 minute timers between? Bad!
---
Right? If you hate the game so much, just play something else. There's literally thousands of games out there, find one.
---
Scorched Killer weapon receivers and sacrificial blade mods used to add an extra star. It was removed awhile ago in an update. 
---
I imagine they will have to find a way not to make 4 or 5 star weapons not severely OP. I really would rather not see everyone running around with bloodied Quad FFR +Vats Teslas.
---
Try every event, Try to collect the rare stuff the events give (very hard), Learn all plans (even the useless ones), Try to get god rolled 3 star weapons (very hard), Try to get a god rolled 3 star armor (even harder) and try to see how many time you are able to manage your stash space without losing your mind (boy it is a hard one for sure)
---
I think I read that using a ProSnap camera can actually be beneficial in identifying dead enemies like legendaries when they disappear! I've been meaning to do this.
---
I've explored every location, sorry but for me no feeling of discovery at all. It was cool for the first 30 levels or so but then it's just rinse and repeat.
---
Yeah seemed pretty easy to me.
---
That goes the same for thoes with concoles. Thoes with alot of memory taken up by diffrent games. Tend to boot you off more. I dont play on pc but when i use to play WoW yrs ago. I used a alienware desktop with 1tb ram.
---
PvP would not matter anyway for people who play solo on a private world, or even for friends playing in a group. I do not see a major problem with enabling it at least as an option, when there are no random untrusted players on the server. But I do suspect private worlds might be implemented in a fairly simple way, with little to no options.
---
I do agree, i played Destiny and they had this same issue, the Rahool guy would give you blues when you turned in purple, basically you get less than what was advertised.
---
It got SO MUCH HATE that the devs had to change it, and now that Rahool is a meme of hate and disappointment.
---
I honestly dont understand why FO76 fans have let Beth get away with 3 star enemies dropping 1 or 2 star stuff
---
its demoralizing and every time it happens, people reflect on that disappointment, it hurts the game.  It hurts the replay-ability when you keep finding yourself resenting the game itself.
---
I'm sure the AAA game industry appreciates people making excuses for their predatory macro transactions.
---
I unloaded everything I had and was either firing or reloading the entire battle, even running out of my primary ammo, so if you have the nerve to call me lazy then you better take a moment to reflect on your idiotic statement
---
i wanna know more about private servers 
---
can we adjust npc respawn rates....turn off hunger/thirst/ etc?
---
$0 Let me self host even if it has to check with their servers.
---
I do get this from time to time.  Usually when I try to pull something from my stash that is for sale while someone else is using the same vendor it was stored in.
---
[We are truly in the darkest timeline.](https://i.imgur.com/dgGvgKF.png)
---
I love mount blair for it's big excavator, the animation dude.... IT'S AWESOME
---
I've already had to reorganize my stash 3 times :( Lost my mind this last time, I think. Is there a method to finding rare stuff beyond just going and finding legendaries? One time I raised my luck a couple points with a Bobblehead and I started finding a ton of rad weapons and chems and ammo - is that coincidental or really how we should expect it to work?
---
folks, this is called what an apologist sounds like.
---
I don't mean to offend but I think most people have moved on from this game by now. Sure you'll get youtubers who still make occasional videos about moldy helmets or something for views, but anyone who still actually reads this reddit probably cares about the game at least a little bit.
---
I’m acutely aware of these issues. It feels like some players are anchored in their initial feelings of disappointment and outrage. Now, no matter what, they will always find fault in the game and the company. Not saying that either one is above criticism, but we should always reevaluate our positions over time and with new changes.
---
Any word on characters crossing over from private to public?
---
Try turning your shop off when making changes to it?
---
👎🏻👎🏾
---
Amazing, haha. And do you... borrow... your water from other player's unlocked purifiers or are you an honest salesman? What even is the cap limit?
---
All I ask is that Bethesda can allow us tweak things like enabling PvP which makes sense since Bethesda killed survival mode
---
Waaaaah
---
Thanks for this!
---
To each their own. Play something else.
---
Please elaborate further instead of using the “I’m rubber and you’re glue” defense.
---
There was a prototype of this a long time ago. It came out for [South Park: fractured but whole](https://www.adweek.com/creativity/we-tested-south-park-fart-smelling-vr-device-and-now-we-can-never-unsmell-it-173140/), it was used for when you farted on people so you can smell it lol.
---
lol what
---
Can I have your stuff?
---
Same, I have a TSE gatling plasma and I’m holding on to every second I play with it pre nerf
---
Who didnt read the feedback from Bethesda when they said they were working on this after they received our feedback?
---
I think the cap limit is 30k. I justify theft this way: more water will be created by their purifiers. I leave mine unlocked and people take from them. And it’s fine. And if something that’s no skin of their back gets me 5 more caps... well... I don’t see the harm.
---
Scorched earth was in the game at release what are you talking about???
---
But if there is no plan to use them, just remove the other 2 stars????
---
It does raise a nice “what is the best 5 star weapon” question....
---
Personal preference would be a Bloodied Explosive Quad FFR handmade with Vats reduction....
---
Would be immense!
---
Would probably break in about a clip and a half but hey....
---
I am, destiny 2 and outer worlds is downloading atm. 5 months for new content to drop on fo76 and 0 end game stuff. Everyone I played with has moved on and who knows if they will be back. Just fyi I have over 600 hours on fo76. Though with the removal of PvP game has nothing left to offer.
---
Well you can minmax thats what I did or trying a rp character that can mix things up
---
-&gt; New bug discovered: changing your preferences deletes your operating system. Sorry for the inconvenience, we have passed the information to the dev team.
---
Some games are able to detect virtual machines and close the game on the first machine when you launch the second. That's why I'm not sure about FO76.
---
Its almost like there are lots and lots of different people, some of them hate stuff and some of them praise it.
---
The ones who got burned and hate it move to a different a game, the one that praise it stay. 
---
Not so complicated isn´t it?
---
Hate to tell you, but this sub has been that way since the beginning. 20% "Beth please" posts, 10% "I'm leaving forever!" posts, 20% "P2W" rage posts, 20% whiny complaint posts, 10% returning player posts, 10% "new player" posts, 7% raider posts, and 3% actual relevant posts about game content.
---
What is minmax?
---
Getting the best gear for your build whatever it is
---
ok think about this my server i have ability to alter things i also have the ability to place my camp anywhere i want whats to stop someone from mass farming locations or if they have even more control over their servers whats not to stop users from changing drop rates? or even making all enemies drop legendaries. It opens way too many doors for cheaters. I feel if you have your own server it should be its own thing where you can do what you want but i dont want a character from a private server be able to go to public servers and flood it with legendaries or sell legendaries they farmed and had a better chance of getting. Its just not fair and semi cheating
---
Yeah... no. My understanding of the logistics involved with video game development and software engineering is essentially limited to “voodoo” I couldn’t program Pong if my life depended on it.
---
I eat them every time. They taste good. :)
---
I haven't done one in months, that was about 45 levels ago, wonder how I'd fare now
---
"And when I get bored, I get **VIOLENT!**"
---
Ammo is the new currency because there is no cap only restriction is weight. Thats the only reason ammo is good for currency.
---
Im just messing with u, no offense
---
Sorry I meant project clean up Appalachia
---
Berserker should stay at +60% but should be calculated based on armor worn, not overall Dr.  That way, you can still use barbarian/scaly skin/etc. Would end up working well with naked chameleons or broken armor.  Thing is, you can't got over +60% (at least not by much, 75% might be ok) without making it the best for stealth builds.  Because you don't need armor to be stealthy, and having high endurance is actually really good for being tanky because of how stimpaks work via %hp and poison and mister gutsy bullets ignore armor anyway.  It's already not that bad of a legendary effect on any stealthy weapon, it is just too dependant on playstyle rn.
---
How would this be useable at all? If your going to force detonate the mine to do dmg, it would have already gone off from proximity?
---
I don't have the slightest idea about that. But to answer your first question, a bunch of outfits (leather coats, red asylum outfit, tattered field jacket, some jumpsuits) are only awarded by completing events with a very low % chance to appear, so you would need to do them a lot of times, but hey maybe one day it pops up on the event reward and you'll feel slightly more happy. Same thing goes for the plasma grenade and mine plans, arktos pharma plans, power armor pieces plans, and lots and lots of plans you won't ever use!
---
The detect prey with smell would make sense for forced evolution kinda thing where the improvement of the body was sought after in a controlled environment but thats not the case for ghouls, they are a result of the right exposure to rads and a good dna / heritage combination of genes that just resulted in their ghoul status.
---
Id have to look on any dialog or lore in regards of them been able to smell sense i cant remember anything on that matter on my play troughs
---
It's also my bday, which has always made fallout feel quite special to me.
---
Unfortunately this isnt how it works.
---
People get way to attached to their current game of choice.   Instead of moving on to a new game, like any rational person would they instead come here and trash fallout and its devs because they think the public wants to hear them whine like babies.
---
As long as it gets clicks on their post (upvote or downvote) they will continue, because digital exposure is the new popularity contest, and these people NEED the exposure and comments to justify their existance
---
Unfortunately I've already dumped almost all of my junk. About the only things I've kept are rarer things like some ballistic fiber and stable flux.
---
This would be pur pay to win. I don´t think they would be this dumb about it. 
---
The Atoms and costums maybe, but no weightless junk.
---
Yeah, and the person pointing out that OCD is a thing people actually struggle with wasn’t being malicious in doing so either. It was merely a request to consider how using it like that diminishes that struggle.  And I’ll add that using words in that way continues to trivialize mental illness and add to the stigma those of us with it face. 
---
To be fair maybe you should consider getting a thicker skin if people asking you to think about other people exhausts you so much.
---
LOL how is this P2W?
---
It's a stimpack that share the effects to other people. Found one recently in a vending machine, I was like "why tf do we have to use that for tadpole sucess if it's that rare..."
---
i don't have a link but some of the 4th and 5th star effects have been datamined
---
Very secretive about what's going on, normally they release notes before maintenance happens.
---
Yeah, no real info there...but apparently there will eventually be “modes”
---
The benefit of Berserkers is clearly not commensurate with the sacrifice required to achieve it.
---
If nothing else there should be a perk comparable to serendipity but with DR as the trigger to make it better as opposed to % of remaining health and a mutation that grants some benefit at low DR could be added.  
---
that said I don't get the feeling that Bethesda is very interested in a balanced metagame as fo76 is 1 year old and it's still heavily based on the wildly imbalanced fo4 single player base that was used to build it.
---
Lol let's be honest guys, all it's going to be is you and you only alone in the world (or with I voted friends/party). I can almost assure that there will be no setting preferences and it will be exactly the same as normal
---
Since there's no mention of a different ruleset, I would assume no problem with cross over.  Once they change the ruleset on a private world/server, though, then I'd think there would have to be separation.
---
The hell you play the game so much for? Level 250? You’re bored cause all you’re doing is playing the same thing over and over again.
---
You are complaining about complaints.
---
You are part of the problem.
---
Again, if you’re acknowledging this sub is essentially an echo chamber of complaining and game bashing then that’s fine. I’ll be on my way and leave you to your circle jerk.
---
I don't think they will nerf them, I think they will get a different identifier and along with current TSE and then put TS and E in the same category and put their effect back normal.
---
Remember that the main reason Atom Shop prices are so inflated is because people can earn Atoms in-game.
---
Assuming the private world will be paid for directly instead of through Atoms, I’d expect it to be either a $10-a-month rate or a $25-30 one-time payment.
---
Level 250? I’m bored at level 28!
---
None taken.
---
Carrying endless junk?? How is this not pay to win. Thats something people asking for since the start and Bethesda always said its a "server problem"
---
This makes the game so much easier, sind you can just pick up everything and dont have to use the horrible inventory managment.
---
I'd be more concerned of some immature kid, or ANY of my friends, getting ahold of a Smell-o-visiin device. You would be assaulted with farts all day. Come to think of it, doing that might be a bit exciting. 🤣
---
I ft to tree tops.  North to the road.  The road goes under train bridge and over a stream. That intersection has a high probability of random encounters.   Mr bandit, sheep squatch,  albino deathclaw.  You can see the tick shack from bridge.
---
Nobody is calling that content. It was a community event. But I would call new brewing mechanic and related quest content, I would call the 6 sheepsquatch quests including lying Lowe questlines content, I would call nuclear winter battle royale gamemode content, and I would call the upcoming wastelanders DLC content.
---
This is just SAD. Bugthesda charged $60 for a broken, unfinished beta, strung its players along with promise of "updates/bug fixes", charged outrageous prices for mediocre items in their shop, and now roll out "private servers" for a premium price. How GREEDY can one company be...smh.
---
Do these "mutant" items have a purpose. I mean, for exemple you can take the sheepS skull, its projectile, etc but it's nothing but bones to me...
---
But it's doesn't effect you.
---
I’m expecting multiple packages starting from $5-$10/mo for a single server, with more expensive options to have multiple worlds, maybe even Atoms and other items.
---
That’s literally the stupidest thing I’ve read all day. Try again.
---
Noticed it at Poseidon just after the beta.  Had a 4 man squad keep building.  We got bored before we hit the limit. Was funny watching all the ant people (game was new so everyone was at Charleston) and lobbing mini nukes at them.
---
Seems like a shitty birthday present...world annihilation. Makes my friend's 9/11 birthday not so bad.
---
Okay so you sound like you're lying, you only buy repair kits? Not cosmetics?
---
Once you learn to solo the silo you can easily pull at least 1 sbq run in an hour, possibly 2 if you are ultra efficient ;)
---
I love random encounters but never seen one there. Might have to scout around a bit, as up there quite a lot for tics and there’s a treasure map location at the end of the tracks.
---
It was intentionally hyperbolic to make op examine his own words.
---
It is what makes ammo a good choice for currency but it is not the driving force behind the problem. The problem is people have too many caps. That doesn't necessarily mean that people shouldn't have so many caps. 
---
There are simple economics at play here, the value of caps is not sufficient enough to sustain the balance of cap limits vs the level of trade that is actually occurring. IMO player vending blew that door wide open because suddenly price points on everything changed. Yes there has always been trading facilitated outside of game but vendors brought that out of the niche corners of the internet and into the game for every noob who steps out of the vault to use.
---
I have 4 heavies on display so this has had a big impact on my stash. Now I will be shopping for RW legendaries.
---
steam is having a fallout sale
---
AND for those who have not bought the game yet (like me.. i played the b.e.t.a. but did not buy the full game yet)
---
its on sale for 24 bucks for the PC...now if they just release the private server info soon then ill be like "country roads take me home!"

---
Give it ago, I feel like it’s easier than it was two months ago but I could be wrong
---
I'm curious why Bugthesda has not address the selling of in-game items on unofficial sites for real world cash.
---
Guy above you said he only buys repair kits in the arom shop, i think hes lying though tbh. That or well, I don't know really that makes no sense
---
And work with anything that doesn't actually cover the chin. Like the skull mask from the Atomic Shop
---
Nope.
---
Will do
---
Find some people to play with. **Use your mic**, and team up. It's a much better mode when you're doing it as a cohesive squad. Call outs, sharing ammo/meds/weapons, consistent revives, it's like a whole new game mode.
---
I get the point you’re making, but I don’t entirely agree. I don’t think being a live service means that it automatically makes it a game that you can play continuously for years.
---
Take Destiny 2, for example. Shadowkeep released 3 weeks ago, and I’ve probably put about 100 hours into it since then. I know that’s ridiculous, but my clan was going for the raid jacket, so we were all power leveling to make sure we wouldn’t miss it lol. But the point is, after 100 hours I’ve beaten the campaign, done the nightfall’s multiple times over, done the new raid, hit the level cap, and played a lot of the Iron Banner. Unless I’m gonna stick around to grind out pinnacle weapons and exotic quests, I’m pretty done with the expansion until the new season starts unless a seasonal event drops to pull me back in for a week, and that’s totally fine with me. I got 100 hours of playtime for $35.
---
How about Overwatch, one of the biggest live service games out there? I’m level 680ish on Xbox, and 50ish on PC. I’ve put well over 1000 hours into that game since launch, and I’ve only stopped playing as of late thanks to Blizzard’s recent stupidity. But up until that point, I’d say I’ve gotten more than enough playtime out of the game, and I’m really not that high level compared to many other people who are still playing! I love Overwatch as a game, but after the firsts year of launch, I’d only pick up the game again whenever a new season event drops. I’d binge play it for 3 weeks or so, and just play something else when there was some down time in new features.
---
How is it a fuckup on Bethesda’s part of they’ve similar made a game with insane amounts of content to do, and a select few players who have played the game to death have run out of things they want to do? It’d be like me hitting max prestige in Call of Duty and complaining that the game wasn’t replayable enough lol
---
Thats what I was thinking as well I got two bundles for the maxson and general armor that included the kits
---
Learning the silo is the next big challenge, given the constraints on my “screen time.” But it’s good to know that it can be done efficiently with some practice. Thanks!!
---
it does it gives them more access to better weapons a lot easier than me, it also gives them the ability to make more caps easier so it does affect me.
---
Lol I feel your pain I stoped play at 147..... done everything in the game 100 time.
---
You can only grind the same stuff befor it gets old. 
---
Also the hard end game stuff is a resource dump with little to no pay out. 
---
I really hope wastlanders is not a crap shoot.... I have lost all faith in the game but I really hope they get it right with that dlc
---
Yeah, I’m 99% expecting private worlds to be identical to Adventure servers at launch. 1% chance we’ll be able to toggle PvP options. Expectations should be tempered dramatically.
---
For your next mission, try obtaining all of the magazines.
---
I have six purifiers for that reason (as well as my crops out in the open). That way players can always help themselves, and when I need some, there's  usually some in there.
---
Ah but that was a package deal it wasnt for the kits so much as it was the battlecoat
---
i agree, which i am fine with. I would like to test a server out with just me and pray it runs 100% better and lightening fast.  if it has the same lag when going to vendors or hitting enemies then there claims of server stability on number of players and their stash and such BS.
---
If you live there your probably used to it. Thats the world they live in.
---
Sure, for 500 atoms
---
That's normal
---
its not a big deal to me, i just go back to the item and try to sell it again, and it works. 
---
The issue wastes like .2 seconds of my time.  Its not a game braking or experience braking issue at all.
---
You saying you buy repair kits on a regular basis?
---
That’s totally fine. I’m not offended. Game relevance waxes and wanes. Will we be talking about FO76 next year or 5 years from now? Maybe.. but probably not. But I just happened to catch someone’s post entitled “Bethesda, I’m bored” and I was like “holy tap dancing Christ on a shingle”
---
I do that to essentially make air burst grenades. Toss, vats, celebrate victory
---
Totally agree, 5 people almost max capped, all different builds. I have a aresenal of weapons, and only want 2 pieces of armor. Ive gotten most plans 5X over but have to continously buy stuff to make money...but theres nothing more i want to buy which is a issue so now my junk business is almost at a halt because i dont have the space and dont take ammo as trade because i dont need it taking up space thats filled for my business. Something needs to happen lol, i myself am almost at the end of my rope until next year, but even then when i log on ill face the same issues im sure because im not making a brand new account just to continue this game.
---
Me 3!
---
I'm level 60ish and also running out of things to do, but what I've been doing lately is trying to complete my armor set and power armor and collect the mods I want for them. Next I'm going to focus on helping lower levels more by scavenging and crafting lots of stimpaks and things.
---
I browse here a lot and get inspiration for things to do to add to my list. Good luck!
---
I have already seen multiple posts complaining about the cost, the implementation, etc.
---
There is LITERALLY no information on them as of this post. Since there is no information to go on people are effectively *making things up* to be pissed off over. It's a frakkin game... 
---
[](/pinkiefear)
---
I try not to wear out my disk drive by only playing one game a year
---
They did specifically mention the word 'cost' when speaking about servers, so I don't think it will be like GTA where you can set private lobbies. I'm expecting something more akin to the ~~hundreds~~ of survival crafting games out there. They'll probably give us the ability to set parameters, but I highly doubt it'll be like that at launch.
---
You might want to see what they charge for them first... :D
---
Aw poor thing. I'm sorry the big bad scrap kits ruined the game for you.
---
How? You're still as capable of doing everything you already do. Someone else having a better gear or more caps doesn't mean anything.
---
How true this is. You never knew how much of an asshole you were until you make a mini version of yourself to argue with every day.

Aw you got ahold of mommies credit card. How precious.
---
I seriously paid 30 dollars for over 300 hours of gameplay and never bought atoms and still have purchased items in the atom shop by just doing the simple challenges.
---
Also almost all online service games charge you for a private server and if they dont younwould have to set up and maintain one your self which takes time and as we all know time is money.
---
&gt;but sure. plant your flag on the side of the corporation instead of the consumer...
---
Welp, as I'm both a consumer and a developer lead working for a large Corp, I'd tell you it's not about sides nor is it, necessarily, a zero sum game between corporations and consumers.  As a for instance,  Bethesda gives you a way to earn the atoms in game, never having to pay for them, albeit you have to know how to save and not buy every shiny object presented to you..
---
I wish they’d introduce a Berserker’s legendary effect on armor that makes the “armor” have 0 resistance and gives more weapon damage the lower your resistance up to 10% per armor piece. It’d give that build more cosmetic options and a boost to the dmg.
---
Couldn't you have just moved your camp temporarily, or is it a complicated one?
---
I got the bungalow because it fit with my character to live in a camper thing (and I got really tired of not being able to place my camp). I grabbed the portapotty plan and strung up lights in it to complete the look. No one likes pooping in the dark.
---
Plan your build and figure out what your ideal weapons are for it so you know what to learn mods for and what to look for in player vending/legendary drops.

---
Every day there's dozens of "I just winged it with zero plan and now I'm lvl 50 and my build is screwed up how do I fix it?" posts on this sub.  Don't be one of those people ;)
---
Not regularly but sometimes and they’re the only thing I buy from the atom shop.
---
Normally that arguement would hold water, but we're kinda past that point considering the number of utility items that are listed in the atom store (repair kits so no need to collect junk for that, scrap kits to save yourself a trek, junk bots to get access to more goods so the grind is ever so slightly less painful), those would all be advantageous to a player who has the cash over someone who doesn't.  And considering Beth's already hinted that the private servers would cost some kinda money (they explicitly used the word 'cost' when referring to hosting servers), I'd argue it's in the same boat, though I understand those wouldn't quite be that related.
---
ok im done i see this is a waste of time have a nice day
---
We should be able to host them ourselves, or have a straight up single player (although this would make more sense with Wastelanders) , not for purchase, this is pure greed.
---
You on XB? I'm 80, haven't launched a nuke yet myself.
---
Yep, it's a thing. The base versions will have DR/ER = 20/20 on legs/arms and 61/61 on the chest
---
Mod to your preference from there
---
But you can't get 100% Fusion Cores outside of workshops, or very rare rewards from Brotherhood events.
---
I wish there was something like GTA:Onlines FiveM for FO76....just host your own server and done.
---
I expect it to be a monthly subscription, probably around 10 bucks a month? Wish imho is too much.
---
I hear you fam, hoping wastelanders fixes this.
---
I have 30k caps hundreds of serums and 6 figures worth of legendaries.
---
As for workshops, imo at low level take every one but just move on as soon as you own the workshop.   
---
Taking workshops isn't risky, but hanging out there for extended timeframes is an invitation to get attacked.
---
you're welcome
---
I have over 1100 hours and I'm still enjoying myself. PvP sucks and I'm glad it's gone. 🤷‍♀️
---
Well you certainly got your money’s worth
---
Here is what you do:
---
1) Equip Butchers Bounty
---
2) find an area known for many ticks (Moonshine Shack, Lumber Yard and others)
---
3) Drop some explosive bait
---
4) Profit
---
Holy shit, now people are trying to claim getting leveled up by paying cash isn't p2w.
---
You may want to look up the definition of p2w, it literally is "anything that gives you an advantage in the game other players who don't pay money don't have access to. 
---
Are you trying to claim modern WoW isn't p2w as fuck? Next you are going to say runescape isn't pay 2 win either. LMAO
---
&gt;I'm sure the AAA game industry appreciates people making excuses for their predatory macro transactions
---
As I replied to the other in this thread, I'm a developer lead for a large corporation,  as such I'm both a consumer and a corporate employee... it doesn't have to be a zero sum game of us vs. Them. Bethesda is better than most in that they do provide a viable way to earn atoms in game, you just have to be able to have the self control to save and not buy every shiny thing you see. I'd hardly call that predatory.
---
Reminds me of picking up both the Tomahawk plan, and Fixer for a little less than 200 caps in total at a vendor. Always love when I make a good score.
---
Very very likely not. 
---
There's really no reason to think private servers aren't anything else but invite-only servers.
---
I really am failing to see how this is pay to win. Half the time I never see anybody and not having places "pre-looted" doesnt seem like that big of a thing anyhow (just will prevent endless server hoping which as far as I can tell is not an intended gameplay mechanic)
---
If anything its pay to have stable servers
---
Well. that's all rather uninteresting and not relevant. All I know is consumer complaints works. Complaints fix bugs, bring better content and control cost. I don't give a shit about bethesda as a corporation, I am thankful folks complain about this shit tho, because if they didn't I'd hate to see how incomplete/buggy games will be 5 years from now and how inflated the monetization would become. cheers tho. this topic is boring and I won't be replying to any more defenders of unchecked profiteering.
---
I would think it has height limit.
---
It's a combat knife masquerading as an anal probe. It is, for all intents and purposes, nothing more than a skin or model swap. I'm not conflating anything. You're over blowing a single item into something that isn't even close to happening.
---
I'm level 94 and even the 50% off at the purveyor got me to play on the 17th
---
So what did I pay $60 for at the beginning? Because I like unstable servers? So now we essentially need to pay to get better servers?
---
Kaboom.
---
All that I've been able to find about them is that they're just a weird glitch.
---
What I really like is when after something is released and people are upset because it wasn't what they expected it to be based off their completely made up expectations
---
Nah you paid for all the hours I assumed youv poured into the game and to play in an open world online fallout.
---
Now they are giving you the option to play it one player or on your own terms.
---
I have my base next to my girlfriend's and my brother's. We kinda settled there to form a small town, but they're never on anymore. It's faster just to switch servers.
---
Not the first time I've been nuked. Lol
---
Is it weird bombs dropped on my bday
---
I just wondered if you don't want private servers at all, or specifically being able to place a camp anywhere. It seems you're advocating for no private servers? But this thread is about camp placement.
---
Play fallout 4. I have never run out of things to do in that good fallout game.
---
I don't want to. I want public servers that don't crash every now and then.
---
Lol your not going to get any form of setting manipulation
---
It’s a pain in the balls. I admit I have hoarding tendencies, but too often it’s like playing Inventory Management Simulator 76.
---
I’d probably fill any sort of limit but 800 is a bit ungenerous. I hear in the olden days it was 400, eeuggh.
---
I feel there is plenty of content though. To get as far as OP has is still good value for money if you think about. Like pennies per hour of entertainment.
---
How about an actual no hair style?  Youd think bald would be a no brainer, wouldn't you lol
---
Give it time, every online game ends up having the servers reverse engineered and privately run by players. Even WoW has private servers.
---
"I used to be an adventurer like you, but Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long."
---
Just so you know all that resulted in was more people griefing in adventure. It was only helping carebears like yourself by keeping griefers out of your mode.
---
I used to try and protect the upstairs machine at Mama Dolce's with a mine, but any enemies entering have cleared the explosive range by the time it goes off. This lets you detonate them immediately.
---
ok, answer me this, what advantage does getting to max level instantly get you?
---
what advantage does it give you over grinding there instead?
---
all you do is save yourself time, theres no advantage in it.
---
the real pay to win in fallout currently is in people selling caps or items for actual money.
---
People are under a weird misunderstanding that Junkies is a special "build" when its just like any other full health build with at most a couple minor alterations to enhance chem/alcohol usage (though those perks can benefit any build, not just Junkies).  
---
So you just use whatever armor you would normally use for a full health build.    
---
The main exception would be chest mod - there's a strong argument that biocommesh is worth the slot especially for pve so long as you don't use explosive weapons and thus need dense.
---
I just want more reason to nuke other than sbq or white springs. I would like to nuke the toxic valley or ashheep for a boss it can really break up the monotony with different bosses.
---
Then dont pay for the private worlds? Honestly the crashes iv experienced are in par with other bethesda titles so maybe I'm jaded but I don't see the issue.
---
Most people would be more than happy to set up their own servers for free. I know tons of people who run their own minecraft servers, and even a few who run private wow servers.
---
More nuke bosses would be fun.
---
I still haven't got tomahawk! Before this, my best hit was heavy robot legs for 59c from a vendor, and before that it was the bear arm plan the day before the inside the vault saying you needed it to unlock legendary near arms. Had I been a day slower it would have been 15k and not 450c :)
---
I'm failing to see how this post agrees or disputes the purported private servers nuking the economy from orbit.
---
* 100% fusion cores can be crafted, and also drop from various mobs. Yesterday I picked up several from Super Mutants of all things. I have a heavy weapons power armor wearing toon. When I made him I claimed one of the power plants for a couple hours and combined all my excess cores from other toons. I wound up with about 50 cores. I've been playing him for a month now and I think I have burned through 3 or 4 :/
---
* How is doing a Brotherhood event hoping for a very rare reward any different on a public vs private server? Unless private servers give the ability to trigger the event at will (which I'd bet my life savings they wont), this is a total non-issue.
---
That is literally the point, the advantage is you don't have to level up yourself. Just like how runescape has xp boosts for cash. Which has been called out as p2w for nearly a decade.
---
No sense in trying to reason about it, just know that complaining about complaints is still complaining my friend.
---
AA is good for targets that are tanky, Junkies is just raw power. Both will do fine in pve and pvp. In pve there is no damage threshold where as in pvp the max damage you can deal is 110. AA works well on people and big creatures who are tanky, and junkies will let you remove a few cards in pvp to use elsewhere or push your damage high enough where armor wont soak enough damage. 
---
Junkies requires that you have conditions, AA does not, however, it also does not fair well vs HP heavy creatures that don't have a lot of armor.
---
It thus comes down to, what do you want to do with them? AA is fixable and junkies is a meta because bloodied is to risky for some people.
---
Hmm, downvoted for pointing out it HAS already been invented and exists? Alrighty.
---
A few tips that have been shared before but all the same:
---
1. Never, ever log out of the game while you are at your camp. Most of my pet deaths happened when I forgot this and found the pet dead upon logging back in... Try to logout somewhere in walking distance of your camp and then when you log back in, just walk to your camp... After you get your camp to load that way, you can come and go via fast travel without issue, for that session.
---
2. If you're getting a pet that you want to guard your camp (Megasloth, deathclaw, etc), DO NOT pacify (with Wasteland Whisperer) before taming them... Just tame them (Animal Whisperer) first... Pacifying them will make them nonviolent hippies... The downside of this is that, if your camp is along Grahm's path, he may aggro towards your pet. Since Grahm is essentially immortal, he will kill your pet.
---
3. If you want to ensure that another player cannot kill your pet, you have to stay in Pacifist mode... They can shoot all they want, but they can't do any damage.
---
I'm a big Megasloth fan (I sell souvenir sloth toys for 25 caps!) , and I've learned all this the hard way. But I've had my new Megasloth for over a month now following these guidelines.
---
This is a huge problem for me on PS4.  Takes between 10-20 seconds before I can assign another item after I list something.
---
I agree with you that people would.  I'm just saying it's not uncommon for live service games to ask for money for private servers.
---
Ask eckserah, they’re a dataminer
---
I think survival-type servers will be one of the first changes we'll see.
---
Sure, have that as an option instead of forcing anyone who wants to run a private server to have to pay them monthly. That is the point, the fact they only offer "renting" servers is just more greed.
---
I'm getting Vertigo just looking at the pic!
---
I smell it every time Bethesda think about monetization
---
Yes that's why they are unlocked
---
very cool picture.....my best picture is probably this.....  
---
[https://imgur.com/2wVNTgh](https://imgur.com/2wVNTgh)
---
Is it PVE or PVP? It's way op to feel any discernable difference in PVP; either one will kill folks in few seconds. In PVE you will effectively use the splittered one for about dozen enemies until it breaks down...
---
Outer Worlds coming out in a few days. JS
---
same bro
---
Have you see one with magnifying glass and the needle? Or gang in rowing boat? Or threesome? Or workers grill party? I thought I took pictures of all ... then I found another ... :D It always makes me smile when I find another one!
---
Only in the rain.
---
Anyone can farm Poseidon for 5 hours, Ammo factory for 10 hours without fear of being contested, then flood the public servers with these. Your legendary drop rate effectively increases as you no longer compete with others to get a hit in. You play with 5 alts, not everyone does that. 100% FC are extremely expensive to craft, requiring a lot of flux, and super mutants don't drop 100% cores. They drop 90% ones and that too, very, very rarely if it is crowned.
---
And you misconstrued my last point. On public servers you *need* to hop BoS events, but on private you don't need to. Just hold Poseidon for 2 hours, without any fear of having it being taken away.
---
I don't disagree with you. And I agree on your post about legendary hazmat. I just found it a fun challenge to make it viable, given all of the trash talk about it. No one who does a berserker is trying to be OP. It's definitely more difficult to play my Berserker than my heavy gunner, or even my hybrid - another garbage build lol.
---
I know one other person who has a berserker alt. His is slightly different from mine perk-wise. When I was still playing, we would sometimes trade berserker weapons.
---
I would like it if the bitchfest would stop every time something releases. Like when things the community asks for like a fucking fridge, that they wouldn't complain when they charge for it. That was the last straw for me. Of coarse they are gonna charge it. Time is money and someone likely multiple people were involved in getting that mechanic to work and produce it for us. And you all cried like fucking babies about it.
---
I enjoy the game and I am not gonna bitch and moan over stupid shit.
---
congrats man we need more post of peoples experiences instead of all the complaining and bashing. Congrats again
---
What does that accomplish aside from spending caps that you don't have many of at a low level? You have to stick around for the defend event to actually get anything out of it, and that is when you are most likely to get steamrolled. 
---
Again, not arguing that nobody should be taking workshops. I grab them whenever I level up a new toon. But as far as advice to give a brand new player goes, I just don't think they are something anybody and everybody should be told to do. 
---
I for one will single out somebody who has more than 2 or 3 workshops on a server and I'll start taking them. Not because I consider myself the workshop police, but because I know somebody either does not understand what workshops are and there's really only one way to learn, or I believe somebody is putting their PvP flag up.
---
I've never tried to set up a camp inside of an already-established building so I'm not exactly sure how it works there but at places like The gorge junkyard some of the things of scrapable and some arent. I just open the camp build mode and run around the area and see what highlights green. I'm assuming it works the same way when you set up camp in and establish building. once you have your camp area I would assume certain objects in that area like chairs and tables and probably that power armor station are scrapable.
---
The real endgame is PvP. Research and start fighting people. Builds matter way more when fighting other players.
---
Congrats! Once you reach higher levels, they become more of a nuisance. Look forward to that day.
---
People love to theorycraft and run their imaginations wild. Just look at the Star Citizen forums; folks dream about their future gameplay more than they actually play.
---
I agree with this, you used to be able to nuke the Capital and Fort Defiance and get really good spawns. Then they nerfed the shit out of it.
---
LOL.  In Todd We Trust, or don't trust anymore...
---
Greed is a pretty convenient blanket term for whenever a company try's to make money.
---
Once again the practice is not uncommon and often works as a way to keep server side code and such from not being fugged with.
---
That's not really a good reason though, people that would want to exploit things are simply using mules already.
---
I was level 100 before I fully committed to heavy weapons, prob 115 ish before I became a total junkie slut. Junkie builds rock IMO.
---
My made up expectation is that this sub will be full of salt from other peoples' made up expectations.
---
Card sharing is very important for team support classes in both pve and pvp so our group tends to build around what cards we can and will share with lower CH people taking the 1 point cards and high ch people picking cards that help us all and also cards that help if we close by.
---
Ain’t this the truth.
---
They'd be printing money if they offered a Service Rifle or R91 skin for the Handmade or Assault Rifle. Or even a Riot Armor skin.
---
I’m level 140 and still on brotherhood quests. No rush. Explore, grind for mats/levels/legendaries. The game isn’t going anywhere. Try some PVP if you’re bored and you’ll see where your character is lacking.
---
I knew you could target enemy grenades, but it works on your own as well?
---
Recent blizzard stupidity ? Hmmm
---
Actually I’m quit the game since early April hoping for Wastlanders Update but suddenly delayed so MAYBE I will be back Fall 2020 or even 2021 because 2020 have ALOT of games
---
Can we please get some chainsaw skins and buff to make it good weapon i really like the chainsaw its got potential like 
---
A biger chainsaw that uses fusion cores 
---
I mean im completely crazy with a chainsaw i have taken on a legendary 3 star lvl 80 noxious sheepsquatch with a friend using a chainsaw 
---
Plus i normally tak down ghouls at white spring resort. You can even run  with your chainsaw on so it becomes really strong combined with pain train, glow sights and speed demond
---
If it's the same day, how do they explain nights?
---
I felt like this around February but I started playing other games, came back and started making new characters and had fun again. I have now 5 different characters and still having fun. I never bought any weapon or armor from player vendors because that would kill the game for me. Also don't blame survival players for shitty players you find. Or try pvp, it becomes a whole new game.
---
Do you have a source for this rumor?
---
I was do bummed when I found out OW was only single player. But, I still think it will be good.
---
You know, the truth is that even for high-level players, that area around the Pumpkin House can be a nightmare.  Because it's often not just the Scorchbeast - it's also Deathclaws, Super Mutants, sometimes even Fog Crawlers.  You should be proud that you were able to take down that one in particular.
---
If the pricing/subscription is anything similar to Minecraft Realms, then I'd be okay with that, especially if as the owner I can set up an access list or tie it to an XBox group and have it open to group members.
---
I would not have picked the cores up off super mutants if they were not 100%. Sorry I don't have screenshots readily available to prove to you that it happened. I know it is not something I have seen in the past so I will definitely chalk that up as a fluke.
---
What's to gain if somebody farms fusion cores and ammo from workshops though? How does that effect my game play? I don't think people should be buying fusion cores anyway but they are, what do I care if the prices get driven lower? 
---
10 hours of holding the ammo factory still won't produce the amount of ammo I can get from one trip up the savage divide scrapping weapons as I go.
---
Maybe I'm just not doing things right with legendaries but I have never had to compete to get a hit. I don't run into nuke zones, perhaps that is why. If that is what you are referring to then I'll agree, you do have more potential there. Even with 5 alts, I still usually only play 1 per day, and I can't name the last weekday evening of limited play time that has ended without me blowing through my 150 scrip cap.
---
They are coming tomorrow...
---
And you sound like a potato flavored candy bar. I got some nut for that mouth.
---
And you should be able to place your CAMP in another persons CAMP. Since I doubt they’ll raise the build limit.
---
I am just lvl 50+, still upgrading my gear for my 1st SB fight. Cant wait for the experience ..
---
Congrats!
---
Thats the same place I got my first, and I was just as terrified as you were...
---
True but it’s a pain in the ass to go thru breaking armor just to get the effects. Unless there’s some enemy/area I should look for to help destroy it more easily?
---
You don't choose the junkies lifestyle, it chooses you.
---
Hmmm i wonder
---
So, it's complicated. Heh.
---
What a little shit. Not gonna lie, I'd probably laugh if it were me, let the nuke land, then harass the hell out of him, but I'm petty like that. Lol
---
I get the same message occasionally (PS4).
---
I think it just depends on how long you have the window open.
---
I just reexecure the paticular transaction and carry on
---
I don't know.  It's not an easy question to answer.  I've long advocated for several different endboss options though.  The Queen should remain the Queen, but dropping a bomb anywhere else?  There should be a unique boss associated with that too.  I also think the game should embrace its Sims-side a little more and offer random "stuff" to do at your CAMP for others, like mod crafting, offering services, etc.  It also needs a reliable Cap sink that's tied into the Legendary system in some way - whether it's upgrading Legendaries, buying them, etc.  Caps eventually become meaningless and they really shouldn't.
---
The players are really to blame. How much enthusiasm would you have if you worked with the dev team and every fo76 google search yielded salty comments? 
---
They wasted a lot of resources to cater to salt miners and now private servers? 
---
I mean if the player base showed more support - then the company would be more inclined to invest more resources. 
---
Why would they waste their time or money just to get shit on ? Just saying... 
---
We shit on Bethesda from the start. And it never ended. However other games came out in worse shape then fo76 but fan base was positive and in return received more content and updates.
---
I add serendipity, ricochet and brawler to that.  Very helpful.
---
Scrip caps are easy to blow through, takes only 5-6 pieces of gear. People make the actual money selling them.
---
I didn’t think searing rocket was rare? I have it on my junkies sledge
---
thats strange.  Scrip usually resets in 24, so you should be able to get rid of some of that excessice weight...
---
IDK about the rename - does it still error when you try to remove a custom name?
---
You won't get it because the it's bugged. They need to fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long.
---
What online game only allows private servers that they themselves host? I can't think of any.
---
As a person who will hunt down work shop owners for their stuff I strongly encourage people to take workshop while they are low in level, but not so I can kill you. I encourage you to take over work shops and not linger around them though. Work shops are great for Exp, caps, passive loot you will never use that early in the game, and plans. They will also unlock a bunch of defense plans you can use later at your camp.
---
Most work shop hunters will not bother killing a low lvl person unless you are linger around for a long time at the work shop. The reason for this is it takes caps paid to start the fight and if you are a super low lvl person we only get caps based on your level. If you have a crap load of stuff built up though, the gamble is you have enough junk on you or that the camp itself will produce enough junk to make up the cap loss. I have taken camps that cost 100 caps from low lvls because I gambled on the fact they might be an alt, 75% of the people I have done this too have been what we call "pinatas" and dropped all manner of stupid amounts of junk. DON'T be these people and you will be fine.
---
Also if you want to stay in a workshop, stay ducked and stay outside of the camp area. You won't lose your stuff, be murdered, and the camp will be taken from you without any trouble. If you stay in, expect to die.
---
25k
---
Back to economics then, more supply should drive prices down to where caps once again become a viable currency.
---
I can only suggest doing something else for a few minutes and coming back.  When I've come across this error, if feels incredibly random and I have no idea what causes it, but it also seems to work itself out in time.
---
How good is 100+ protection in all categories for a chest piece
---
yeah i agree, its making my merchant characters inpossibel to play on, managing inventory is infuriating
---
Wtf. No update today like normal?
---
For me, the damage mitigation perks are more important than added HP, in terms of spending perks and points. I find sneak is also useful for staying out of harms way. And this character is melee.
---
So Adamantium Skeleton, Fireproof, Dodgy, Serendipity, all maxed. Maybe Ricochet, which I do use. They all help prevent or reduce damage greatly. 
---
It really came together for my Berserker when I maxed Born Survivor and upped First Aid. She became more hardy in combat.
---
If I come back to the game, I have a junkie planned. Already collected quite a few weapons.
---
Just enjoy the game. It is fun and there is a lot to do and people to hangout with. 
---
If on PS4 and need the Basic supplies. Pm me 
---
PSN: Radcooldude55YT 
---
Always here to help
---
Really oh ok, thanks. I’ll  have a route about and see if i can find it..
---
Update is happening tomorrow.
---
Nah. Someone will math out a new way to keep the build alive with new techniques.
---
Nobody trolls harder than Bethesda.
---
My made up expectation is offended by your made up expectation.
---
So, the same as nearly every other previous update... um, "integration"??
---
Serious answer, people who have no problems or complaints generally don't come here and let us know everything is fine.  The stuff you see here is a slice of people complaining, most people don't have all the same problems as these here.
---
I do like to come around and voice the other side as much as I have time, since some of the stuff people complain about is not really an issue, but you'll see mostly complaints.
---
For me adventure servers with control who gets in so I can ensure its 23 of my friends is exactly what I want.
---
The PvP toggle will come at some point. I hope now, but I'm okay if not immediately.
---
This is a big deal, and huge the first time you do it. Congrats!!!
---
what lvl do i need to join?
---
I never said it was fact. Its an educated guess as I've played in servers on FO76 where there were only a few players and the game ran much smoother and not even the infamous strangler heart PA was lagging.
---
Because October 23rd is the pre-anniversary of the bombs?
---
I'll tell you after I get mine. I'm sure you'll just say "nuh uh" anyway though.
---
Yooooo me too! End of the World Bros
---
That seems surprisingly low given that’s it’s by the dudes who made New Vegas, and that was certainly more than 40
---
That is greatest thing I’ve read in a bit.
---
Also the holotape games. Always fun to play if your bored
---
Wait wait what is it? I haven’t seen it yet
---
Sounds like you need to put the mine next to the machine...
---
I can nearly guarantee that this is the case, for more than one reason.  I doubt that there will me much in the way of configurations that will be available, *at least* on launch, and likely not ever.
---
I'll be happy and impressed if we get some granular control down the road, but I suspect that hadn't been developed at all yet, and may never be.
---
RNG?  Why does everyone on here use these acronyms assuming we all know what they stand for?
---
ITYAADWSHBS.  (I'm going to start typing complete sentences as acronyms in response to these from now on.)  Go ahead... figure out what I just said.
---
The moonshiners shack near the vaut
---
I’d say given the fact that you’ve done everything, you have every reason to be. Make a new character and force yourself to play in a way you never usually do as a challenge mode.
---
Nice job!
---
The only way I'll even think about getting a private server is if I get a bigger stash, scrip limit and camp limit
---
I wish I could up vote you twice for this.
---
Lmao. The economy is fucked by design.
---
You sound like one of those people that said "if trump wins I'm moving to canade". I dont think you'll leave just like not many people actually left after repair kits.
---
I think was was over level 40 before I managed to take down my first Scorchbeast.  Was only able to after I managed to get a 3\* Gatling Plasma, otherwise I'd continue dying like I always was.
---
You can get plans for unique items?
---
I'm not sure, probably any level. But depending on how they set it up, the ghouls may be overwhelming for lower levels.
---
The more questions you ask, the more disappointed you might be
---
Imagine the meme that could be made from this: What Fallout 76 players imagine Bethesda setting up private server architecture to be.  
---
Picture of somebody, preferably female, standing in line at Wal Mart with a cart full of Raspberry Pis and a wireless router.
---
You can get a four star if you go to Charleston fire station and buy scorched killers mods
---
That as well. Service rifle for the AR, chinese AR for the handmade, and R91 for the combat rifle.
---
Certain ones.
---
Depends.
---
Go to the middle of the big red circle in the map, don't take any junk
---
Should have all that information tomorrow, hopefully.
---
All rise?
---
power armor also has a bug where it can break cards. You may have to take the cards off and put them back on for them to work. Sometimes its better to just ignore power armor when a melee build.
---
Sounds great fun actually!
---
If u want to kill almost everything in 1 shot, sure a instigating lever, instiganting hunting rifle, instigating pipe bolt action.
---
ROFL, 1tb of ram years ago? What OS were you using?
---
Its going to be minimum 10$ a month. Its pretty much the normal rates for rented private servers in most games to do so. If they charge more than they can shove their Private servers up their asses.
---
Actually there are ticks running around dolly sods cabin
---
Lever rifles can get pretty high in DMG but it depends on your play style 
---
Gauss rifles are also great DMG
---
The tomahawk plan took me ages, and I actually feel very lucky to have found it in a vendor because I had been farming drops for it for months.  :( Edit: If you are on Xbox, and need a supplier for them, just being me the mats, and I'll make tomahawks for yah. They are great for a stealth grenade slot.
---
Let me know the reactions you get if you can sell caps for max caps.
---
In my opinion since I run all 3 Riflemans I use a Lever Action Rifle &amp; Gauss Rifle! Mine are both two shot/explosive so with Demolition Expert x5 my Lever Actions base damage is around 350 and Gauss damage base is around 470.
---
From duping yes, but I currently make a decent amount of caps from selling plans, unused ammo, flux and serums at fair prices.  So the economy isn't that bad at the moment.
---
Patch is tomorrow
---
I have 7 in misc. I don’t know where they came from.
---
Can you put it in a display case?
---
This is awesome haha, do you have a video? Would love to see it
---
You mean to launch? You get a screen that somewhat resembles the game map and you click on it to select a point. It shows a red circle and gives you the option to confirm.
---
Only thing you need is extra room in your inventory to fast travel out with all the crap it gives you as a reward. I usually drop the missiles on the floor.
---
Not that I'm aware of.
---
They assume they will be able to tweak the server options (drop rates/duping) to do things. Imo private servers are going to be identical to adventure just with invite only / kick options
---
Not at all. I'd love to visit if you are on XB1.
---
I am  hoarder of chems and aid items, in fact if you meet my character in game I'll probably have plenty of any item you need. With this in mind and with so many chems and lots of aquired junkie weapons I found my calling.
---
They said it was coming tomorrow..
---
Bethesda has never been very consistent as to whether or not ghouls rot or smell. Some of it you could chalk up to anti-ghoul bias. Some may be individual ghouls. I know the drunk in Underworld in FO3 complains that he keeps losing body parts and the doc has to keep stitching them back on. But that could be because he's really clumsy when drunk.
---
I presume that ghouls aren't noticeably worse smelling than other wastelanders. It never seems to be an issue in settlements with a lot or entirely ghoul populations. If they did smell I can't see anyone wanting to stay in Undercity without gagging and puking. An entire settlement of ghouls underground in a building with bad ventilation problems? The mechanic may complain that he has to keep it going to keep the smell down, but it can't be worse than any other group of people in that situation. If they did smell of decay and rot the Lone Wanderer would have doubled over and started puking as soon as they entered.
---
Hence the need for an improved system.
---
&gt; really hoping it's hearsay :/
---
Same.. .7 people is quite lame, really really disappointing lol
---
Care to elaborate?
---
It is. It's hilarious. 
---
One guy followed me and I brought him there, my buddy went on area chat when he was standing on the rug, and he yelled 'PULL!'
---
Then that player was launched and downed. I went down and revived him, then the first thing he did was pop on mic and ask how we did it
---
Nah next week will be private server hate when people realize that server costs will go up according to playercount, there won't be mods yet(yeah some people still won't know), and overall its not gonna be this end all be all  experience for most people in the long run.
---
Or flight helmets.
---
Looks like there's a Bombs Drop sale on Xbox right now for Fallout games. No. Fo3 or NV DLC though, that sucks.
---
The radiation could kill them though?
---
Thats pretty cool. Makes sense then
---
Probably something you did to anger Atom?
---
Pipe bolt imo.
---
I'm on PS4, But actually am due to receive my first Xbox One tomorrow. I might get it for XBox and do the same there.
---
Whenever I come across a camp with a launcher, I'm always the first one to volunteer to be launched🤣
---
Wow that’s nuts. What’s your opinion on Handmades?
---
waddle to harpers ferry? Or are you maxxed weight that you are slower than a snail? And what the hell you got in your stash that you are that bad?   
---
I rolled 1000 scrip on 3 characters each all 3 star ranged and still have weight open. Did you roll all two starred?
---
I got this one from spamming the pick up action on the caps that explode out of the bottle cap mines.
---
Hi bored, i'm EZMONEYSNIP3R
---
Complete challenges.
---
Explore everything on the map.
---
Stop fast traveling and walk to every destination. (Warp to events, but return back to your journey where you left off.)
---
Lol come on over friend, we will launch you any time, we will even cover the repairs of the trap if you want to go again.
---
Bloodied melee has a tough time on the SBQ unless you rad shield and have good defensive buffs. Vanguard melee does well. But most I see do like you said. Heavy while in the air or other mobs and melee on landing.
---
Dude your a jerry
---
yes, otherwise I'd never find the mines that didn't get tripped.... Well I still don't usually find them but it helps a little
---
I actually do. I will edit post and add a link later. Just at work right now!
---
Workshops are horrible for farming ANY resource
---
More and more repetitive more like!
---
instigating + explosive or fire rate leaver action rifle.
---
My biggest takeaway from this discussion is that melee builds don't use power armor haha
---
I keep 2 of my 4 unlocked this way I have some restocking and if people wonder by and need some theres 2 they can freely pick from. Otherwise I usually harvest mine for easy caps when I need some after buying plans I need etc.
---
I didn’t see anything new in there
---
Way easier to talk shit than actually use your brain, huh?
---
I hear you on the toxic players lately the other night around watoga there was a lvl 35 that just went around talking crap to people that wouldn't fight him.
---
With clever use of equivocation, I imagine
---
I do 650 with bloodied explosive leavers and adrenaline/vats activated.
---
lol Its sarcasm guys!!
---
Don't shoot her and she will land. Yeah pop her a couple times to get her to fly over but once she is headed over the group needs to stop shooting. You always get that one guy though that has to lay into her when she starts the landing animation and she just stays up in the air.
---
My bloodied melee has a Resolute Veteran. It only comes out to get the attention of the SBQ or to tag things without killing when I'm around other people.
---
Sounds about right!
---
I run two separate instances on one GPU (GTX 1080 Ti). I have a multi-monitor setup so I keep one on my my lower left monitor &amp; one on the right. I run them in bordered windows (fullscreen) &amp; hit the windows key when I want to move the mouse from one game window to the other. 
---
I use it mostly for swapping items between the accounts. I just open the second game instance with the fallout76 . exe. I actually often open both instances that way these days just avoid the delay with Bethesda's launcher.
---
Well even service games reach an ending.
---
Sneak helps a lot with this. I just crouch below her and rarely get hit by her. It's all the other stuff running around that I have to worry about. If she does hit me I heal quick and move while still crouched. That's all it ever takes.
---
I do like them, I had a TSE one at the start of the game but ended up selling it but recently bought another one! To me it's more useful as non automatic due to not having every single shot hit the target and wasting ammo, cause it does happen. But other then that it's the more realistic / entertaining gun to use
---
Not for Fusion Cores.
---
I have no idea why they haven't done this. It is such a no brainer to put Fallout things they already own into the game.
---
Instead they seem hell bent on putting resources into making absurd costumes and skins to introduce into the world.
---
I use a junkies handmade with 33% vat chance. I can headshot level 68 mutants from insanely far for over 1300 damage.  I run adrenaline reaction and unyielding gear tho.  I usually sit around 25-30% hp
---
Just let the defend event fail and then do the retake event at your leisure.  Similar reward and no need to sit there through multiple waves.  Retake almost always takes vastly less time, meaning a smaller window of time hanging out in a pvp open fire zone hoping not to get roflstomped by some other player.
---
You normally earn the caps back you spent to gain the workshop as soon as you take it plus some minor rewards so you are already ahead of the game just from the jump regardless of the defend/retake event.
---
Or op can sit through the defend waves and hope someone doesn't stomp their noob character into the dust, whatever floats the boat :P
---
I've been buying cheap weightless weapons I like and putting them on my walls for displaying. 
---
I have a Hunter's RW broadsider that weighs literally nothing, with its light barrel mod.  It takes up literally Zero stash space.  [https://imgur.com/a/f3PrVdB](https://imgur.com/a/f3PrVdB)

fans: pls beth we some improvements as built in borderlands2 
---
beth: ok go play borderlands3... we are building best pubg alternate... go away

fans:.. (cryin in dark corners)

Very nice. I have one that I posted when display cases were added. It has a few other collectibles you might want to consider.

[Checklist 1.0](https://imgur.com/a/98Yl2BH)

First attraction in your future amusement park.
---
If it is modded , lock the character to that mode. But not all people care about or want mods. I know I don't. Never have . I have no interest in modding . But I would like to have the option to use a private server as a place to play laggy content in a less laggy server. That is the only interest I have in them. So I think the fair thing to do would be, lock the character to private if mods to drop rates etc have been used . No mods, free to come and go.
---
Sure does!
---
I'm a melee build for most ground based things, but to date, anything that flies has been on the recieving end of a ballistic weapon.   (Although last weekend, Mrgph graced me with a 3\* utracite gatling - I'm going to try next time I cross paths with the queen)
---
I don't, understand, your accent,
---
Anti-Armor Quad Explosive Tesla w/ 25% faster fire rate and 15% faster reload.
---
Not just from doing. Legacy weapons sell for 200k even though they have been duped. Without doers they'd kill like 500k. Even non legacy items like the red asylum outfit good for 150k+
---
If I had the camp budget, I would. 
---
We are always working to add new and exciting things though, so definitely not out of the question.
---
lol ego much? I don't have issues with griefers because I don't put myself in a position where they can touch me. People preying on low levels are scum and should be banned
---
Eh people are bored server I was in dude used all 3 to target people
---
Grats man and keep going!😎
---
I'm a mix of melee and ranged but I really dont have the ranged kind of weapons that would be effective against the SBQ, so when she's flying around I'm running around killing all the scorched on the ground.  When she lands I run right up and start on her head.
---
Lady luck must have been rolling nat 20s for both of us, got [this](https://i.imgur.com/ZtkQLiw.png) and [this](https://i.imgur.com/TUmrIax.png) from AWOL Armaments today. Congratz.

QE railway
---
Use bait
---
Yes, it absolutely should. They made those games, they need to learn from those games.
---
Whatever they think they have going with the current legendary system is not working.
---
The end game reward system in fallout 76 is absolutely uncompelling and unecessary. People stop playing because it is so awful.
---
Ha ha, they aint that active at Bethesda!
---
If its like most games probably $15 monthly minimum. But that'll be just basic, low player count. The 2 games I play with private servers charge more for the number of players allowed, so unless people are gonna rent for purely single player reasons, its prob not gonna be cheap to have a decent server going, that's high speed, high player count etc.
---
For sure for sure. The bugs can be annoying. Fortunalty i haven’t came across any big bus when I’ve played. Biggest one I’ve come across is probably that one if you don’t count the server lag outs.
---
I never lock my 2 purifiers water makes fast..
---
It was changed to 30k
---
Actually you were given this.  For a normally 100 script item. you got 80 script back for the same 100 script during the sale.
---
But the real story is WHY did they nuke your camp? 
---
I've seen it done for pretty petty and senseless reasons. Meanwhile I've done it myself for perfectly good.....nah fuck it they were petty and senseless reasons. But no regrets. 
---
PS: No I didn't nuke your camp I haven't been on at all yet today.
---
Oh thanks I would get it wrong for awhile until I would be corrected
---
Same position! I left at level 240, logging in occasionally to get free atom shop items. I didn't participate in the wasteland cleanup because everything was getting so tedious. No events, scrip limits, etc.
---
Been playing Borderlands 3 since release... I miss 76 and expected to be playing it for a long while yet, but content seems slow to come and we never even got to do the raids in account of it being buggy as all hell, minimal to no benefit, and the prospect that it will delete my items.
---
Someday I'll be back. Until then, it's living vicariously through all the other players posting fun pics and filthy situations.
---
There's no reason for this comment to be downvoted, that's the exact truth. They've been using the same engine for over a decade, and it definitely shows.

You crank up your adrenaline with her minions and wait for her to land lol

Nope. Next thing you know you're farming legendaries and what's to stop a simple mule from another console/pc invited to the private world have all of that good stuff transferred and returned back to adventure mode? It's bad enough that you'll be able to take over all the workshops in a  large world, farming for hours and essentially throw the entire market out of balance soon after everything becomes worthless? They have to reduce drop rates and rewards in private servers to little to no return to balance things out.
---
Yikes, that's insane.  I don't even care about those weapons but those are ridiculous prices.
---
Very true! I also sneak with rifleman. That’s a good point
---
But I mean... that’s not Bethesda’s fault? This is really just a whiny post IMO.
---
Here’s the truth: *you’re a fringe case on the bell curve of players*. Bethesda can’t conceivably cater directly to you, **nor should you expect that of them**. They’re working on new material, *game-changing* material, that will give everyone much more to do and make Fallout 76 feel more like a fallout game. 
---
Until then, things might get “boring”. But COME ON... your boredom is not their fault. You’re a pretty high level, a lot of people aren’t there yet. You’ve done everything, a lot of people haven’t yet. But that’s why other games exist. Go get Outer Worlds (as others have suggested). Go play Borderlands 3. 
---
Don’t complain because they won’t give you engaging content whenever you deem it necessary. Just wait, and you’ll be back to playing new content in no time.
---
Nice!platform?all on the queen?
---
Definitely get full cores from mutants and ghouls and anything that just happens to have them .
---
Here's a list for [Legendary Weapons](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_weapon_effects)  
---
and here for [Legendary Armor](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Fallout_76_legendary_armor_effects)  
---
A Bloodied/Explosive/Weightless/Wounding/Dangerous anything would be insane  
---
I would love a Furious/Explosive/Durability/Wounding/Dangerous LMG or Minigun.
---
Shotgun perks demolition expert and other stuff that increase Dmg
---
&gt;Well. that's all rather uninteresting and not relevant
---
&gt;this topic is boring and I won't be replying to any more defenders of unchecked profiteering
---
Lmao. Because you have no rebuttal to real world problems...nor have you shown any form of "unchecked profiteering" , only the usual whining of the entitled that they never get enough for free.
---
There's a note on a table on a patio in Morgantown, close to the monorail. It's called "Unfinished Postcard". It was written by a student to his/her parents. But it just stops mid-sentence. I assumed it was because as this student was writing a letter to their parents and having a few beers, the Great War happened. It made me put myself in that situation myself. One moment, things are nice and calm. You're sitting outside, having a few beers, and writing a letter to your beloved family. The next moment is chaos.
---
This is part of what I like about Fallout 76, it gives you a look into the lives of people directly before the bombs, and how they reacted and experienced the Great War. This is especially true with the Responder stories holotapes, in my opinion.
---
Haven't seen it yet, did stumbled on an Avenging Mothman for first time(Revenging or something of the sort?). Which caught me off guard since heard it, saw it, blinked a few times got knocked around by its blast then spent a few minutes fighting it as it jumped into the air and back, was a weird encounter. Found the Graffton monster 3 times.
---
Ah I see
---
What's going on in this thread? Oh shit They need to fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long.
---
Yeah it's odd that fo4, an older game, had better enemy ai.  At least supermutants will occasionally toss a grenade hoping to flush you out.
---
So because I make offensive jokes in private, I have no right to view something as offensive?
---
You're therefore implying that you personally either never get offended by any racism or anything like that, or that you've never done or said anything offensive with friends. I found either one very hard to believe. If neither are true, that makes you a hypocrite by your own judgment. I guarantee you can't find a single person on Earth who fits that description.
---
I also wasn't offended. I was pointing out how that could be offensive.
---
It's not virtue signalling if I clearly made that comment with a kinda intent. I didn't talk down on OC or anything. I simply said that that's not what OCD is and to be careful with how it can be taken as insensitive.
---
We’ve got an update coming in November
---
This is pretty much all I do, no one ever sends me angry messages :)
---
Hey look Ma, a complainer complaining about complaints.
---
my gawd...you're tedious. blocking now. just because you don't see the rebuttal doesn't mean it isn't there. you are blind or refuse to accept evidence contrary to your predetermined opinion. you want to go in circles until you wear me out. done. blocked. bye.
---
Best idea ever!
---
Nice! Same here, Never got a single angry message.
---
I never said that, seems your quite delusional as well, let folks have there fun here, ya'll don't need to throw bee's nest posts like this to get your rocks off, that's what porn is for
---
Seriously...you and your high horse can eff right off.  Stop projecting and get help yourself. And blocked.
---
I want something else to do in the game.
---
Go in circles? No, you never rebutted my point at all, just said it's all boring. So, yeah, I get why you want to run away. Cheers!
---
Top of West Tek Research Center.
---
Popped your cherry!
---
Currently running a bloodied lever. One shots most stuff. It is backed up by a quad explosive handmade for oh shit moments.
---
Also noteworthy in my wheel is a bloodied railway for when I want to say choo choo over and over until my wife tells me to shut up.
---
this, no reason to pay xbone and ps for 2 patches on back to back days.  Better to just lump the atom store update in with patch 14.
---
This! I have been diving into Red Dead Online for the first time so I've been content.
---
I’m not hopping on until wastelanders
---
Wc lvl?
---
I’m still scared of them but that’s because I designed my character around stealth. So I’m squishy and they have amazing perception.
---
PVE only, PVP only, or both? Vats or free aim? Build type? Playstyle? A ton of factors go into weapon choice.
---
Yikes, was hoping they'd give us something instead of trying to make a buck. Guess we'll find out for sure tomorrow.
---
I have no idea i dont pvp and im a nice guy help out plenty of low levels and even high levels i was just getting iron in ash heap when i heard the alarm and thought oh sweet SBQ event then i saw it right over my camp i fast traveled to it stood in front of my house saluted it and waited for the boom
---
Even if you do, it's not a reliable farming source as opposed to using Poseidon.
---
the stats.  There's a post somewhere that shows the stats of the various versions of each armor and possibly some of the various wikis out there might have this info as well.
---
iirc heavy combat limbs have 20/20 dr/er but I could be misremembering.
---
The real question is will they patch the latest duping exploit lol
---
Chances are that would be the case until Bethesda realizes everyone canceled their practice care server subscription because of it.
---
Yeah but the mule system is a PITA especially for console or weaker PCs, this would be incredibly easy. Quite a difference between the two.
---
Dang it. Now y'all are going to be crowding me and my base with your manhattenization of the region.  😉
---
She gave me a furious ultracite gat laser on my melee character. Just tried it out against the queen lat night. Prepare to be impressed. It frikkin melted her with no perks. Only said i was 4 or 5 damage per in her face but her health bar just dissapeared man. Took less than 5 minutes. Highly reccomend.
---
This is awesome! Thanks so much for taking the time to make this!
---
Damn that sucks. Glad you were able to rebuild.
---
Dang straight we better place it anywhere if we paying for the dang server. Would prefer building restrictions be removed though as had a fun time building using exploits and main one most use is rug glitch to make displays cool.
---
My bloodied sniper looks happy with his toys:
---
Instigating lever, bloodied handmade and bloodied prime Gauss for SBQ
---
Haven't yet. Gear doesn't break down fast for me and aside from Ballistic fiber everythings been easy to gather, so I see no point in it. (gear is at 130% and have the perks that slow gear degredation so repairing only every few odd day. Unless getting into some bad situations.
---
If people want to waste their money on kits so they can just spend their day doing nothing but nuking and SBQ, their choice. But they are the people Bethesda are targetting, not the more casual folks.
---
Damn
---
Lol he disappeared so I don't know where he is.
---
If there were any good way of taking down players in 76, I'd do so. But as a guy that's been scammed out a pretty badass weapon before, I know it's just about impossible. Even if you have their gamertag.
---
Yea i had a contingency plan just for this
---
PVE, Free Aim, Rifleman, idk casual? I’m not exactly the most experienced player, if you couldn’t tell lol.
---
My friend who is obsessed with collecting clothing no matter what has all
---
No. Just, no.
---
You are blanketing over the actual issues that have happened with this game. The beta was actually early access, giving zero time for deva to fix problems before full release. Bugs aplenty, some still in the game since before launch haven’t been fixed. Server lag and sever crashing is still common. And some new updates meant to fix these things break others, or bring previous issues back. Push to talk was an update, not an automatic implimentation. There aren’t any private servers until now. We still have zero mod support despite being out a full year, and being promised such support. And that is just game-side.
---
Then there was the nylon bags bait-and-switch, the ‘no refund if you downloaded the game at all’ scandal, the Nuka-Rum bit, the broken promise of only cosmetics in the Atomic Shop (which is the only thing that gets consistent updates), the fact that the game would BRICK ENTIRE SYSTEMS upon start-up.
---
It is more than just ‘Angery Gamer REEE!’ Bethesda has earned the ire it has produced. The company is not a person, it has no feelings, it is here to make money. It made a shitty product. We, as the consumer, have every right to call it a shitty product. The irony is, I want to give Bethesda more of my money, but I refuse to because they don’t meet the level of satisfaction they themselves created with previous titles, and thus, deserve all the criticism they have hurled their way. Maybe if their product wasn’t is such a messy state, people wouldn’t complain, and they would meet those precious profits margins that every company wants.
---
Bethesda is rather incompetent, Atomic Shop only failing in cosmetics due to crappy items and I agree give me option to buy classic skins and my wallets open.
---
Wow.  Can you booby trap it and make griefers struggle to get ya on the top floor ? ;)
---
I personaly use a 3* furious hunting rifle with a .50 refined receiver,stabilized long barrel,true stock,stinging mag,long recon scope,compresser. I love it i 1 shot 3* gouls all the time with it. Plus use 1 chemelion armor peice to gain invisability.
---
Like I said. The market was always gonna be fucked in one way or another. I dont think some extra fusion cores on the market will matter
---
Well thank you for being polite. I can appreciates that about yous.
---
That would explain the delay of Wastelanders :D
---
I tried to solo my first one at level 25 lol although I did glitch up too high for it too attack me, I still managed half of the health before it healed itself and I was low on ammo so I left
---
Disco Elysium??
---
OK this is just inaccurate, or a lie.  You did not have 3 of the rarest items in the game.  Almost none dropped, like less than 5 of each on any one platform.  And you got 3 of them?  Right...
---
Google "how to install a mod"
---
I was in a group once with 3 players. We headed over to jacks house for a daily quest and then someone got the bright idea to take down a scorch beast while we’re here. We were absolutely swarmed with scorched and kept dying. We decided to head into a nearby cave so we wouldn’t get hit with the scorch beast blasts and would have a choke point for the scorched. We set up a firing line and defend against the scorched at the mouth of the cave. Suddenly one of us screams as a deathclaw grabs him from behind. We all turn around and then we’re fighting on two fronts. It didn’t end well.
---
We used up probably 30 stimpacks between all of us. And we never let that one guy live it down. “You think we should check out the fissure while we’re here?”
---
Yeah I’m on PS4
---
Ya I had pre-ordered it on the MS store but cancelled when it went onto game pass.
---
When did they announce this?
---
I lock what I want to keep. Everything else is for everyone :)
---
Ooh nice haul, well done! I got a QFFR +250 or such handmade from a horde tonight, then upon looking it's only a lvl25 :/ but still a nice alt weapon. Also a VSS RW pole hook for 1k to go in my pole hook collection!
---
Lets just hope the patch doesn't bombs...
---
I would hope that private servers and official servers would be separate? But I guess we'll find out when they come out.
---
One core last me two to three days of playing. I've never used a workshop at all. Most of the cores I've used since the game came out, came from line in the sand, two times I crafted a stack of them. I've never come close to running out. Full charge removes the cost from sprinting . That's where almost all the charge goes. The people that need the workshops , usually do so because they use Gatling lasers . I like the plasma better than the laser. Even if the ammo was easier to keep up with. The fire rate on them is awful.
---
My psn is defaultmode I might hit you up sometime
---
Release date has been pushed to Q1 2020.
---
According to linked post, "... we are delaying its release to Q1 next year."
---
The first time I pulled in late at night (Fallout time) and found the lvl5 robot on duty, I freaked out thinking they'd nerfed the vendor and his merchandise.  Everything seemed the same - same inventory and same number of caps.
---
I feel you.  Sometimes someone pisses you right off and dropping a nuke just seems right.
---
Yeah, its petty and senseless, but so is just about everything in online gaming.
---
This is something I wish they'd give us.  We're supposed to be rebuilding appalachia, and we have this ....well I can't call it amazing, but i'll say "useable" construction system....and yet NOTHING is ever being rebuilt.  Anywhere.  Ever.  We live like scavagers in old abandoned buildings full of holes and assorted debris.....and that's it really.  Even in FO3 and FO4 that's an issue, and those are supposed to be hundreds of years later.   And there's still massive piles of rubble everywhere?!  I don't believe it.  At least in New Vegas there were a lot of houses and other buildings that DIDN'T look 2/3 destroyed...and a small number that did but had other reasons there was never anyone living in them.  
---
I'd like to be able to get into a server, private or otherwise, and actually *rebuild appalachia* .  I don't care if I'd have to do it over and over again, or if events (nukes, wandering mutants, etc) kept going around breaking things.  It'd be nice to actually be able to rebuild stuff!
---
"Bethesda would make money by putting what I want in the shop"
---
Shoot, sorry, I got confused. I was thinking of the Clean Appalachia rewards.
---
Wouldn't stop me from trying. Lol
---
&gt;Atomic Shop
---
&gt;Failing
---
You have no source for this other than your own feefees
---
That's kind thanks but to be honest, I'm just after learning plans as a completionist. Also it's nice to be able to offer anyone any mod they require! I'd like to run a wasteland mod shop at some point
---
I'm not sure what the cause is but I occasionally suffer from the same problem.
---
Smoke grenade fix yet ? Or are we still screwed cause of the dupers?
---
Honestly I’m down with that, especially since that likely means we can get Halloween items tomorrow instead of having to wait til next week
---
A Bloodied Explosive Lever is the ultimate, 960dmg with full Nerd rage, Adrenaline etc, with a much faster fire rate than a hunting rifle. 
---
However a BE Handmade can have up to 670dmg with full Nerd/ adrenaline etc, but at a much higher fire rate.
---
That's a killer. I keep mine in my stash.
---
Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on too long.
---
I’ve recently made a list of all locations, and deleted the ones that I’ve already discovered, to truly find all places. I’m not near 250 (just hit 60!) and haven’t done half of the things you said, but man I almost have my whole map done
---
From what I can tell, you're looking for the shotgunner perks under strength, skeet shooter under perception, and tormentor (luck).  And of course bloody mess. For exploding, demo expert (intelligence) x 5.  I don't think grenadier helps, but I'd be happy to be corrected.
---
There's a number of quicker reloading and vats based perks; I don't know how effective these are.
---
It looks like the train wreck is starting to slow down a little...
---
Hopefully something good will come from it.
---
I'm okay with a solid 40 hours. That's still a fuck ton of time, and as long as it's a jam packed 40, I'd rather have that than a boring 100+. Just because a game is long doesn't mean it's good
---
YES PELEASE!!!
---
On the 10th of this month. It's called Mischief Night. It starts on the 29th and will last a week, similar to Fashnacht!
---
I actually agree with this. The way I see it, Bethesda probably already made as much money as they needed from this game, so if they really didn't care they could just never work on it again at this point. If I were a making a game I would improve it for the people that are hopeful towards the game rather than trying to please the crowd that will always find something to complain about no matter what.
---
\*Click  
---
Noice
---
$15? That's ridiculous. I'd pay a third of that, maybe
---
As much as I have enjoyed playing 76, outside of the brief Halloween event I think I'm going to take some time off from the game until nearer the release of Wastelanders or whenever some new content comes in. After the initial release of Nuclear Winter everything seems to have slowed development wise and I know full well if I keep logging in I'm going to check the Atom Shop out of habit and impulsively buy something. At some point I have to try and take a step back from all of that. 
---
This week has the release of The Outer Worlds, and through the Xbox Game Pass for PC I can try it out pretty cheaply. I don't want to shit on Bethesda here, I just have extremely little to do in game and theres only so many times I can go on legendary hunts at the same locations over and over again.
---
Doesn't fix the issue where the Zerkers effect isn't really strong enough....
---
Nice ! Makes sense too. Seems like fickel circle of events that control each other.
---
Good start. Are you going to be running around and shooting? Stealth sniping?
---
For run and gun, bloodied builds seem to be the best damage you can do short of sneak attacks. At 19% HP, bloodied builds do about 3.24x your damage. Sneak attacks can do 3.75x your damage. If you prefer sneak attacks for your damage, we would need to recommend a rifle with access to the silencer attachment.
---
They never do that, they always release patch notes while it's down.
---

---
Sorry always thought it was before...my bad
---
No delusions or rocks. If the sub is supposed to be a community that wants to play the game in its current and evolving state, share content, look forward to future updates, and generally enjoy the thing for what it is, then that’s great. I would never rain on that; however if the main content of the sub is primarily complaints with a garnish of Bethesda/76 bashing and everyone enjoys that particular aspect, then my point is valid. I’ll leave you to it. But don’t pretend to be one thing and then embrace the other.
---
Thanks!
---
I'd prefer to see an "Armored Hazmat Suit" honestly....I'm thinking of something like the Armored Vault Suit...its basically a version of the standard vault suit...but with armor pieces actually included on it.  You could make a Hazmat suit in the same style...an Armored Hazmat Suit.  Still can't have armor "Pieces" equipped, but far more useful than a standard hazmat suit.
---
If they did this you’d likely have to make a new character for said server.
---
I think OP is trying to get the trophy for being at ground zero when the nuke goes off.
---
There's usually plenty of other stuff to do while waiting for her to land. I like to check the safe, kill things that are pestering the heavy gunners, take drugs, eat. Once she lands I know I'll be busy, so I'm not too worried about it.
---
You're welcome! the more that join in, the funner it will be.
---
Fixing stuff has been delayed to Q2 2020 since Q1 is for content
---
Under challenges.
---
It wasn't difficult for me, it was ANNOYING. Ghouls were gangbanging me while I was doing the terminals. Quit halfway through.
---
Good to know.  Thx!
---
Instigating anything works great.
---
 I have an instigating plus 10% damage while aiming handmade that can hit for around 2k
---
I also have an Instigating + explosive pipe rifle that can hit for 4k (using rifleman + gunslinger perks)
---
 I also have and use:
---
TSE Handmade / 
---
AAE Handmade / 
---
VE Handmade / 
---
Zealots Prime Handmade  / 
---
TSE Lever Action  
---
 They all kill fast and have their own uses.
---
Its funny how people complain about pay to win and now they are begging for it
---
People that have given me stuff has been made aware that I am a returning player. Thanks though. :)
---
Best all round gun in the game is a handmade. The type of handmade depends on your build
---
Welcome aboard! Hope to see you out there, fellow SBQ farmer! I do the same whenever I can, and would be happy to have you along.
---
For me (on Xbox) this message pops-up if my menu is laggy. You'll notice the item image preview is rotating kind of choppy. I wait until it's rotating smoothly (1-3 seconds) and then the message doesn't pop. It's annoying, but less annoying than exiting and then opening the vendor again and scrolling down, down, down....
---
None of them say anything about vault tec themed rewards
---
No, I'm picturing a harried intern frantically googling "how to create hyper-v site:answers.microsoft.com"
---
I’ve never done any event before, are the servers the same size?
---
I’ll be looking for a nuke zone later this evening! Thanks!!
---
An overhaul of skins and mods would be nice. Especially for melee. Need more mods that change the look of the weapon.
---
Then you probably missed it. They’ve been there for like a month.
---
I have about 800 hours since BETA but if they allow to transfer between private and public i will move on to RDR2 and never look back.
---
On your compass, run to the radiation symbol.
---
Nuka-world music is lore breaking if one seem to be picky. Some neat interior in the wouldn't hurt anyone else but them people appreciate it and a few wood pieces in the junk box. Ty for watching bro!
---
Probably waiting to see to see what they can and can't properly fit into the update before they promise us something they can't deliver on time.  Update notes will probably be finished last minute.
---
There is vtu poster, trunk, and diploma
---
Depends on why and how you want to run the Silo.  
---
If you are running for content (to get the plot) or to get materials/resources, it's a bit of a long slog but you can end up with a lot of mundane (steel, lead, cloth, nuclear waste, etc) materials at the end.  
---
If you want to "speed run" the silo JUST for launch, then there's a particular way to do that, and some of us are willing to teach it. Doesn't take much practice, either.
---
Yeah, the scrip is resetting every 24 hours, but I spent a little under 1,000 scrip on the last day on 3\* armor, so I got about 30 pieces of armor and can only scrip 6 of those per day (24\*6 = 144). 
---
I'm scriping the heaviest ones first, so I should be able to move soon. 
---
As for renaming, I'm able to remove the custom names. It appears to be a fixed pool of renames, so I can rename more as I scrip more.
---
It seems genuinely a little weird it looks like there will be nothing of note added to a current Fallout game for the 23rd.
---
There's a static spawn for one inside the nukashine tattoo parlor. It's under the desk where the cash register and terminal is. Hard to see but it's down there in one of the slots of the desk.
---
hi, please reread the first sentence in my post :)
---
Thanks! All I see is a tent
---
I have one in my stash to,but i often switch between HLC,longshoremen and winter cloths.o and clean space suit.they all work well with urban scout mask and blue helmet
---
I doubt it most likely how it is for atoms
---
I want a week where all enemies are wendigos 😂
---
Haha no problem. I was at work still and kind of panicked I missed it.
---
There is four people in the support team? Might be 3 too many there
---
I remember in South Park they had a device that lets you smell a game where people fart
---
Ikr? It's crazy.
---
I also run silos like it’s no one‘s business. Keep it up.
---
The latter would make zero sense lol. Similarly can you imagine 10 ¥
---
I suppose tomorrow we will have an unforgettable event. I suggest you to store some Cola caps, because even will literally blow your mind away (badumts).
---
FWIW, the two most effective ballistics I have are AA LMG and Resolute Veteran gatling.   
---
 May change, but it's going to be a few days before I can test out the untracite gatling.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I’m sure that the game is gonna be great, obsidian hasn’t failed us yet. Just saying I’m surprising they didn’t up the ante, although in fairness half the time in New Vegas was walking from location to location, so there might be as much content, just more condensed maps
---
The table with the stats has been linked in [this other thread](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dlkk8l/is_legendary_heavy_combat_armor_a_thing/), or [here](https://i.redd.it/sihoyun3o1921.jpg) is a direct link that also shows the visible differences between the armor types.
---
Yeah, just usually everyone on it will be doing the event while it's going on. Gives a good sense of community, seeing everyone working together.
---
I appreciate that. I still want to do the content part, but I still take opportunities to join any nuke zone battles when I can to farm flux and high-end plans. Probably gonna wait to do a solo for content with my son and daughter-in-law. But many thanks for being willing to teach the speed run!!
---
Fair enough, at what level did the lifestyle choose you?
---
Why would paying the equivalent amount make zero sense? Why should we pay more for the same service simply for being foreign?
---
At most they will copy ark on how you setup a server. But the other end of it is they mey get rid of NW to make way for private servers.
---
I said the latter does NOT make sense... where you said just swap the currency symbol. That does not make sense.
---
I don’t think the current economy needs to stay how it is. There will still be an economy with private server advantages, it’ll just be different. Nothing wrong with that.
---
Sweet!  Man, its been a long time but I remember those days when those things were scary bastards.  I remember unloading everything I had and finally killing my first.  Its a hell of an achievement.  Fast forward, they become easier and easier to kill.  Fast forward, they drop crap loot.  Fast forward, they are such a damn nuisance.  Fast forward, they are easy to kill.  Can we get a damn random plan or 1\* legendary at least.  Sorry, broken record there.  OK, I'll admit sometimes when all of sudden you have 3 level 80 SBs come at you, that can get a little fun.  Uses a little more ammo, a stimpack or two, but still, too much for too little.  Ramble, ramble, ramble....
---
It is patch day, I was just hoping they'd sneak something in or at least give it a nod lol
---
LOL about 114. I had a junkies grognak axe with faster swing speed dropped into my lap and the rest was history.
---
Instead of doing the smart thing to make money like adding skins everyone would surely drop money on they instead would rather add more utility items to the atomic shop and sell us servers. I would buy a fallout 3 dcg skin so fast.
---
You dont say if you are in PA - if you have excavator, equip it.  That should let you carry between 1500-1700# (depends if you have calibrated shocks) an still sprint.  Other varieties of PA will limit you to about 1450#.  It'll burn AP rather quickly, but at least you'll be able to do a bit of adventuring between Berkeley and the next train station you decide to visit..
---
My overweight character did all 3\* armor, but that's on a commando build character, so low strength.
---
My bloodied melee/heavy gun character did 3\* ranged and hasn't had an issue.
---
What's in my stash? A nearly full set of all magazines. Too many alternate guns that I'm not yet willing to part with, such as a FFFR plasma rifle, a FFFR ultricite laser, a IFFR Gauss, AAFFR submachine gun, and a beautiful IE Lever. Lots of stable flux. I'm sure there's something I can cut down on, but I'll probably just scrip once-a-day and play the bloodied build until my commando can move again.
---
I'm also nearly at max caps, so I really don't need to waddle to Harpers Ferry.
---
You just won the internet
---
Please sign in with your Microsoft ID to continue.
---
You only have two hands... how can you play two at the same time? Regardless how you setup the second instance you can only control one at a time.
---
The same way they sell the game. Equal to the exchange rate. It's not even a question.
---
I would imagine its because tomorrow is the 23rd October 2077 er...2019 and may  have some particular significance from in game lore...
---
damn thats kinda funny, if you are on Xbox I can come drop a excavator PA for you and then you can log out and in and have 200 extra carry.
---
My last two toons have been bloodied (melee and commando) and I've acquired a good amount of Junkies weaponry during that time. The kicker was Mrs Mumbles coming up with a J/E Handmade and a J/E/RW Combat Rifle, so it's time to put them to use.
---
I'll be starting a new toon over the coming week and will plan to get addicted ASAP after reaching level 10 as I have both melee and ranged Junkies weapons at that level. Also have a stash of low level Vanguards that should do the trick for armor.
---
I'm looking forward to not having to play chicken with my health bar all the time and being able to consume everything and anything as the role would dictate. Should be fun!
---
"Bethesda would make money by putting fan favorite skins in the shop from earlier games" there i fixed your comment
---
Anyone who plays the fallout series takes joy in the unexpected—be it an unforeseen treasure or pitfall.  You just added on to what makes this game great in the first place.
---
You’re likely going to be disappointed.  There’s a bug with explosive shotguns that causes mobs to look like they heal (in essence you overdamage and the game resets it back to normal damage).  However you look at it, shotguns aren’t what they used to be.
---
Lol. Next time, read through _all_ the conversations on a topic that you're critiquing, because your comprehension needs work.
---
Last I checked, I was not the one who had made the OCD comment (yeah, sure, you can go back and verify). My comment had been directed towards the guy who had responded to the OCD post, with his virtue-signalling pc bullshit response, and _that_ is what I found exhausting. This guy is trying to come off like some kind of  social justice warrior, only for us to find out later that he's just a hypocrite (maybe you missed that part of the conversations, too). So yeah...he's masquerading as a righteous person in a public forum, but the truth is that he doesn't actually give a shit, and he admits as much in his follow-up post. Malicious? Sure was, because he doesn't practice what he preaches. He was just hoping for a few "feel good" likes from the other SJW's.
---
No one had addressed me, at that time I had made my own OP. So, for you to now claim that I was exhausted because that SJW said that I should think of other people, is a ridiculous notion.
---
Nice!
---
If you REALLY want to max damage around a shotgun you want these perks ([ShottyStuff](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=c313583&amp;d=sd2su2so2sp2pc2ib4cu2as2a04lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=f&amp;nw=&amp;n=)). That build will probably not be best for real play though, but it gives you an idea of what works for increasing explosive shotgun damage. 
---
This is a build I use for an unarmed/shotty that's pretty fun ([IronShotty](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=f4546e8&amp;d=s92ss1sg1se1c72a72am2ar1a00a30ao0lu2lt2l71i44ej4p00sd0so0su2sp0pc2as2i30&amp;w=ic2l11sf2aj2pa0p80p90c52cr0iq2ir2if2ek1eh2pe2eu0eo2p10p53ed0el0ia0i50ij2lm2lv1ag2at1s50sb2sa2s61si0sj0au2sv3s01pj0ps0ce0cm0cu0ib2a12a80s72la2lb0&amp;m=1c249fe8gha5&amp;nw=&amp;n=IronShotty)).
---
&gt;for all intents and purposes
---
Glad you agree with me.
---
How much would you say one of those sells for?
---
Yea I dont get it either you’re not hosting a lan world or off your computer its all hosted on their end that stuff isnt free
---
If you're on PS4 I'll keep and eye out for ya!
---
My previous toons did not make much use of chems so I've been selling them cheap out of my vending machines. I'm looking forward to being able to make use of them as part of my character build and role play it up!
---
Because thats how capitalism works.  
---
You want American prices on American goods, immigrate.
---
Well as I explained this is common practice for US companies when they set pricing in Europe &amp; the UK. They simply change the dollar symbol to a pound or euro symbol &amp; keep the numerical amount the same. As pounds &amp; euros are not exactly equivalent in value we end up paying much more for the same product or service than Americans do.
---
Many newspaper articles have been written on the subject. The companies claim it is because sales tax isn't included in US pricing unlike here. While that is true the markup is so big we massively over pay on some things.
---
I’m more of the run and gun type. This has been very helpful.
---
Rampant speculation like this usually comes with a backlash.  People get their expectations up *way* too high or other people read speculation and take it as the gospel truth; when it doesn't live up to the hype built up in the own minds, they start raging about how it's trash and how bitterly disappointed they are.
---
Me?  I'll just wait and see how this all plays out, thank you.
---
It can be used by greafers to use as a aoe dammage that still gets thru passive players. Same with thoes asses who blowup cars as a noob passes.
---
Ok. See ya online
---
Exactly. 😁
---
Get good at Nuclear Winter!
---
Deliciously evil
---
Only 20 a day? You're doing something wrong ...there are 50 atoms available in the dailies alone. Also the weeklies give out a bunch. There are also the combat, world character and other challenges that give out upwards of 80 atoms per completion, many of which I get by just playing the game, like the 80 atoms I got for "killing enemies with a ranged weapon" while doing scorched earth yesterday.
---
I’d be fine with people losing it over server cost if the cost was actually announced!  I mean everyone is going to have a line for what is too much money, that’s expected.  There are some that will expect free and honestly not be trolling, that’s expected too.  It’s the wild imagination that gets me.
---
Maybe it’s a glass half full thing.  I’m optimistic that this could be done in a way that really helps the game out longevity wise.  A lot of customization to make the game harder could be a fun thing.  However seeing as how this is Bethesda I’ve set my hopes way low.
---
International players will probably pay more.
---
Thats how trade works.
---
You want our prices, immigrate.
---
Thank you very much
---
Welcome to the internet.
---
Random Number Generator, rtfm
---
Oh Fallout has mods on PS4 too, no worries
---
or, here's an idea: let *me* host them. there, problem solved.
---
I agree, I see less posts with people upset about none free servers. I see more posts about people upset no details have been announced.
---
I've played this game way too much...and I've set a number of goals for myself (build fun camps, buy all the serum recipes, get a good pet, get all the plans, get all the badges, complete challenges, try different builds), but what keeps me coming back aren't these goals I set for myself, but just my enjoyment at being in the world of this game. I still love doing some of the quests, and can do them over and over again, like the Messenger, Death From Above, Irrational Fear. I still find new stuff when I explore (found a re-enactor on the path north of the ammo factory!), I like hopping into other people's camps and chatting (amazing how few folks are doing this), and I like helping out fresh, or reasonably fresh out of the vault. 
---
All that being said, if you haven't tried a no power armor, unarmed melee build, give it a try, it's a blast.
---
There are more than daily and weekly challenges,  you need to look at the other entries.  A lot of those give out 80 atoms 0er completion. You're assertion of "if they don't bug out" is a red herring too. Yeah, a few over the year have had an issue but the majority work just fine
---
Sneak attack head shots with 1* instigating hunting rifle, without all the crit perks (I think I put 1 in covert operative), I was typically getting 1200 damage head shots on super mutants.  Way more than enough.  More if you beef up covert ops and/or use Mister Sandman.
---
In last week's ITV they wrote more info 'in coming days'. If by that they meant next week with the patch, they should have written next week with the patch. :-p
---
It builds suspicion when they're not direct and honest, and honestly after the Wastelanders delay last week I'm not sure why they want people to dwell on negative thoughts for 7 days.
---
Yeah I heard it's not a true-open world. Think more like Borderlands with loading screens in between sections basically. Either way, I'll be playing the shit out of that all weekend, so I can't freakin' wait
---
Excuse me, PLEASE fix the damn trading glitch, it has been going on to damn long, thank you.
---
Not w/o getting a more powerful PS4.
---
Another settlement needs you to Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
You know there are more than 3 currencies right? My guess is there will be regional pricing. It won’t be based on fx rate nor will they just drop all currency symbols as some currencies are like 200:1 lol. Yes Uk may get screwed
---
Act its Cry Me A River Build A Bridge Then Do Everyone A Favor And Jump Off.
---
yea, right before a server crash.controls stop ressponding, screen freeze, some message about controller no repsonding, then a disconnect message...
---
Or, of you didnt get disconnected, I'd bet high latency/traffic spikes somewhere between your system and the server.
---
Does no dmg to other players. Only dmg being able to be done is from radiation from nuke mines
---
I loved it once I got to the point where I no longer feared them.
---
Mine do 3 to 4k in headshots with covert, nerd rage
---
You know that expecting me to write every currency is ridiculous right?
---
&gt;I've finished all my challenges. 
---
That statement alone shows that you don't understand the game mechanics.  The challenges don't end in the other categories,  they just progress to a higher number of X required to complete.
---
I’m going to get through the Halloween event and burn up my caps and then it’s outer worlds I come 
---
Maybe I should sell my weapons and armor on EBay lol 
---
I’m probably sitting on a small fortune
---
It makes sense that it costs money if they are hosting it, but I was hoping private servers would work similar to Minecraft/ARK/Conan Exiles/other survival games where you can just run it on your own machine and do whatever you want with it (custom game rules, mods, etc.).  They really should have called them 'solo' servers instead of private.  
---
Why would I pay extra for a solo server when people hardly interact anyways?  People claim that those who wanted FO76 to be a single player game will pay for private servers but I can't imagine they'll want to pay an extra (and I assume recurring) fee just for that.  I'm not really sure who this feature is meant for.
---
Not much else to do but throw guesses out there, since they wont tell us anything until the goddamn patch comes out apparently.
---
Rad damage can still kill specialy thoes who run blooded.
---
In scenarios like this one common sense wants that the character wouldn't be allowed back on regular servers so it's their business what they do on their online single player mode, to be honest.
---
They will most likely use the same tecnique as when modding Fallout 4, the character you bring over to a private server gets duplicated and they become two different characters, and you can use either one whenever you want, but each in its separate environment.
---
I would love to see a free cage or pen added and a bunch of skins but we all know they would just make it exclusive to the atom shop
---
Sure, except that a peer to peer connection tethers everyone to the host meaning that fast travel would be impossible, loading doors would be impossible, and auto respawn anywhere other than on the hist would be impossoble. It's not practical and would require more work than it's worth in Bethesdas part to make it work.
---
I approve of this message.
---
&gt;You will eventually run out challenges. Many players have. Many of the challenges are bugged and don't give rewards.
---
No, they dont run out, go take another look at the entries other than daily and weekly. 
---
Kindly list the "bugged out" challenges,  I know of only 1 currently which isn't giving credit for SBQ kill.
---
Did they lower game pass price cause i swear it used to be more
---
I hate the inventory management part of some games.  Yeah, it may be part of strategy... but it really takes away from in game experience.  For me at least.
---
Wow ok haha. Thank you so much but I'll keep looking and hunting. 10k is a little high for me. You're awesome though for trying!!
---
😂 You want some fries to go with that salt?
---
Before you invest Time and other resources, remember shotguns suffer from bouncimg damage which makes enemies heal after each shot. 
---
The higher your damage, the worse they work. Not fun at all.
---
It's part of the main quest. Once you progress to the end of the Enclave portion of the questline, you're instructed on how to launch nukes and given the corresponding quest.
---
I think it's also worth considering that making 'more' content for 76 isn't really going to help matters until they can have more in-depth story telling through dialogue and quests. If Bethesda wanted to, they could do a lot of smaller content updates and leave it at that, but they can't do that *and* work on creating systems they need for stuff like Wastelanders
---
In terms of money's worth, there's always the dollar to hour ratio, and I would guess OP passed the 1:1 ratio there twenty levels ago if not more.
---
if modders can do it I'm sure Bethesda could. right?
---
besides, it's not like I was planning on letting anyone in. I want to play by myself, alone. lots of other players were waiting for this specifically, too. so they could mod the game and not be "tethered" to Bethesda's services, which aren't much better.
---
I wonder if there is some kind of overzealous anti-cheat functionality that prevents enemies from taking damage too quickly.  This bug seems to affect weapons that deal damage quickly or hits multiple times.
---
Well tarriffs do play a role and who is or aint ur allies. What costs us 10.00 costs other countries like iran 100.00
---
Being bored Is being bored. Plus, some flora. Maybe a couple of ghouls.
---
I am at the part of the quest where I launch the nuke but can't get in to the silo there is a mysterious button in a toilet press it and nothing happens
---
&gt; I’ve set my hopes way low.
---
Lower them more :P
---
I don't think you'll get anything except restricting who can join.  Literally nothing else.  I wouldn't be surprised if they messed that up either, though I think that's simple enough to get correct.
---
I can't imagine (at launch, not down the road) that you'll have access to any of the other server settings.  No camp budget, no stash space, no drop/mob/level changes at all.  Vanilla game, nothing else.  And honestly, it has to be that way if you want to be able to move your characters around to different servers.
---
Also, you won't be able to move your characters around to different servers :P
---
I'm *hoping* that I'm wrong about all of that, I can see a huge draw in completely customized servers, I just don't think they've put enough time into it to be at that point already.  And I'm not really sure if it will ever be like that at all.
---
I could see like $5-10 bucks a month.
---
Player: "Bethesda, I'm bored. What plaything can you offer me today?"
---
Bethesda: "An obscure furniture item in the Atomic Shop system. The locals refer to it as...the Mr. Pebbles Lamp."
---
Player: "How colorful it looks." \[Activates the item, looks at the price, laughs hysterically\]
---
Bethesda: "Most effective, your majesty! Will you purchase this...lamp?"
---
Player: "Not now. I like to pay for a real lamp, before I go right the hell out of my mind and buy make believe lamps." \[laughs sanely\]
---
What weapon are you thinking of using?
---
If you use the hand scanner to enter the silo and it’s red, then try another silo, or a different server. Good luck launching your bike!
---
Bloodied Combat Rifle. It’s a 1* but I don’t have anything else.
---
Honestly I always expected it to be a Pay to Use situation, it's how they make their fucking money lol. It's literally a Minecraft Realms service.
---
I would like if there was a free alternative for custom characters and all that forces you to use your own internet and/or host but that's wishful thinking. 
---
My biggest wish out of the bunch though is that if I'm renting a server and not modding it, I better be able to use my own official characters in it. I'm not buying a server to be denied.
---
yes!
---
Fries are awesome
---
Same here. ive gone through many daily routines by now. the thought of having to wait 3 or 4 more months for NPC's seems so long. for now im looking forward to the next event but thats about all. Outer worlds will take a bunch of players away im sure. including me.
---
joke already used, be original dude..
---
It's especially bad when using a jetpack since you lose all your AP instantly and can remove 20% from a fusion cote
---
Stop fast travelling and start walking.  I'd venture there are lots of places you haven't found/been yet.
---
Enjoy the graphics.
---
collect all the bobbleheads and magazines.
---
Find the bears in compromising positions.
---
Find the alien getting ready to eat a deathclaw egg.
---
Discovered the skeleton lauchers at the edge of the world?
---
You almost get it. People want the option to run their own server.
---
That's because you're not supposed to be in the toilet. Literally.
---
You're at the endpoint of the evacuation route.
---
You need to actually go into one of the three silos via the elevator, then do the whole thing leading up to launching the nuke.
---
The toilet is the where you exit the silo, not enter it.
---
If you’re asking if an AAE Combat Shotgun is good, then yes.  That would be one of the best shotguns in the game.  The bad news is that shotguns are overall not great.
---
Lol, of course you will pay more
---
Just be thankful you don’t live in Australia mate
---
Those are god tier weapons. Normally traded if I’m not mistaken as they would be max caps or way more depending on the market.
---
I can't find a hand scanner
---
Thanks very much... yea the minigun would be cool. I think id swap out the explosive for rapid... you’d need to farm ammo every day to have 20 minutes of fun..
---
Just remember to pass the generosity on.
---
Wow, great picture!! I love the blue and the contrast of the shadow on his body!! 👍👍👍
---
I got a Tenderizer there right after or at the end of the last Meat Week, right while I was considering spending 2 to 4 grand on one. I almost pooped my jumpsuit.
---
So you’ve completed the Enclave quest, been made a general, and are ready to nuke?
---
If so, you go to one of the three silos, enter the elevator, use your handprint inside the elevator.
---
&gt;But you can't get 100% Fusion Cores outside of workshops, or very rare rewards from Brotherhood events.
---
I regularly make cores at &gt; 110% at my work bench in my camp. It just takes flux which I farm daily.
---
It'd be really neat if they released a patch that fixed things.

Don't be afraid to run higher health when YOU KNOW you are going into ghouls. Your DPS output should still be more than enough to one hit them. I run my bloodied characters at 39% (there's a ui mod that helps with this) most of the time but I'm not afraid to go higher or lower depending on the situation.
---
The beauty of bloodied is you can run full health without losing anything over a base build with the same weapon.
---
Gotya the waypoint sent me to the toilet lol

Hit up this piece of human filth, he's got them all (on pc).

Obvious duper, exploiter, and scumbag.  That's the only way you get those masks.  Be one, or buy from one.
---
I always do :) it's actually one of my favourite things about this community!  Back in beta even, people would leave unwanted goods in the overseers camp. Now we are long in the game, we leave free bags at our camps :)
---
Nope not evil seen a simular build last yr that did the same lobbing players off a cliff.was funny.
---
That'll be $2.99 per hair style
---
There are gonna be so many 'trap camp' videos now.
---
Idk about you guys, but it's still 22nd on my calendar, tho  its like 10 pm
---
If you're going to stick purely with bloodied melee, can get some unyielding gear and ditch the power armour then this build would be ideal for you
---

---
I have yet to get bored of the game and i think it has to do with me alternating between my characters. From my experience people went out of there way to help my lower level characters which was nice.
---
Nah sun was one of the uncommons.  The atx shop had the moon with the rocket in the eye, and the old man summer mask.  Old man winter, sun, goblin, skull, jester.  Those are the unobtainables
---
People don't want Bethesda hosted servers for free, they want a server tool so they can host it themselves. You know, how private servers worked ten years ago or so.
---
This is what I used to learn the basics, courtesy of [captainoob. ](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=6k_iq2f2UQw) I tweaked it myself since I don’t use energy ammo.
---
Since this game is sold all over the world I wonder how many millions of dollars is still being made off of it not counting micros?!?! Sold as a game you’ll never get tired of yet here we are. My point is if the poor company and developers are so hurt by cashing those nice checks then why aren’t we seeing more out of it. Simple business rule number 1 is supply and demand. Bethesda has supplied the base game plus but the plus is very small. The selling point to me wasn’t just the fact it was FO but that it would continue to grow. The growth is happing but a snails pace. So downvote me but save your pity for Bethesda and the millions upon millions of dollars in profits their making!
---
junkies, crit damage, vats cost, ffr, vats chance, fixer
---
They weren't working together, each was brought in to replace the previous dude
---
I’m 230something and feel the same way. I picked up red dead 2 cheap and have gamepass so I’m fine taking a break for while. Even during other periods of content drought I would just jam events like crazy but they’ve screwed that all up.
---
thanks bro!
---
I'm camped across the bridge from the Overseers camp and I often dump unwanted items there.  If you're on PC stop by and say hi.
---
I would love a Paciencia skin for my hunting rifle
---
Yeah, lets hope they are so dumb and keep the amount constant and just switch out the denomination! \*firing up VPN\*
---
Maybe I am making a mistake with sun, but I am sure about having old Man winter (old blue guy), jester (looks like half mask), soldier, the red one (that looks like old Man winter). I can easily imagine people scrapping or selling to vendors like I did. 
---
Who knew they were treasures back then? How many people play without checking Reddit for info like that? The answer Is: most people. 
---
Before I started reading about it, I scripped and sold to vendors uncountable bloodied, junkie's and unyielding ítems. I play full health and no addictions, so, they were junk.
---
 I lost Many things by deleting characters, like, I deleted the only character who received plans for the Fixer, because I thought it was common reward. I also sold to a vendor that scout camo mask people seem to die for.
---
Is the value -1 caps? You have to pay someone to take it.
---
What's a "nukashine transport"?
---
Cry me a river when the servers can only hold 6 people and cost $15.99... But in all seriousness I'm open to paying for a private server, just needs to be worth the cost. Its exciting to think about all the communities that could emerge with private servers done right
---
Yeah, I didn't take into account low health (and probably a few other things).  I got it to the point where most things I fought just dropped dead, and stopped trying to improve.
---
Hell, I'm full time commando now, and most things die in one hit anyway, and I still run lots of weight reduction and stuff that I could improve, but everything dies plenty fast enough as is (my handmade has instigating, and even that doesn't have optimal effects on it)
---
It's almost like the community is made of many different people that think differently on different subjects...
---
*ALMOST.*
---
Seriously, you are renting the server what do they expect would happen
---
Ohhh okay that makes so much more sense 🙏 thank you
---
I'd advise you get some unyielding armour, you need the commando perks and tank killer perk are a must.
---
You need several perks in the agility tree to for sneak damage and dodgy. The luck tree is important as well for bloodied builds including the serendipity perk.
---
Glad to help
---
Sure, for PVE is the best
---
I am not expecting that. I am asking you think beyond those 3 currencies lol. I am saying why it doesn’t make sense. If you are asking specifically about GBP, fine, say that. 
---
$1 equals 7 Yuan for example. If they charge 10USD in USA and 10Yuan in China they would be getting a ridiculous deal. Paying the equivalent of just over $1 lol
---
You actually looking for someone on here to be able to provide you with an accurate answer to this?
---
They can all go to private servers.. witch will make adventure servers free solo player servers.
---
I have 66 of them but I am looking for ultracite emergency protocol plan.
---
Whoops. But how to buyers know where it’s from?
---
As a fellow bloodied build, i have a bit of advice I have found works for me.
---
I used to exclusively use explosive heavies (TSE Gat Plas, BE mini, AAEmini, FEmini) and since I have gone the bloodied route, I have taken another look at efficiency and what actually works. 
---
Bloodied doesnt need explosive perks.  Ditch Demo Expert, you need the perk points elsewhere (nerd rage, stabilized if you use heavies, agility perks if you sneak/vats, luck stuff).
---
Most bloodied builds are glass cannons, we arnt meant to be tanky.  If you want tanky, go Vampires or Junkies.
---
I stay away from explosive guns because the blowback can and will deal damage to you.  This is the main reason I stay away from it.   I now use a rifleman build with sneaky perks and +10 aiming instead of explosive.  I have far to little life to worry about the blowback if something gets too close.
---
I have found that Barbarian and Serendipity will keep me alive well enough without the rest of the defensive stuff.   I rarely slot evasive or dodgy (unless im trying to solo something really stupid like 94), as the +dmg and sneak stuff is way more valuable.  Though i drop Serendipity when I hit the queen, because other people are tanking and I want the extra 15%dmg for that fight from bloody mess.
---
Full unyeliding is my advice for armor set.  You can mix in Bolstering for some of the peices, but I wouldnt use anything else as the stat increases from unyeilding are hard to pass up.
---
These are personal preferences and not set in stone as a must do for bloodied.   
---
Us bloodied users all typically use a tad different setup based on playstyle.  Try out different perk set ups to find out what works the best for you without sacrificing too much damage.
---
I have no issue with that just dont throw tantrum and try to says its this when its clearly not that
---
Not sure, I signed up for the first time a couple days ago.
---
Which one is todd?
---
Maybe play a different game?
---
I've  had the issue as well, both with melee, and the pistol I carry as backup.
---
The next hundred levels or so will basically just be vending, camp building, event farming, and Reddit trading to get god tier gear. For a while I was just sitting on Xbox looking for group refreshing and joining any queen fight, encryptid, or project paradise post that came up. Raids were supposed to be something for endgame players to add to that rotation of activities and just didn’t hit the mark
---
Then why don't you use frog legs and they can only have two jumps before a cooldown
---
Weightless armour's DR shouldn't be counted for the berserkers effect. It'd mean lots of Chameleon berserkers, but at least the legendary would be useable.
---
I doubt anyone wants this kind of logical thinking right now. Even if you're 110% correct.
---
All three on queen and Xbox
---
absolutely amazing. i wanna see that in game
---
Dont people come and contest it to  mess with you?
---
Exactly....meaning you ran out of scrip as you bought more items at a reduced price. If they gave 300 then we could have scrip the extra we had from the discount.
---
They’re rumored to cost 15, and the host has to start it up for others to play.  Minecraft sells theirs for 10 and anyone on the list can join at any time.  That’s what people are upset about.
---
I don't want to use them because I don't want to reroll my character just so they're accessible to me. 
---
What's the cool down? I was not aware of this
---
So heavy gunner is a better option for PVP?
---
Wouldn't the off game game item selling be so divorced and separate from Bethesda's revenue streams to be of no interest to them, if it started impacting them it would be stopped in it's tracks. They must be on track for sales so they aren't bothered by any cheating.
---
I login just for an hour today, lvl 180, boring
---
It is not common because something broke bottlecap mines for a lot of players a few patches back
---
Scorch beast fighting is very fun. Killed three of those with a shotgun and a stick at the same time. Death to those damed bats!
---
LOL for how much is the stuff selling for? just curious
---
The game world is already downloaded.  An example like I commented previously, Minecraft allows this on player hosted games.
---
Q2
---
March.
---
Send in a ticket to Bethesda, provide usefull info, pics, vids. 
---
Trying to call out mods/devs on reddit is a waste of their time. 
---
Going through proper channels is most likely bgs protocol so send in your ticket rather than trying to score internet points over your outrage.
---
Btw i am also annoyed with dupers too.
---
It does suck for sure, pistol also though, interesting.
---
I don't want a tank build, just want to die a little bit less which is why I'm asking experienced bloodied users for their advice and tips :)
---
I've not got the explosive perk yet but it is something I was going to pick up.
---
The sneak perk over dodgy is quite a good idea, I'll keep that in mind!
---
Thanks.
---
I'm level 305 and I've never done the bike launch quest. 🤔
---
How about you just put the game down?
---
Woah y’all, the xenophobia on this thread is scary. Take a chill pill everyone.
---
ESO player would disagree with you.
---
The problem with duping is they only have one of two options to figure out how its being done
---
* Hire somebody full time to sit and hack the game
---
* Get one of the dupers to disclose their method
---
There was recently some source code leaked for a duping method and I took some time to look over the C variant that was published. Like every other cheat I have ever seen code for, it was far from super advanced but you could tell somebody sat and spent a lot of time looking at hexadecimal numbers while doing some trial and error. A program had to be made to manipulate specific memory values on a running client and there was no check server side to invalidate the behavior. I'm not willing to go into any more detail than that. 
---
It is unrealistic to think that specific program that exploited that specific thing is the only method used by dupers selling stuff on ebay. It's also unrealistic to think it would have ever been spotlighted without somebody obtaining and publishing the source.
---
We the players shouldn't have to be their Anti-Cheat.
---
This happens in VATS sometimes for me. I figure outside of VATS I may just be aiming poorly or going to fast. Working on that timing is critical, but if it doesn’t swing when you press the button, it’s the game.
---
I'm assuming it's using  the nukashines' black out status effect to traverse large portions of the map.
---
Shotguns suck, they don't do 1400 damage since the nerf....you are going to be disappointed.
---
The update is tomorrow?  Is that why there was no atomic store update on the website today?
---
I used to use dodgy until I slotted Sneak/Escape artist.
---
Not being seen = not getting hit.
---
Not getting hit is far better than 30% less dmg only when you have AP that you are using for vats anyway =)
---
I cant count the number of times my ass was saved by escape artist.
---
Lever action, handmade and fixer. I have a bloodied lever and handmade. Lever does 397 with 2* of each perk card. Handmade does 230ish at 30% health and back up bloodied guass rifle for scorchbeasts only as it can kill them in the air in 5 shots.
---
Maybe people with dissenting or more nuanced opinions are waiting for the initial rage to die out to not get attacked or downvoted to hell.
---
Me next! Xb?
---
get the Chemist perk in Intelligence and the Super Duper perk (2 ranks) in Luck, then use your Purified Water to make 1x purified water into 4x diluted stimpacks or radaway (and often doubled with Super Duper). That makes significantly more profit per water than just selling the water!
---
Event time!
---
Apparently if you die mid battle you lose any progress even if you do more damage to her. Which I find to be a crock of shit tbh.
---
Disagree. My bloodied melee character has no special defenses and survives just fine. You stay behind her or go stealth and hit her in the head. I rarely take queen damage. Also,  if you stagger her by shooting her in the air the animation restarts and she won't land. It's a giant waste of ammo.
---
my bad.  
---
my idiot brain read unarmored as unarmed...
---
Other than possible technical issues, that would probably not be compatible with the intended business model of the game that relies on revenue from the atom shop. With local hosting, the game could effectively become offline, or the player could even unlock all the microtransaction items (including yet to be released ones) for free.
---
Frog legs never bothered me. i never got it and honestly couldn't care less.
---
Except the engine being old doesn't explain AI not being as strong as it was in a previous game using the same engine. So, no, it's not the exact truth.
---
thx. i realised my mistake.  
---
I read it as unarmed.... smh...
---
Congratulations! You'll be fighting three at once and whining because they won't die faster while doing no damage to you in no time.
---
Q2 - 1day
---
Long shot, and I know it'd never happen. Jan 1st, 2020. Would make for an amazing New Years day gift.
---
But, if I'm being honest here. We're probably looking at mid to late March on a release date. And in all honesty, I'm happy to see thier taking time to get it just right and want to do justice for it.
---
I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding of the topic entirely.  People want private servers.  Dedicated servers.  Full mods on separate databases.
---
The vast majority don't want to pay for private instances that offer you none of the advantages of hosting your own server.  They serve virtually no purpose, so why would anyone pay for one?
---
After two jumps u have too wait until u can super jump
---
You stand behind her and hit her in the head? Is this a vats glitch?? And also, do you use radshield? Do you not take any rads? (I take insane Rads when meleeing) what exactly are you disagreeing with? Just the fact she will one hit you if she decides to?
---
Being a live service game doesn't mean someone can't get bored of a game or run out of things to do. Given OP would have easy surpassed a couple hundred hours of play time then of course content is going to feel lacking for him.
---
No game has infinite amount of playability in it.
---
I hit 714 with a bloodied lever action with adrenaline on....over 800 with a couple chems...great ranged and VATS weapon
---
I agree, people are really friendly! Most higher levelled people I've encountered have dropped stuff on the ground for me and been generally friendly!
---
after that buy a serum recipe.  Easy to sell, not too bad to create, take up little space, not really time dependent.  
---
I only use my water for crafting, or visitors to my camp can take what they want.
---
Alas not, I'm on Xbox. I have my camp just north of arktos, so I get a lot of lower level guys visiting which is cool
---
Nice, do you have a pic or a video?
---
I was like lv 11 and i came across scorch beasts, it was a nightmare because i had a lot of junk i wanted to keep and they kept one shotting me because they were around lv 50.
---
 I would love if enemies lv gets toned down if another high lv player goes away from that spot with enemies - lets say a lv 40 walked through some broken homes and there are ghouls all over the area, those ghouls are going to be around the lv 40 mark but if someone else who is lower than lv 40 came across those ghouls will still be the same lv and make it almost impossible for them to cross
---
Seriously - First thing I'd be doing it cleaning up the rubble and making it look somewhat nice.. well other than running from the scorched, ferals, super mutants, and other radiated creatures
---
Stonks
---
How many levels higher are ideal? I recently went to Pioneer Scout Camp at level 11, and the enemies were generally level 18-20. I was still able to kill them pretty easily, being able to one shot them from stealth etc.
---
Other issue worth mentioning in case people don't know, if you have the junk rat perk and access your storage, it will show the weight **after** the junk rat perk applies but that won't be the real weight of the items.
---
Time to save up atoms lol
---
Oh I see, you're supposed to go to the NUKE SILO not the BIKE SALE, that may be your issue
---
only if i can solo it
---
I hope its not 2020! But I guess anything is possible so time will tell.
---
If you mean griefers as in claimers, there is a certain height limit of the "claim zone", which seems to be lower than the upper limit of the "build zone". I don't have it mapped very thourougly, as every workshop is different.
---
What kind of idiot would put 100's of hours into a game they weren't enjoying?
---
as far as i know there is no difference between the 2... mine jsut held good memories that is the only reason i was saving them
---
2077
---
Well I wanted both those things.
---
Drop Luck of the draw for Serendipity, thats the first change I would make.  Luck of the draw goes off so infrequently that it makes it hard to slot over better options.
---
I would also reevaluate all your weight reduction stuff.  with unyeilding armor, you wont need these as your carry weight will be over 400.  
---
Drop Travel Agent for Tenderizer. Travel agent should be situational when you are camp hopping for gear only, not a constant on effect.
---
Drop Thru Hiker for Dodgy or Evasive, you are melee, which means you will be getting hit.   Coupled with Serendipity, these perks will keep you alive.  I would even go so far as to drop action boy to slot both dodgy and evasive.  Or get rid of marathoner for a 2pt action boy.
---
Drop Traveling Pharma for Barbarian.   As melee, you need all the defense you can get or you will constantly be a meat pile.
---
Bethesda “this will be your forever Fallout game”
---
I mean I want more utility items and would pay money for em depending on the utility they bring
---
Seen some insane rm prices while looking.
---
This happens to me a lot as a melee build.  I’ll hit the enemies and it will even show the damage numbers, but they won’t register.  It’s either server lag or a bug, but either way it not really anything you can control.
---
Battle Royale was announced as an idea from the devs. They have feedback posts on their official forums for other things, with the occasional mega thread about something specific they're looking into.
---
I usually try to kill anything i encounter.   
---
But after wasting hundreds if not thousands of ammo fighting couple tough enemies, and not getting almost anything worthy, I started just ignoring some enemies.  
---
those damn lvl 52 Mr gutsies, and lvl 62 charred ghouls and scorched beasts... NOT worth a damn second or a single ammo. I think i will survive without the plastic forks or bandage scissors ...
---
That's odd, I've never experienced it. I've slashed through whole groups of super mutants with a machete with ease.
---
Sorry, we don't have the junk jet gun or mortar yet (if ever) launching bikes is not allowed.
---
However if you find a shopping cart, the so ghtest nudge will launch those into the stratosphere
---
Have fun with the mass amount of lag and crashes you’re going to get.
---
Isolate the servers - common sense really - so characters are server-bound and cannot cross over to 'vanilla', give me console access, creation kit and SFTP/https uploads and you have my monthly fee.
---
I have a handful of ideas in mind... and houses of ill repute. For a brutal and gory post-apocalyptic hellscape the game is sorely lacking in that department.
---
Almost like drug abuse, untold graphic violence and bloodshed is fine and dandy but fucking is taboo.
---
Before even contemplating the idea of leaving the forest the denizens of Vault 76 would have a place of worship of some description, a brothel and a pub up and running in Flatwoods. And someone would be reprogramming the vendor bot with Fisto firmware.
---
Unsure how safe those possums would be too.
---
Will the colour/rank of the weapons change according to the cards we have selected?
---
nah they know they have no chance against Outer WOrlds
---
2019 Q5
---
Ah okay that makes more sense. Do you not wear any armor what so ever? The things that suck right now is poison for bloodied since they buffed poison damage. It'll almost immediately kill me.  I guess that with high health that isn't much of a favor really
---
Kind of you to offer but I’m on PC. I probably will be able to use excavator after I scrip in an hour or two.
---
Totally agree +1
---
There was a fuzzy backpack in the backpack promo images but nothing ever came of it
---
You know what is another reliable way of getting them? Blow through the bots at white springs. You'll net several full core on one pass through ...
---
I'm guessing it wasn't Pete Hines
---
https://www.gamesradar.com/bethesdas-pete-hines-will-always-say-no-thank-you-to-battle-royale-knockoffs/
---
Nah, Todd's not there. He's swimming in a pool of money right now.
---
Don't have that. But got tons of Stims, caps, etc...
---
One sec
---
They are going by their data on what has sold best on the atomic shop. They likely have made more money from the utility items than the cosmetic ones. The atom shop team is not making decisions based on reddit posts. They got hard numbers.
---
I certainly thought this but I’ve been playing a lot closer attention to the game world and have been surprised by the detail bethesda managed to put in. I was walking around and saw mannequins on the road. I see these all the time and usually I just blow past them. But this time I decided to look around for an explanation for them. And there was a container with a note that said it was a memorial for lost loved ones and to leave a moments for those that must, for now, be forgotten so that survivors can move on and live. And in the box was a bunch of random junk, trinkets.
---
Ok i just lit the bills a flame. So todd will be there soon.
---
The color system sounds interesting, but I wonder if it will take into account play styles. Are all snipers just going to be better than automatics?
---
Lol.
---
Lol indeed. I never implied you were the OP. Your first post was about how exhausting it was for you that someone suggested the OP using the term OCD in that context could be insensitive. 
---
Perhaps you’re right and my reading comprehension is off, but how does that NOT mean “hey, consider people with OCD before you use that term”? 
---
You seem pretty fixated on this person’s perceived hypocrisy, so would it help you recontexualize and address the statement if it came from me, who also tries his best to not say offensive things even behind closed doors? I’d like to hear your thoughts on it, seriously. 
---
While we’re at it, here’s a philosophical question for you:  how is calling someone out on the internet for “virtue signaling” not the very definition of “virtue signaling”?
---
New FEATURE discovered *
---
So what i wanna know is does this mean we’re getting a halloween nw event too? Its not entirely clear, like are the pictured costumes limited time NW rewards or just atomic shop items?
---
I think maybe the reason hair styles don’t seek as much is because hey offer hairstyles like the freakin beehive one. Who honestly thought that was what anyone wants.
---
There is a difference in appearance when equiped, but not while inspecting, heavy is much more bulky looking
---
Doesn't the rad effect follow pvp rules since it's from a weapon and not an emitter?
---
I want to see events where they have human npcs rather than Grahm and what not. Like a seasonal event where someone scouting Appalachia arrives and with it brings a quest or simple tasks. I honestly believe they should think about this to bridge the gap until wastelanders. Because who the hell knows when that dlc will ever REALLY drop.
---
hahahah yep
---
Believe not. I've definitely kill my Friend in adventure who is a bloodied build with nuek mine. It's environment radiation I think.
---
Thats not really a good way to check data though. They are going off single use items vs items that we keep. Of course single use items will keep selling since people have to buy multiples vs the cosmetic side where if you buy it once you don't buy it again.
---
Yeah. At the very least, we ought to be able to copy over characters into private servers regardless of mods.
---
I'm not a VATS user so this lagging and freeze is outside it, must be the game or network server then? Who knows.
---
What's that?
---
That doesn't make you evil at all. People who attack you have only themselves to blame!
---
I'm so glad i clicked on this
---
How about some better xp rewards or a different way to earn overseer xp for those that don't like battle royales.
---
Wait for wastelanders, its not a bad thing to have a pause :)
---
Gamers do have burnout syndrome, you know? Especially the good ones.
---
Gl mate &lt;3
---
Congrats! I remember smoking that Bitch the first time, man I was so giddy after all the times hiding in buses and other places when they used to come for me. Good for you, rock on!
---
They should also buff Nocturnals. It could just increase at night and not decrease during day. Just do base damage in the day and boosted at night
---
Oops well I didn't expect that. Does aoe rad damage from an enemy being hit with a gamma gun also damage other players even if I have pacifist on?
---
Yep an All Rise weighs 8lbs with 90% reduced  carry weight go figure
---
Wont see me getting upset because I will be right here, not paying for any private server.....
---
In what world are snipers better than autos?
---
Ah. Ok. I haven’t had the chance to engage in a proper , fun battle sharing and exchanging hits. I get the ones who come in and kill me instantly while throwing up zeros when I fire back. I always try to booby trap them. I’ve heard melee takes them down but can’t get close enough. 
---
I like the build. I want to try it later.
---
Go outside maybe?
---
That I don't know for sure.
---
If you're getting the jump on them, then aim for where they'll land
---
Just combine bloodied and stealth for the best damage you can possibly get. All bloodied bonuses give you 3.24x more damage at 19% HP. Add sneak attacks on top of that with Covert Operative and Mister Sandman for 3.75x more damage. Now grab Concentrated Fire for head shot targeting and double that result.
---
If you aren’t using power armor you could do something similar to my build subbing the rifleman perks for commando. [here](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=fd64378&amp;d=la2l71lu2a71am2a30a00ir2c72ej4eu0p00pd2pk2pp2pl2s92sf2ss2sg2se2&amp;w=&amp;m=51c2fe8g&amp;nw=&amp;n=) 
---
I get an absurd amount of free armor from barbarian, ironclad, evasive and grounded and scaly skin mutations, but if you want to use power armor you can easily cut all those. If you’re interested in energy rifles you shouldn’t use the grounded mutation either. 
---
The melee package is sweet because my carry weight is 450 usually and Radicool is an absurd effect for 1 point. Talons and iron fist are cost effective on points and the unstoppable monster is cheaper than a lot of bloodied weapons of that caliber, but I have a bloodied SS +1str that wrecks shit.
---
I would say tank killer, nerd rage, serendipity and blocker for sure because you end up dodging tons of damage and the anti armor effect is great against mutants. Lone wanderer makes a big difference too.
---
Adrenaline/gun fu/concentrated fire work really well together and lvl 1 is all you need to get that combo online and save yourself tons of ammo. Just set your vats to headshots and enjoy the aimbot.
---
It would cause infinite resources as everyone would buy bulk and give purified water in exchange
---
and you actually believe that?
---
some atom shop stuff on 24th. no in-game content for you, now go and spend dome atoms
---
The other guy is right, if you just watch the video he linked it’s a great video to get you started for a bloodied commando build
---
**TLDR:**  
---
\- Possible event in nuclear winter for Halloween  
---
\- New color system for item rarity/effectiveness (probably static, so won't change with perks)
---
This.  
---
You dont have to run at 19%, its the most damaging, but sometimes you need to go full health and swap in a secondary weapon.  I keep a vampires combat rifle in my bag just for this scenario.
---
Aww...c'mon Brothesda, do something.
---
Isn't that a medium speed weapon also? No way could I handle a mob with this issue, I get wrecked by just a few when it happens, I fall back and melt them with my handmade, melee could be so good.
---
Perhaps and this is a big guess, melee in Fallout 76 was designed 'optimised' specifically for PVP, 1v1 not against groups of NPCs so they just see no need to even look at this.
---
If I were being honest I'd say I would seriously consider paying Atoms for increased stash or camp building size. 
---
I know. I'm appropriately ashamed. But I'd more than likely still pay for it. 😞
---
The one selling skyrim.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if they have no modifiable options initially.  If they do it will be things like PVP Always on, make some sliders to adjust enemy/loot spawns, simple things like that.  So yea, the first options will probably be the things you've asked about, but that may not be available right away.
---
Honestly i would too.
---
Xbox actually. Yeah use them chems and drink alcohol too. Learn which addictions are best or worst for you as they all have certain stat reductions. Also change the characters face to reflect the lolz of chem usage over time. Oh and nothing is more fun than using a junkies shovel while trolling ghouls and scorched and whacking them over the head to here that DUNK sound.
---
Also experiment between a good junkie RP build and a meta try hard build. I am not a meta person at all so I have a hoarder or chem/aid/stem and stash up and coming junkie lol merchant who is a pure cheap ass. Oh my character  likes to blow everything up when I he is high on chems lol.
---
Then you go to log in to check the atom shop today and it looks skimp as fuck.
---
Me too! I want to camp in that horror camp side so bad. So i can play with the effects and the screaming etc.
---
Fixer plans sell for $30
---
To clarify I'm over here selling them for 15k
---
people dont get banned nearly enough in this game
---
don't you like this new fridge and collectron? we heard you guys love utility items
---
Jump to site alpha near whitespring, enter the shack by the lake and enter the elevator to start the quest. 
---
You’ll need to google the codes of the week and make sure you have a nuclear keycard in misc items to launch the nuke. If you don’t, you’ll have to go to the bunker military wing and use the terminal to start the hide &amp; seek &amp; destroy quest and complete it to get one.
---
If they continue with utility items they need more thorough descriptions. If it said 15 item capacity of the fridge I would have skipped it and I wish the gas mask I paid 300 atoms for actually worked. it's not like a gas mask would be game-breaking the things are laying everywhere.
---
Except that 10 years ago maps were smaller and so being tethered to the host wasn't a problem like it is now
---
You can select them in the atom shop
---
You're playing Fallout 76, so that's not surprising.
---
How big is the playerbase in Nuclear Winter? Do people go back and forth with Adventure? Just curious, doesn't mean anything. I'm not interested in NW (cause I'm an awful player) but wondering how popular it is.
---
So, I just want to say the memories are flawed and we remember things that didn't happen, sometimes.  For example, the red mast was atom shop only.  So you accidentally bought it?  Then crafted it?  Then scrapped it?  These masks that you claim to have had are so incredibly rare, that 99% if the player base has never even SEEN one.  And you say you owned more than one?  You can see why I'm skeptical.  And maybe you did have one of them.  Sure.  Unlikely, but ok.  But 3 of them?  No chance!
---
This character is the best thing I've seen all week. "Get off my lawn!... and my tower, too!"
---
February? April would be suicide with Cyberpunk being released.
---
when were private servers ever free tho? I mean server you can mod etc? 
---
ive played many games where private servers cost money to run. those were usually the most fun to play on (for free, since im just playing and not the one running it)
---
i dont really see the problem
---
I'm glad you're enjoying them, but it sounds like you're in the minority. From all the negative comments i've read on here and what i've seen in live streams, they're a bit of a joke and have utterly failed to attract big player numbers.
---
I think it is a medium speed weapon. I've killed groups of 3 Scorched with a combat dagger in open combat as well, which is a faster weapon. All mobs were either my exact level or slightly lower. But it was still fairly easy. I've had to heal, of course, but they've only gotten me to half health. Currently, I'm level 11 and I have not died yet. My primary tactic is careful stealth, though.
---
the end game content doesn't work properly because of server lag
---
and now they are introducing private paid low population servers
---
if that doesn't upset you and you actually want to do the endgame content, you are an imbecile
---
Sadly that's not greedy enough for Bethesda. They only get to sell those once. With utility items, they can do so indefinitely.
---
Forget the nuclear codes. Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long!!
---
My guess is some folks were hoping to be able to privately host their own servers.  Like that's what one friend and I have done on 7 Days to Die and Conan Exiles.  
---
But I guess part of that might be because Bethesda's system is funky and it might not be easily doable to host servers privately.  Especially because private servers would have to still communicate with Bethesda's cash shop/etc.
---
Sentry bots don't give full cores. I often farm them. They actually nerfed it in one of the earlier patches, which makes in world cores less efficient. Eg. Ones in PA frame spawns are always at 25%. I think Sentry Bot ones are supposed to be at 75. You can go in and check this right now yourself.
---
You're right but you come off as such an arsehole I really don't want to support this.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dl08tn/camp_location_list_build_in_a_building/
---
imagine wastelanders coming out tomorrow instead lol
---
Well, based on how many times the legendary player content has been pushed back. Probably summer of next year....
---
Other than a PR statement, I don't expect anything serious from Bethesda until Wastelanders launches.
---
Yeah I am on xbox
---
You can report the listings on Etsy. Only handmade &amp; vintage items are allowed to be sold on the platform. They actually will remove items/shops breaking the rules.
---
Dolly Sods has guaranteed Ticks too.
---
I can just drop you some if you need to use them.
---
It’s been going on to long and frankly it’s to late. The game has to be endured as a single player game where you either play within the limitations of the poor game design or you excel by cheating. RNG is so bad that I almost sympathise with the few frustrated players who feel they have to pay cash for the weapons and armour they want.
---
oh man youre not alone. i avoided them for the longest. specially since i had melee build mostly. But nowadays im like you and accept the challenge from time to time
---
Big facts
---
Cool,u be doing this tomorrow?il do a couple silos to.whats ur gt?
---
What do you expect Bethesda to do? 
---
They pretty much alluded in the last couple/few Inside the Vault articles that their main focus is Wastelanders and other content for 2020. We're pretty much going to get nothing except for the token event or 2 for the next 5 months, give or take.
---
I saw a complete bobblehead/magazine set for $150 with several sold.
---
Don't forget about the medicine stick for the lever! Or the ranger Sequoia on for the western and lucky for the single action!
---
anywhere from january to march somewhere between those months
---
One thing I could see and this is in base game, no mods needed. Is if a player took the Converted Munitions factory on a private server with an alt or a main, because there is no one to claim the workshop from them or challenge them, they could make 5.56, use a tactic to defeat the auto log out and just make ammo forever. Than swap back to the public servers and use that ammo to buy OP weapons and armor, effectively making it pay to win. Yes its slow money, but when it can be going 24/7 365 it still can amount to a ton.
---
Thats not considering if on a private server your able to affect drop rates, spawn rates, or the rates that legendary monsters spawn at.
---
Id like to see you able to take your public characters to the private realm, but any items/caps/changes to the toon that happen in the private worlds only applied to the private, but I have no idea if this is feasible/do able.
---
This is not a small indie company. They have more than enough resources to have staff break/fix.
---
Honestly I love the AI, but that’s because I’m used to playing minecraft where the AI has the sophistication of a cheese grater.
---
People are extremely overvaluing the amount of content in Outer Worlds, it’s only supposed to have about 30-40 hours of gameplay in order to finish everything and it’s not open world as some people seem to think. Not saying it doesn’t look fun, but whenever people cite that game as some sort of long term substitute for a game such as Fallout, it kind of bothers me. It’s a short term substitute at best.
---
It already is on sale, it's a budget game. It's $45 where I live.
---
Other games exist, dude.
---
Borderlands 3, GreedFall, and the upcoming Outer Worlds and RDR2 (on PC) are currently occupying me/us
---
Where did this expectation come from that a game should be entertaining forever?
---
That’s also far more expensive in the short term.
---
Wait what exactly is the glitch? (out of them all lol)
---
It's a visual glitch. Fusion Cores cannot be overcharged. They run for the same duration. Also, farming for flux is a pretty time consuming and grindy process. Paying to reduce grind is exactly one of the facets of defining pay to win.
---
i feel so lost. im guessing they are talking about looking at vendors and not seeing the inventory?
---
Role players
---
I bought a pickaxe skin to proof Bethesda that we are as stupid as they think.
---
Lots of location discovery challenges and creature kill challenges are bugged. There are a bunch of posts on this sub every week about them. They fixed a few a while back but it still isn't gone completely.
---
Nothing is free.
---
The refrigerator and collectron are not single use. They must have sold exceptionally well.
---
Lack of  \*\*\*Quality\*\*\* (this is important) content is the reason I gave my money to 2K getting borderlands 3 instead of bethesda.
---
Raids are bullshit, traded my way to all the legacies and armor sets, but have nothing new or rewarding to do with them.
---
I just want an instanced mode with hundreds of waves of enemies so I can mindlessly farm legendaries and sink my ammo into it. Gotta be rewarding tho, else it will be just some irrelevant content most people ignore like raids
---
Ill take your word, then. Ill log in to see which ones I already have, the common ones. You can get them for free if you are on ps4. Add me. Andreslamantis.
---
Look at today's dailies. I didn't count more than 40. And  also, I said, realistically obtainable, because often they require you to complete events that ni longer trigger even after hours of server hopping.
---
Just say theres a bounty reward for revealing the method of dupe, let all the rubes submit the info and ban em all permanently 👀
---
I'd be fucking ecstatic ngl
---
Seriously though, a year in and no Super Sledge skin? What is going on down there?
---
i mean they are worth as much as those on westtec tho? just get 2 new once :P
---
I hope it's not $16 that's way too overpriced, I'd be fine with $10 though.
---
Or they could have made it like ark conan exiles only time you need to pay for a server is if you plan to play with a group of ppl and you can also host a server.
---
^this. You can select an outfit and a power armor skin in the shop if you've bought em
---
We got one. A super mutant themed one. It was pretty cool.
---
Mate why did you make this thread when you have no idea what you are talking about?
---
I got it to start a few times yesterday, but he kept dying in one hit so I gave up.
---
Of course they won't chime in other than &lt;message of condolences&gt; &lt;message that it will be passed on&gt;.
---
If they were serious about dealing with cheaters, they would have announced something and done something regarding the NW cheaters at the very least weeks or months ago.
---
I really hope that this isn't the case but sadly I feel that cheaters/dupers like them will be the new normal for the next few months.
---
it doesnt really matter. some people dont know how to get items and they might buy it. 
---
my 2 best selling groups are free items. the plans in arktos pharma (groth enhancer etc) and the bottle and cappy clothes you get from the bunkers. lol
---
even those miniature eyebots etc sometimes get bought for 2k lol 
---
Oh and dont forget the alien gun with the fusion mod.
---
Or their testers for that matter. Don't release a giant game if it ain't ready.
---
He's arguing that they should be separate characters. Your private server character can only play in a private server and your public server character in a public server to avoid people using the private server as a way to farm and then sell things off in the public server. I think he makes a valid argument.
---
Oh I'll try that, thanks! 
---
Have to take a break from 76 though for Obsidians new game The Outer Worlds. Some are calling it a spiritual successor to Fallout NV so have to check it out. And Metacritic is 85! But I'll try this before Friday.
---
Do you pay once, or once a month? Once a month for 15 is wayyyy to much
---
Xbox?i can help you tomorrow if u like
---
You know Bethesda, they never announce things on time. There are almost always delays.
---
It honestly wouldn't shock me to see a Halloween event from them being launched first week of November. Maybe with some excuse that they gave us time to enjoy our own IRL Halloween before playing it in game or something like that.
---
Oh look, this door says EXIT on it, finally a way out. *Opens door, gets launched out*
---
So they are going to make people pay just to play alone or with friends and no added benefits? That doesn't seem like a good value.
---
lol same. but i give that 0 chance lol
---
Is this a sarcastic post or not? 
---
You’re at level 250, seems like you’ve gotten your money’s worth out of the game.
---
See you when Wastlanders comes out
---
Shotguns are no good in this game unfortunately,tho u got the best perks on it
---
Only if we get toilet planters too
---
That would probably cut the player base in half like it did the last time they did a mass ban.
---
Join the hive mind
---
What trading glitch?
---
I have had no issues trading now, or in the past.
---
Ok call me stupid but.... but if it’s just you in the server, what’s to stop you from camping anywhere since it’s just you in that server. Am I missing something?
---
*cue yet another e3 of "Hey, We're working on stuff" presentation*
---
I quit after level 70 experienced it all
---
Yeah, I'm excited for Outer Worlds as well
---
Aww that's sad. Now I have to go find it because I missed it. There is a lot of subtle story telling. Just takes imagination. Thanks for the tip!
---
When I met my beloved Rosaline 😆
---
like todays? :d hahaha
---
Yeah if it's not an always up server so that all of us can keep building upon it, it won't be worth my time to invest in it. I want to make a world with friends, who can do as they please when they please, without me having to "start to server".
---
I didn't even think about that but you're absolutely right. Especially if you get to modify parameters of the server e.g. spawn in legendary creatures/items.
---
I'd be very much happy with new, non-transferrable character on private servers only. Also deals with any future modding issues/conflicts between private servers and main servers.
---
That’s in the atomic shop.
---
Handlebar moustache.
---
Better not use your perk points for shotguns,they really suck now
---
u/Yabvone might have an informed opinion to share on this topic.

---
This is my current bloodied build. I use a meathook. I have everything min/maxed for the most damage output possible. I run a full Powered Unyeilding Cavalier armor set. With food buffs, chem buffs, alcohol buffs, mags and bobbles, my meathook is doing well over 9k damage. 
---
Seeing how your running two handed, youd have extra points in strength for incisor and martial artist. (Essentially leave your strength the way it is in your build except for traveling pharm, id personally put it  more points in slugger.)
---
Dude nuclear winter is a ton of fun. I hate battle royale games but find this mode extremely entertaining and tense.
---
Well, if anything, it may get worse.  But we'll find out tomorrow how everything works.
---
Yeah grafton monster is actually not rare, hes in events and always found at toxic lake in top left near hemlock the lake outfront, at anytime can be found there and the grafton day parade, the other two from my experience mothman is a little more common, but i guess to others in here the flatwoods isnt rare, i dunno i still think when like 70% of people i talk to dont see it more then once or twice ever, that its pretty rare :D
---
Expect the crying about how little you can mod them to be even worse.
---
I've actually had really good luck with the combat rifle when built up and with your character perked out.  I'm still using my 2 star bloodied +damage while aiming that I've had for almost 100 levels lol.
---
I've modded conan exiles and ark with just the cost of the game.
---
They should give all items a personal id. once one gets duped youll see the duplicates and might be able to trace them to the account. i cant even imagine what that database size would be. But if you would connect them to player id's it wouldnt be as much data. Like having 12 stimpacks (12) but theyd have 12 separate id's too. and then maybe ad an alert to duplicated items. 
---
(lol idk but it sounds reasonable to me)
---
Just got an email from fallout. They're having a giant sale on all fallout games for each platform for this special day.
---
I spend $200,00 per month on scrap and repair kits. Waits for everyone to hate on me.
---
Had a guy doing this to me last night actually. He was trying to get me to PVP and I just wanted to check out some dudes C.A.M.P. he killed himself trying to get me to PVP so I took his scrap and started walking back to my camp just to have him run up and toss mines at me over and over till he  killed himself again.
---
Based in the US, I see the same players either every other game or every game if I get the later rounds.  So what's that?  20-40 regular players?
---
it makes sense tho... to me. i mean if they were in your stash theyd take as much space.
---
imo they should raise base budget 20% and stash could also use one more little upgrade imo. but budget more. specially with them bringing out new items all the time.
---
Yep, I see this somewhat regularly when swinging my All Rise and also occasionally even when using my .50 Sniper/Hunting Rifle: a cleanly aimed head shot will hit (the nice big yellow damage number comes up) but the hit and damage will completely fail to cause any reaction on the mob: no HP reduction, no flinching, no change in alertness...
---
I've managed to survive the ghouls at level 8, I think everyone around level 10 can manage lol. I joined the enclave at level 8, and after visiting it quite often, I think the whitespring resort is a good place to set this event
---
Unlucky I lost a quad Gamma gun some one gave me then I stashed it so I can fast travel. The server crashed and I lost the gun
---
I think it’s trading between players. The options to invite or accept trade don’t appear.  Happened twice this evening.  Workaround suggested earlier works but a fix would be nice.
---
people get them because they affect gameplay.  they give an advantage.  this is my own assumption here, but i doubt most of the people that got the fridge and bot were happy, or even content, to spend atoms for them.  theyre "popular" because people feel theyre necessary.
---
About 15 caps, crazy right
---
As someone who is excited to play it, do you not think a tightly wound experience with quality and choices at every turn outweighs repetitive and boring content that’s stretched out because it really wants you to play a thousand hours when in reality you’ve done the same thing over and over for almost a year??
---
There's always a $1 deal going on for anyone without a current subscription, switches to full price after the first month though.
---
Thats awesome. if you think about it thats really very nice of them tho. i mean its dedicated to your personal preferences and that for free. i remember arma days and counterstrike etc and youd always have to rent a server.
---
Q1 of 2021
---
Would the server be more stable and not kick me out every few minutes if I paid extra or will it be a more lonely world than it already is but with the same amount of frustration? Just asking is all
---
Usually they are level 68 when I get there.
---
Private server is the only thing that will get me back into playing.
---
That wonderful do to much damage bug that ppl complained about at launch.
---
Before it ends.
---
We've had groups do server takeovers and we capture all the workshops to use as free travel spots. And when you have that last holdout that is going around just destroying workshops to grief the rest of the players it starts to look like $15 wouldn't be so bad after all.
---
There's always tea bagging in a shooter
---
I don't mind teach either or both. Done it enough times :D
---
They definitely need to change Project Paradise back to being able to be activated via the elevator. I like the idea of it being a public event so it's free to jump to and the server wide notification similar to the imposter but trying to get 3 teams of 3/4 people organised before the timer runs out is freaking hard to say the least. I want my backpack skin and stimpak diffuser plan damn it! 😅
---
I visited a camp yesterday guy with 10000 stims and 8000 nuka colas and 1 cap each.  Had many other things.  I actually talked to the guy over the mic and he wasn’t hiding from it. 
---
Since drop rates are so shitty that’s why people go to the open market.  I saw a fixer for sale for 200 real dollars.  Full unyielding sentinel set for 100 bucks.  Tons of good legendaries for 20-40 bucks.
---
yes im wondering how this will work out? i mean surely i cant just bring my character to a modded server with only level 3s and then go back to a normal server with the items i get?
---
As long as we can place them on foundations.
---
I was thinking about making one. I just moved my camp to the back of camp defiance, so I was gunna try to do something like that when I attempt to launch him at a SB.
---
I was using the bramin, but its difficult to get the fertilizer to be in position right to get on the trap trigger, even then it prompts me to milk it and not always to trigger the trap. 
---
I always get to trigger it with the robot.
---
The combat rifle is completely viable, it is not as good as a Handmade or Fixer, but the difference is not enough to not use one until you find better.
---
No they couldn't. That would devalue currency, be counterfeiting, and probably something else illegal.
---
I’m almost certain it’s either or. Not both.
---
ive seen ads for 40$ bloodied heavy weapons. whod buy that????
---
when i saw that i felt like i was throwing away so much money lol. even farming mags and bobbleheads could be fun for 150. i mean i got a complete set right now if anyone wants lol
---
Nah, outer worlds.
---
Wow. Hilarious. Where did you get that joke, joke.com?
---
Jk bro, i love you.
---
They tend to level with the player. The ones I encountered at that level were level 9-14. They'll probably be level 18-22 now
---
Haha yeah for some reason the game puts the marker there.  The outhouses are where the bunkers exit.  In the enclave bunker in the military wing there is a map near the terminal that locates the code pieces/keycards.  If you look at the map it has the silo entrances marked and if you click on each silo it will put the location on the map similar to how other locations turn up on the map if you go to the lookout towers.
---
Had they put the fear of getting banned into people early it wouldnt be so widespread now. Them not doing anything is almost them condoning it so people feel they are safe doing it.
---
ohhhhhh. i only have one char and my friends stopped playing months ago :( i never use that option lol
---
What on Earth leads you to think those things are not possible?
---
I'm gonna piggyback on this post too, if you don't mind!  I just received a Junkie's 3* Lever Action and am trying to do a Junkie's build too, but I'm really not sure how it works.  I just got addicted to Buffout and Med-x and it looks like my base damage went up on that particular gun.
---
You're thinking of the one for console or the ultimate one.
---
It's like Fallout but less wasted space and instead of a few choices that don't really effect anything, there's a shitload of options that effects everything. So it's "short" if you need your hand held, huge if you're creative.
---
Oh, i was unaware of that, ty :D
---
Pvp brings out the worst in people.
---
Hasn't happen to me in a while still makes me mad tho lol
---
I'd look into getting The Outer Worlds if I were you. Bounce between that and maybe another game until next year when the new content drops, there's no shortage of good shit to choose from. 
---
If you want another shooter/live service type game, I'd recommend Destiny 2, it just went Free to Play so you've got nothing to lose trying it out. Borderlands 3 might also be up your alley but you'll need to fork out some dosh for it first, it's worth it though IMO.
---
Already got my costume 😎
---
lol i got a few snallygaster spit attacks. some toxic goo i believe (not the one in a bottle) and a few boxes of targets. no idea why lol
---
Come play with me if ur on ps4 I can get u going a little better in it me and the people i play with usually have 7 game win streaks
---
Nice idea. They won't listen.
---
speculation
---
Fixing broken things in the game is harder than a thing in the shop. One thing us huge and has to be figured out in different situations. The other only happens in one place. Also it's easier to implement things in the shop verses a whole world. Taking a couple weeks to fix something is pretty reasonable where other games had issues for months before the got fixed.
---
Yeah the damage increases the more addicted you r
---
Ah ok, I need to find one then. Or buy one.
---
I just wish SPECIAL points where separate in NW. I really like my current build but it isn't very well suited for NW, I could use a new character but what about the Adventure XP, the rewards?
---
I respect but also disagree with your opinion that Fallout is filled with “repetitive and boring content”,I find myself making something new with every play through with almost 2 thousand hours combined in the franchise and still find myself enjoying myself every time I boot up one of the games. I will enjoy Outer Worlds for sure, but I will go through all of it’s content much faster than any Fallout game I have ever played, therefore Fallout games will always have more value to me than the Outer Worlds will ever be able to offer.
---
Observation*
---
I'm leaving work at 6PM pacific time that puts me home at 7PM pacific time and i'll be nuking shortly after :D
---
&gt;You want American prices on American goods, immigrate.
---
It's not like most of those american goods aren't made in China, Taiwan or Mexico.
---
oh good.. then you can link me to those hard numbers
---
they dont even fail to connect.. they show how much damage you do. but they indeed dont count for some reason. its very annoying because then they get to punch.
---
edit: my bad i thought this was about the first 1 or 2 hits not doing damage
---
&gt; i remember arma days and counterstrike etc and youd always have to rent a server.
---
Both of these franchises have supported self hosted dedicated servers since their first games, what are you talking about?
---
That is great! That first solo kill is so satisfying! I took a photo of mine and I'll never delete it :)
---
I'd argue more that they should have the budget to hire somebody with a skill set specifically geared to this. Somebody with experience working on anti cheat software would be a great place to start. 
---
Clearly it has not bubbled up high enough in priority for their management staff to care.
---
I’m not saying that there’s no replay value, I’ll go through it a few times to be sure, but I can almost guarantee that I won’t put the same amount of time into it as I have with any fallout game since there’s so much to explore in an open world versus a linear plot (in my opinion at least). And on the contrary, linear games tend to hold your hand much more than open world ones so I would have to disagree with you there
---
From where exactly am I to pull hard numbers from personal observations. Are you having a bad day or something?
---
Join the club dude, I once lost my entire item inventory after dying due to a server glitch with power armor! You would freeze and not be able to do anything but aim and shoot and I died and lost everything. Bethesda’s response was, “oh well”. Quite unfortunate.
---
Oh yeah, hopefully they have a level cap during the event though
---
When I first started playing I honestly assumed that's how it worked. Clearly not the case however.
---
Its 5 bucks for the beta which it's currently in, i think when it fully releases it bumps up to 10 a month
---
probably because i dont know much about it. but you explained to me why people are mad now. its because they allow private servers but only the once they provide and not your personal servers?? that sucks indeed...
---
my Pistol/rifle guy went Mentats, Alcohol, Overdrive, Psycho and Day Tripper. I dont take chems all that often, sometimes Ballistic Bock and Psychotats, but I think Overdrive stacks as well so you lose a lot of the negatives of addiction if you're taking the drugs associated.
---
For my no power armor build, I like to run blocker, barbarian, nerd rage, dodgy and serendipity, sunkissed and born survivor. I use all unyielding armor (some rad resist, poison resist, ap refresh, dense) and a bloody death claw gauntlet.
---
I usually run around at full health, and it takes me two or even three hits to kill a high level scorch, super mutant, or yao guai. However, in really tough fights, (mirelurk queens with friends, AWOL armaments), as my health goes down, my damage goes up, so those fights typically don't last long.
---
Usually at SBQ events, I just show up, and my damage goes up and down with my health; but once in a while I'll thrown on radicool, cook myself to 19% health, and seriously throw down (and die).
---
What I like about this build is that I can pretty much handle anything, rarely die, and can become a super version of my self if I'm so inclined.
---
Up to 5 addictions will increase your damage on a junkie's item (50% total).  Just pick 5 addictions that won't bother you too much.
---
"oh thats easy! youre a pirate"

\- "em no, im my fallout character"
---
:D
---
I'm reading 40 hours for a playthrough that mainly focuses on the main quest stuff with a bit of side-questing, 60 hours if you really dive into the sidequests. 
---
Throw in the fact that the game encourages you to do multiple playthroughs (there's a faction system, and multiple character builds) and I'd say it's right around where it should be.
---
Ok thx. Trying to find the withdrawal effects anywhere seems impossible. I can find the initial affect but not the actual withdrawal status ones.
---
hackers would probably just find a way around it anyway
---
Junkie Raider Love, I get it :-)
---
remember that Plans have weight too. I think they're like .25 each or something. I recently  saved about 20ish lbs in cary weight just by dumping all my duplicate plans
---
Congratulations! You beat the game! You have seen your enemies driven before you and heard the lamentations of their wimmin'.  
---
The outer worlds arrives soon. Go play it!

https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/

wow. talk about breaking the 4th wall
---
u/Yabvone is one of my primary inspirations for going Junkie after finding myself with enough gear to make it happen. No mention of levels that I saw in the posts, but I'm going to start at lvl 10 and give it go! So if you see some strung out low level on PS4, it may just be me :-)
---
Well it's not that simple.  
---
These aren't just simple skins, most of these weapons look more or less different to their Fallout 4/76 counterpart.  
---
New models and textures would be needed.  
---
And it's unlikely that Behtesda will create Ranged Weapon Models Swaps anytime soon.
---
Like imgurnewtgingrinch was saying: sometimes you have to tear down part of your camp to get rid of things people have placed. Sometimes it's not even done on purpose. A lot of people don't know that placing things up against a foundation will make them irretrievable.   
---
It gets on my nerves too, but it's not an issue worth quitting over. Or worth telling someone to quit.
---
My pie; much treasured.  
---
I ate it, but it saved me.

Perfectly preserved.

i have like 4 brown and 1 blue :( the blue is nice but the others are more rare. youd think theres one for every color hat but i never hear people talk about the yellow outfit
---
Its a patch 11 bug all of us who do meelee are upset by it.
---
no one ever talks about the yellow one. but theres a yellow hat? (as others have already said) but has anyone ever seen the yellow one or might it be the actual most rarest?
---
There's areas you can't place camps at all.
---
I agree with this so much.  I've been playing off and on since B.E.T.A.  I enjoyed 76 when it came out, but now.  its getting stale.  My brother and a friend of ours we met at Faschnact try to find stuff to do, but there is so little to do any more.  Wastlanders, here I wait.
---
Can we see it?
---
then you are speculating that it was half the playerbase arent you..?
---
It's your money, no hate here.  I've only used 1 scrap kit ever and all my characters have at least 15 repair kits.  I've never stored anything in my fridge but I'm liking my scavenger bot 👍
---
If you truly believe the fridge or collection give you a real advantage in the game you're playing wrong. Neither one of those things give any real advantage you can't gain in game already. 
---
Get a refrigerated backpack and build on a junk pile, both of those things work drastically better and are free..
---
oh man i had that happen just once luckily. but what does happen a lot recently is dead bodies despawning before i loot them or indeed inventory being empty (not as often as the complete despawn)
---
100% agree.  Lol I've been waiting for the rng gods to give me an upgrade however they have not deemed me worthy yet.  Haha I seem to get a lot of heavy weapons and melee.....i hate to think about the amazing rolls that I scripted without knowing what I actually had.
---
Yeah 60 sounds a lot closer to what I expected, and I know I’ll have a bunch of play thoughts if the game is even half of what New Vegas was
---
Did they add the ability to respec a character by selling all cards and getting new points to spend or reset your cards yet? I'm waiting on that before I come back. I really dont want to start a whole new character to change my character.
---
I am conflicted. I recognize that a steady stream of income to the developers is the only way to continually get updates and such.
---
however, I'm not exactly thrilled with the quality or quantity of the updates that have come. Some have been fun, but nothing ground breaking.
---
I really like fallout 76, i never got the ridiculous hate. I have super high hopes for wastelanders. If it is as good as it should be, all will be forgiven.
---
id also be totally down with the hazmat suit being underarmor (or their being an underarmor version)
---
The attitude of wanting the perk removed from the game because you don't want to spend the special points on the perk is pretty crappy. You can 100% get it for yourself, you just don't want to do what it takes
---
On that point, IMO that's the biggest problem with NW. It's ridiculous the amount of special points it can cost someone if their adventure build is different from what they want in NW
---
I mean, I don't want the common ones but if you actually do have the jester or old man winter, goblin, skull, sun... sure I'll take those off ur hands
---
I observed alot of ppl be banned and noticed half of my friends list was never to return and still haven't. That's my observation. You can call it what ever you like to make yourself better. But for real, you step on a Lego or something this morning?
---
Agreed, I probably won't either, I've been more into huge games where I build one character over a long time, though there are drawbacks to that too. Just wanted to explain what all the hubbub is about though. Who knows how it'll actually play, we're entering a new era of RPGs, maybe it will actually make replayability more of an enjoyable thing. I'm just hyped to try it and essentially treat it as a tech demo for next gen's RPGs, where they'll hopefully expand it both ways instead of just one.
---
Thx that about covers it awesome!
---
more speculation.. you really have 0 idea how many people were banned at all do you?
---
That's just tragic man. I'm sorry to hear that.
---
There's people there? There should just be little Faraday cages on display to display the AI support team.
---
Psn name?
---
This game was 60 bucks, not free to play

A little tip I've learned recently. If you pick up something or learn something that you don't want to have a chance of losing, drop something right after. Dropping an item (or selling) will trigger your character to save. Picking up something (or buying) doesn't. I usually just drop a bullet or something. Has saved my butt and some of my friends' too.
---
Yeah I understand, I’m pretty hyped to try it as well! It’ll be very cool to have a new Obsidian RPG since it’s been awhile.
---
If they're cheating I don't see the problem with them being banned regardless of how many there are.
---
You like blocker over ironclad? And does serendipity have a cool down on proc?
---
Not everyone likes whales being in the game. But is a nessaserry for the game to stay live. I dont understand the use of scavanger bots really as extractors have alwase been free. But it takes place for thoes who love idiot bot.
---
Put on a suit of unyielding armor, rad yourself down to -20% health, eat possum bacon and you’ll get them pretty often from the machines.
---
I agree. Don't get me wrong.
---
This isn’t Minecraft. I think Minecraft is a lot easier to maintain vs fallout
---
Scrapping armor can unlock mods for *any* body part. Did you check if you actually unlocked Buttressed for chest or legs instead of arms?
---
He has mentioned to me several times that at lower levels the downsides from the addictions are difficult to overcome, and don’t adequately offset the benefit of Junkie’s  gear. I’m curious to hear from him what lever is the tipping point.
---
i got a level 50 explosive combat shotgun but its really bad :( i think its because of the suppressor. idk it just sucks
---
You're right, I don't. Also idgaf, you ever think of that? I was stating an observation based on my friends list. Do you go around correcting everyone or did you just target me because your day is shit and you're trying to make my day shit too?
---
Stick with it and watch player vendors.  My first Bloodied was a 1\* Handmade I got for 1500 in a players vendor, my best find was a BFFR the Fixer for 10k, I did a happy dance.
---
even when i dont use melee on her i still wait till she lands before i start shooting her in her face. the only thing i might use when shes flying is a shotgunl. because i heard that makes her land
---
I like how everyone is some kind of expert on economics and digital market places. Bethesda knows exactly what they are doing, what they can do and how people will react to it all. They have psychologist and all sorts of advisors on staff for the things they don't. They have a plan for.everything that goes on that shop unlike the rest of the game. They know if they release anymore than what they have they will be competing with themselves for the atoms you have and how much we are willing to spend on atoms every week. By the time you have enough atoms to buy that x-02 or plasma caster, they will be old news. It also be impossible to get you to buy FO4 gear after the new Vegas skins are released. The 2 week patterns is to get you to use your spare atoms on the sale items and then release something a bit cooler the next week so you buy more atoms and repeat. Then there's the hopes that settlers will inject more life into the game and more potential shoppers, meaning they can't pull the trigger on the stuff they actually have to make new models for.
---
I'd only go for a private server if it let's me play solo without all you scrubs :P
---
Mainly interested in how the gameplay will be and will it still be a skating rink of mob lag and disconnects.
---
Long hair styles for women as well please?? 
---
Nothing goes past shoulder length :(
---
Having the plan is rare, not just finding the mod.
---
That is an awesome take!
---
I also completely respect my character.
---
I was level 36.  I have low level power armor and a Fixer.  Used maybe 600 rounds and 10 stumps is.
---
He's talking about hosting his own dedicated server, not some shitty P2P networking, homie.
---
Why does everyone have this idea that every game is supposed to last forever?
---
I got close to 100 hours out of this game, I got maybe level 60 can't exactly remember. It was a blast, and I got my money's worth.
---
It's not a job. You don't have to keep going back once you get bored with it.
---
yea i usually stay around 40 or like said higher if i go in to a herd. but i got 1 auto stim armor so all i take is a diluted rad away if i want that. also i got 3 of those armors that give extra strength and the radicool perk. so even at full health its fine.
---
Maybe each month will have a new set of Nuclear-Winter specific rewards, like the VTU rewards we got when the Morgantown map was released.
---
-radiation emote-
---
yea i have that happen randomly too. only found 2 weapons in there i wanted tho. but when  you find them.. they are really cheap ;)
---

whaaaaaaatttttt?? the second projectile is only 25%? :(
---
I picked up my 2*BE Lever for 20k and my 2*BE Handmade for 25k + 7k 5.65
---
In the launcher, right?
---
 Yes.
---
your friends list does not represent the entire playerbase.. your opinions are not facts..
---
The lag is going to be worse than ever. They're going to layer so many VM instances on the servers we'll be lucky to get 3 threads per world.  
---
Bethesda are.getting *paid*.
---
Exchange fees for converting foreign currency. BLAME THE BANKS.

I'm exactly the same, I really want some more Camden Park stuff to complete my "Mr.Fuzzy Fanatic" look. lol
---
So I actually did this in survival because I wanted people to come mess with me. Sadly no one did.
---
I respect what they do
---
#HOWEVER
---
I don’t understand how they encountered a negative reaction from the fan base and were like “yeah these people are ready for non-cosmetic exclusives in the atom shop” 
---
Like how can you be THAT tone deaf?
---
Awe shit, man. That’s too bad.
---
\*AHEM\*
---
That's not what a dedicated server is so that's a silly and unlikely rumor.
---
If this would happen, the economy would be fucked in the matter of a few days, due to a hardworking minority that grinds a ton.
---
Repost
---
r/tf2 can relate
---
maybe youll remember that next time your trying to pass off your opinion as a fact to refute something another person has posted.. hopefully you learned something today
---
You think servers run on rainbows and unicorn farts?
---
I learned that you're definitely up yourself and blocked. :)
---
Unlimited generation of unlimited amount of ressources vs fixed predetermined ones? 
---
Guess again.
---
Childish people attack the other person rather than their arguement. Good job.
---
It's not common on XB, I think because the player base of 76 are pretty much all older. 
---
My squad reserves tea bagging specifically for special occasions, like group tagging grenade launcher douchebags.
---
🤔Well there is some kind of update 2morrow, cuz its goin down for maintenance soooo who knows 🤷‍♂️
---
Doesn't matter how I come off as long as I'm right.
---
SAY👏IT👏AGAIN👏LOUDER👏FOR👏THE👏PEOPLE👏IN👏THE👏BACK
---
also please stop gender-locking hair styles, there are so few as it is :(
---
You cant. You can only wear atom shop items.
---
what is wrong with the internet today
---
They only allow Atom shop items, they're trying to push more outfit purchases.
---
Wanna back that up?
---
Automatron really was great.
---
But yeah, I like to base my prices on other games I've bought.  If a game itself cost $60 and a full DLC cost $15 then I'm not gonna spend $5 on a singular set of armor.  The Creation Club has better prices than 76 and you're getting actual items that aren't just cosmetics and very often a little quest to get them.  I'd much rather spend money on that.
---
I also base my prices on food.  If a weapon skin costs over $6, no way in hell am I buying it.  I could feed myself for a day on $6 easily and eat good too.  Would I rather have a single virtual weapon skin for just a single weapon in a videogame that is only cosmetic and has no effect on gameplay?  Or would I rather feel the delicious satisfaction of having finished a hearty meal?  I'll take the meal.  I love a good meal.
---
They are impossoble eith the current mechanics. They could be changed but it wouldn't be worth the cost to Bethesda.
---
Constant clipping issues with armor and outfits?
---
Probably not
---
shudders a little
---
I guess if you want to have a second system to host a dedicated server that you cant use for anything else like ark survival evolved then that's possible.
---
I love the battle royale. Reddit =/= the entire 76 player base, no matter how important you think your opinions are.
---
u/nwordcountbot u/JustAFakeCactus
---
No not at all. The key, as I said, is being able to weave a tale that hooks the readers. Some folk got it, some it's hit and miss, some are further ahead just taking a photo!
---
The Outer Worlds is arround the corner
---
Thank you for the request, comrade.
---
I have looked through justafakecactus's posting history and found 1 N-words, of which 0 were hard-Rs.
---
Are you sure you aren’t at the limit because those “phantom vendors” are actually stored, not scrapped?
---
Good bot
---
Ps4 !
---
Lmao
---
Prove me wrong.
---
indeed.. the rare and exotic wednesday update
---
Yeah cause those millions in annual profits are just killing Bethesda! Damn, to lose sooo much money is unreal with the game selling around the world for a year now. Must be rough. How bout a sub on quarterly profit loses from game sells alone, then the lose their taking on micros?!?! I can’t imagine the hit their taking!
---
I've gotten the key recently with someone just a few days ago. I think ppl arent aware the wall in the OTHER room opens
---
👋🏻
---
Yeah i dont know how i feel about fighting a 3 star only to have it drop a nocturnal rad suit
---
I didn't have any plans on me, but a bunch in my stash that were for sale in my vending machines.  It's weird.  It's either ammo or meds somehow but I feel like I don't have so many of those.  I used to carry around 100 stims and I reduced it to like 30 and now it bugs me because I feel like it'd be easy to go through that many and run-out unless I find more as I go through zones.  
---
The weight perks should apply to your stash.  That one thing would probably save me a ton of headache.
---
Are you're sure it's your vendors and not what you are personally carrying? I got a dialogue last night when I tried to pick something up that I was 'at my maximum item count' or something to that effect. I stored all my holotapes and that dialogue went away.
---
Woah! Being on an organized team sounds exciting. Is there a subreddit for that by chance?
---
Good stuff! This is a big deal, I remember my first SB solo kill! Keep it up 😎
---
Are you certain about that? I can certainly affect the value depending on my current intelligence and, anecdotally,  they seem to last longer, though I've never tested it 
---
As for flux, I don't find it all that hard and in fact that is pretty much my end game, dropping nukes, killing SBQ and making ever type of flux, some more than others. I made a couple hundred violet in the last week, need to keep my prime .50 cal in ultracite ammo!
---
Didn't know that about the rewards. All the Caps cap is 30k so I guess the game is just tossing caps in the void at this point.
---
Fair enough! As long as there is still value as decorations 😂 I actually could agree with you there!!
---
There is definitely the serrated mod. Not sure on the electric one though.
---
Don't forget about the fact that ash and goo piles prevent those killed enemies from spawning again, leaving only about 2/3 or less of the enemies on a good mob location (west tek is the most popular)
---
A 3 star Berserkers Tesla dropped for me today.
---
First time anything Berserkers has dropped for me.Everything has been bloodied or nocturnal.
---
Think i will keep it just for arseholes who Slap/instigate PvP,i have a few Stealth Boys.
---
Serious question,Are these Teslas any good for anything other than using for the PvP glitch ?.
---
I wish when we displayed them that people could see the names of the weapons, sortof like a pop up sign qhen reading an interactive object like in previous games
---
Textures are way easier to load in Minecraft. Fallout has way higher requirements and has textures that take longer to load. Of course Minecraft would be easier to maintain. And oh wait, who owns Minecraft? Microsoft
---
There is a serrated and electrified mod however I'm looking for the mod that's puts them both together
---
So, yes, there have been some in the past, but from my own experience,  there is only 1, kill SBQ, that does not increment. YMMV, but every other one seems fine and has for a while
---
Oh that would be awesome. I’ve always been a builder and I love showcasing my character/items. I agree 100%
---
"Legacy " they are so duped that they are not rare at all all I ever hear now is what legacy do you have? And you know what we all have the same legacy weapons.  You know what a real legacy is to me a good right arm or leg, a heavy armor that's not crap like underwater or nocturnal.  That's a legacy or even a 3* legendary anything that's from a 3* creature that's a legacy because that never happens.  More ppl have the same explosives weapons than not.
---
If you're on xbox I can build you a gauss rifle. I see the plans for it pretty often in the vendors. I don't recall where I got the gauss rifle plan for, however. And, people do buy purified water, I sell mine for 2 caps and it sells out all the time despite having the purifiers unlocked.
---
Use it to buy stuff for your main before it caps. I just transfer the excess to my mule once it starts getting near the max. Matches only reward 30-500 caps per game, so you have plenty of time.
---
I've actually fallen asleep sitting in the giant teapot it's quite peaceful noises
---
Again, look at more than just the dailies...you can average easily 100 a day over the course of a week, you just have to put effort into ot
---
Things that are still obtainable are what I consider legendary, maybe really highly sought after legendaries. But legacy is unobtainable through normal gameplay means.
---
Cry me a river.
---
Nobody buys purified water because is easy to obtain, sell trash weapons you obtain for a decent price so people can scrip them, you'll make some decent caps. If not, obtain a full unyielding set of armor and bring yourself to low health, you'll get a charisma bonus and sell your stuff on the vendors for more. As for the gauss rifle plans, they are always available in a certain vendor
---
I am indeed on the Xbox. I believe I can give you the mats. Screws will be an issue, as they always are
---
Monster mash is great candy because no one does it
---
This is a solid idea, but how much NW would I have to play before I level 50 and get the max perks.
---
I'm about 130 but could always use help and I'm searching (in vain it seems) for a Vampire explosive weight reduced or FFR gatling or Minigun  .... and armor etc ..... but .... i feel your pain for the boredom. It comes and goes for me even now. I restarted Fallout 3 just because but it seems too low res and clunky. FO4 is still too fresh in my mind so that's out and I don't want to get back into Far Cry even though i really enjoyed it.
---
I know some folks about the same level as you and I belong to a group that I won't mention here that attracts people with honour and good hearts so if you want to hang out some time my IGN is Maddog-McSugartitz and I'd be pleased to know you. (Yes I am on PC)
---
Thatd be neat, they should've released the antique globe with explosions for this
---
Nope it says 4/4 and that I'm at maximum build count, and Im not full on my build bar either
---
I've been buying it all up from vendors.
---
Yes, in Phoenix. I just don’t have enough caps.
---
Awesome move!
---
Money causes selective hearing.
---
I'm pretty sure the general consensus is that we need to Fix the damn Trading Glitch, this has been going on for too long
---
What I noticed is that those areas tend to scale with your level. It just depends on what you want to fight. The Mire has a lot of critters to keep you surprised. Cranberry Bog is a mix of mutants, robots, scorched, and some critters. 
---
But to answer the question. If you can kill those with relative ease try a harder spot. Levels indicate difficulty but so does the types if creatures you are fighting.
---
I was just 10 minutes into killing the queen, someone nukes it again, overlapping where everyone was out of the nuke zone.   
---
I'm ok with private servers.
---
Maybe the light they fixed at Grafton high will flicker out
---
Are you talking about when you look the map?
---
You can change the player icons in the atomic shop.
---
Sorry to bother you out of the blue by my lvl 41 cant even Register with the Brotherhood! Everytime I go in there its filled with level 62 ghouls in clumps of 4-6. How did you do it at lvl 8? 
---
Any tips would be very welcome. 
---
Have a good day!
---
I’d say the two biggest drawbacks to running Junkie are that it isn’t particularly good at low lvl (50 would seem to be ideal so that you have the most points to draw from) and that most of us run addictions with negitive charisma so sharing perk cards with a team can be a problem.  Good luck w/ your low lvl attempt!  So long as you’re having fun with it that’s the main thing 👍🏻
---
Yup sadly
---
The two of you typed words on my comment but never mentioned how special or great I am. I too am offended and my offendedness takes presedent over anyone elses because im special and great
---
Don't they also get murdered by random camp attacks?
---
Not my best launch, but you get the idea.
---
https://vimeo.com/368154445
---
It can take a while. On nights where we win consistently, I can gain 2-3 levels easily from 50+. Even on bad nights, I still gain at least one on my main, but thats 130+, and I don't know what the xp curve really looks like. I think the first 15 levels are the hardest, you pretty much have no damage or mobility perks, and not enough stats to run any dmg perks.
---
That being said, I started a new character last night, and played a few matches before my regulars got on. In the first 2 matches, I got 13 (7/6) kills, and an overseer win, and raised 6 levels.
---
This is just a quick and easy way to tell which weapon is stronger than another of its class. So if you see that a 10mm SMG has 1 dot and a Handmade has 3 dots, you know the Handmade is stronger. I don't think they're meant to be used for comparing weapons of different classes.
---
My biggest issue is that like two weeks ago it was kill different scorched creatures. Even after going to several Queen events still didn't get credit cause all the "scorched" creatures were diseased. 
---
This shit continued into the community event, so who knows when we actually finished it, considering how many scorched creatures probably didn't count.
---
A little disappointing launch but it is what it is, lol.
---
This is true. I figurer prepatch today at least. Makes me worry the release is gonna be really buggy
---
It is all so hideously wrong. I am ( probably too?) devoted to this game. Some people have bragged to me about being a duper. I understand that buying w/ real money has been around for a long time w/ MMO s, but mixed with the unchecked duping? It is very disheartening. I can kind of understand stuff that is almost truly impossible, specific example: the plasma grenade plans. Any player buying these plans doesn't effect me, and I have spent tens of hours doing the ash heap's quests that can drop them, none yet.  I can almost sympathize.
---
         Where does that slippery slope stop though? Drop rates are so rough mixed with difficult in game trading mechanics ( vague discriptions of player vendor inventory from main map, and player to player trading bug) there is just so much incentive to go out of game. How long does Beth want it to take for an endgame player to assemble the gear they want? 
---
      Without using at least the trade sites this grind can go on for, well longer then the game has existed so far. I have not gotten 1 peice of sentinel/ assassin's cavalier/assassin's to drop, ever, been playing since Christmas. When there was a survival mode, this was one of my long term goals. 
---
     I refuse to cheat, but it is so frustrating competing against those who do. The current environment makes me feel like the game is melting down. It is Beyond "immersion breaking" to wander into fountain of nuke mines. Seeing that people sell multiples of items I have spent months grinding for angers me, and sucks the feeling of accomplishment out of the game.
---
    Please Beth, put some precious resources into fixing this. Ban away, sure, but stop the actual cheating as it is sucking the fun out of this awesome( buggy) carnival ride of a game.
---
Thank you for clarification &lt;3
---
Yeah there's a Yellow one, I just don't like it so I forget it lol
---
Wouldnt be neat QoL to have text indicator for that :')
---
I’m pretty sure I have the plan.
---
The host would be a machine, not a player.
---
Happy Fallout day!
---
Can not remember the last time i drank purified water.
---
These days i drink only Inert Flux,always have 500 + from  around the Clock Nuke drops.
---
I always sell all my Purified to the Bot Vendor.And leave the Pumps open for those that are in genuine need and the greedy  thieves running  water Bootlegging :-)
---
Mine sometimes stop displaying an item, but it has only happened maybe 3 times since display cases have been out. Moving the item out and back in fixes it. Are you talking about that or something else?
---
If I may ask, why did you lower your charisma?
---
The server doesn't load textures, that's all done locally. In fact, the server knows nothing about textures whatsoever.
---
A server only maintains the 'status' of the game world. Monster positions, world states, player inventories, etc. There's very little if any *graphics card stuff* involved in running a server.
---
Having said that, Fallout probably is a little harder because it has more fine grain/less voxel properties, but I don't think things are that different. Even if Minecraft is infinite, it only renders the areas around the player and the same is true in Fallout. 'Active' blocs are the only work the server is doing.
---
Youll be able to mod servers
---
They said beta is coming sooner than we expected. Maybe wastelanders beta for new characters only. Gives them months of testing for once
---
I wasn't being serious about telling them to quit, I was just annoyed since it was something completely harmless. It was more of just that there are far worse things they can face and make a fuss about than stash boxes. If it made it so they had to break some stuff just to remove some small item, I'd understand the fuss and sharing so more people might think "okay yeah I can see why that's annoying, so I won't do that". But it was just stash boxes and larger decorations in OP's case, which can just be scrapped and moved on from. But in the end I could have also just ignored the post and moved on, which was my own mistake. I honestly don't even remember reading or saying anything on this post until you replied to my comment. So I'll call myself out here and say I was a hypocritical asshole and I apologize for that.
---
He feel Predator, having skull pieces as 🏆
---
Doesn’t inert flux weigh a ton?
---
Highest record ive had is 7 hits before the hit registered on the enemy, using a controller on PC buti t happens either way, seems to be issues with the damage syncing with the server
---
Also don’t be afraid to pop a diluted Rad-X before going in to the fight, if I go on a white springs run I just pop on prior and that really helps. And Barbarian perk is your friend imho helps you with a bit more dr/er
---
I want to make the toilet corn.
---
Solid gold advice right there
---
The economy is already fucked, and has been since launch. There has never been a single time in 76 history when there was no duping exploit, the dupers have just wised up and started keeping things quiet while they sell on ebay etc. so the exploits are not patched. Any economy you think you see is simply an illusion. Duping for RMT is what really controls the market in 76. Sad, really.
---
Btw is there a legacy for rifle build better than the Fixer we have atm?
---
Did you log in to Nuclear Winter before going to Adventure Mode this morning? This is a known bug that messes up the Dailies/Weeklies. Always go to Adventure first after they have reset for the day to avoid this till they fix it :(
---
Soooo painful. Fss AA bone hammer 1 or 2 shots almost everything, when it finally registers the hit. So functionally it 3 or 4 hit kills everything, which is not useful with mobs. Sprinting into an area seems to cause more "sleeper" mobs, as if they haven't had time to load in fully. Even when fully loaded, sprinting up to them for that running power strike usually doesn't register the first big hit. Feels like a lag based problem, but whatever it is it handicaps melee. Beth plz fix!
---
4th of july to celebrate the liberation of the scorched from appalachia and the return of settlers back into the wasteland.
---
Same here in the sense My 2 vet characters are pretty well set PVE-wise nothing but legendary grind machines.  So I started a new alt during the sale and got her some \*\*\* legendary weapons.  Much more fun if your lvl 10 has a \*\*\* insitigating, explosive pipe pistol and vanguard's leather armor with reduced weapon weight.  This alt has been leveling up by grinding mats (adhevise, springs, screws, oil) to mod all the good weapons I managed to get during the sale.  I have great combat shotguns which ironcially dropped at West Tek (not the purveyor) which i plan to develop for an alt shotgun build (sounds like shotguns were nerfed to crappiness recently, unfortunately). Also got a bloody, faster fire/relod broadsider I want to play with to see what it can do.  Also got a Vampires Ultracite gatling plasma I need to research to maximize use agains the SBQ.
---
I have about 10 things I want to do now, but need to grind the mats to play with all the new shiny toys I received.
---
Same!
---
Some good points, but i'm not suffering from ammo shortages like yourself and I've gone back to a heavy explosive build which I really like, it's not the most powerful but bloodied felt wrong and explosive is just fun. I get through a lot of .308 but my vendor trade is strong enough that i just buy whatever i need, I only make .50 and ultracite. A big help is my explosive flechette harpoon, free ammo, long range and hits for 1000 damage, but i do miss my snipers and handguns. Started off as a vats gunslinger, miss my pipe revolver, such a good early gun
---
Sent you a chat message.
---
Very cool
---
Red Dead Online has gotten decently better with Septembers update, bounty hunting and lucrative trader/collector
---
Me too.
---
I ended up getting rid of  the Bobblehead collection and the Stand to free up Stash Space.
---
Would be nice if there was an option to remove items from the Statsh Box for permanent display and suffer no carry weight penalty.
---
Maybe a simple disclaimer before choosing .: " You are permanently displaying this item,it will no longer have any functionality/Cap value  other than a Camp cosmetic,if you decide to remove the displayed item it will be deleted permanently".".
---
Meat hook
---
Honestly, taking a break makes parts of 76 more fun. I completed crackdown 3 because it was on gamepass and I felt like a stupid 80s style over the top sci-fi lite theme with explosions. Tried Mass Effect, since it’s my brother in law’s favorite series, and played some Switch.
---
What is the level and the effects?
---
While shotguns are not powerful, they're incredibly useful with the Enforcer perk and Marsupial mutation if they're exploding, i never get overrun now and once everything is crippled you can easily finish them off with something that has more kick
---
\*\* Laughs in Bloodied LMG \*\*
---
I was going to try to make my alt something different but now I'm going for a bloodied explosive build and then my next build if I ever get to it, is going to be bloodied unarmed. It's gotten addictive to play like this. I just know they are gonna nerf it soon because people seem upset by it. But I think it's just high risk, medium to high reward.
---
hahaha that's so cool
---
Maybe it's bugged? From the Purveyor's Sale, I got a Mutant's Laser gun three star, and it wouldn't shoot unless I was using the scope. So, I found this out the hard way in close combat when I needed it to work. Well, needless to say, that bugged laser gun, after I'd upgraded it with mods, found it's way back to the purveyor.
---
I have no issue spending real money in the atom shop. The problem is there’s nothing I really want where I need to spend cash. I don’t need a junk collector. Give me my butler from FO 3 and I’d pay. I don’t need a fridge as they don’t work that well from what I’ve heard.
---
I want a matte black PA skin with no other colors. I like the look of the ultracite blue but black would be even better. But just give us more choices for a reasonable amount of $. Maybe $5 and a bunch to choose from. Even better if we could swap it like swapping clothing. Maybe I normally run black but at a queen fight I swap on hunter orange for lolz.
---
Maybe some decent wallpaper? Different roofs. Windows that aren’t broken. A toilet that is pristine. 
---
Ok, I’m off track. Most of these are items I just want in the game. I can think of a hundred camp items that should be added. If I can craft a fusion generator I should be able to fix a toilet seat. That’s all I’m saying.
---
I saw one that was off center yesterday at Whitesprings that took out three different camps. It was pretty impressive placement.
---
This is hilarious!!!! Well done!
---
Yeah everybody has been saying to use a lever-action which would have been my last guess. Super good to know, and I appreciate your in-depth explanation.
---
Me too! I wish there were a dance emote, so's I could make the treaters do a jig.

Last day
---
Search the petrified corpses
---
No fork knife dances please.
---
Because it wasn’t done in fallout 4 or before FO76 launch so they don’t want to take time to make new stuff rather than rip old assists to sell
---
I’m talking about the item just getting deleted
---
Meat hook only is better when combined with the one handed perks, I dont believe that's what he's asking
---
Or that...
---
I'd like to be able to fill out the Whitespring Bunker with NPCs doing busy work on the terminals and (maybe) see some wastelander getting brought in for questioning in the prison section of the bunker. Maybe an animated thing or just have them sit there bloody and bruised.
---
Also, ADD THE ABILITY TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT! We know it was supposed to be in game if we look at the wiki and game files, so maybe that will be included finally?
---
I'd also like outfits and stuff to have them become soldiers instead of just operatives.
---
On grenades and mines yes. It means you can throw a grenade, immediately vats, wait for it be flying into/over the enemy and shoot to blow it up immediately. They don't have a chance to run.
---
You can also VATS creatures. Helps to not waste ammo on those fast moving creatures.
---
Definitely subjective but the DCG feels like it swings a little faster. I never have noticed a difference between puncturing PF and DCG when I have checked.
---
I was looking for this information myself the other day and someone mentioned on an old thread that the DCG used to have some built in AA effect. 
---
I feel like I've also seen some mention in past threads that once your smg gets high enough it sort of rolls over the DR on enemies. I don't think it matters at all except for queen and when I checked I got the same dmg using those two.
---
As noted you can get higher with meat hook. But you have to give up all the convenience perks. I just stick to DCG for similar damage and style preference.
---
My first game ever, I was honestly worried/preparing that as soon as we won as a team, it would be a sudden 4 person death match.
---
What goes around. Comes around goes around and comes all the waaaaay Baaack  aaaround
---
I don’t have the same username here, as Ashes2007 was already taken so it’s CyanAshes2007. Poor dude that just got messaged randomly
---
That's a splendid name, I'll definitely add you
---
1000 free scrip for everyone! yeah right.  Will be interesting to see what might appear in the Atom Shop...
---
The main reason I take workshops at any level is to induce PVP! Occasionally I actually need some fusion cores, but even then I'm crouched in a corner hoping someone will come to fight.
---
OH NO!!! NOT STEEL AND WOOD DUPES!!!!!!!!   
---
Seriously this is how you clowns sound. It is a bug it will be fixed, and since you can only "dupe" thrown objects like cleavers and mines it is not much of a dupe. Weapons dupes have been getting patched out super fast and this is the last one that has been known by the group. So effectively for nearly two months dupes have died.   
---
Don't get me wrong people are still trying to find some but at least on consoles dupes are dead and that is a great thing.
---
That sounds awesome. And thanks for always launching a zillion nuked in the morning, I feel like I always end up on the same server as you.
---
Laments "lack of depth" after checking Wiki for location items . . .
---
I think I see the problem here 🤔
---
And there goes my hopes of the private servers being able to fix this mess i was hoping for mods and all that good stuff but with BSG holding the reins i'm guessing that your not going to have access to the stuff that would needed to be modded in order for stuff to be properly integrated. 
---
(also mods can be skins and why would BSG allow 3rd party skins to be given away for free)
---
I don't know, I thought that a lot of people wouldn't buy into it, but it seems that every round of content I see suddenly see it everywhere being used by half of everyone.
---
*Liberty Prime PA, I'm looking at you.*
---
I can help, i need  the same on my other character.
---
I'm enjoying it a lot right now.
---
What I plan to do this Halloween is go camp to camp. If the camp I visit is cool or at least has Halloween decor, I'll leave them candy! Otherwise, they get to enjoy a brown paper bag full of toilet paper
---
i need to revive someone as well 
---
add me on psn with 'fo76' in request please 
---
Owl_No
---
&gt;The refrigerator and collectron are not single use. They must have sold exceptionally well.
---
I'd guess that at least 8 out 10 camps I visit have a collectron and/or fridge
---
I sent you the msg here on Reddit, does that message go to the wrong person?
---
I ran to the center of the circle and watched for the nuke and followed it till it came down on my head instant achievement
---
I second this. It's the whole reason it happens. I know exactly what time is the changeover everyday and if I'm in a nuclear winter, I will literally just close down fallout 76 a couple minutes before.
---
Bloodied Swing Speed Deathclaw gauntlet or Meat Hook.
---
Shoot people and don't get shot.
---
I got into the enclave by sneaking past a few level 40-50 deathclaws. I think there were 2 or 3 of them, but I snuck past them. Including into their nests to get a specific item XD.
---
Your answer? Stealth. Use stealth.
---
+ karma
---
:)
---
Yeah and these games allow for great admin controls so making private servers really your own
---
Got all sweaty doing this and had to hit the showers after! https://imgur.com/a/Gdr78Z0
---
Same. With unyielding armor, sneak 2, and ninja I'm right in her face smacking away and never go out of caution. She will do the wing swipe but only very rarely does she actually connect. Once in a while you will find a server where sneak is not working for some reason but for the most part I rarely take any damage right up in her face because she doesn't know I'm there. 
---
Generally when I die it's from a poison attack from an add that's attacking someone nearby.
---
Is that glitch really still around?
---
I prefer the DCG over the PF because of the silly noise the PF makes.
---
 I have two in my stash I got from Robco's kitchen and the vendor at the Ski Resort.  No reason to keep them, but I do anyway.
---
I'm on ps4 and I think I've only had it happen to me like twice in ALOT of games. I think you were just unlucky to get such a douche
---
radshield works great and the lead lined backpack mod is equally as effective.  If you have one piece of rad resist armor or a set of trapper or marine armor a simple rad-x diluted will suffice.
---
Well I'm majority talking about skills to take
---
They were pretty quick last time I opened a ticket, turnaround was less than 2 hours, including answering a followup question.
---
Quite agree, for most part.
---
Players who play a lot, have to come up with their own thing to do(in the game). If you want to rely on Bethesda giving you things to do, you run out months ago already. 
---
The game would have to be subscription based for Bethesda having the money to constantly bring out large content to play. It isn't so there's that.
---
And neither is it hardcore grinding MMO like there is plenty of, where you have to play a lot and long, to have "endgame" gear.
---
Live service doesn't really mean much. It's too broad concept.
---
Don’t shot her in the air. Please. Just wait. She will land.
---
With one-handed, you're likely best off focusing on stealth and speed because you simply can't get the power you do from two-handed or unarmed, so you want to get as many hits in as quickly as possible. Bloodied or Junkies would be two routes you could go to maximize the damage.
---
Ah, no, I haven’t received it though.
---
Welcome to Appalachia! If you’re on Xbox and ever want a high level escort, hit me up if I’m online! GT is Splaishe
---
Go unarmed, if you do anything.
---
The machines aren’t the only way. One spawns on a certain rooftop. I always check when I clear that spot, and then drop it in my vendor.
---
Now you just have to tame yourself a guard cat to watch the candy for you while you're gone.
---
Become the Bush master, be one with the Bush, know it's shapes and sizes and it shall look after you
---
Technically the DC gauntlet Is unarmed so go with the meathook since it double dips other than the meathook all one handed  melee sucks dmg wise regardless of perks 
---
Edited
---
Like on the ammo counter? Nice idea. I’d also like the ability to see how much of all the types of ammo I have while I’m creating it. Also, the ability to break it down.
---
I feel like the Fist animation slows you down your swing in high lag areas like queen fights as well.
---
Tagging them like this is pointless.  Its their job to read all the posts and comments here.  If they were going to say something they would. 
---
I see people tag them a lot and think of writing this everytime; sorry if it seems like I'm calling you out specifically.
---
Thanks. His name is Zippy. *Zippy will do anything for caps*.

I run with a bloody black powder rifle with my bloodied rifleman build im putting out around 1100 at 10 percent health one shot on everything exept scorchbeast and queen plus a couple big bosses speed demon helps with the lengthy reload
---
I really do not see how being able to repair your weapon where you are instead of going to your base is really a pay to win situation..... It really does not make a difference..... I'm not trying to be rude just my opinion.
---
I use the ultilty items when im on the go without supplies to repair nothing wrong with using atoms we earn on something more useful than anything else in the store
---
I've been waiting to see a bloodied god roll bear arm in the wild as I'm curious what the damage numbers look like.
---
Essentially what i already do.
---
&gt;I spend $200,00 per month on scrap and repair kits
---
I, for one, will thank you then! 
---
There's suddenly nothing happening. I know they removed the constantly spawning events to help server performance but I'll totally take the slower server again for something to do.
---
And no. Not dogwood die off.
---
So would I use the meat hook and grab unarmed perks?
---
Feel free to use mine. It's a stealth melee build, centered around anti armor weapons, and perks. It doesn't use ALL the damage perks, but trust me, it doesn't need all of them. I melt shit.

Realistically long hair would be a huge disadvantage in the wasteland wouldn’t it ?
---
I sent it as a chat, from your name on the sub here. Check that chat icon next to the envelope under directs.
---
That never happened.
---
So...new glow in the dark Skeleton costume then? Or does the current one already glow?
---
&gt;all my characters have at least 15 repair kits. 
---
I've taken to dropping some of them as I found I was holding &gt; 50 advanced repair kits just from doing SBQ fights
---
Man you gotta launch so many bikes now
---
They aren't dead.... There is still a weapon duping method around.....
---
No sarcasm intended, quite a few people on here think I'm just moaning, but that wasn't the point. It's more a cry to Bethesda to pull their head out of their ass and commit to their plan, regular content to keep the game alive long term and players engaged. Instead they're letting it stagnate and I'm seeing many higher level players quitting through boredom. It's not about getting your monies worth, although I'll agree I have, by the time Wastelanders finally comes out it could well be too late, some will come back but many won't.
---
I love this game, it's sad to see it dying
---
Neither a fridge nor a robot that slowly collects random junk is an edge over other players.  There is food everywhere and junk is easy to get.  
---
Atoms are given for free from doing challenges so nothing is truly locked behind a pay wall.  
---
Stop with this "pay-to-win" BS
---
People are leaving because we thought wastelanders was coming soon and now its not coming until first quarter 2020, which could be as late as march.  Disappointed.
---
First Time? We have coffee and cookies.
---
It’s not about pay to win. It’s about pay for convenience
