I’m gonna sell common plans for super cheap so I can profit off of new players. If I ever start playing this game again
---
---
---
Yes, I think it's OK if someone initiates a capture attempt and it flags you as hostile just like the warning box tells you it will when you initially take a workshop. Not a fan of camp destruction myself, but that's one of the risks you run when you take workshops and lead a hostile entity home. You should be on guard and ready to dispatch threats. Someone tried this with me the other day and got slaughtered the second they went red.
---

---
&amp;#x200B;
---
The rest of your previous post was you re-explaining your terrible workshop replacement mechanics, so I'll just say "all of it."
---
Aren't all trailers cooler?
---
I did the exact same thing. Pew pew!
---
For me the worst is just server disconnects. I literally get one every half hour or so and it’s infuriating
---
Nice work.
---
I stopped by here a couple days ago and waved at you. I was the Level 170 on XB1 wearing imposter sheepsquatch armor.
---
I'm with you. I think it'll scrap your 3* and 2* and only issue you 1* worth of scrip. Because the testing team will only validate that it in fact issues scrip instead of doing min and max values.
---
You kidding? The problem is STILL the assassin sentinel build. If you're going bloodied, the concept of that is supposed to be high risk, high reward, but with sentinel and assassin as well as perk stacking, there's a little problem there: it no longer becomes high risk. It's no longer a stealth build when you can just sit there and wipe through PvE AND PvP without a problem. 40% DR from Assassin, 55% from Sentinel, 20% Lone Wanderer, 30% Dodgy, 45% Fireproof, need I go on? This shit is ridiculous. A Bloodied build should be exactly that: a person who's at the edge of death able to do put all out damage as much as they can before a stiff breeze hits their knees, breaking them and killing the player ultimately. Shouldn't have to try and sneak on the player as well as use a gamma gun just to get through it all, it's just dumb.
---
Thanx wil try
---
Nice. Tesla rifle, eh?
---
It’s like comparing the honeymoon to the marriage.   At first its all gunplay in the meadows.  But later on your two-shot explosive gets nerfed.
---
Take your pick from all the "bugs" they have patched before, lots to choose from.
---
Anytime :)

Yup. Thats about an hour before I will sign off.

They post it every Tuesday. It's on the r launcher

What does this vendor sell? And why do people want to build camps to block it from spawning?

I'm hoping I'll be able to offload some motion assist servo plans and ultra light marine plans for 10 caps a piece.
---
Water spouts!!!!!
---
Thanks for sharing this. Passed it onto FB people. Appropriate the info.
---
Ok, but I'm sure you,got other plans.
---
If she doesn't want to open herself up to attack, she has the option to not take a workshop. There's a confirmation box for a very good reason. The workshop system was intended to flag people for pvp if they own it and you try to capture it. At no point are geographical restrictions mentioned.
---
What kind of build are people running? I'm fighting people that are damn near invincible, they have a quarter health but never die
---
If it's a super rare plan, I'll charge thousands of caps for them. If it's uncommon, maybe about 200-500 caps. But majority of plans I end up giving to lower level players or stashing in places at train stations or Whitesprings.

Big Bend is pretty depressing. The final stand of the fire breathers only to be cornered by BoS, Raiders and Scorched.
---
Right? Throw on scrapper and you're set. I think I generally get close to 700.
---
My guess would be because there are other subs already dedicated to it.
---
Rad Away Recipe. Twice.
---
Huntersville's entire story is heartwrenching and I feel remorse killing those mutants.
---
I've died a few times to queens. The acid drops hp really fast sometimes and you don't notice it since there isn't really an animation for it.
---
&gt; But later on your two-shot explosive gets nerfed.
---
Are you still using the marriage metaphor? Cause I feel like my TSE got nerfed for sure.
---
Inpromptu fireworks displays for newbies. You can hide on top of V76, and when they pop oit, fire 5 flares off in celebration. Then, sneak behind them and launch 5 more when they find the overseer's camp.
---
Like?
---
Sad thing is, that's how WV is right now. Best of luck to you West Virginians.
---
Just like you said lol randomly shooting them off. I do it too lol. Also like in the wendigo cave I fired them off, helped see corners from afar.....that’s the only real time I used it for light.
---
Rubber from moleminer scrap

I got the rad shower on my first scorched earth SBQ completion.
---
What about bullets? Only allowed to sell 30 bullets?
---
made me think of Mario Bros and the castle. Thanks
---
Sweet! I got some plans I didn't already have, and have been looking for this guy for a LOOONNNGGG time. :) Wish I could give you karma for this. If I can and just didn't know it, plz let me know how!
---
Ones that will increase your critical shot multiplier and just overall sneak perks to stay hidden
---
I saw a level 100+ guy who was wanted, I believe because he was attacking someone else’s camp...
---
Ok
---
That's in Morgantown Airport.
---
Both of these instances there were still HP available as noted in the health bar. Sitting there dead while having 60-80 HP showing is what I'm talking about.
---
Less sad when you realize most of them became raiders.
---
Sorry meant sneak attack multiplier not critical shot multiplier. However critical shot does also help if you use vats a lot
---
Like ones that'll only take you a few moments to search out.
---
White spring always has both
---
nope.  went back to the bag thing for a while.   
---
seems like patience and waiting 6 months for adjustments might pay off.
---
Only at cqc range lol
---
It was just something for the people who want the game to burn to complain about and after people found out there not so bad especially the free ones they had no fire to throw fuel on
---
I'm not a melee build. Could you explain why it is that great compared to other BSS melee weapons?
---
Be careful though - if your camp is too big, you’ll receive a message when trying to place it saying that it’s floating.
---
Oh ok. In that case, I've had experiences where my game doesn't update people's health that are in my team of just constantly show them as dead. Could be something similar. I play with groups a less now so I don't know if anything has been fixed.
---
Not judging. People can build whatever they want. You said people were creative. I said lots of people build cubes and it is not creative.
---
Also has the cookcoo clocks plans.. but yea nothing amazing other then the coat and the clocks to me
---
PS4?
---
Meh I have 3* lvl one.  The definately exist, not sure where you are getting your info.
---
The chip system [which is a pc mod for 4] would be a great feature for all weapons, as crafted gear has way better durability!
---
Fallout 101 may get confused
---
It was less about the improved kits, more about the principle of selling non-cosmetic items for real money when they said they never would. I doubt anyone is purchasing them though, given the regularity of improved kit drops from queen.
---
Woah Friendly Fire, i’m Guessing it would just flood the discussions page as well.
---
You wanted to!
---
Absolutely nothing 🎶
---
Fucked the weight of them up through multiple updates.
---
Thats what i thougt would happen because how is it exactly gonna fit in another place..wil try tomorrow,ty
---
That what I was waiting for. Thank you. But still hoping someone has something rare or useful it does.
---
I'm assuming that they increased the weight of them?
---
Other than pointless trying to light up caves, I honestly see no major benefit for them, sadly.
---
105
---
Like 50,000 caps lmao
---
He loves you 300.
---
Get good doggy and a run @ watonga for dog food,there like stimpacks also with the doggy perk
---
This has helped me out so much. Have it saved to share on with other of my fellow vault dwellers! Thank you!!!
---
What kinda bullshit is this? This is literally all games. Is there no end to the 76 hate?
---
You're right, that response was harsh. I apologize for it.
---
You're right, it would flood page. The problem is that we can't even link to those hubs. It's what the mods here have stated and we must abide by if we want to hang around.
---
If you're interested, just look through my profile. I deal with one hub only and, so far, it seems to be pretty good. That's the best I can do and I hope it helps.
---
Welcome back,,,,
---
PSN aj ninetyeight 
---
(w/ mic)
---
And I obviously didn’t mean everyone in the Fallout 76 universe builds amazing and creative CAMPs. Some people do; some people don’t. It’s called generalizations.
---
By the way: You didn’t need to interject your opinion in a positive post. 🙃 Let the community have nice things, yeah?
---
Sorry I don't remember, I just noticed that when I went to 76 fertile soil started starting again and I was stoked. Probably the first time that's been said. :P
---
You mixed up the OP and commenter.  The OP is asking if his neighbor is using the brick building.
---
I linked him in the imgur post with proper credit!
---
118. Ran into a level 330-something last night or the night before.
---

---
I did complete the Camden event though
---
Your first born.... no but seriously, explosive energy weapons are legacy weapons. Since they no longer drop as loot in game, prices are ridiculous now. They hardly sell for caps, if they do, its 50k+ meaning you'd need at least 2 accounts and a whole lot of trust with the seller. Mostly they are used for high end trading pieces. You'll need a legacy weapon of your own to trade or one or more of those god rolls on 3 star legendary weapons to use as bargaining pieces.
---
That is way overpriced
---
567
---
Level 68 supermutants have 700 HP and 135 DR. If you get the paper damage above 6.5xDR then it's unmodified, so Tank Killer + 350 damage + 2x sneak bonus should be a one-shot. 
---
Sanity check: Do you actually deal more damage with sneak with the explosive weapon? Checking whether it's sneak or instigating that's not working.
---
Increased them inadvertently with an update after an earlier updated reduced the weight to realistic levels.
---
I’ve been lucky enough to never be griefed. Glad this update is coming.
---
Damn im working,lately there not many nukes on xbox...
---
Or fast travel...
---
I can respect this lol.
---
I’ll have to find the name when I get back from Michigan or can log in some how
---
There are plans that should make camp placement easier however I think most people who put time in building their camp don't intend to move it, often choosing the location has equal amount of time put into it. 
---
My current playthroughs I designed my camp to be easily placed, ie only one contact point with the ground. Yeah people hate these camps but it's only while I'm going through the story. I have already decided where one of my characters permanent camp will be placed. 
---
My first character has a permanent base for the time being. I woefully ran out of build budget with it not adequately decorated. However I did build it using a glitch that has been patched, stacking foundations, so if I move it it's gone forever.
---
Definitely deal more damage with sneak. 
---
The problem I'm having is I'm dealing about 75% damage on my first hit. But I think that's just my non instigating damage.
---
PAY TO WIN
---
I hope lots of people do that with shotgun ammo.
---
I bought a 3* TSE Telsa rifle a couple months ago for IIRC 9k and at the time that was ridiculously high, but I wanted it, cuz I knew with the nerf with the TSE weapons, I'll never find again. I luv that weapon, it's my beast.
---
So glad there’s been a response like this to my reply!
---
Another idea I had that would be fucking insane was if there was an event that spawned on various parts of the map that had, let’s say, a guaranteed 3 star bullet sponge ISH legendary.
---
While the event is happening / aka while the legendary is alive, PVP is disabled (just like any event in survival). Once the legendary is killed however, everyone can loot it but the legendary it drops ISNT instanced.
---
Only one person can get the legendary and once the event is over, PVP is enabled and everyone is allowed to kill each other and ostensibly loot the corpse of the person who looted the legendary and take (in addition to some AID And junk) the legendary item itself if its worth it for them to take it. 
---
That person then either dies or has to survive for an allotted amount of time and will be marked on map and in order to keep the legendary drop has to basically play keep away until his marker disappears.
---
maybe the item will be something that that person needs so it’ll be in their interest to run and survive or stay and fight for it. 
---
I think an optional event like this would add a little bit of a “classier” (is that the right word? Haha) reason to PVP outside of just random grieving at train stations.
---
As Todd said way in the beginning  “why not turn other players into interesting content”?
---
Also btw any of the like minded bros who responded here if you’re on PSN I’d love to run survival with yall!
---
That joke was pretty funny on day one lol
---
did you forget about fast travel?
---
Shielded raider underarmor
---
Awesome. The raider lives on!
---
I said "as well", implying that I agree that there are people who create good looking CAMPS. I just wanted to say that besides the creative CAMPS, there are also a lot of ugly cubes.
---
130ish, but I've seen players at 400+ online before.
---
117
---
Everyone knows that and has seen bare-bones CAMPs. Still didn’t need your opinion about it.
---
Which road??
---
+karma
---
Well honestly the trailer just raised a bunch of questions that the game answered in an unsatisfactory way.  But the trailer really got me that hyped.  Curious yes, excited, no.
---
The one leading into it, southern most road.
---
157 here.
---
 Just did the imposter event with a 300+ player.
---
Nah. Game is fun af for me
---
Alright, but you do know you are posting on an online forum right? People might respond to the things you say. It's called communication. Might happen in real life as well!
---
I have noticed that to. Maybe everyone is getting ready for the new update tomorrow. I for one don’t launch a lot of nukes. But I try to post any I see when playing. But for me tomorrow is all the new content.
---
But accurate. Explosive Tesla are legacy now.
---
Level 181, 325 hours in. I have seen level 600+ players
---
my advice is skip school and play your heart out. i am not being sarcastic.
---
I'm only 88, but I've seen 373.
---
I'm not so sure.
---
This was asked a while back and most responses i saw then were - 
---
"Use it as bat signal, if we see your flare we will drop what we're doing and run to your aid! " 
---
Unfortunately I never heard back from anyone indicating it actually worked though. :(
---
I agree with you here. However in their mind if they have a mode (as maybe a 3rd mode separate from survival and adventure) that turns out being full on battle royale and it becomes popular WITHOUT affecting the people who enjoy the base adventure mode, I think it would only help the game overall.
---
I actually says 1) The vendor bot spawns in places other than Chaleston, 2) You can farm those places just as easily, and 3) because of these two things, wrecking what is a common camp location because they're "blocking the spawn" is a shitty thing to do because there are other spawn points just as good.
---
Yeah, and I’d probably say the same thing to you too if you kept arguing with me in real life. I mean you can probably imagine it: A group of people super excited about seeing interesting and creative CAMPs, and then along comes Negative Nancy you with “lots of cubes too.” Way to kill the mood, bro.
---
Not always.  Red Dead Redemption 2 was pretty underwhelming to me, but I ended up enjoying the game a lot.  Fallout 76 did not excite me, just left me with questions that the game later answered in a way that didn't satisfy me.
---
I would love to see a dev or community leader pop in here and say something like well maybe in patch 10 something cool is coming.
---
I spent today remodeling my camp to remove a level (it was a 3-story 4x4 square) to free up budget space.  
---
I'll be setting the doors to "open" to welcome new visitors.  I've done that in the past, but only very rarely, especially since I put in the decon shower.
---
I have also found the Vendorbot on the road that passes south from Flatwoods and under that big ass bridge. Was shocked as hell, it was within render distance and sight of the Red Rocket in town.
---
Unless your turrets fire on a wanted person?
---
If they delay this tomorrow it will be an absolute shit show.
---
Worked perfectly. Thanks again
---
Spongebob season 8 episode 154a. All my CAMP ideas are inspired by spongebob.
---
No problem
---
I was being sarcastic
---
Ryan Gosling and Freddie Mercury have a synth child in the wasteland? Don’t tell me you don’t see it lol
---
I will thx for the help.
---
Very clever, love the interior and the garage doors.  Well done all around!
---
Could run a [Monty Hall/Let's Make](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Hall_problem) a Deal game with three doors, one of which hides the winning object. Be aware that the game can be skewed in favor of the player based on their understanding of the probabilities. I actually had this set up for my main at once point, but had no easy way to attract guests so nothing came of it. Might try again with the vendor marking the location.
---
Idk. That "fall of 76" video is circulating around. It's idiotic that people are still obsessed about something that happened 6 months ago.
---
yea I have AAE tesla on xbox and I don't think i could let that thing go for any amount of caps would have to be an amazing trade
---
Man, I am not coming to see that unless you lower your gas prices!
---
That be pretty neat. Shoot flare, send out server wide message *Fellow vaultdweller in trouble!* 
---
It could be like an event, you'd join and help the player survive whatever he's up to. I'm sure their would be more to it to make it work, but that would be the basic idea.
---
Me too!  😁
---
Yeah
---
I think I've had 1 crash in the past 2 weeks? What kind of hardware are you running? What settings do you have?
---
That's too bad.  I haven't had that many crashes.  One when I died at the sheepsquach imposter and didn't get to finish it.
---
Isn’t there also Elder?
---
This makes me want to try out the game again. The last time I did this was about a month ago, and I pasted 10 minutes.
---
Between this and Anthem, I'm pretty bitter.
---
I'm dreading the golf club after I can't level turret camps.
---
Fr sent.
---
Trade value is around 25k now, pushing into caps-only.

I can't find you 🤷🏻‍♀️
---
I saw a 785 farming West Tek a couple days ago on PS4. Insanity....
---
I played resident evil 2 remake for a few days, beat it under Leon and Claire. That kinda made things better when I got back on fallout. But like today, I got off at 6, wife and son are out of town and instead of playing I’m sitting on my balcony smoking cigarettes scanning through all this. I don’t know man maybe it’s just a “worn out” faze I’m in right now. Take a break, see the real world for a few days or something, you’ll get that itch back

Hunters long coat, clean outfits, and horseman’s outfit
---
He has potential for some rare outfits, like different colors of the Ski Suit or the coveted Hunter's Long Coat. Don't remember if he sells Responder Fireman gear or if that's strictly an event drop.

Is there a specific day each week the inside the vault article releases on?
---
Yep on Thursday :)
---
What kind of speaker do you have? Is it a standalone speaker or speaker from the monitor?
---
Where do you plug the speaker?
---
I think it is definitely not a problem with your directx nor antivirus.
---
My assumption is that you have the speaker plug into the motherboard (uhd 630). But, when the game starts, the BIOS (setting in the motherboard) changed it to HDMI plug of 1050 Ti. It happens sometimes on 1050 Ti. The solution is to disable the sound for HDMI monitor or change the BIOS setting for sound card to auto.
---
Honestly, if they don't I'm just going to install a camp there with missile turrets and vending machines that only sell salt.
---
Me too. No issues on mine.
---
Thanks!
---
Thank you!
---
I got a friend who's lvl 455.
---
Yes happened to me yesterday on XB1, didn't get the Atoms, got screwed out of 30 atoms, thanks Bethesda. Tried to do the challenges anyway but didn't get the rewards ..
---
Well the hardcore just want to know where your camp is so the moment they know where it is its all over for you and your camp.. They will just keep tabs on you until you slip up and claim a ws and destroy over and over again until you find what account they are using to server hop to you and usually they have multiple accounts for that and block those accounts or relocate your camp after it being leveled every time.. All I know I will not be using player vending until that is fixed
---
Now I'm just thinking about a SBQ shooting at me in flight with a legendary pipe rifle rather than that cancer screech
---
I do this, I see others with their tse's shooting like crazy and it looks like a waste of time. Maybe shadow a melee and shoot everything once before they hit?
---
Uncommon. Not unusual.
---
For the most part, just pick a new location and all your stuff comes along.  If you ran out of camp budget, it likely would have stopped you from adding to it. 
---
I tend to build on mountainsides. So that means my camps don’t relocate well. I like building, so I don’t mind taking it down, storing piece by piece and make something specific to the new aria.
---
I love this, very well done
---
Just lead a pack of monsters over to the offending camps.
---
Agreed
---
I’ll add you on PS4 sometime :) I never really get to play with anyone
---
I really want to move my camp from the railway framing with the junk spot because it’s out in the middle of nowhere, but I guess I’ll wait till we find out what how cool the vending is going to be. No one is going to want my common recipes and two-shot Who Gives a Phuck’s lol.
---
The BOS recruited him and changed his name to Phoenix. Lol
---
It is a rare-ish drop from regulars, usually level 80s. These are smart drops so once you learn that plan, they will never drop again on that character. If you want to grab a decent amount of these plans you will have a better chance going to the nuke zone at fissue prime after SBQ is dead and force spawning them in the nuke zone.
---
be prepared for a sharp learning curve. it fustrating figuring out all the ludicrous quirks but rewarding when done

I just want white power armor.  Absolutely shameful that they don't have basic colors as a default customization...

I doubt it, when they postponed the camera and player vending before they at least gave us a few days heads up in advance. Although the camera has a pretty big problem despite being postponed, soo...

---
172. I've seen a level 500 in the last week or so.
---
It doesn't look good. As soon as they announced there was a further fix to be done a week or so ago I started planning a new build. Looking to run with a AAE 50 Cal as heavy weapons are the only other category that interest me. Using power armour is going to be weird though...
---
"You free-lancers have tools for everything"
---
It all depends on your build on what to look for armor wise. I like to farm ghouls with my melee build character so I look for gear with ghoul bonus effects. My main weapon is a chinese officer sword with str, limb dmg vampire effects. I can one shot ghouls quite easily. I don't really know what you should look out for for your character besides looking for easy farm locations with little player interaction so you can get better starred gear. 
---
I would ditch power armor as soon as you can unless you need it for specific builds or situations like rad/nuke storm.
---
Seriously, I’m scared to preorder games anymore.
---
its a mirror but this game handles mirrors like hot garbage. my friemd got the fancy mirror from the whitesprings vendor and he was really upset because it looks like a foggy peice of metal
---
I think Ever Upwards drops tomorrow. I have seen people saying they had a newsletter as well stating the purveyor was dropping on the 16th not the 24th.  I haven't seen any confirmation on that though.  
---
I wonder if the Arktos Pharmacy mission is related to the Ever Upwards quest?

Before the haters come on!  We had a team of 4 collecting code pieces, and in the silo ready to go.  we're now working on Bravo.  Congrats to the other team who solved Alpha!
---
XB1 sorry I always forget lol
---
you've clearly never even attempted to solve.. We'd be happy to show you how!
---
Congrats guys!
---
We solved a silo in 24 minutes this week. If we had "datamined" it, all 3 codes would be posted instantly at reset. Stop trolling. People put real work into making these codes available to everyone in the community who wants to use them at the beginning of the work.
---
You can't fast travel while you're taking damage, there's punjie boards anywhere there isn't already a trap, and another trigger on the inside so there's no where safe to stand. Best chance you have is if you survive the traps going off 2+ times and they break.
---
Same, when are you typically on?1
---
Especially a scorchbeast.
---
I didn't preorder. I waited until launch, heard community feedback and developer responses, and decided to trust the developers.
---
No more. I am openly hostile to certain games now, and this is one of them. I enjoyed the game for less than a month.
---
Wow dude. I knew there were more of us !!! Love your camp !!
---
Backpacks would look silly on your backs though. So instead they should turn the backpacks into little dainty handbags for power armor, so they don't clip with the power armor. Could match them to your paint and everything.
---
Uhhhhh....ultracite to repair.
---
Took your criticism to-heart, check the same link in OP. First eight pictures reflect a new build. Still a floating-house, but fits well in the world around it. (genuinely unsure how to build at the new location without it floating, tbqh.)
---
Add me for some nukashines at my camp or anything else! PSN Cirdloc
---
My gatling gun does 330 dam at lvl 5 adrenaline. were it a bloody instead of vampire, it would do 500. it has 25% faster rate and a speedy barrel, it smokes SB in a timely manner. Ammo is not a big deal. i crafted 7000 today in a few hours.
---
I got my health below 20% with adrenal reaction and my pipe rifle is at 367 damage. So not bad.
---
Hahahaha thanks !!
---
It seems to decrease it a lot but I'm still getting the occasional issue. Perhaps it's more lag than anything.
---
I just soloed a sheepsqautch lol.
---
My beta is 130 and I won’t play it anymore, My main is 196 with 74 unused perk points lol
---
Camps can still get smacked around on survival right? Mine is going to look like a bus stop with a vending machine
---
Ya it was kinda sad the candy counter lady talking bout her kids and husband and everything. That one got me in the feels.
---
The bolt action pipe rifle gets all the damage increases. Right now mines damage is at 367.
---
Same. Either look for low level players on the map or leave them.in the flatwoods overseers cache
---
No need to remove rad resist from power armour and Hazmat suits, that's what they're designed for.
---
How long is the keycard from the vertibod active and do you have to shoot one down everytime you want to nuke?

Repairs for it are a pain in the ass, is my best guess. Takes a lot of ultracite scrap. (Though if you don’t mind hitting glassed cavern every so often it’s perfectly doable.)
---
I got adrenal tonight and my rifle is sitting at 367. What else do you suggest I do?
---
Expensive to repair for me personally.
---
Hey I put a blaring Siren to attract new players in my house then drink in the Bowl only to find out they're going to teleport somewhere.
---
For now im putting a lot of Mountain Honey on it
---
With adrenal ny rifle is now at 367 damage.
---
You'd have to ask a mod.  They really should sticky an "Is this game worth buying" thread, and they should sticky a thread about the server being down for updates every time it's down.  When a big news item breaks, they should also actively monitor new threads to prevent the same thing being posted over and over and over and over and over again for a day or two straight.
---
But I imagine they have lives and they're busy.
---
If I'm not spotted by an enemy yet I use a flare gun as a distraction. They usually look and head in that direction but no more than one or two shots or they will get you. Very useful for lower levels trying to evade a scorchbeast.
---
revolver as well. i 1 shotted lvl 50 SB with a 3.5x crit headshot
---
Repair kits turned out to be perfectly reasonable and the outrage manufactured by the same YouTubers that get these idiots riled up every time
---
Furious explosive 10mm smg
---
It's actually not the best in any stat. It's very well rounded but the X-01 has better radiation resistance and the T-51b has better physical and  energy resistance. Honestly depending upon the situation the only three you should be using are the T51b, X01 and Excavator armor. X01 for rad zone farming T51b for general use, and Excavator for carry weight and mining.
---
Usually about 1am uk time zone
---
I've run all 3 and I agree. The enemies are harder but the path is more controllable and predictable by far.
---
Wouldn't hte metal just... dissolve with the rock?
---
I don't wear any power armor. It's all bad. With the right perk cards, mutations, and a good set of 3 star vanguard armor, I'm sitting at more defense than most power armor, and as a plus  I don't need to haul batteries around, AND I get all sorts of legendary effects PA users don't. In fact, with the weight reduction stats on my armor, I carry WAY more than power armor let's me. (For those unaware, power armor doesn't let your basic armor effects do anything) So outside of a nuke zone, it's completely useless to most folk with good builds, and decent gear.
---
I guess people forgot you can use improved repair kits(you get from the queen) to repair power armour. I think the main reason is because they didn't have any paint for it. They do have paint for it now though.
---
This explains why I find so much cool shit that way
---
I honestly think the decision was made to exclude PA because they couldn’t code it properly. Think about all the different outfits that there have been that clip and show outside the armor. They obviously have issues with coding anything that isn’t a skin. Now, what they should’ve done is allow your character to have it on inside the armor. Problem solved. You get in, it disappears. You get out, it’s on your back.

---
The keycards do not expire once you get them. And yes you would need to call in a vertibot from the enclave if you don’t have a keycard. But there very easy to deal with.
---
I love how you incorporated that cobblestone wall into your build ❤️
---
If no one answers here, try this sub: r/fo76filthycasuals
---
People get way too deep into this game.
---
They are pretty useless. The flares don't stay in the sky long enough for people to actually see them. 
---
I carry one because I occasionally like to signal allies, but they can usually see you on the map anyway. 
---
It would be good if they put a temporary blip on the map, or you could shoot them at people to blur their vision or something.
---
I enjoy survival for the tension even though most people shoot on sight.. but I have most of my deaths from visiting other camps just to check them out and the owner stopping by to murder me.
---
I too look forward to lurking at other camps.
---
To me, that's not an excuse, with regards to coding. There are several mods that made it possible to have backpacks on power armor, cosmetically and functionally, for Fallout 4. Not to mention, nearly all power armors share the same back models due to the frame, there would be very little concern for clipping when compared to regular armors.
---
Thanx

You are probably thinking of the “Personal Matters” quest. Which is similar, but different.
---
Most likely it's gonna be released just like the burrows so probably the week or second week after watch 9.
---
get a bloody rifle. handmade preferably, get all 9 rifleman. adrenalinex5 bloody messx3, covert op x3, mr sandman x3, tank killer x2, (the vats body part one) x1, and glowsight x3, if you can get a +10% aim bonus that'd be cool on the rifle. also, four leaf clover x3, better crits x3. 
---
a bloody weapon is for critting, an instigating weapon is for one shotting things.
---
Sure, pass the Tick Blood Tequila.
---
based on post title, if you read further, that’s your own damn fault.
---
Exactly, 
---
You know how if you boil salt water the salt crystalizes out, same idea, but with metal and acid.
---
Same idea as electroplating.
---
What's your gt?
---
Hopefully they fixed the error where slap damage exists after events in Adventure mode!
---
Donno what you are playing on but maybe a hard reset to your console or pc will help. I've found its cleared up other issues I've had.
---
Same as here Jjinsaru
---
I accidentally made my camp up by him, before I realized he was there. (I really just wanted to make a Cliffside camp) so now he technically  has a home, i even put a moo moo by him so he has company when I'm not home.
---
Don't you remember those sentient mannequins from Skyrim?
---
Todd bless you my friend!
---
Idk if it's just me, but they can't even get 75% of the scorched to use the right weapons for what they drop lol.
---
Water is abundant.  But if you're going for a food market,  try hoarding the non perishable foods like fancy lard snack cakes and potato crisps.  Ionized meat also doesnt spoil. Nor do gum drops, nuka colas or alcoholic beverages.
---
I was thinking more Nu-Metal, with that Limp Bizkit smirk..
---
What platform are you on?
---
I guess it’s pretty simple: “HOW 76 IS FAILING” = views and likes?
---
Xbox 1
---
I used to have one really crappy level 1 legendary (something useless like a security baton or switchblade) that I got from a level 3 three star legendary ghoul.
---
Stuff like this does give me ideas.  🤠
---
Oh it wasn't tech glitches. It was much more sinister than that. Check the computers around the inside of whitesprings and the enclave.
---
I've used them several times to call people into an area. Used to get help sometimes when I was new, and newbies will generally come to one, so it's good to give junk away, also I have a wonderful story about my favorite bounty I was hired for, involving several mines, a flare gun, and a leveled base. Flare guns make a loud *POP when they go off, so I snuck into this guys base, dude left his door open like a knobhead, and I set a few mines at the base of his stairs. My teammate proceeds to set some as well, and we sneak back out, I begin my recording, and fire the flare right above this guys window, he freaks out, takes a potshot at my team member as she runs around super obvious so he would see her, initiating slap, she ducks behind a tree, he runs downstairs, and BOOM! Plasma flies everywhere, his base is obliterated,  he's dead, we are laughing our asses off, the explosion killed my friend, and we made a solid 2k for griefing a griefer. TLDR: they are ok for their base use, but my God are they perfect for shenanigans.
---
Lol as a 28 year old I understand completely. 
---
As an anti-social mostly solo player who’s only remaining achievement to acquire is “Revive 20 players”... I understand that too. 
---
I’m on Xbox..
---
I’m really looking forward to this. For me at least, it’s more about seeing CAMPs and interacting with other players/characters than actually needing the things I’ll buy.
---
Pretty sure he ended up in a vault though if you read through the computer. If you're talking about the one in the side quest. Kid was kinda of a jerk. I feel more sorry for his uncle in that story line.
---
Still haven’t tracked the bugger down yet and I am dying to obtain that coat. 😫
---
I'm not a football fan either. The reason for the theme is that the real-world device the President carries is called "The Football". Hence the puns. The core loop here is actually CTF.
---
His uncle kidnapped him, and held him hostage at the dam.
---
SpartanB694
---
Yeah, it's a mod. I don't remember the name right now, but it deals a small amount of damage over time.
---
Not sure. I'll keep grinding it
---
Mine is SpartanB694
---
Thanks for the offer! (But I’m on Xbox unfortunately.)
---
I’m just looking for a new thing to grind, not any outfits or paints in particular, and was worried I might have a BoS big, and of course this thread ranked high when I searched. Good stuff here!
---
With Butchers Bounty you can “search” kills that you didn’t tag too!
---
I normally see him spawn from the Bot Stop nearby, while his entourage spawns near the building and mosies over to him.
---
Yeah.
---
Right now, with my Instigating Meat Hook, I can basically down a Glowing Deathclaw in a hit or two.  Doesn't quite live up to its reputation.  Now, the Sheepsquatch has a much deeper HP pool, which allows it to survive long enough to attack you in various ways, but it is kind of slow about it.  That same HP pool and a relentless Deathclaw?  Oh yeah, that could be fun.
---
Thats a good idea, I dont understand how mules work unless you own two copies though.
---
There’s a whole bunch around the WS entrance, the welcome sign, the central landscape and also outside the fence to the north and east of the property. They didn’t make the color glow as much as blast berries, that’s probably why you didn’t see them, the dark red doesn’t stand out in the orangy nuked atmosphere.
---
Yeah - I get the same thing. It's unpredictable. 
---
Can run well then freeze up over nothing.
---
Sounds like it's going to be locked to each character not by account. Also I'm waiting until the inside the vault on Thursday when we will learn how the purveyor will work. I'm only scrapping absolute junk, saving anything I may want to reroll
---
Responder bot in whitesprings usually has them all.
---
At least until Thursday when we see if we will be able to re roll at all
---
Camden Park responder I think, also the one in Grafton
---
It would  not work with the way the multiplayer loot system is integrated.
---
And my dog
---
Hard to find mods for it (IE they don’t exist outside of finding players who’ve learned plans. Which mostly only drop off the queen. And the nice ones plans are incredibly rare. And jetpack may not even exist?)
---
 Very few paints (there’s *one* now). 
---
Expensive repairs. 
---
Nothing exceptional about it innately (no, it doesn’t have the best defenses).
---
I'll add you tomorrow
---
go to lady janets soft serve run down the road toward the bus on its side and a random event will spawn sometimes the vendor apears its it's much better than the Charleston train station because nobody puts camps near the spawn
---
My first SBQ I got the marine wetsuit and helmet plus plans for the T-51b jetpack.
---
Can we get a map location?
---
A 500 cap bounty on my head
---
This kills any any purpose to playig an off-meta build and would open up a form of griefing.
---
Imagine wasting your life writing 500-word essay on a fucking virtual backpack.
---
yep got a syringer today
---
Does anyone happen to know what we will be able to sell in these things?
---
Friends
---
Or the more risky way, dump in a container and rejoin through the console menu
---
(Don’t think you can do that for PC)
---
Instigating bloodied explosive dragon
---
Really? Got to test this. I used it as a distraction on PvP
---
As are missile launchers, Fatman, grenade launchers and every grenade in the game!
---
Same. Can’t wait to see what people come up with
---
then they should let me slap a backpack to my power armour instead of a torso mod
---
Not at all, creatures scale with players levels, a level 20 can go to WS and farm level 12 ghouls quick. But if they want to go to a boss battle and ‘tag’ a god tier reward they need to level up and fight harder.
---
It is the best way to get disease cures!
---
Nukashine?
---
If you're on PS4 I'd want to take a look through your recipes! I'm trying finish the challenge right now.
---
I'm guessing here, but maybe your armorer perk isn't high enough to actually craft it? But in saying that  your display would indicate that point by graying out that choice, and showing a pictogram of Armorer lvl5.
---
That being said, I'd be more than willing to settle on it still giving the weight despite not appearing on the armor.
---
Had to feral ghouls (sorry for not specifying)
---
Gamma emitter.
---
Wait, they are making camps immune? They are also putting them on the map? And they are making player vending? 
---
This game is about to get a lot better. Does this mean that these settings are for adventure mode and not for PVP Survival mode?
---
That’s bloody useful thanks!
---
Good on you, that's all they can ask.
---
Think of it like they're using their stimpaks
---
if you pick up weapons and frequently scrap them weight should not be an issue for the most part. also check your meds, most people i see have like 40+ radaway/radx. you dont need that much, sell it for hella caps and to reduce your weight TREMENDOUSLY
---
Thats clutch. Thanks bud
---
What's your ID? I'm game
---
I really hope scrip acts like caps its not in your inventory and has no weight
---
I have a Bloodied + FFR 10mm Sub. It's nice, but not the best weapon in the game.
---
Did it involve pictures?
---
What platform are you on
---
that's where i "borrowed" the idea from. perhaps it could work in a way that smarter characters can make better legendary gear then Dum-Dums. and say if you are under 5 INT you cannot install a chip (you could still take chems to be smart enough)
---
Ps4
---
I look for a player in the wild not moving, then I fast travel to a near by spot and run. Have found several with this method.
---
Thank you. The hero we deserve.
---
My shop always gets a lot of foot traffic because it’s interesting, and that’s before player vending. Gonna be busy tomorrow!
---
I tried to post a video but 1. I couldn’t post it and 2. It cut off the initial part where I fast traveled but I do have proof of me arriving in the vault and being confused
---
My 30+ intelligence character made a hyper durable set of heavy combat armor that was soo tempting to abandon legendaries for!
---
If 500 words is an essay then I must be back in middle school, took not even 15 minutes. But by all means, spending your time to respond in a nihilistic fashion seems like the best use of yours.
---
Press l2 in Build or edit Mode ( I forgot which )
---
did you fast travel to the event?
---
A shark that has wings can pick u up and launches you into a lake
---
Yea, that's what I would expect to happen if I didn't have enough perk ran, but it's not there at all.
---
I made mine into a fortress.
---
Shhhhhhhh. I live there
---
Just got it a few days ago.
---
That’s exactly what I did and I know that it has been reported that this event did it to a team of people before
---
Chip it
---
Alpha codes anyone? Me and my dad are trying to launch his first nuke and we’ve wasted 3 cards trying 2 different codes. We’re just sitting here. Help!
---
Ayyyyyyye tyvm 💗✌
---
If only~
---
Press L2 in build mode. You can lock the shutters, terminals, collectors, water purifiers...
---
Did you get it from MODUS?
---
I would spec into praying skill, rng is fickle.
---
You sound like me. I don’t mind helping a kid that just started out. I just don’t want to be stuck on the mic with them and I don’t want to be followed around because I decided to be nice for a change.
---
cant have an instigating and bloodied weapon. this guys a phoney
---
I'm pretty sure asbestos is a chest mod, not a limb mod. I have it on my marine chest. It makes me invulnerable to fire.
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/t/fallout-76-nuke-codes/ Try here!
---
Except then a higher level player with a god tier weapon could just tag everything. Not every part of a game needs to be competitive.
---
MODUS is the only place you can get it.
---
Just got it yesterday however I'm sticking with Excavator for now for the carry weight alone.
---
I'm so trash at building I love seeing other people's camps and stealing ideas lol
---
Like im saying did he trade it from someone or did he buy it from MODUS
---
Thanks guys
---
5,1,4,2,3
---
Thanks
---
ammo is 3 caps for the cheapest from a robot, i doubt they'll let you sell em less than 1c/e.
---
no theres a separate one in intelligence. but they dont really need it. power armor breaks incredibly slowly
---
No. The perk you want is "Power Patcher" under Intelligence.
---
Lol I’m literally debating right now whether or not to move from Far East Mire to something less Hobo in the Woods.
---
I'm sure it's much like the vendor bots we use now. There will no doubt for me at least that there is a slider for amounts.
---
Haha yea I know you can't have that together I was gonna see your reaction is all they're all different but no the most lucky I had was a vanguard sentinel heavy combat chest piece
---
Thank you so much for the answer!
---
The second one was a TSE with faster movement speed dragon
---
Glowing meat.
---
I still have both
---
Can I do vocals?
---
I mean, mines a field hospital type look using tents and etc. Changed it to that because I’m playing as a medic as my newest build for my team and players at events. Tbh any camp looks good as long as it isn’t 10 stairs going into the sky connecting to a flat wood foundation surface xD.
---
You know what, I agree wholeheartedly
---
What they could do is sell basic colors like black, white, red, and more on the atomic shop and implement a custom paint job section with a color wheel when we go into our power armor station to modify our power armor later on as a quality of life feature.
---
Yeah I think I found it in the airport once??
---
Friendly Responder Vendor Bots?
---
I don’t believe they exist.
---
I’ve never seen it at Charleston. I tried the soft serve place and found it after a few tries.
---
It does actually exist. Most the time when I have issues getting it to spawn is because some idiot built their base over that pond by Charleston station... which prevents any random encounters from triggering there.
---
Camps are finally immune? I can now be happy
---
Directly north of whitespring station. You can see it from the deck, its just across the road!
---
Why does it have to be different for every player?
---
I think there may be an untapped market for low level legendary items. I stumbled on a lvl 5 chameleon chest piece and wore it til lvl 20 something. Even if you don’t charge all that much for it, you’re still tons better off than the sometimes literally one digit sales to vendors...
---
I have 3000 lbs on an alt mule lol
---
im up on a high cliff you'd have to climb to get to me lol. great view tho
---
legit got him first try with the longcoat, no server hopping needed... thanks!
---
Maybe I’ll focus my efforts there then, thanks.
---
Hmm, I don't have the chest plan, so that would explain why I don't see it. Am I supposed to be able to get chest mods from scrapping limbs?
---
If you sneak around a bit you can save ammo with head/crit shots.
---
Ive got a green house in the basement as well as 5 massive water purifiers. In in the ash heap becayse no one seems to collect junk in this area.
---
Watch Hachiko and after that get back here
---
Flee before my might puny mortals...
---
Sorry misstyped that, It was meant to be 45ish..
---
I couldn’t get the fucker to spawn ????  Just a responder eyebot. Dammit.
---
And what about the functions that the backpack can provide like storing food longer? Is that still working while in power armour? If not then this is another reason not to come back to fallout 76 when I'm able to.
---
The good thing about phantom devices is you can you use super duper when crafting them and get 2 out of one stealth boy, ideally. Obviously doesn’t happen every time but gotta save them caps somehow haha
---
Nice. I can do that but it probably takes longer. :p
---
I had a level 7 show up at my camp today while I was sitting inside. I think he didn’t realize that it was a player made camp and looked around a bit, I startled him (I had the Vault Girl devil head on), gave him a few gifts, and then he asked me to take a selfie with him and he left. Best day ever.
---
There's always the 'was it an arm, or a leg?' option. Check and see if you can craft them instead. And yeah, I know that comment might sound a bit snarky but it'd annoy me too if that happened to me. I'm old enough to admit these things happen more than I admit to. :D
---
230
---
Now I just hope they release metal rolling doors, its weird having to use either a brick or wood one for a metal compound
---
I live in a van down by the river.
---
Haha, I understand completely. I'm 99% sure it was arm, but I checked both arm and leg, and neither have it. I don't have the chest plan, and another user in this thread said he thought it was a chest mod. I had no idea you could get mods for another part than what you scrapped.
---

---
with an instigating rifle or bloody, this will annihilate anything
---
I bet your rolls are hot garbage noob
---
Can you lock him in?
---
Does this mean tamed animals at your came can't be destroyed either? I love my megasloth and dread the day someone comes along and kills him (even though he likes to spend most of his time inside my camp groaning).
---
I mean the people complaining can ask the mods. I couldn’t care less
---
It also occurs to me that claiming a workshop will open up your camp to destruction
---
I'm still the only one who hasn't gotten it I guess.
---
Can we get a machine for the CAMP? If we can I can probably just mass build machines and try my luck.
---
Yo dude this is sick, what’s your gamertag?
---
Yup
---
i think the PPP should grant +50% EXP for 2 hours. have it come in two types. "Fresh" and "Dirty" the only dirty one would be ones not found in the Machines and only gives +5%
---
Haha awesome. Months ago i awestruck a new player by giving him one.
---
He squeeled but i caved and told him you can find them on top of westtek
---
This is the only reason I’m excited about player vending. So I can find sweet builds.
---
Im not so good in this building thing,just put some walls and a roof with a deathclaw carpet that is
---
I bet i could! Chally milk for days.
---
As far as I know, as of Bethesda's post regarding this change, any functionality for the backpack would be unavailable while in power armor.
---
I'm not in that bad a place. It only costs a few caps from white springs train station.
---
Upvote for viability.   
---
I want a mix of colors.   
---
Everything black. Red lights on the X01  
---
Or everything black with white highlights.
---
Yes, he does. I server hopped all day and found him once there and 2 others at Lady Janet's Soft Serve. It took all day though, so don't give up.
---
My aesthetic is, as my flat mate notes, Mighty Mighty, a hipster bar in Wellington. Come relax on my chaise lounge and peer through the palms at my artwork....
---
How did it go?
---
Steam version is gonna get instant review bombed
---
Thats ridiculous man ... 3 star are prety rare , since it hasnt a 100% 3 star confirmed drop at least make they common as the single star are
---
Hahahaha. I thought everyone had found at least one of these.
---
In fallout 76 you can teleport from
---
Inside buildings
---
There's a piece of paper on a table in front of the Southern Belle Motel. The other begins at Toxic Larry's Meat n Go and a campsite right next to it.
---
Good luck.
---
I found him once in 4 hours of hops. And he didn't have the outfits. Rip.
---
So your best option is to quit Reddit and never come back, since it's terrible and all. Good luck in your endeavors!
---
I worked on mine for hours. I think it's worth it.
---
Can you trade power armour pieces with non atom shop paints? BOS paint for example
---
Yes, you can get all of the mods by scrapping limbs (so I'm told). It's cheaper that way too.
---
Someone else will need to fill you in on the trapper chest plan because idk. But keep your eyes out for a drop or at the vendors in case someone sells one. Then you can add the asbestos to it, unless you decide on another chest mod.
---
I’m sorry what’s the horseman’s outfit? Google doesn’t return anything for that
---
How do you rejoin the same server?
---
Lol, welp I've got bird bones for an agility boost, but you bring up a good point, more AP is always welcome... Feels like it's my limiting factor to just critting constantly.
---
Lol not going to lie I laughed pretty hard when I saw this
---
Its the long yellow coat with the fisherman net on it. Think that’s the name of it.
---
if you take a workshop after the patch be sure to shut down your vending machine first, so your camp won't be on the map. just don't go home until you relog.
---
If we’re talking genre, every post-apocalyptic movie I’ve ever seen also had all the humans living in harmony without conflict
---
Everything looks good with matte black. But to be honest, it'll lead to a boat ton of unique power armors and it'll give clans their choice to represent their colors.
---
Yeah. You're definitely going to be murdered, skinned, tanned, and worn in there.
---
Pretty sure that's happening tomorrow
---
So is it from those new miscellaneous quests they added over there? I went to toxic Larry’s on one character and didn’t get any plans. All I had to do was read some notes.
---
30 items or stacks.
---
Eh, it would be nice, but since I mostly refuse to spend money on atoms (Steam sales are on the horizon), I don't think it's that big of a deal.
---
I thought it was just no one could reprogram the and they booted people pit because their stay was up. It's more sinister?
---
Basically. But that's how views git got in the social media age. Happens with mainstream news, too. Not to get political, have a look at Fox News and MSNBC. All gloom, all the time, and sensationalist as hell, but they get the ratings. CSPAN, however, is rather boring by those standards, and I don't suspect has as much viewership.
---
So no PVP at all, unless you are on a PvP specific server?
---
Yes
---
that sounds pretty cool, id like it
---
Unless bought from another player
---
 The ONLY place you can get it from is from the modus/enclave bunker at whitesprings. In the military wing. And yes you can still get it and shocks for the x01. Just got to server hop a bit for them to show up
---
Shut your whore mouth!
---
Also a midwestern middle aged woman who builds two story brick houses. My last camp was two cabins and a barn, though. Still not very creative. I really wish they’d release more camp items or that there were mods available. I looooooove setting up camp but need more stuff.
---
\#13 Gatling plasma bug happens to me too...
---
I’m not saying this justifies the change (originally they said the functions would work in PA, the backpacks just wouldn’t be visible), but I imagine it’s 25% aesthetically motivated and 75% Atom Shop motivated. 
---
Easily 4 out of 5 players I see in the game are in PA at all times. I’m sure they asked themselves what the point of designing all these items was if 80% of the time they’d be invisible. They also likely considered that most of those PA players are always wearing it just to have extra carry weight. If those players can have similar carry weight with a backpack, maybe that will create a little more variety in the world from a design perspective.
---
All of that makes some sense to me and I can accept it as reasonable. Honestly, seeing everybody look the same all the time is kind of boring. 
---
The other part though, is that there are going to be Atom Shop skins for the backpacks. Who would buy one of those if their backpack is never visible? 
---
There are also a variety of clothing items in the shop, and likely many more to come. Again, if no one will see those items, why would anyone buy them? PA users would mostly only ever be interested in PA skins. 
---
Now we’re going from an aesthetic perspective to a financial one. Increasing the variety of styles players have while playing will likely lead to more sales. 
---
Do I think that’s some nefarious conspiracy? No, but it certainly wasn’t a pure gameplay/aesthetic decision and I doubt it was a technical limitation. If they can make the stats work with 5 pieces of regular armor with umpteen legendary effects running they could certainly do that in PA. 
---
I personally have no dog in this fight, as I’m a non PA player. I only wear it when I have to. Just my thoughts on it.
---
Power Patcher is good, makes the PA cheaper to repair, but Power armor lasts more then long enough to only need Power Patcher when repairing, not for normal use
---
How would this work?
---
A bit he says :p
---
"you wore the wrong colors wastelander!"
---
Would love it.
---
My clans would be white with dark blue highlights.
---
I would wait until after the update tomorrow.
---
Will the vender work thw same as the stash as in only one
---
do that
---
Vendor inventories are player based, server hopping doesn’t work. In fact server hopping is useless for everything except random encounters
---
Lol
---
Oh what’s happening the update? Anything super big I should know about?
---
I’ve noticed that the production per hour for water and food appears to be a bulk thing aka one or one hundred plants in one camp will produce, in bulk, 17 crops an hour.  
---
The benefit of having more crops is if You come back after an hour you can harvest them all 
---
Not something I necessarily agree with but that’s the way it seems to be set up
---
The one by southern belle is a stand alone quest that gets you the mounted windego
---
LOL
---
Too soon
---
My understanding is that vendor CAMPs will be visible on the map and be fast travel locations. They said they will definitely be visible and show what types of items are for sale—not 100% on the fast travel, but I’m pretty sure that’s the case.
---
A lot there are plenty of posts here and on YouTube.
---
Alright I’ll make sure to check them out, thank you and have a good day.
---
I was able to get it running, FrizzyLiz316
---
Sorry for the side note, but where did you find the plans for the RAD shower? I heard they were dropped from a SBQ but didn’t have any luck getting it that way...
---
Okay. Haven’t done that one yet, I guess al have to go to toxic Larry’s on another character and see if I just missed something because I don’t think I got anything but xp and caps.
---

I really enjoy when people use "cowards" as an insult. I'm not even being sarcastic, my wife makes fun of me when I shout Fight me like a man you cowards! At mosquitos.
---
Economics is still a social science
---
Omg you hit the nail on the head. I also grow a bunch of weed and smoke etc. I don’t have kids, nor do I plan on it. I’ve got a foul mouth and speak horrible things mostly. I’ve angered many parents on GTA. Found out it wasn’t worth the arguments.
---
The brotherhood of steel protectron sells t-45 through to t-60 mod plans. Looks to be every single one but I'd have look to be sure.
---
Dang, I’ve been thinking of a switch to the dark side.
---
Don't worry, I get you man.
---
I’m former army. My mouth isn’t much better.
---
Free Wooby. Wooby Gang
---
I work with a lot of vets. Iron workers 🤷🏻‍♂️. Thank you for your service. :)
---
Unlass of course that camp is just a sinfgle set of stairs and two turrets ;)
---
Much like many of the scorch and ghouls, his likeness was there but he wasn’t... sometimes it leaves a person there for awhile or a dead ghoul... I’ve been seeing this a lot
---
You guys think your bad I’m in the big close enough to prime fissure to see the mushroom cloud in all its glory
---
Am I the only one who sees the clear issue with damage immune camps? I can see WS turret camps becoming far more prevalent since no one will be able to deter them outside of Nuking the camp. I feel of patch 9 should make all of White Springs a no build zone.
---
i hope it means people won't be afraid of you being in their camp now. one time i saw a player in the teens had a camp near the overseer's. i wanted to drop them some useful stuff, but i went near their camp and they logged out. maybe seeing a level 100+ player at their camp freaked them out.
---
now i'm definitely not a griefer. so that will be cool to help other people :)
---
Violet is best harvested after SBQ fights in groups of trees. Cobalt is from silt beans and glowing resin. Also can nuke a corn field if you need a lot of cobalt and have the non perishable ingredients.
---
I have a lot of duplicate plans to sell as well, and I'm going to sell them for cheap. I'm not trying to get rich from it, just want to make them available in case anyone wants them, and the vendor prices are a bit much. I have a few plans I'm looking for myself, so hopefully the karma comes home.
---
NOOOO don't say this. I don't want you to judge my lazy ugly camp...
---
Get ride of bandolier it’s worthless unless your caring 6k ammo plus. Instead put string back
---
Yep... enjoy my shitty loot cause i grab from the stash after i clear the area now.
---
Try boosting your luck with drinks/food/chems/gear before you try. 
---
It works.
---
Would love those encounters. Especially the possibility of players utilizing the way you can change your power armor color, matching each region and camouflaging.
---
Because someone who just got access to an almost unlimited account of weaponry and might, for example, have a grudge against Greg who stole their girlfriend one day in the vault isn't going to lash out.
---
People are bastard coated bastards with bastard filling. Give someone weapons and no consequences, they might become a psychopath.
---
I don’t do the lucky cards for armor and weapons I use selected mutations and starched genes and better criticals. Otherwise it looks solid. 
---
I also use commando and have my handmade as tweaked. Between adrenal reaction and bloodied it is at 148 damage per shot at half health as an automatic.
---
Do people actually do that? I’ve never had anyone initiate any PvP for a workshop and wondered if it actually happens.
---
That should be a weapon honestly
---
I really hope people are selling bulk rubber for cheap. I haven't found a good farming location yet.
---
It was not happening for me and I played for about 2 hours and had a server crash, but then was able to get right back on again.
---
Thanks.
---
Only from the Armory MODUS. I finally saw one today. Grabbed it for 360 caps. I paid 5000 a couple of months ago for mine from another player.
---
Vendors it's better to be after cause whatever players sell show up in vendor inventory I've got some decent legends off the vendors in WS or watoga
---
Interesting, I hadn't thought of that. I've seen it with Scorched a few times, one even headless, but didn't think about that affecting players as well.
---
I really wish I’d find some people like you two when I play. Lately it’s been a lot of me trying to gift low levels and just confusing them. I miss human interaction in the game.
---
Wow 400 hrs I'm I had no idea
---
Would love a patch that is all old bug fixes and camp content.  Wouldn’t mind some atom shop stuff mixed in, but could use some free stuff too (say free diner set, atom pristine diner set).
---
That’s where I got mine. Grafton
---
General rule with explosive legendaries: All the damage perks that affected them before still work. Demolition Expert only applies to the additional +20% explosive damage, so one point is +24% and five points is +32%.
---
I have the garb of mysteries costume, and the challenges to do, if you still need it.
---
I saw it in whitespring a few times.
---
Yeah- I don’t need any but was buying bulls from a guy who had like 20-30 bulk rubber a few days ago
---
I’ve seen it with power armor a lot.. it use to happen with a players name tag floating where they use to be and in many cases the player would be invisible to the rest of team after fast traveling.
---
This is a struggle for me, too. I don’t like floaty objects and don’t understand how people get ground items so flat!
---
That's not funny lol
---
I doubt Heavy Gunner would stop working for a gatling gun just because it has explosive bullets. And I've been told that Demolition Expert works on all weapons with explosive bullets.
---
Yes. However, I didn’t know what perks affected them before. Does heavy gunner work as that would go against its description? Thanks.
---
Okay, I'm lost. I can't see where they made this change
---
I use the excavator for farming and nuke zones. Otherwise no armor. Lose to many legendary effects with it on honestly.
---
If you're on PC, I can sell you the plan tomorrow.
---

---
You can unlock all the (unlockable) mods by scrapping any part. Hence the best and only plan you need for each armor type is light arms. Everything else is just for collectors.
---
Easiest way to get trapper armor plans is from world spawns in the Savage Divide. Look near armor benches, if you're lucky there's a plan on a table.
---
Cant wait to see you guys at dragoncon, it's going to be my first one and I'm hella excited
---
Sorry. I basically briefly said what you just posted because I’m an idiot and didn’t read all the comments :/
---
Dragoncon is a blast, the Fallout love is huge there
---
Cool i was like dude. Duuuuude. And then i was like bokay!! And then i farted up astorm and flew away and it was pretty cool man dude guy
---
Yea, if you read more into it the uncle kidnapped him to use as ransom to help pay the union workers at the steel mill, if i recall. And the the dad didn't even give a fuck. The kid was such a little asshole that he wasn't even bothered that he killed his uncle when he left. I'm pretty sure the computer at the house has info about the kid making it into a vault somewhere though
---
That'd be the faster fire rate. I've got rank 3 action boy and lone wanderer, so AP regen is not a problem. 15 PER, 15 AGI before armor and mutations. They definitely designed the 10 Sub for a build like mine... and I started out as a sniper!
---
My TS handmade with a drum beats it in DR, but I have oodles of 10mm ammo. Plus the 10 Sub just handles really well.
---
That damned Greg...
---
log in and find out.
---
I had 99999 of each item once.
---
But I haven't played this game since they nerfed TSE weapons.
---
Easily one of the coolest weapons in the entire series. I still remember the first one I found in fallout. Hopefully it becomes viable by the time I get my one hand melee guy leveled.
---
My buddy has been trying to get me go for awhile, but as someone with severe anxiety and depression, it's hard for me to do almost anything. I think this year is the year though *fingers crossed*
---
Oh hi Satan?!
---
I used mine once. On a ghoul.
---
Your camp looks awesome! We have a similar style. I will update this post later tonight with some screenshots. :)
---
I only know xbox
---
Go social at main menu, open gamer profile, find someone who has join in white
---
If i recall correctly modus had it programmed to kick everyone out after a set time. Something to do with the whole in fighting of the original enclave I believe. You have to check the managers computer in whitesprings, and the maintenance one and one of the computers inside the enclave to put it altogether. Everything about whitesprings is a wild ride.
---
And while on this subject, you can find all their corpses in the dumpsters outside.
---
I tend to see a good amount of camps as I and a few others still camp in whitesprings, there are areas just outside the blast zone that I and a some others ive seen call home. At one point there were three camps all in view of one another, it feels nice to have a little neighborhood and makes me hope Bethesda will add a big “server workshop” in the future where every player can contribute to a sort of town
---
He's there, or at least he's one of a family of several possible events that trigger there (presuming nobody's planted their camp there.) The key is that you can't just fast travel there and look for him by the lake. You have to follow the rail line down a bit and walk back to trigger the event. I've heard all you need to do is hit the felled telephone pole but I like to go down to the second bridge by the Grafton monster spawn and then walk back. 
---
Alternatively you can try the soft serve shack spawn point which is actually a bit more reliable imho. But I've got him both places. Still haven't got anything good out of it tho. :(
---
That's not what I asked.
---
I would give it another go. Some cool shit to do now like hunting the real and fake sheepsquatch, meeting BIV and listening to his muttering, Nukashine, meeting random people at events and generally having a blast. 
---
They’ve done some things to make it more enjoyable like pooling all the vendor caps and putting all the vendors at whitespring so we don’t have to travel all over the damn place. 
---
It’s a lot less buggy as well. At least for me it has been.
---
 CHARLIE CODE: 76235245
---
Of all the great lines in Tommy Boy, that’s one of the funniest in delivery.
---
So like 30 individual items? So if I wanted to sell stimpaks and I put in 30 to sell it would already be full?
---
Yeah, I'm pretty much just intending to throw in unwanted stuff. I don't think there would usually be anything worth stealing unless it was a super valuable legendary, but even then I'm just gonna turn those in for scrips. I feel like if you \*really\* wanted to sell something valuable, you're better off advertising it in one of the market subreddits so you can haggle for prices and get more exposure. But that's just me.
---
It’s something to call somebody when you’re not actually trying to be insulting. It works well for everything
---
It’s not worth it. Riflegaming tried it on YouTube.
---
936 on first, 103 on second.
---
If you were looking for pvp try the survival mode if you haven’t.
---
I have collected over 290 teddy bears since I picked up this game. I intend to sell these and only these. You may have nothing, but at least you aren’t wasting people’s time like me, lol.
---
Probably doesn't help a lot but this is what Google said.

If there is no minimum caps for items it will be back to duping items again.
---
For sure that is what I will continue to do for the really rare stuff, as I have made very good profit from the market that way. I plan on putting plans, and a few rare weapons and armor in the machine.
---
I have VERY few crashes these days, and I’m not nice to the game- I alt-tab a lot, and run two clients simultaneously. But I’ve got a 1070 w/6?8?gb, 16gb of system ram, run ‘76 off an SSD, running win10. Ryzen 1600z
---
At least we matched. Lol
---
😂😂  niceeeee
---
I carry flares, artillery grenades, and vertibot grenades for pseudo fireworks as well as marking/signaling :)
---
glad you liked it, took me forever to find the indoor toilet though.
---
True. But one time Karen used my toothbrush and didn’t tell me.  So gross. It’s time for payback Karen!!!!!
---
Same just got one yesterday. My son was watching me play and asked about it as I was walking past. I told him it's super rare to get one and to have any chance you need to do lots of things to boost your luck so I haven't tried since fallout 4. He wanted me to try so I clicked on it and was just about to walk away when I got it!
---
As to the jet pack. It does exist. I run the qween regularly (up to 10 times a week @95%kill ratio) and I haven't been playing long (lvl 146). And have 5 or 6 jetpack plans sitting in the stash right now for tomorrow. Aince patch 8 I have seen an uptick in mod plans for ALL power armor drop (except x01) regularly from sbq.
---
I guess Bloodied legendary prefix would make it usable. Wouldn't it?
---
Amen.
---
It works with the garb of mysteries as long as the other player is in PVP. You only need 1 player in the shot. I did it between my two accounts just by shooting at each other then taking a picture.
---
If you’re on PC I’ve got a three star crossbow you can have. I’ll be on tomorrow. nmprogue
---
I just want to nuke the bastard I have everything allredy but thanks
---
I haven’t gotten ANY of the “new” BoS paints... I’m getting salty. Probably turned in 50-70 plans by now (I’m not trying to farm it but I do at least one a day)
---
Try turning off "Intel SpeedStep Technology" in you system bios. Was having the same issue and turning this off made a significant difference.
---
Pretty sure its left over from FO4. They only drop from attack dogs during scorched earth.
---
Time is of the essence
---
Seems just before a patch things get squirrely... not sure what’s up or they turn something off but the game acts differently. Even more lag like small pauses from just a second to quite a few seconds...
---
Your Xbox might be haunted, really:(
---
Like a post apocalyptic Build a Bear
---
24 minutes, that's cute? What's the code word for this week then wiseguy? :D  
---
I see you guys don't post the codewords for the week, soooo.. yeah? Bit suss.. but you know. It's coincidence. Righto..  
---
Community? Uh huh... I see a big fat donation button on Nukacrypts page.. If this was for the community, you wouldn't be asking for donations now would you? ;)  
---
It's not trolling if it's the truth, you're just a butthurt that someone's calling you out for your bullshittery.
---
Kill a lot of scorchbeast queens. You won't get a duplicate after learning a prime plan, so eventually you get them all.
---
Someone might have a spare, but expect to pay a few thousand.
---
Play it for yourself and form your own goddamn opinion. Pretty simple right.
---
Stability &amp; disconnects gotten better , bug still a shitload if bugs and glitches apperently never getting fixed . Some new quests, really not much dlc to brag about
---
But its fallout so i guess its worth playing in some sadistic way
---
My camp got fixed almost immediately because that account is melee only so i have alot of spare supplys on hand
---
Same holy crap I’m ready to get these out of my inventory.-.
---
I know a way around immune camps
---
They have already gone full carebear outside of workshop PVP. What more do you want?
---
I’m 100% positive many griefers will be testing the patch out or trying to trigger PvP or destroying camps because they were told they can’t... so I would expect company for sure either way...lol
---
It's an automatic win on the event.
---
Thx
---
I think mine is 540 when I first log onto a server with calibrated shocks. Should be 440 :)
---
I still need the mysterious woman costume, do you have that one?
---
*Quick Fixed
---
change servers.
---
Have been lucky enough to never have anyone mess with my base since launch until this evening when I guess some guy thought it'd be fun to damage all my stuff but not break it so I couldn't repair it through the computer. Guess the jerks are having one last night out before they're forced to harass their own kind.
---
Scotch is too strong for me
---
Nice little place you got there.
---
I got it last night. Was very excited.
---
Just drink it.
---
Yeah, I just uprooted my CAMP and moved it to a new location last night. I was doing some decoration earlier today trying to get everything roughly in place ... I wanted to do a train station, and I found a great spot on the map, but when I got there? No good. Turned out that where I THOUGHT I had a great spot where two traintracks met ... there was only one set. teh other was the monorail in teh sky. D'oh!   
---
But then an idea hit.  
---
So i started to follow the high tracks for a while, looking for a good vista, then went and made a floating-style platform ... one foundation, stairs, then built a train station at the same height as the monorail. Below it, I scratched out a small lounge area, with a bar, a cooking area, some tables, a pool table ... and below \*that\* a small half-basement for storage and probably a minor living area.   
---
Out back is a tool shed with all teh crafting stuff.  
---
When it's finished, I'll have a proper shop on the third floor (The train depo), a place to cook and eat on teh second, a small private area, and then teh stuff that you \*need\* to have out back.  
---
I had someone find teh place while I was working on it tho and they came in, looked around a bit, gave me a hi, then pulled out their camera and took several shots, then waved bye and dashed off. Is it weird that watching someone take a picture of my place, even unfinished, is something I take as a massive compliment?  
---
Tomorrow, I'll try and open the doors for business. We'll see what's out there before the day job beckons in real life. I also \*really\* look forward to whatever else other people are going to have to offer. It's gonna be so cool!
---
I got out
---
See, my problem with their "wasted effort on outfit design" is simple, nearly all of those outfits are just reskins or something incredibly silly that I couldn't see myself using. Nearly all the skins for weapons are basically gags, a croquette mallet, a candy cane, and a wiffle bat, or are just turning it the color green or chrome, badly. I myself have purchased atomic shop items that show they put in some work, which lately happens to be power armor. The only outfits I can recall that weren't just recolors seemed to be the snipers outfit, the survivalist outfit, and a few that were for a limited time. That's the problem, they need to realize that recoloring items isnt going to get most people spending atoms in the shop.
---
But then these new Horsemen skins come out, of course people are going to be hanging out in power armor, they show some amount of effort in design. But in my personal experience, I see a more diversely outfitted playerbase then you must. Right now, it's usually players in power armor or people in the more rare outfits hopping around with marsupial.
---
Yeah but where's the fun in that :P
---
🧐
---
handmades are pretty cheap actually as you can make lvl 15 versions the heavy cost items are heavy weapons / railway rifles / radium rifles - you need 15-20 screws each then add in weapons like ultracite laser rifles and such and you can get pretty much 3-4 rifles for a days worth of farming maybe 5-6 with super duper and a junk factory in your house
---
Also, just normal scorchbeasts too drop those Prime Reciever Plans rarely. Good luck hunting
---
I haven't played in ages but that plan was never confirmed to exist when i did play.
---
With the change to plans you'd simply see it at a vendor no?
---
Just shut the door when you leave....
---
Just try not to sprint often in PA, it seems to absorb the cores quickly.  The fusion generators do charge them 100%, but I recommend not using PA when you are farming for them because then you'd technically be using cores to make cores.
---
Don't really care too much for now tbh, I have hundreds of plans I'll never use. Regardless of whether I get caps or not, I'll have some more stash space
---
Bethesda has made a real effort and it’s better than it ever has been.
---
I really really hope the wont be visible , i for one dont want a huge turtle on my back. I hate PA and wont be using a pack id they are visible
---
This is amazing!
---
Fallout 3 begins with PvP over a Sweetroll.
---
Cry more, or don’t hit back
---
If you pick up plans you already know, sell them below the vendor prices.
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/4aSpwjqqwDZqD3JD6ecTT/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pioneer-scouts-and-backpacks-april-25-2019
---
Scroll down to backpacks
---
Janet’s Soft Serve is definitely the best place. He spawns down the road past the overturned bus. Be aware that his selection is random, so even if you find him, he may not have what you are looking for.
---
There is no method to recharge cores.
---
You may however capture a powerplant workstation to create 100% cores. They churn out fairly quickly as well.
---
As for usage -- jet pack uses a lot of fusion core power. Melee power attacks and sprinting all use core power at an accelerated rate, but nowhere near as much as a jet pack.
---
You could pick up full charge under strength to mitigate core drain when sprinting by 50/100% and/or grab power user under intelligence to increase fusion core duration by 30/60/100%.
---
You could have made it even easier by pressing "repair all" once while looking at your C.A.M.P. unit
---
That's not what I meant. What I was trying to say is that with full excavator PA bonuses carry weight can go up to almost 600. Bethesda surely doesn't want us to stack another 100, 150, or whatever the max. bonus for the backpacks is, on top of that.
---
For stability reasons, not because they can't.
---
I just got my first one a couple days ago at Valley Galleria. I was doing the bucket list quest, and decided to do some mall walking, ‘cause, you know, the music there... I walked by the machine and said, hell, why not. No luck, then again, no luck, but on the third try, I noticed that the claw jumped sideways just a smidge before it dropped down. I thought, that’s weird, then it picked up the pie! I was so excited I fumbled with my camera, but only managed to take a picture of the machine with no pie in the top shelf. It is the most cherished item in my inventory.
---
Everyone hates the paparazzi :-)
---
Again, using aspects in unintended ways. What is not clear here. Stop calling anybody who attacks you or your camp a griefer.
---
my only tip would be to NOT run. also if you have mods like the jetpack i think they also use cores but i could be wrong.
---
Yeah the one from the challenge description. We can take turns.
---
If you already hate power armor though, what difference does it make? Personally, I like the idea, because it makes little sense already that our weapons disappear from our hands once we lower them, if I was wearing a suit that made me a certified Hercules, I'd want to be able to hold everything I can.
---
Now this is a good idea. They need to work around the camp and try to fix it up so that it's easier for players. It's not all combat like it used to be. Now players want to make the dream camp of their dreams.
---
I dont do it cause the day i do i will get a god roll which would be lvl 40
---
What this guy said. Tis why I always craft and scrap arms, cheapest to make for unlocking mods.
---
More often than not the patches have unintended consequences of breaking random shit; most folks like to wait to see what those are before hopping on as soon as the servers are back up.
---
Equip 3 Power User perks on Intelligence tree, then keep picking up any fusion cores you find. You'd never run out of fusion cores unless you overuse your jetpack.
---
I'm glad you do. I'm just hoping it gets realized.
---
Maybe they let you sell items as stacks?
---
No PVP in adventure as stated.
---
If i wanted to play pvp I would do it in a game that was balanced for it. 
---
I accept other people might want PVP they can have survival mode, that is what it is for, just leave me, and everyone else out of it.
---
You asked me to name purely online games that aren’t chalk full of micro transactions. And because I did so, you changed the rules. I’m sorry if you don’t like my answer, or don’t like being proven wrong...but I named 3, and there are more, successful, fully online, non-micro transaction based games.
---
You can use the perk card Power User to use less. However you lose precious slots for it.
---
VATS in powerarmor really chews through cores.
---
Power User perk will make cores last longer.
---
I'm not waiting. I have plenty of 1 stars and plans I could care less about. I just want my stash space back
---
I try to sign in and crashes
---
Thanks a lot for the tip! I'll try. How did you discovered it?  
---
How often would you say ur game is crashing now?
---
30 items or stacks
---
I bought this for my nephew and he loved it, he is currently reading it cover to cover. He is a bit of an artist too, and he just loves the detail you put into it.
---
Anyone who loves FO76 will love this, really reasonably priced and a great gift.
---
Yep
---
I think that's called the Longshoreman's outfit or coat.
---
Same
---
Ammo is not an issue at all. If you keep your acid supply topped up, gunpowder is easy to craft and I have good iron and lead ore runs. 50cal and 5mm for days. 
---
My workhorse weapons are executioners/limb damage gatling and anti-armor 50cal. My anti-armor gatling laser is also fairly good against the SBQ with rank 3 Power User. My two shot LMG also  tears stuff up without explosive.
---
I take one at first. . . . . . . .then I walk arround and come back and eat the whole bowl
---
I learned early not to drink out of those. The one I sipped was Nukashine. They may all be, I woke up at a picnic table in the Mire.
---
I'd be willing to dish out a couple grand. I can't craft ammo for my new gun without it🤦🏻‍♂️😂
---
Alternatively, did you have Pacifist on?
---
That would be me. I turn off every radio i see. Wasteland or not, no reason to run up the electric bill.
---
You animal....
---
I'm planning to sell junk I get from raiding workshops with mine
---
If you plug in your store and power it up your CAMP appears on the map. I was worried no one will ever find my place too but this eased my mind.
---
Does nukashine actually do that to you? Or is that a joke? Idk never got to try it.
---
Yes, this . I miss this song
---
That's all good info. Thank you. 
---
To be clear, are you saying that I can unlock heavy combat armor chest mods by crafting and scrapping light combat armor arms?
---
Just make a spotify playlist like the rest of us. Licensing is a nightmare when game is already launched so dont think they’re gonna enable us there when every lazy ass person can find the radio playlist on spotify and add some related songs they like. 
---
1. Because Bethesda wont spend money on more music.
---
2. Because you can easily find a compromise that should make you happy, not cost Bethesda a dollar and they can spend their resources on stabilizing and bugfixing the game.
---
I got glad bears, sad bears, bad bears and rad bears. I can ready a teddy in no time if you let me. If you want to bear to bear the bears that I bear in this bare Apocalypse, come on down to Sir Veyza’s Bear Emporium for all your post nuclear fallout bear needs. 
---
It’s a barren wasteland out there. Don’t be bare and don’t bear it alone. Get a Bear today!
---
Not mine they all loaded champagne mimosas.
---
But I did just buy 50 nuka-quantoms recently....
---
Yes. You black out and the game puts you in some random place.
---
DONT ANSWER ARE YOU ON XBOX? I WILL GIVE YOU A NUKASHINE
---
It’s kind of awesome.
---
Mr. Prize bot shows up at every transaction.
---
Same. I’m gonna sell my stuff on the cheap. It’s still a profit and it helps the new players. I don’t see why I’m being downvoted for that
---
Oh it allowed stacks? Awesome then, thanks
---
It's known to cause conflicts with nvidia drivers so I gave it a try. Went from practically unplayable to having no crashes at all.
---
Oh cool, didn’t know this! I hadn’t had the chance to read the patch notes but that is a good feature.  Can we fast travel to other’s camps for free?
---
Thanks for the tips guys, appreciate it
---
Just wondering, does this also make it immune to nuke destruction?
---
\~200 hp knifes will take down most things in 1-2 hits.  I'm just getting around to the 2 handed weapons with my melee build (level 107).
---
But I agree on the k-bob....
---
I leave Nukashine at the Overseer’s camp for the new people. Hahah
---
😢
---
All ammo bulks should be the same as the default crafting numbers. so 10 bulks of 5MM would be 1K Rounds.
---
make them an aid item, consuming them destroys the bulk and adds them to your ammo page
---
Sorry, I had already posted. Lol
---
30 items period or 30 types of items?
---
No crashes at all?! Definitely gonna try it ASAP! I'll post here when i do the results :)
---
So long as they're not tied to your stash limit.
---
Ok so educate me, what is the correct Reddit term for a player in an online game who attacks and continues to harrass and harass when the other players is clearly not interested in fighting back? And then they keep attacking and harassing some more? Usually playing rediculous loud music over area chat or shouting expletives. And playing the game solely to annoy other players. 
---
If they're not griefers then I'll call them exactly what they are - Cunts.
---
I knew what you meant, but I think the way it's phrased ("profit off of") it sounds like you're wanting to take advantage of them instead of helping them.
---
I had three lvl 50s at whitesprings today then I went drop off technical data and got ganged up on by three lvl 85s. Stupid sexy bats.
---
None of those games are purely online, all can be played alone in a private lan server. 
---
Thats like saying minecraft is purely online
---
Love this. 🐻
---
Waaaaaaaaaaa
---
I thought of this as well, but no I did not at the time. I've wondered before what would happen if I did. I tried to kill a wanted player just today and forgot to turn pacifist off before my first shot. I missed, but it was only 50% in VATS. I wonder if I missed because of the dice roll, or because I had pacifist enabled, or both. Turned it off and got the bounty.
---
I found a server with a nuke zone if you want to do it now.
---
If one doesn't match my outfit it'll probably annoy me, and nothing wrong with wanting to toggle hide a cosmetic item. Outfit system already hides the armor that will most likely look like a total mess for example... since finding a good full set of legendary armor of the same type is near impossible for most. Maybe there should be a backpack type that is invisible or super smol.
---
I killed one with my brother the other day, right after we killed a giant mutant hermit crab with a bus for a shell
---
Thats a very good idea, would also be quite realistic as no one buys ammunition in individual bullets.
---
I just want to easily buy 10 stacked ammo for 1k and not have to fiddle around with the slider to buy exactly 1000 bullets 😅
---
Oh, right. Forgot that detail.
---
Like someone stated in another post, it makes sense. We're the best and brightest its only right that we are a little competitive. Its human nature, heck it's just nature we don't all just wanna just stand around and look at pretty camps we wanna ravage and take what we want. Gimmie your sweet roll &gt;:(
---
Y'all use the manufacturing extended mod too?  Great mod.
---
do I have to pay the troll toll to get in the boys hole
---
Got the hot rod paint, definitely can't miss me in it....
---
also, Bulk fusion cores and plasma cores. just for giggles. would look like a 6 pack of Beer.. but with cores in it
---
Time to get rid of your cheat base.
---
Lol people still play this shitty game
---
If you’re available, I’m online now and will be for a while.
---
I think ammo should be sold in suppository form. So you can insert it up your anus. That's sounds en flik.
---
Yea well I finally learned how to get power to half of my one room cabin but.. This is cool too i guess
---
I've been playing since launch and just got the plan a couple weeks ago on a random event. Also only seen 1 two shot weapon lol.
---
It's all luck really :/
---
As funny as this sounds, they still kill ghouls with their ballistic damage. They are obviously terrible at it because they also heal the ghouls, but they do end up killing ghouls eventually.
---
if you are gonna sprint, use Fully charged. alternatively hoard every core you can and use Batteries included. i have well over 130 in my inventory above 50%
---
You don't appear to be able to hear me. You should try to mute and unmute me from the social menu. I can hear you. Trading at Whitesprings is hard, every time someone enters or leaves the cell, the trade window will cancel. Come to me.
---
This needs to be on a note in the game.
---
189
---
Non explosive heavy guns applies before the legendary prefix is applied. so a Gatling gun with Explosive is classified as a non explosive heavy gun. Explosive Heavy guns are the Fatman, Missile and Auto Nade Launcher
---
If you don’t like pvp/survival..... play adventure.... it’s really that simple lol
---
It’s nice to have the option for those who want both or one of the other...
---
And it’s really easy... you just hover over the adventure tab... and confirm... there’s two options... choose the one on the left 😂
---
Nvm. Someone shot him
---
Does this apply to everyone, or only those with passive mode turned on?
---
My stash box sure doesn’t lol I accommodate.
---
PVP with Butch would imply you could fight him at that point, the most damage you can do at the party is to call him mom an alcoholic in form of his friends. Which is probably more than a punch but still.
---
Butch also wasn't packing a TSE rifle, full invisibility, and a I stop dying at quarter health build. 
---
PVP requires such specific builds to even come close to working out fair I just don't want to deal with under most circumstances.
---
Ended up in the Cranberry Bog at level 12 once. Ran all the way back to the Whitesprings without dying. Terror the whole way. It was awesome
---
Scav-A-Bear
---
I'm not going to bother rebuilding until everything has patched, cause what if something AMAZING is released and my build is already full? lol
---
Mine are legit fool
---
Not hitting back works until they start playing secret service to enemies you are trying to fight.
---
I’m looking forward to offloading 400+ lbs of crappy 1 star legendary weapons I’ve been farming for weeks. If you want to see camps just look for players on the map who aren’t moving for a bit or a group in one area not near anything.  I am kinda interested in what people are going to be selling though at their new vending machines.
---
#9 would be genius. Even if it's only like weapons and armor in there it'd free up space for those things i might use in the future and don't quite want to get rid of.
---
Also a bug I recently discovered: the strange in numbers perk works for some perks, and straight up disables the benefits of other perks while keeping the negative effects. I have twisted muscles and talons, both lose their positive effects. Super lame
---
Remember that it's not instanced, so someone else may have gotten it, and you might need to server hop.
---
That's messed up sorry man
---
You seem to be the first one to mention Ultracite having a jetpack. Can you post a picture?
---
I keep wondering this, its a good way to make the legendary enemies feel different.
---
Imagine how different a fight against a super mutant with a TSE minigun would be...
---
Ah, they edited it. I was looking all over for a new post stating this cuz I remember reading the opposite a while back lol. I actually found it odd when they said they allowed it since I've felt like the game catered to PA users way too much already. Game doesn't even let me stack Rad Resist on armor and use Rad Shield to enter nuke zone because it still doesn't work the same as PA.
---
Drop endurance and add gun-fu and adrenaline. Even with one rank of each, that combo is pretty amazing with sneak criticals. And maybe consider tank killer over concentrated fire. My build is very similar and I feel like it’s a pretty viable endgame build.
---
If you’re on PS4 I am 100% visiting!
---
The TLDR did specify I wanted it out of adventure, I already don't play survival. 
---
You can hover your eyes over text to read it and not put your foot in your mouth(key board?).
---
That's not true. You can server hop vendor inventories. I did it literally hundreds of times.
---
Unfortunately I’m on Xbox, friend. But it’s the thought that counts. Maybe one day we can bridge the gap with crossplay, for now, we wait.
---
Sicc em’ jerry
---
Out of date, useless albeit entertaining video. Why share this now?
---
Is it a daily then? Or is it just a side quest that is first come first serve on who can get rewards from it?
---
::slow clap::
---
All I can see is your active quests lulz.
---
Honestly, I probably could. I was holding my own against level 68 Super Mutants in Harpers Ferry.
---
Side quest, first come first served.
---
I don't know what was wrong dude. Every time I tried to complete a trade with you, it would cancel it. Then when I tried to trade with you outside of whitespring station, it wouldn't let me accept. There's still three more serums I like to get from you,
---
Tbh that would be 100% of what i would expect to find in fallout
---
I just seens it now and it hasn't been put up here before iunno.
---
So you're one of the guys that always walks up on me chilling at my camp? I put a lot of time into my little plot and I love visitors. Even when they blow it up lol.
---
I think they nerfed fusion cores, cause I've been using PA for months, and the last few weeks have been horrible for how fast they run out. 
---
Yes to everyone about to tell me about the perks, I have all the PA perks for cores. Thanks.
---
Just kill them all and let god sort them out
---
I still want my 3 star drill
---
He means if it works exactly how they said it'll work (but with Bethesda that's still 50/50).
---
Looks dope! What platform are you on?
---
I had the same question and got lit up for it.
---
Not much has changed overall. Couple of events, short dungeon and booze.
---
Loads of qol of course but if you were bored before you'll be bored now.
---
No good paint options.

Three possibilities:
---
1. Someone deliberately designed and programmed the bowl to work just the way it does and all of us who think that this was a bad idea - are wrong.   
---
We simply don't get it... 
---
2. The bowl is not supposed to work like this - but none of the staff noticed.   
---
Seriously? Again? No quality assurance, no proper testing?
---
3. The bowl is not supposed to work like this - but the staff couldn't or didn't want to fix it.   
---
How... why? What?!
---
This, once more, is such a good example of what's wrong with this game and what has to change. The devs, time and again, either wrongfully assume how people play their game or they put merely the absolute bare minimum effort and thought into it... which is a shame, really, because the bowl is a super cool idea - and we got it for free! So what the hell is going on here...?
---
Haha thanks!
---
https://nukacrypt.com if you still need alpha :)
---
Yeah, mixing the current sets doesn't look that great. Some plain colors would help, and they'd sell more sets.
---
Okay because I did it the other day and like I said earlier in the post I got xp and caps but no plans so I didn’t know if you could get plans from the quest or not.
---
check recon posts on r /fo76 😊
---
I love me a good peaty scotch beast.
---
Exactly, don't know why Bethesda hasn't done this. Doing this will sell atoms and they can put more attention on the content on the road map too.
---
Not true friend. the other night i had grahmm twice and the vendor bot there twice and there was always a camp each time
---
I really just want to know how they made that...
---
HUZZAAAAH!!!!
---
Think that covers it.
---
Don’t worry it will be a limited one day $12 skin if Bethesda is behind the wheel
---
And it's in sprinting distance of Billings Homestead which has a field of Razorgrain.
---
are you on ps4? can send some pics to show you how much more cloak you get per piece of gear.

Ah okay.

Build straight up, like a tower. Have someone stand on a spot that has nothing under it. Remove that piece.
---
Yeah, I don't know what to tell you other than that is 1 of 2 known side quests that give you a mounted thing.

I'm not sure what was up with your audio. I could hear you the whole time, but you couldn't hear me, from either of my accounts. Not sure why you couldn't hear me. Usually muting/unmuting from the social menu fixes it, but this time it doesn't seem to have worked. The in-game voice in this game is just badly bugged.
---
There are also two of trade bugs we experienced:
---
* Every time someone enters or leaves the cell (and maybe the server) the player to player trade window auto-cancels. So, trading in a high traffic area like Whitesprings is problematic because of the trade window being cancelled frequently.
---
* Sometimes players are unable to initiate trade with another player. It might have something to do with the game thinking the target is overweight and cannot trade (and somehow messing up that calculation), but I'm not sure. The only way to fix that is for one of the two parties to relog. So, that's why I was relogging.
---
Adding u/Aten_Ra for visibility to add these to the unofficial bugs list.
---
Glad we finally got the trade done.
---
If Graham gets stuck, he teleports away from that location. I had a camp on the highway next to Pleasant Valley Station and found that out.
---
Well biologically speaking I doubt they are a plant ...
---
You can also do the same thing with building layers near a cliff edge.  You can make the snap trap (the one that springs upward from the floor) on the bottom layer and layer a floor piece over from a different foundation.   It will fling them in the air.   Now just have an open “chute” ahead and down they will plummet.
---
I actually do similar things to practice deconstructive and memory intense retention writing for classes. 
---
Also when did they change back packs last I read they would work in power armor.
---
Possibly for performance when loading in?
---
Or some other issue since they had radios in beta, then removed them on release and only relatively recently re-added them.
---
It would have been really cool if I didn’t have all my junk of me. I usually take precautions (no team invites, pacifist mode on, no survival, etc) but don’t really account for floors giving out on me lol.
---
Maybe I'm just not mean enough to build dearhtraps...
---
Go. Away.
---
[](/celestiahappy)[Here's a map of ore nodes you can place an extractor on.](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/249279013510578186/568773895331774485/9Rccgzd.png) If that interests you.
---
I've experienced similar happenings on Xbox the past few days. On Friday, the game kicked me out for 30 min and after that is when it got wonky. Took extreme rad damage in PA, invisible enemies, enemies randomly regaining health that weren't legendary mid gunfight, loading freeze when entering buildings, and grenades defying physics and freezing in midair killing me instantly. Not enough to make it unplayable but still annoying. Looks like a pretty solid update tho so I'm excited
---
Thanks I have seen that but I doubt my build will leave enough for an extractor.
---
*Stares in Army of Northern Virginia*
---
I SWEAR the floor exploded. It could have been something else though. (Maybe other traps in the walls?) at the bottom of the trap were electrical traps, which would have killed me if the server hadn’t crashed. Seriously have never been more thankful for server crashes lol.
---
This could be the challenge we want!
---
Love the idea!
---
But could have draw backs 
---
My example tho:playing Fallout 3 i had the firelance spawn/drop at the super duper mart, than a raider picked it up and killed me. "Poof"
---
But having a Legendary super mutant with a TSE minigun sure why not im okay with that challenge.
---
I think you’re right but it’s either extremely shortsighted or extremely clever. On one hand, it’s shortsighted because not everyone plays this game every day: we have jobs, families, vacations. On the other hand, it’s extremely clever because of and when they bring the item back you’ll definitely buy it, even purchasing atoms, if you were away from your game the last time it appeared
---
The amount of stash space that I'll finally be able to free up will be the best update of all.
---

---
Thank you for hanging in there and being patient in completing the sale. I got everything I wanted and you even were considerate in taking back one of the double purchases I accidentally made. Can't thank you enough. You're a damn righteous dude.
---
There's no weight distinction for armor mods. If you've unlocked a mod for light combat armor than you've also unlocked it sturdy &amp; heavy, and vice versa.
---
joining your world :_D
---
Found a nuked world again join me
---
Which made [this moment](https://streamable.com/wpbhk) quite a predicament when I fast traveled to a horde event node on map.
---
I hope we get 400 but think 200 is more likely but am worried it will be none
---
Im hoping its separate storage but i doubt it. I have way too much lol so i am wishfully hoping the vendor has its own storage but i think it will act like the punch bowl. 
---
Also i am hoping for players who forget or run out of water while out doing stuff. That way they can grab a few waters and keep doing their thing. Im on the edge of the cranberry bog still in the divide, so kinda hoping for that.
---
Yeah I saw that but they never say whether or stash will increase which I feel is unlikely but probably needed,
---
small question, will the Death rider be usable on excavator PA?
---
Anyone know what time the patch is done/servers live?
---
Lol nope.... gonna get it from the vendor for like a fraction of that.... finding it is half the fun
---
Didn’t work in survival mode, but worked immediately in Hunter vs. Hunted in adventure mode.
---
The coat without the backpack...yeah good luck with that one 😁  👍
---
Oh like a world spawn?
---
Ed do you need the other challenge? kill a player in survivor with the Grock costume?
---
just out of the usual blast range so no need to repair?
---
It doesn't seem that big according to the notes. Just see player vending, which will be great, but is that really the biggest thing to be added so far?
---
really hope you can fast travel
---
I have no words. Lol I got tounge tied trying to read it. Take my upvote
---
Ya bro, all you do is select adventure instead of survival at the menu pop up
---
But see, modders already do that, while I agree with you, we're not up to the "transmogrification WoW era" just yet with this game.
---
What about it is "cheating"? This has been available through all of Fallout 4's lifespan, copy and pasted here then removed right before survival beta. I completely understand why it shouldn't be available in a pvp scenario, but I never cheated to get it nor did anyone else. And I don't play survival nor pvp at all, so my base way off the beaten path has affected no player.
---
If that were the case you'd think the jukebox would be off, too. But it's. Always. On. Always.
---
Wild savage.... ill take it all dammit
---
you only need 1 rank of power user. seriously i sprint and jetpack and vats around everywhere and cores lasts a long time
---
Dayum, your Vault Dweller ate too much Sugar Bombs cereal.
---
Where abouts is the space station?
---
Most people alleviate this issue with Rad Sponge, the new Lead Champagne, or just generous amounts of Rad-X, but overall, people who go into blast zones wear either Trapper or Marine as they have the highest natural rad resistances out of regular armor.
---
[](/celestiablink)I unno what to tell you then, maybe a nice cliff, or if you don't want to deal with enemies at all there's Lake Reynolds in the ash heap. It's shallow enough in the center that you can make a huge base on it, and it's even got enough dirt for crops. Enemies almost never can even figure out how to attack, and when they do they just plink at you from the shoreline.  
---
  
---
I loved that place, had a massive three building estate there, but I really wanted a junk extractor.
---
... I kind of want to do that to griefers who go after workshops. Just catapult them away from the workshop.
---
NOOOO!!!! ITS MEANT EVERYONE! NOT JUST FOR YOUR ENTITLED ASS YOU HEATHEN!!!
---
I always leave nuka shine in it... fuckers want free shit... you get a free trip!
---
I shared a link to their revisied post on a previous sub post, should be a few up.
---
I really hope Bethesda makes the area around the Whitesprings Golf Club a no build zone.
---
It's ok take a deep breath. He is real we all have our stalkers. Mines an albino deathclaw that seems to like me.

---
There's also the Ever Upwards questline. Which Todd Howard said was the best quest they **ever made**.
---
try a million hours.
---
ive yet to see one shock
---
Nope. it changes the inventories of vendors server hopping
---
Thanks might take a look tonight. Part of why I want it in eastern divide is just to save on fast travel. Ive heard behind fort defience isn't bad but gets scorch beasts. I can only build the basic machine gun turret so I doubt I could reliably take on one of them.
---
Hell, everytime I would log in, my jukebox would be on.  Quite annoying actually.
---
It dosen't block the spawn.... just so you know.
---
Weird! The only emote you get is the “Uncle Sam” salute, should show up as owned in the Atom Shop. If you got the power amor paint and weapon skins (which should also show up as owned in the Atom Shop) you should also have the emote, they’re all included in the tricentennial DLC code.
---
Are you on PC?
---
One of my first missions was trying to get a full Trapper set with +25 Rad Resist, which was so impossible I gave up, but I did reach the Power Armor tier of Resist but the game still doesn't let me reduce it to "1&gt;" Someone told me PA and Hazmat suits have somekinda hidden effect you can't get elsewhere to do that. And Rad Sponge requires a random to join me which rarely happens. Overall it's total shit situation I wish they'd fix. :/
---

[](/celestiablush1)Hmm, I did have a base on the cliff overlooking Hapers Fairy, and one under the bridge that that cliff is above. You've got access to a bunch of gold veins and an amazing view on the cliff, or water, a small prebuilt chem station hideout and soil under the bridge. Neither one ever had any mobs since they're right next to a spawning location, and they're both right next to Harpers Fairy, one of the best vendors in the game, and the barrows.

I would love to sell food to people. It will most likely spoil if I had to guess.
---
Yeah , there’s some sketchy people out there in Appalachia. Back when there was still splash damage , this guy I was going to trade a bunch of junk with insisted that we go to his camp. Luckily nothing happened , but it could’ve been bad .
---
thanks mate =)
---
Same.
---
Ahhhhhhhhh thanks.
---
Right, but the difference is relatively negligible, I think the chore of having to collect fusion cores makes up for that slight advantage, dont you?
---
Just found a 3* bloodied kbob..lvl 35. It still only does 228 dmg, whereas my bloodied super sledge does 700+ atm without 2hand perks
---
Me too. Especially to the lower level players who have a hard time getting stuff. We need refrigerators to last for a few days and freezers to freeze meats.
---
I want to make things 50% off or more for everyone.
---
Yep, clearly underpowered lol
---
I want chips for all things and I wanna be able to buy them with scrip and put them on things so I can make the legendary armor set I want. :&lt;
---
Rule 10

this post is for reasonable talk about the post and build in question. if you do not have a comment pertaining directly to the work in question, or cannot act in a civilized manner, you can go on another forum. there was no need to bring this negativity here, and it is not welcome. people have the right to play and enjoy and game they wish without getting hate from people like you. that is all. have a pleasent day, and please remember that hate is always foolish, and love is always wise.
---
Haha that’s hilarious and kind of freaky
---
Wait, so it's now backpacks or PA? Well damn... That sucks.. I love my power armor..
---
Oh yeah, so am I. I'm counting down the time, and have an alarm set ready for when the servers are to come offline to start the updating/maintenance. :)
---
I mean 34 *luck*. Cant edit on my mobile app
---
Backpacks aren’t coming tomorrow..? Player vending, legendary exchange &amp; small balance changes plus the survival leaderboard changes.
---
As a cryolater fan, I thank you for that
---
Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Scorched Earth?
---
You're more then welcome, it got me thinking really.. as I swore to myself. I had remembered seeing a perk card with a bow and arrow ages ago, and I wanted to make sure I hadn't been dreaming.. But yeah, before the game launched. There it was, when the game launched. I grinded hard to try and get that perk card to no avail.   
---
Hopefully with this next release of content, the long wait will be finally over.
---
The spacesuit he has is the clean version, which I believe he's the only place to get.
---
Fusion cores aren't a big deal and you use less perks to manage everything than the 15 slots I use for Non-PA only perks to make up some of the difference from not using PA.
---
It might not be a graphical powerhouse, but the game is still really pretty. I love the Todd rays. 
---
Yesterday, I wandered the length of the Savage Divide looking for a Flatwoods monster, and was just reminded of how much I love the world. It's so pretty.
---
Still Hype for Backpacks
---
Yeah I was a bit unsure at first being on ps4 but it doea look good.
---
Yeah.......pretty sure that's already a feature
---
What gun?
---
Gatling gun does this a lot for instance
---
You do realise you may struggle for customers don't you?
---
I'm so pumped for immune camps. Today someone destroyed every single piece of my camp. 
---
I didn't see it happen I just get back to store some shit and patch up my armour. All was left was the foundation
---
I feel like energy damage should be separated from flame damage. Flame resistance is already its own thing right? So why does it not do flame damage?
---
Who says lol at themselves?
---
I am looking quite forward to it. Got a bunch of legendaries I can get rid of so I can free up stash space which has been an issue for me my entire time with the game.
---
Backpacks I was looking very forward to but now I read a post saying they aren't compatible with Power Armor, if that is true, that is upsetting.
---
The new Ever Upwards quest sounds very fun to me so I expect to enjoy that questline.
---
I have soooo much lag/stutter on xbox one x,dont now if its the game or my internet
---
but then it is also goes in the wheel menu and you do still have the ability to sell it and drop it
---
A damn rollar coaster
---
Well considering I did a legendary run just now at whitesprings and literally got over 200 pounds worth of legendary armor and weapons from server hopping, I'd say I'm pretty dam ready to trade them all in for some legendary scrip lol. I'm also looking forward to the new backpacks(hoping that sloth one Bethesda showed art of is in the final update) and the new ever upwards quest line.
---
Gonna have hard time looking for it dead body to loot :( I never found it when I nuke it
---
I don't know what from the cartoon they might add but those tubes looked really interesting
---
YOOOO I just realized the stay away signs were just released like 2 weeks ago lmao I find that so interesting, so that confirms it, we’re getting fair rides
---
It can very rarely world spawn. Got one in the whitesprings golf resort helmet spawn (in the lockeroom where the wendigo is)
---
It might trickle out over the next few weeks. Tomorrow already has a whole slough of changes and updates, backpacks and player vending, etc. Bows might be introduced *next* content drop continuing ever upwards. Like how Sheepsquatch played out over several weeks. (And i loved it! We all were shocked when it dropped seemingly out of nowhere.)
---
Unfortunately I’ll have to work after it comes out. Stupid third shift! *kicks his job*
---
I will be able to play it when I get home from work though.
---
Waiter: And how would you like that steak cooked?  
---
Me: RARE, YOU COWARDS!
---
There is an additional warning now, right? Like you have an additional button press to confirm you actually want to drop it. Pretty sure that is suitable. But the community may disagree with me I guess
---
Spend that lifetime finishing up your quests instead .-.
---
I used to be like that and get comments on it every time I posted a screenshot for the longest time. Took me a few months to finish all the base game quests
---
yes there is a warning but not if you drop it(as far as i know)
---
Thanks. Good to know theres sunny fans out here in the wastes.
---
It depends on what you're trying to compete with power armor in, rad resistance, yes, you're gonna need more perk cards taken, but in my experience, just taking the radaway buff perk is all I needed to get my business done in a nuke zone, but I didnt stay in it the whole duration. Whereas regular armor can can not only outperform defensively with sentinels, Cavaliers, vanguards, and bolstering, but also with pure utility like chem weight and ammo weight. But also offensively with action point recoup speed and more.
---
I'm not saying that regular armor beats out power armor in every way, but nearly everything power armor does, regular armor can already do better. So why make this distinction with carry weight when there isnt any logical reason as to why a suit of armor cant also carry a backpack.
---
Imagine player built roller coasters all across Appalachia. Todd will have to take back what he said at E3 , “It’s the apocalypse not an amusement park.”
---
I was able to sneak up on one trying to ambush me
---
you could make it an interaction people could have with the C.A.M.P letting them give a thumbs up or down. this would also be a fun thing to add in a mail box where people could leave messages.
---
Player vending is essentially a stash size increase for most of us.
---
The introduction of those legendary scrip machines means that ALL legendaries will now have a minimum inherent value. Even wood legs and nocturnal pool cues will no longer be worthless. The only problem is we don't know what that value is yet because we won't get the legendary vendor till the end of May, so it's possible even the legendary scrip will be nearly useless
---
I have never in 350 hours of playing had my CAMP destroyed, but apparently many people are happy for the survival mode camp invincibility so that's a plus too
---
With the introduction of backpacks, the idea of getting myself down below overencumbered to the point that I can sprint again (for the first time since level 15, I'm level 191 btw) is feasible
---
That is little disappointing as I have well over 30 magazines, about 20 bobbleheads and little under 50 plans that I wanted to put on vending machine.
---
Then there is the insane amounts of ammo, legendaries and basic junk, like 500 ballistic fiber that I don't need.
---
But, 30 is better than the 0 we have at the moment.
---
And that's why dad's are awesome...
---
Unless they take too long getting milk...
---
That's a lot of scrips.
---
See but there’s a THEME there. You could name your shop something Queen related..
---
Remember to take everything Todd Howard says with a gigantic grain of salt. If Todd Howard told me it's daytime I'd look outside to make sure.
---
This guy!
---
Yeah...not sure what to do other then trying to compact my house but then I'd lose the look I'm going for!
---
Seriously, If you don't like the game ... you can just leave us alone.
---
Hopefully the quest just works
---
I drop em for my friends
---
Nah I'm good I brought my own drink.
---
im on pc, i just tried myself with 1 or 3 pieces of chamaleon and theres was no noticeable difference at least outside of combat
---
I have maybe 100 plans i was saving for this because i dont want to sell them one by one.... Oh my god. Every update have some hiden reason why it sux. 
---
Like yeah it is super update, but i belive bethesda just dont like me :D
---
Most 1-handed weapons need a buff to make them comparable with 2-handed. Also would like a DPS number on melee weapons to compare them better.
---
I'm looking at the calibrated shocks mod but whew those are pricey.
---
Dear god...
---
Unless you stick to only one weapon, you will never run out of ammo past maybe level 20. It will be literally everywhere. Random container? You bet it has some ammo. Ammo box? Ammo, ammo, and more ammo. Super mutants? Ammo, grenades, and gunpowder. Scorched? More ammo. Safes? Ammo! Duffle bags? You guessed it. Ghouls? Of course!
---
Much appreciated. I’ll keep that in mind if I still can’t find them.
---
Thanks, theres no point for people to aim their hate at others just having a good time. Im having a lot of fun today and i hope you are too!
---
Entitled...you mean drunken
---
Very solid list right here. Here's hoping!
---
Thats the point
---
I'm heading to bed, but if you still need them tomorrow afternoon message me on here and we'll meet up
---
I thought we all knew this was a thing? The compound bow was datamined during the beta, an update around scouts fits perfectly for it. I'm hoping they add some mods to the crossbow as well. The only mod currently available is the prime receiver, so it wouldn't be out of place if you needed a perk to apply the new mods
---
I meet fun people all the time, this thread has me meeting some more cool folks too. And i always have my plushies when it’s slow. It’s all gonna be alright.
---
You see them all over, they random spawns. There are a couple events like Free Range, which will start an event, but you only see it at the end of the event .. you can try kill it for some loot or just run
---
Just run. If he randomly pops up in the wild without you having started the event free range then he's just a random spawn.
---
Ohh, that I didn't know. It felt like it was based on damage... Hmm, idk if I can hit 34 agility. I bet you can get that reduced with the right legendaries.
---
Right on, thanks. I’m using a vertibot to keep it entertained so I should be fine.
---
Shot him twice and he didn’t take damage lol. I’m out!
---
For sure, ill dm you.
---
The radio syncs so it's global/playing the same song at the same point for the whole server (so players can sing along).
---
I was more thinking of the road traffic not moving much these days lol
---
I died several times when entering the game due to spawning over a cliff. To resolve this problem I never log out without power armor on. Great list. Nothing there to disagree with. But you left out the disappearing inventory items bug. It still exists. Simply fast traveling is enough to cause items to disappear from your inventory. Sometimes just simple items like a bottle of lead champagne for one of Biv's quests. other times good stuff like my All Star Supersledge. And I have lost way more than just two items. Worst part is Bethesda won't even acknowledge the problem exists.
---
Mini rant, I have less a problem with this and more a problem with how you can initiate pvp by stealing a workshops. Lost Poseidon the other day and was confused by the notification so I fast traveled over and got killed by a level 80 with an explosive gun seconds after spawning. Lost 80 caps cause someone took a workshop and I had been confused about the message. Maybe just make it so if I contest it it initiates pvp?
---
Ah,  neat. I've never seen it there, but RNG and me aren't the best friends lol
---
Got my Bar &amp; Grill ready right on 91, just north of White Powder Winter Sports. Hoping to primarily have a great selection of Booze, Cocktails, NA concoctions and tasty treats made from all the various monstrosities of West Virginia. And a side selection of plans and other goodies at deep discount on various days. First floor is planned to be a relaxing lounge or dance floor, upper level has rustic dining, billiards, live music, and stations for all your crafting needs.
---
That's a good point. I still wish the stupid jukebox was off, or at least you could set it's volume separately.
---
Luck, sorry- I couldn’t edit on my mobile client. There is a crit gain rate legendary effect. But with 15 base luck, 15 luck from Unyielding, you’re only 4 away. In my case I use herd mentality (+2) and have 2 legendaries that have +1 each.
---
 I'm sure you can find lots of stuff that can be sold for a decent price. Maybe focus on loot that would be good for lower level players and sell it to them at a competitive price. I for one have tons of chems and 1 stars I'm itching to pawn off on anyone willing to buy them.
---
Not sure if this adds more data, but I have 19 luck base and I can critical every 3rd shot with lvl 1 critical savvy, when using a faster fill weapon...
---
The fixer
---
Throw a bottle of Buckie at them, they'll leave you alone
---
There is the mod that does this but yeah a basic text chat would have been one of the most basic things to throw together I mean ESO has a decent chat client with zones and all sorts so why not just directly port that and then have local/server/global chats then people could find other people who want to do the same kinda thing over when they are not on the same server.
---
My fear is the wasteland tycoons/former dupers will use their multiple mules with maxed out cap loads to buy up anything sold cheaply to try and monopolize the market on anything with value, and return prices to the 40K caps charges they are currently looking for.
---
That said .... my whole hope for the vending will be that good \* and \*\* items get more availability than they currently have.  The game is too much of a grind if you don't have a decent weapon.   The current vendor system of redistribution is too much RNG like the legendary drops themselves, and they disappear from those vendor's stashes far too quickly.
---
Just unlock someone's door. You'll have a bounty on you. 😁
---
The main reason I wear power armor(excavator) is for the carry weight bonus. I’m looking forward to hopping out of the tin can more often and sporting that backpack!
---
I can’t speak for the early game but it’s definitely worth a shot if you haven’t played in a while. There’s a big update coming tomorrow.
---
Interactive map fo76map.com
---
I’d so much prefer that to voice chat. I don’t even like talking on the phone.
---
What platform are you on? Xbox here and WS just got nuked.
---
I was thinking maybe chems and ammo on the cheap for now. I have a few pieces of armor that would be ok for lowish/middling level players too, I think. I’m just outside of Whitesprings though, and I don’t really want to move, so there’s that to consider.
---
Check w/ Remax. Their office is located in the Wendago Cave. 😄 Just kidding.
---
Can we also fix the fact that you can no longer press X, square, etc to pull your power armor out of your inventory due to atom shop paints. I know you can place it using another button but it seems like there is no difference between the two.
---
👍
---
I've got a nice little house at the entrance to Flatwoods. Farm, water, and steel are free. 
---
Planning to have some higher level stuff, but mostly make and sell full leather armor sets for the newbies that come through.
---
Nice, XB1. What is your GT ?
---
if they actually release the tube slides at some point. I'll buy them without any hesitation !
---
Jay Kateel!
---
Thank you, you rock
---
It's probably got a good loot drop 4 U.  Do not underestimate the power of the Wise Mothman.
---
I literally went to build-a-bear a week ago. His name is Rupert. This is a sound business plan.
---
Get ALL the legendaries for tomorrow’s update lol.
---
Tragic! I wish you well from ‘cross the platform divide.
---
I'll take the free resources. Need shii--- I mean fertilizer for grenades.
---
Ya..it was a little disheartening when I saw that
---
Will definitely do this!
---
Ohh it would be nice !! 
---
Blood/ furious / racial damage in the first perk
---
Limb damage 2nd perk
---
Random 3rd perk it would be amazing !!!
---
Imo they could add some useful 2nd and 3rd perks to melee weapons that use damage over time  like drill , mr handy buzzblade and chainsaw.  
---
For example
---
2nd perks:
---
Like: 10% extra damage as : radiation, fire or energy
---
-1 armor for each consecutive attack max 30 armor debuff
---
20% bonus damage after 2 secs of consecutive hits
---
Poison damage  with 5 seconds cooldown 
---
2% of the current life per hit ( max: 10 extra damage)
---
+ 5 armor per second in combat ( max 25) 
---
+ 100% damage in power attacks 
---
take +50% damage while attacking.
---
3rd perks:
---
 +50 % durability
---
Chance to repair the weapon in 10% 
---
Or any effect that buff the damage over time.
---
 
---
Those items would get prety strong ( i know in the right hand they are very strong) but adding legendary effects would make those weapon more interesting.
---
You GT doesn't seem to be working, can you confirm ?
---
id imagine the chips would come as 1-3 star rolls. the main benefit would be for smarter characters to "Build" Legendary gear with better stats (mostly durability) if you could fully build Sentinels Assassins armor (as an example) then everyone would be using it
---
I just started playing but id love to add you too!
---
Thanks I might use thst to see whats about.
---
Is there going to be some kind of quest for the plans of the vending machine?  How is that going to happen.  I'm also excited for the back packs.  And scrapping useless "Junkie" and "Nocturnal" crap. .... don't even care for the scrip, just want to hear a very satisfying crunching sound as that fifth nocturnal, blocking bonus rolling pin goes to hell where it belongs.
---
Hah, yeah you got me there. But there wasn’t a postal service until kevin costner started one to eat free meals. Maybe cars will start visiting like when kevin costner built a baseball field. Maybe Ray Liotta speaks to me too. The Drive thru’s are back people!
---
Because that last ghoul you bashed knocked you scope slightly askew and you did not take the time to zero it back in?
---
Just get all three
---
I've got a lot plans that go for 220 to 330 or so.  I figure 150 would be a good price.
---
That is a very cool camp build im going to be honest in saying i had a similar idea, but smaller in scale
---
I found that back in early BETA days. To this day I can’t bring myself to listen to it again. Not much freaks me out, but that did it.
---
I believe that would be Evergloam.
---
Have a level 35 quad guass you can have for free
---
hopefully it comes with Camp protection. a bit ago i saw 4 people with bounties roaming around the map. when they got close to my camp spot i changed servers

That’s me. What’s your GT, maybe I can send an invite

---
im hyped to make some space on my stash lmao.
---
save it for the Scrip Machines
---
Kinda what I want to do. Move my camp near low level high traffic areas and sell lower level but still good legendaries. Ive also worn certain pieces just because you dont find gems that often as a low level. Only really till you hit 50.
---
If you’re on PS4 I’d kill to buy that Instigating hunting rifle...

Stupid question maby but what exactly is an fc beacon and what is it for?

I accidentally lured him to the steel workshop by throwing another vertibot flare instead of a grenade. Rip

im hyped about the new stuff but what im more hyped about is been able to take a look at ppls camps.
---
U obviously a lier as there no slap dgm if u go into pacify mode as it now grant total immune to dgm  in essence making u enter TGM.  Incase u stupid it mean God mode
---
Oops. didn’t mean to do that; no exclamation point in my user name lol. Glad you made it!
---
I'm wondering if there will be a quest line to earn the plans for vending.
---
I'm wondering if back packs are still coming.
---
I'm wondering if legendary items will still find their way into regular vendor's inventories.
---
I'm wondering how many legendaries will be scrapped and disappear and if that will improve performance due to fewer legendary items being in play.
---
My concern is that they're not likely to give us a budget increase. For those of us with extensive camps, that means deciding between forgoing player vending altogether or recycling enough of our camp to place the bloody thing.
---
Is this individual items or 30 max quantity?
---
I was hoping to sell ammo. So dumb we can't sell to merchants.
---
i dont think the should just drop 3\* items, but they should take them BS gear, wood anything, drill, etc. at least just from the 3\* enemies, doesnt have to be a 3\* but it should be something disent.
---
Sweet. I love it when they take a bit to "die" and just hang out.
---
Server disconnects shouldn't be an issue anymore.
---
But the game is certainly still "janky". Not as janky as it was at release, but janky is one of the best adjectives you could use to describe 76 TBH. That said, the updates have been good. No overhauls yet, but the content added is high quality despite being minimal. 
---
The player base has kinda devolved, TBH. It seems most the people still playing are hardcore and have everything good or are noobs
---
Give it a try. I feel it has always had a charm that always leaves me wanting more (good and bad)
---
Anyone is welcome in my camp, just as long as they don't kill my pet deathclaw. 💜
---
All heavy gun related perks, since it is a heavy gun. Demo Expert, Grenadier.
---
Well, the first question should be “are such heavy weapons viable for PvP?”
---
And that would be an excellent sound ..... like a wood chipper that swallowed BIG after grinding  "EVVvvvveeerrrrrrrrrrrGLOAM!!!"
---
Prepare yourself. The community is hostile to these sort of questions.
---
I was expecting some hostility, but I actually want to know if it is a game I should invest some time into
---
It is better. Bug wise, it is MUCH improved. Content/gameplay loop hasn't improved too much but the last month or so has added some pretty great content, and it seems the content to come is quite promising, so if you plan to jump at any time then now is the time to give it a try
---
I dont know. Tell me please. I dont wanna deathmatches on trainstations, but I wanna play on survival and dont scary every player
---
No worries, thanks a lot, Need to get my daily done today ..
---
Yeah the prices for different mods are pretty similar. I thought about getting the shocks plan too but already bought several shock mods. But i looked for reactive plates for a long time never saw one so I bought the plan. A few days later came across the mod at Harpers Ferry vendor bot lol
---
Thanks man, I was really hoping they worked out the bugs as they were my main issue.
---
Daedra in Fallout confirmed.
---
Nah. only the weapon's Class impacts it. V.Fast, Fast, Slow, ETC.
---
Bloodied would require an overall build, encompassing perks and armor but it'd probably be the strongest. Furious builds up too quckly then flattens. Anti-armor would be good with the right perks.
---
Bummer. Thanks for the quick reply though.
---
Thanks dude, have a internet point. LOL jk
---
For a brief moment I read "We're planning to bring Fallout 76 offline to all platforms" and got excited.
---
[](/celestiahappy)"Absolutely, all has been fixed and the rest is being worked on. The Atomic shop has awesome cosmetic items for sale, please jump right in and join us in Appalachia."
---
Bugs and glitches are much better. Loading in times can be a bit slow, at least for me. Today they are realising player vending and a new quest line. So it's a good time to jump back in
---
hell yes!
---
If you're in power armor Stabilizeis quite nice. That's the only perk I miss about pa
---
I remember the first time I went up there so cool.   Can’t remember what level maybe 20.   Then I stumbled into knife edge and 2 snallygasters....ouch.
---
Afaik bethesda said they'll work with PA, they just won't display outside the armor whilst you're wearing it .
---
People tell furious +50% damage on 10th shot and it beat Anti-armor (\~+30% damage) on 6-8th shot. But I dont know is it work for pvp. Is it anti-armor work for pvp at all
---
how do we find you if we don't know your PSN?
---
I have heard the 50 cal is better for pvp since it has a much harder fire rate. It is harder for other plays to dodge
---
**OHGODNO** It's stuck in my head aga-♫*AN ICE COLD NUKA COLA!*♫
---
I saw 2 AWESOME camps outside Flatwoods tonight omg! I went to see if anyone was home to say Hi, but when there wasn't, I walked through their homes, not sure if that was ok. I didn't touch anything...i'm a really low level and just have a 2 room shack, so I just oggled their creativity. Holy cow!
---
Thanks! But what effect is better for that, aa or F?
---
Now is Harper's Ferry the only places those mods might be or are there other vendors where I might find them?
---
I would think anti armor. Also if yiure pvping you will want perks to increase stagger to counter sentinal and cav armor. I believe one gun army works for heavy guns. Not 100% sure though
---
I'll be selling everything I get for 10 caps or so.
---
I have so much crap lol
---
Plus I'll be selling starter pocketed gear as well for the new people

I enjoy the game very much.  It is stable now and 95% of the bugs are ironed out.
---
But with work comes the earning of money, Money can be exchanged for goods and services.
---
Wow, your CAMP looks awesome! I'm honestly impressed you were able to fit so much with the budget. Can we see some pictures of the inside? :O
---
Thanks, man. Why you think anti-armor?
---
You're so innocent. You know there are already trading subs since day one, right?
---
Pretty sure he means the recall card.
---
Uh oh....Should I not have scrapped the one I found randomly?
---
Guess that means PA users are Chad's then?

Psssh I got at least 4 legendary Junkies rolling pins and a handful of legendary nocturnal boards. Try to control your envy.

---
Adrenaline *5 and an Instigating Combat Knife make Whitesprings fun
---
Furious takes a long time to build up, so its harder to get the dmg boost. And in pvp I would assume a lot of people are running around it high resistance armor. And that sucks a lot of dmg away from lower dmg higher rate of fire guns. Running Stabilized with an AA gun would give you like an 80 or 90% armor ignor
---
I'm willing to help. all I really do is just walk around and help low levels level up. PSN is Deamonium_Diebus. Anyone can add me.
---
No kidding, I always get mods that fix energy and flame damage in Fallout 4 so that they are given out appropriately. The original Shishkebab in Fallout 3 dealt fire damage and ignited enemies after hits but as soon as Fallout 4 came out they got lazy and made it energy damage turning it into a horrible weapon.
---
Where on the map?

I am more concerned with vats crit players than heavy weapons, or gamma guns.  Honestly, I leave the heavy guns for PVE.

They made a correction in the last few days on [Fallout 76: Inside the Vault – Pioneer Scouts and Backpacks – April 25, 2019
---
](https://bethesda.net/en/article/4aSpwjqqwDZqD3JD6ecTT/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-pioneer-scouts-and-backpacks-april-25-2019).
---
&gt;Correction: Backpacks are unequipped when entering a set of Power Armor.
---
The main menu will always say when it's going offline. This says 10:00 am EDT
---
Well most people don't really pay attention or believe what dataminers.  
---
In all honesty, I simply forgot that it was datamined during the beta. I'd love to see some more mods for the Crossbow as well, as a prime receiver is alright, but its missing other stuff..   
---
Here's hoping this does come to fruition only time shall tell friend.
---
Oh yeah, I loved the Sheepsquatch and the quests surrounding the myth and lore of the Sheepsquatch... Then boom! there it is.. in all of its demonic glory. I love it.  
---
Definitely hope we see something like this tomorrow.
---
I suspect the weight dependence for ranged weapons isn't real either. Attributes like sight transition times and VATS cost are directly adjusted by weapon mods.
---
Problem with Stabilized is that power armor sucks for any real PVP. Lack of Legendaries really hurts, and you want to run Assasins/Sen/Cal if at all possible.
---
THATS so cooooooool I setup infront of the Nuka factory if only the ground won't on a slant I would LOVE to do this! SO AWESOME.
---
Add me if you’d like. I play daily and don’t mind company or following others around to help out.
---
Oh for sure. I run a van sent set. But I do miss Stabilized
---
This one is outside whitespring station. Yours could be here, or anywhere. Drive throughs are an American tradition.
---
PSN is SlugsNClips
---
i just use it sometimes for the SbQ fight but 99% off the time the PA I use is the excavator due to the wieght gain, cant beat up runing around with a 580 pounds weight limit.
---
I’ve seen most in Harpers Ferry, but Watoga sometimes has them too. The ones for Excavator doesn’t say Excavator, just the part name, like ‘calibrated shock’, but you can tell by its scrap component, it’s the only one comes with black titanium.
---
I have 50 Free Watoga notes, I'm wondering if anyone would buy one.
---
But I may not get (m)any visitors, since my camp is at the top of Seneca Rocks, and is harder to reach without Marsupial and Strange In Numbers.
---
What's rubber used for? Haha, I' always find I have like 300 rubber, so I'm always tossing it out..
---
you're right! I was only curious, i had a camp south of whitesprings for a while. Id like to make one up by CMF i love the garage doors
---
What needs to be done is change the energy damage to flame damage, add a burning effect for damage over time after hit like Fallout 3 and then allow the perk Friendly Fire (The perk that heals teammates with flame damage) to work with it. I know not alot of enemies have huge flame resistance so the flame change would improve the weapon to the tier it was meant to be.
---
I will work harder!
---
This is amazing! 3 questions:
---
1. Where is your camp? I really want to pay a visit.
---
2. Do you accept clipboards as payment?
---
3. How did you manage to put so many things inside? Is your budget made of rubber?
---
We*
---
lol no idea what they worth, could be based on item value, so maybe they are nearly worthless. I stopped dumping them at vendor bots after they announced the recycle machine is coming.
---
Yup, whenever I find a locked door, I HAVE to find a way inside. Can't help myself.
---
But we cant vats other player now before first shoot. And this first shoot is critical
---
&gt; Non-explosive heady weapons are underpowered
---
Ugh, you did mean the exact opposite? All of the explosive weapons deal too little damage for the expensive and heavy ammo they require. Missile launchers deal laughably low damage per shot, and mininukes aren't much better at all, and they have horrendously expensive crafting requirements. The grenade launcher (not the auto version, but does count as heavy though) is not remotely worth using, and the auto grenade launcher is... underwhelming, even though it's a direct upgrade over the non-auto grenade launcher.
---
The minigun, flamer, and cryolater are the only high ammo usage vs crafting cost non-explosive heavy weapons. Everything else takes a substantial amount of time to expend your ammo, as the ammo usage isn't that significant, or the ammo is much more readily available or easy to craft. You're doing something seriously wrong if you think otherwise.
---
The Exotic Weapons card has been mentioned before between loading screens with the tips.
---
The way I read that is 30 different items, or a stack of 30 of 1 item. Nowhere does it clearly state u can sell a stack of 1 item and it counts as 1 item.
---
Cheap tactic, pretty damn expensive material wise. 
---
Gotta love the downvotes though.
---
Bear Necessities lol
---
Sorry, but i just do not trust other player camps. Even if they say they are traders after the new update i would be very weary to enter.
---
I want to get off Mr Howard's wild ride
---
I mean, for a standard player once you got your armor/weapons all decked out, there’s no reason to keep extra legendaries and they’ll probably be sold again for quick caps.
---
Well tuned from playing instruments.
---
Yes!  Please.
---
Interesting. Appreciate the anecdote.
---
All heavy dmg perks in strenght + shield card for recistense when you fire,  granadier in perception, demoliton expert + stabalize in intellect, Bloody mess + the one that can make heavy wep dmg stagger and cripple the enemies in luck 🤙
---
But you can be so vindictive; years later you get to watch his mother die at the hands of radroaches. Then watch him suffer. The most malicious PvP. Evil karma gained.
---
I have a slight slant. I just built through. As in life, sometimes you gotta take a few speedbumps to get to the thing you want.
---
Touché.
---
Player vending as in a player being able to sell their food/junk/goods for caps? I presume before only trade was allowed? I haven't gotten the game yet either. I've been looking and waiting until it got to a better place \[seems like its getting better\] or on steam.
---
It's come a long way. I'm having fun.
---
Uhhhhh, yeah.  Like my dad back in the day.  :-( .....
---
Slider should be to the left im on console but noticed in the forest since last update or 2 theres a horrible blur with the scenery not so much in other regions.
---
That's gold. Damn this community has some creative folks innit! Great job. I'm going to put roller doors on the four wooden slabs I tentatively call a "base".
---
For me, combat armor and trapper armor crafting for scrapping for mods.
---
They are realising a vending machin that you can buold at your camp and flag items in your stash box for sale. When the machin is on it will show your camp on the map as well as an over veiw of what you're selling. They will be taking a 10% convinces fee from all sales. Also I believe they are making your camp indistructable outside of pvp
---
Oh that sounds pretty nice, specially the camp being unable to be destroyed. I wasn't very good at making good looking settlements in Fallout 4, though I've seen some creative shots from some around here.
---
WS was on fire just now. If I hadn’t run out of bullets I would have kept going. Need to do a melee build one day
---
You are thinking of the Marine Tactical Helmet.
---
[](/celestiafrown)They had a the travel mat in the beta. From what I understand it had some major issues. They prolly haven't ironed those out yet, but they did add back in radios from the beta, so you never know.
---
It is “janky” for the first minute after load in.   Otherwise it is generally good.
---
By the whitesprings train station. 
---
An American never turns down any capital gains. Clipboards included. 
---
I believe you get a little more budget each level. Im just under 80. I have one turret that ill get rid of for the vending machine. Also im using lighting, color, and i lay my props out to keep your eyes moving.
---
I was running around using my instigating Gatling gun, bullets are really easy to make. I basically gave up as I figured I had enough at the moment and trying to outrun ghouls when you're over encumbered is kinda hard lol
---
And hookers!
---
Shit, did I say that out loud?
---
Fun fact: I started this game entirely with the intent of being a player trader. You can imagine my excitement with vending machines. I enjoy building bases. This has just kicked me in the bum enough to rebuild into some kind of elaborate monstrosity to showcase my vending machine haha
---
its an exclusive drop from the event. it only seems to spawn at level 30. it is not very useful as a drop.. mostly because the lack of level scaling
---
*You
---
Oh ok thanks for clarifying do you have any idea what it’s worth?
---
Even if you can't bulk it, simply putting up you entire stock for a set price would work. Got 400 5.56, selling for 200c? Sure. Can't buy a different amount, but it also doesn't require them to add a new option to bulk. IDK what is easier.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Meteoritic_sword
---
Each added piece reduces the blur effect. With that, each piece improves stealth.
---
[](/celestiasup)Wonder if it's gunslinger with the pistol grip then.
---
Yep I'm on about 560lbs lol
---
Still you can see now hostility at all, this community is great.
---
IMO. not much. unless you can sell it to a collector.
---
One gun army is the cripple perk
---
Exactly, thanks, forgot the name 🤣
---
If min price is 1 cap per bullet, like the trade window, ammo that isn't 556 or shotgun shells won't sell at all in these machines
---
So you somehow had three scorchbeasts around you, set down the controller and made this post, hoping that someone would see it, log on to their PS, add you as a friend, go through the loading screen, fast travel to you, and help you? Dude that's like 20 minutes. You really gonna sit there and hide for that long? Just run away.
---
Depends on how good of a shot you are, and how much ammo ya wanna blow through. but I stick with my .50 cal. 
---
Bloodied would be my preferred weapon, but im stuck with a 1*furious atm for the .50.
---
Either way, lmgs aren’t the best PvP weapon imo, and work better if you’re in a group. Basically all the modifiers you can stack on enemies. Meat tenderizer, cripple, etc.
---
Lol that one is always a must for me when I'm using heavy guns
---
Launched my first nuke thanks to you. Much appreciated!
---
Heres a pro tip - if you are running low on FCs, and you have a strong enough weapon/troubleshooter weapon, whitespring has all the Fusion Cores you will ever need.   
---
Each sentry bot will 100% drop a fusion core once you   
---
a) kill it   
---
b) let it explode  
---
Run back in and snatch your guaranteed FC.   
---
There are always at least 3-4 sentry bots around Whitesprings and its surrounds, plus another wild one up the road to the north near the big train crash.   
---
Whenever Im running low, a few runs of this with some server hopping gives me everything I need.
---
You've played almost 200 levels without being able to sprint?!?! Please consult a weight management specialist.
---
Id love to see that. I found a player camp near the whitesprings station that was set up as a trading post. Coolest thing I've seen and I always get excited when I see a stationary player there. I forgot the tag but it was on PSN.
---
Put your glasses back on
---
Yea ive figured, i just made a heavy PA character ( my 3rd, got 2 other 200+ chars ), and honestly when you start getting those heavy perks, its a real blast and you are hard as f#$k, awsome for low lvl pushing harder zones/enemies, at lvl 28 i beat a lvl 50 legendary sheepsquatch who was roaming in ashheap, and i was like: i Think im in love with this character rn!
---
Entering and exiting the pipboy sometimes fixes that 30 yard blur. When it doeant fix I have to quit, it kind of makes me nausous.
---
I got this game for free like a week to two weeks ago and I haven’t really played much, honestly I was expecting to see Sea of Thieves amounts of griefing where everyone I saw just shot me to death to steal all of my stuff, but this new patch is pretty great because it’ll introduce a lot of player interaction with people. Whether it’s just dropping by to sell that useless 1* Legendary or to see how someone builds their C.A.M.P, hopefully the servers won’t be so empty or people won’t be so spread out anymore.
---
You can covert it back to hardened or scorched killer receivers for now, and prime it again once you get the plan drop. According to some youtubers’ tests, for the Handmade there’s no to little damage difference between hardened and prime. The extra work in making the ultracite ammo may not worth it (Bethesda really should buff the ultracite ammo).
---
I had a level 1 two shot hunting rifle, but it's kinda pointless. You're basically level 5 by the time you leave flatwoods an hour into the game, and everything you run into goes down in a few hits of the least powerful weapons in the meantime. I think i gave it away because it wasn't even worth the hassle to load onto new alts. I just play the game legit until level 15 and then pass myself some raider PA and other goodies. Raider PA, and a lv 15 1* bloodied fire axe are all you need to cruise max level enemies at whitesprings. I just roll with that kit until level 50 and then it's the big leagues
---
developers forgot to give them to me
---
Yet.. Here you are. On a subreddit for this "shitty game".
---
Says a lot about you as a person, huh?
---
Pathetic.
---
Must be nice to just be a cynical prick with nothing good to offer. Enjoy that lifestyle!
---
I hate wheels on console! Bring back the expanded d-pad menu from Fallout 4
---
"I hope people can fast travel too me" ... "because I like to stay away from others." 
---
Pick one bruh.
---
uh uh uh... Blackjack and hookers!
---
Indeed, I've noticed it a few times. Possibly that it's sitting in the games files, waiting... for something like this. Who knows.
---
My PS4 pro crashes way more often than pre-patch. Also the legendary drops has obviously been nerfed. Nearly all three star creatures drop only one star item. If it’s a three star item it’s a three-star stalker’s melee garbage.
---
after having some screws loose.
---
In the old days of Everquest you could give enemy an weapon and it would use it and drop it at death. Some kind soul decided to craft lots of good quality weapons and gave them to all enemies in the newbie zone. It did not end well for newbies, when the enemy DPS went up the roof.
---
What. The. Fuck.
---
There go half my fucking excitement for tomorrow...
---
Both heavy gunner and demo expert work on an explosive Gatling. I have a TSE one and can have checked the damage to confirm it is affected by both
---
I'm level 68, and same here!
---
Can't wait to sell my massive collection of bobble heads, comics, magazines, &amp; Plans/Recipes....I have thousands....well... hundreds at least. If you're a Pvp-er don't expect the pvp magazines to be cheap...if you want an edge you will have to pay for it, took time to find all of these and they will be priced accordingly by rarity, supply,&amp; demand.
---
I'll also have some explosive weapons for sale, but not for a couple weeks, have to sell off the other stuff first.
---
Subscribe to "vidro game pope" on youtube. He covers atom store updates and sales and buys/shows off a lot of it
---
1- She doesn’t take workshops, hence “she is missing out”
---
2-Before release the devs said you take already claimed workshops by engaging in PvP. Problem is, people aren’t taking the workshops, they’re just using it to engage in PvP.  So it is not being used as intended. 
---
And that’s discounting the engage in PvP on the other side of the map from the workshop exploit.
---
[](/celestiasmug)Well there is *technically* 4 star legendaries. The Sacrificial Blade mod for the machete, and the Scorched Killer mods apparently add a star. Maybe the legendary vendor will sell us more legendary mods we can apply.
---
Sometimes its a vats glitch, try vats-ing something.
---
meh no bother, they can stack up 5k of them for all I care lol. They arent permanent.
---
From what we've seen from datamining, probably just another 100 pounds, and even if it were 150 pounds, it really wouldn't at all be that significant stability wise, especially as you can technically carry more than that while being overburdened. This is a design decision, and whatever their reasoning is, it's not because of stability. It's a completely ass decision.
---
This would be pretty awesome.
---
Not sure how many people would be interested but I would.
---
Some of the more 'elaborate' foods give pretty decent bonuses, if I can pop some caps to my local and grab some quick and tasty grub I would use them more often.
---
Wait backpacks tomarrow? Holy shizz
---
Found them!  Thanks!
---
My main is an enclave scientist who worked for the DoD. To continue research, he found it necessary to begin anew outside the vault/bunkers in order to gather more firsthand data.
---
My alt was a Vault-tec representative who was able to buy his way into 76. Being a businessman, his new goal is to take advantage of the opportunities the wasteland has to offer and to establish himself as a new wasteland mogul.
---
Haven't given terribly much more thought than this, but this is the gist.
---
Who needs 3 star drops when you can trade in your one star rolling pins and buy your three star god roll at the purveyor’s 👌
---
Are the legendary scrapping machines coming today? Because even in my excavator, with all my weight perks maxed I'm still encumbered with the amount of script fodder I've been hoarding...
---
The Legendary Blender
---
Fare thee well my mules, you hath served me well
---
Well, I'm pretty miffed about it now as apparently backpacks will not function while in power armor. They updated their Inside the Vault article with this:
---
**Please Note: This article previously stated that Backpacks will remain function while wearing Power Armor.
---
This was incorrect. Backpacks are unequipped and do not offer any benefits while you are in Power Armor. We apologize for the miscommunication and have made this correction below, as well.**
---
The new 'Ever Upwards' questline.
---
Hopefully it will bring not just the 'main' questline but a few 'repeatables' or 'dailies' to add a bit of variety.
---
Having been locked out of the dailies in The Mire for months my catalogue of 'dailies' looks a bit bleak now.
---
Ditto! I really can't wait for the refrigerated backpacks even. Anything to make all of the possible food combos remotely worthwhile. At this point, I don't bother unless I somehow have 4/5 of the ingredients. But Beth obviously cared enough to include the countless recipes, it's nist sad they aren't practical.
---
[](/celestiahurt)I'm presently over encumbered with 1700lbs of legendaries, and a full stash. Honestly, the legendary grinder/kiosk/turn in station/whatever it is, is what I'm looking forward to the most urgently.  
---
God, I can't wait to fast travel again.
---
It's still not an exploit, no matter how much you repeat it. And it doesn't matter if someone actually takes the workshop. No rule states that you have to. If she's worried about "missing out" because she doesn't get to do the PVP thing, perhaps she should try to find an interest in PVP
---
Which is exactly why i don’t buy PA skins any more, not until Bethesda gives PA some balance.
---
Hi! If you're playing with two-handed melee weapon, you should focus on the following strength perks: slugger (1 star is good), expert slugger (1 star is good), master slugger (1 star is good), incisor (all stars if you can), Martial artist (at least 1 star).
---
For the 3 first perks (sluggers' perk), prefer to have 1 star on each instead of 3 stars on one. Each perk at 1 star brings +10% damage with two-handed melee weapon ;).
---
Forget the blackjack and the 10% tax. Lol
---
I would if there was a junk pile i could use, lol!
---
[](/celestiafrown)Junkies? Does that work in 76? I feel like my addictions always go away on their own.
---
Agreed, just making sure you didn’t think they were coming tomorrow. Had me thinking Bethesda was giving them to us early lol
---
Really i didn't know that that's insane and i hope so i think it'll be exciting to see what comes out just 8hrs to go
---
When you go into Huntersville and think: "This is a quaint little town, the people must've loved it here." You open a terminal in the building just outside the super mutant camp and find personal logs talking about how Vault-Tek decided to come to their little town. Vault-Tek poisoned their water supply or the air they breathe and slowly but surely all of them turn to super mutants.
---
The guy who wrote the personal logs was just so happy to see his little town get so much attention.
---
They might be in the future.
---
Said that 3\* legendaries are already a reliable source of friction and upset due to balancing issues.
---
Dropping 5\* legendaries before they can get the existing prefixes wherever they think they have to be is not going to make matters any better.
---
a  friend was telling me  it works for players who pop tons of pills and the gun seriously stacks dmg when used with the right chems and such, and the ffr is better than explosive cos the fire rate outweighs the explosive dmg output and allows you to move 5 perk points elsewhere
---
Dude... wieght shaming. Lol
---
Capitalism should work itself out on its on.
---
If you're on PS4 I'll be sure to stop by
---
That's dedication! Are you on PS4 by chance?
---
Oh yes, the fabled Legendary Blender. I hear is drops 50 gears and 25 screws when scrapped
---
😂 joking but same. It'll really clear out my stash
---
Do you play on PS4 I'll definitely stop by
---
Oh good.  I'll check them out, thanks
---
Is that your grandpas coat?
---
I found a great post on this: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/  
---
This actually sounds awesome! I'm going to get nice and drugged up before I start the update tomorrow.
---
r/technicallythetruth
---
Now listen here buddy. Lol
---
I had the best luck at the random spawn location above Pricketts fort. Spawn in go straight up the road til it ends, then go north west till you reach the rocks. I’m sure you can google the spawn point for a better description. I think it took me about a dozen hops before I got him. It’s funny because now I see him all over the place.
---
I don't even trust the regular mechanic for dropping loot - all mobs are supposed to drop the weapon they're carrying, can't tell you how many times I've been stabbed with a pitchfork that looked a lot, a lot, like a knife
---
What was the recycle machine? I must have missed it. (Also for people who cant be bothered looking it up
---
The beam splitter makes it shoot additional shots like a shotgun right? does this mean when it has a beam splitter that it is effected by shotgun perks?
---
Also, does the beam splitter make the durability decrease a faster than a rifle without it?
---
I believe you just have to make a build around what type of weapon youre using. I dont think theres any energy specific perks for dmg or durability.
---
For strength you will want 15 points. 9 for the slugger, 3 for Incisor and 3 for martial artist. Each point of strength increases melee damage by 5 and you get extra carry weight. Then you will want the mutation twisted muscles and adrenaline reaction. Those are most important and there are a lot more to help with survivability.  Then you will want radicool to increase your strength even more irradiate yourself to 20 percent health and equip nerd rage. Grab a bloodied super sledge and a boat load of diluted stimpacks and you will be on your way to hiting like a truck. Add on the standard bloodied mess and adrenaline and that’s it you will have massive damage.
---
"For every other type of weapon, you will basically never run out of ammo if you just play the game regularly and loot every body you find" so you don't play the game, then? 
---
Seriously, that is such laughable bullshit it hurts. I loot every body I find. I then mine for a shitload of lead and grind a shitload of guns for steel to make enough rounds. 
---
Seriously...what the fuck.
---
I might be wrong but I think on one of the overseers Holo tapes she frets about how everyone is fighting each other and launching nukes. This idea that everyone would work together after leaving the vault goes directly against the writing/story of the game.
---
I need an explosive compound bow in my life.
---
Move it 2 inches to the right, it will only cost you some caps and everything will be repaired
---
Basically, they see something that actually works and is fun, and go "nah" and nerf it. That's the only 'balance fix' this dev team knows how to do, it's fucking sad.
---
Man after reading all of these comments I'm really starting to think that if this goes well the social climate of this game is going to change for the better.  It seems that this may be the thing that gets players to interact with each other more and more. Fingers crossed this goes well.  See you all in the wastes tomorrow.
---
I like this but it doesn't mean I trust it...
---
Great idea, I’d love to know how much a shielded plan for the BOS underarmour is worth along with the BOS P.A paints plans, I haven’t got a clue what anything is worth in this game lol
---
Tried that but for whatever reason it has stuff placed in random spots and it scrapped most my pieces. It left me with way less materials. Idk wtf happened. This is the weirdest bug I’ve ever encountered.
---
After tomorrow’s update only the first foundation has to be anchored.  All other foundations can float.   If you want a ton of flat space build out on a lake or off a cliff.
---
What is the name of the mod?
---
Im going to recreate my camp i finally learned how to make an underwater entrance
---
Yea. The degree of the nerf was insane, and somehow they thought almost balancing everything around ore and acid was somehow going to encourage people to still take them over. It's way more of a hassle than getting getting scrap, and they didn't even generate that much to begin with, so the nerf was completely out of nowhere and not remotely justified. If they wanted to nerf things a little, they should have just reduce the amount you got per hour a bit. Granted, you can get more with some ores, and acid isn't at all that hard to get if you know how, but the cost to smelt nuclear ore is insane and hardly worth it at all. It's more a forced time sink if anything.
---
I wouldn't mind smelting so much if we could craft more than 1 fucking thing at a time. Pressing X 350+ times is *SOOOOOO* much fun.
---
...welp. Fuck the asshole who made THAT decision.
---
any time! the game made it to balance something, so its worth figuring out :)
---
Yeah, due to that post, before they went back and "fixed" it.
---
yes?
---
I’ll trade you my furious black powder rifle
---
&gt; If she's worried about "missing out" because she doesn't get to do the PVP thing, perhaps she should try to find an interest in PVP
---
I'm going to assume that you are deliberately being obtuse.
---
Plans no longer wiegh anything anymore as far as i noticed when looking through all my known ones
---
2 hours is the time it took to choose where to put my first foundation:)
---
there are about 10-15 bags of it on the top of the monorail elevator, at the eastern end of the monorail, that’s where i always go and it lasts me for up to two camp builds
---
Yep the legendary scrapping machines are coming today 👍
---
Bog town, and big bend.
---
The guide book, which is a bit outdated, mentions the perk for exotic weapon. It says it was needed to craft crossbows and black powder rifles. I do not have the book with me, but I remember vaguely reading that. I do not remember seeing anything about bows.
---
I appreciate it man I’m feeling the same
---
Awesome thank you!! Where do I find the monorail on the map? Sorry for the dumb question🙈
---
Big bend? Is that a location. Thank you 😊
---
I had heard about that, hadn't thought about in a lake. As for the cliff, I'm not really a fan of floating buildings.
---
An excruciatingly slow death!
---
No.
---
Found it! Sorry mind blank. Didn’t realise you meant the tunnel. Thank you 😊
---
southern part of the savage divide, there’s that picture of a red structure on the map, that’s the place :)
---
How many times do you have to server hop? 15-20 times? More?
---
I would buy food from my own vending machine if this is possible.
---
The increase in Flamer and Cryo fuel from x5. Its a small thing but somthing I’ve wanted since launch so it’s good to see it finally happen.
---
Thank you very much! Have a good day, happy hunting! 😊
---
If you’re using two shot, then yes, otherwise I have no problem most of the time
---
Plasma weapons are getting a buff in today’s patch so they will probably be your best bet. I would steer clear of laser weapons until they get a much needed buff or unless you find a really badasss legendary.
---
Normally I'm against it but FFS
---
I found one dupe glitch during patch 6. Reported and never retested since, but it was a duping method that was still working after the duping crisis was mostly solved. Good thing it was super obscure and hard to find. Bad thing it was an instantious disconnect+inventory rollback and I sumbled upon in on accident - wasted an hour thinking servers suck.
---
I basically give them away and during the Queen event people tend to put them in the suitcase at the train station and we take what we don't have.  Until some selfish asshole comes at takes them all then fast travels away
---
I'm using bloodied. Wonder if survival servers are just total shit
---
Wait what do u mean? That us grinding ghols is a bad thing? Im not sure what ur argument is?
---
Are you sure the scouts are in patch 9? All the patch 9 preview talks about is player vending and the legendary exchange?
---
Ah, I see. Don't use armor that much since I got the Mistress of Mysteries regalia. Thanks for the info.
---
So do we know if food will expire in player vending machines?
---
It was the same in Fallout 4, never seemed quite right to me. Suppose it’s one of those weapons that doesn’t really fit into any certain category very well, it’s a cool weapon though :)
---
The gym up in grafton. Has a ton of basketballs in the gym.
---
...Well that sucks. Damn.
---
Funny thing is that I actually encountered him during the Free Range event for the very first time 😁
---
I am glad I am not the only one who was crushed when my camp was destroyed. I was alone, doing my own thing, on the right hand side of the map on a little cliff just east of Site Alpha. And these griefers came through and just decimated it. I quit the came and cried... It was so sudden and I worked hard to find a good spot that had enough room for everything. And then bam... gone.   
---
I had enough to build it back after 3 days of farming and bartering... but it took a lot and made me hate the game a little.   
---
My last griefer was supposed to be a friend of mine... they used the "on the same team" loophole to get around my pacifist and had a friend steal my stuff after he asked me to help him with materials. I haven't played much since...
---
You can turn your Legendary Stuff into Mole-Man-Money in the recycle machine tomorrow.  Then in two weeks (I think) you can buy Legendaries from the Mole-Man with Mole-Man-Money.
---
Excuse me, would u care to elaborate?
---
Mothman isnt real, he cant hurt you 
---
Mothman:
---
Honestly im going to just sell them really cheap for lower leveled players
---
Nope.
---
I'll admit to being someone whose camp is outside Charleston Station.
---
I'm pretty much in the same spot as OP. Sitting in the field by the pond.
---
Can confirm that the random events still occur around it. Have had a couple of fallen satellites to the left in the clearing behind the abandoned houses. And other weird collections of bots and dogs.
---
Haven't had the trader bot come through yet.
---
I hear that the you will get a better deal scrapping legendaries with more stars at the machine coming in todays patch so might be best just doing that. Can’t see it really being viable otherwise, still a cool find though and I’ve never seen it before this.
---
Glad I’m not the only one
---
I’m level 89, so I’m pretty sure I have enough playtime to know what I’m talking about. Also shotgun shells are plentiful, literally had to drop 2k from just hoarding it over time. I use shotgun primarily on my other character and I have NEVER needed to craft a single shotgun shell.
---
Taking mobs from ppl that are there while u are across the map is wrong i dont care if u have a camp there just dont have turrets. If ur low level follow someone most will let u tag mobs for xp and loot
---
With the shotgun I used better critical and four leave clover and grim reaper sprint . Is it still wise to use VATS with melee?
---
If he's a synth that makes him a mineral I think.
---
I think I may as well keep it and maybe but it in a display case which is coming up because it is so light
---
Thanks, that actually helps
---
I stand by my previous comment, even if he is a synth he is still not a plant.
---
I think it depends on the variant. Some are passive, others are aggressive on site.
---
Are you a primary melee character or something? 
---
I have not ever, in my 170ish levels, been in a position where I brought in more rounds of a type I actually use than I expend killing mobs.
---
Outraged about something for no reason, got it.
---
I hope we'll be able to sell our plans, recipes, as well as ammo 😊
---
Maybe but some 3 Star weapons are already pretty OP with the right combination. I bet they will add more legendary effects first like they did with the FO4 dlc to make it harder to get the best effects.
---
Imagine storing our most valuable foods and then setting up ridiculous prices so that nobody would accidentally buy them 😁
---
I didn't even notice them in the shop until yesterday. 
---
I know I definitely won't be using my hard earned Atoms on something I can do for free by finding mats in game.
---
Came here for the comments. Was not disappointed
---
🎺🎺🎺
---
The same! Now you're kind of invited if the vending is on.
---
My main reached 188 yesterday, though... :)
---
I love building camps if you want help! Lol my psn is gofukyurslf326 if you want some help
---
I found Helvetia a decent area to hang out in the early days, lots of 308 ammo and hunting rifles from the Scorched that spawn there.
---
Yeah!
---
I fail to see the problem with setting up a camp near a land mark. I do it sll the time to save caps
---
Am I being trolled or is your PSN just one of the most savage gamer tag of all time?
---
One tip, mention your platform.
---
MOLE MAN MONEY
---
Are the backpacks going to be random plans?
---
Or will you get them by starting a quest?
---
I read that you must read a note from the Stations in order to join the backpack dudez, any other info?
---
I find him most often near overseers still.
---
My name is Ashton Garvey. Former Park Ranger and highly decorated Police Chief. Had a family before the war but they didn't get entry into the Vault. Always wanted to move to Boston but never happened. Fan of Western movies.
---
People in Appalachia are gone, my fellow Vault Dwellers need help rebuilding, and I have a plan to get that help for everyone. Create a group that will help these settlements. With the rise of raiders, we will need a group that will protect the people at a minute's notice.
---
He spawns in random places I found during free range also scorched earth and 4 times in the mire lol if you want the lemonade recipes I have a few extra I'm on ps4
---
Fair point can't believe I forgot it. Thank you
---
instigating lever action
---
Ammo is the big one for me
---
I have one and it's awesome willing to sell it for the right price
---
Might have to move our camps over there to stop the turret towers.
---
My very last Fasnacht event run granted me an Assassin's Dragon rifle with 200x4 unmodified damage. I still use it particularly against other players. It usually one-shoots players, especially when I pair it with a sneak and critical attacks ❤
---
but when do you set vangars/sents full set going for 150-200 bucks should tell you something.
---
yes, have to keep the Cryolator ammo cold or it could explode.
---
The question is, if you sell something in your vending machine, will the caps go straight to your  account? And disappear into oblivion if you are at max caps?
---
Or will you have to collect it manually?
---
😂 i got that
---
Can you clean up the grammar? I don’t know what that was trying to say
---
Grabbing all them creepy ass garden gnomes
---
How much you wanting?
---
As long as you’re aiming down the sights, the enemy isn’t underwater, and you’re not experiencing recoil - it usually hits.
---
I remember not even five minutes after I finally gathered the resources to build my fusion generator how full speed charging through the woods came some wastelander who in one glance destroyed it and set me back another day and a half
---
Items dont go to the vending machines it all stays in your stash.
---
Too bad about the 30 item limit.
---
Uuuuh... he’s kinda of suggesting he’d like them to be refrigerated in there... that was sorta the point of his post... lol
---
Wait what... they were fucked up at some point?
---
Lol add me you'll see I don't mess around lol
---
Try increasing your perception with the Unyielding Armor, chems like the Orange Mentats and Sweetwater Special Blend tea. Getting the Eagle Eyes mutation and using a long range firearms also wouldn't hurt 😏
---
I'd love it if that was actually a viable way to get viable gear. Unfortunately, the system's so broken that if you don't actively grind for legendary gear you are almost never going to get anything "good". 
---
And when the game is designed around end bosses that _can't be killed_ with non-epic gear, and people get fucking angry when you show up with gear that doesn't do a lot of damage and "sponge"...
---
you wrote that ( This is not the same as a real world currency )
---
then I wrote that ( but when do you sets from vangars/sents going for 150-200 bucks should tell you something.)
---
took some (s) and (full set) out from the original post. I hope you understand it now.
---
If we're ever on at the same time (living in Australia), I'd be happy to join youse for the lore, adventuring and building! 
---
I'm currently level 99 but I still consider myself a noob, especially when gaming with others 😂
---
My PSN is the same as the one here!
---
Try a staggering minigun, you can't even move or use a stimpak. Just sitting there watching your character get stunlocked and being able to do nothing about it while your health gets chunked away. Feelsbadman
---
It's the turret camps that kill everything in the club house before other people can get a hit in, it's lazy and rude.
---
Yeah, I may have to move my camp from south of silo alpha.  I don't get much traffic there.  😎
---
I can confirm this is a bug as it just happened to me!! :( :(
---
3\* Marine Chameleon Left leg with sentinel!!! Pretty gutted.
---
In my case a couple of weird things seem to have happened so not sure what is a symptom or a cause.
---
1. It was my first nuke launch (launched from alpha base) - so pretty gutted this happened, left a sour note on an otherwise awesome experience.
---
2. I died fighting the SBQ (I was adding people from the social tab to join the event) - and somehow I was pretty much one shot - still not sure how that happened!
---
3. When I respawned, as well as my junk being dropped, my underarmor (shielded bos) was also dropped and I retrieved from my bag - I suspect that this is when my armor went missing I can't be sure. Perhaps someone took it but I'm pretty doubtful as everything else was in the bag.
---
4. My power armor seemed to rename itself - I have several sets which I've renamed so I know what is on the frame and the one in my inventory had somehow renamed itself from "\*Excavator Power Armor" to "'T51b Power Armor" (the one in my stash ie. the real T51b, was named the same thing so). Re-logging fixed the naming thing but my Left leg was still gone.
---
Is there an official way to bug report this to bethesda?
---
If somebody is buying this stuff on eBay
---
1. That doesn’t affect the cap market in game.
---
2. Is absurd especially at that price
---
3. Isn’t really related to what we were talking about
---
&gt;useless "Junkie"
---
[](/celestiahurt)Does +50% damage sound useless to you? What if I told you you don't even have to run around with half your health bar missing, or no armor? This future could be yours! Just shove these needles in your arm, down a few pills with a whiskey chaser, and relax.  
---
Honestly, I just read [this amazing post](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bclykn/yabs_junkie_guide_or_how_i_learned_to_stop/), and honestly I can't wait to start going through player vending machines looking for Junkies weapons.

You're on reddit, not Club Penguin. You can say "fucking."

Isn’t that ceramic?
---
Junkies is generally considered kinda trash by most people tbh
---
Sounds like an x-com dev handywork.
---
You also can't drop the camera after completing the quest or it gets broken
---
Seen him in the mire next to the as alum 3 times so far
---
I’ve been leaning on my furious handmade hard lately. Need to do some grinding for lead and gunpowder to build it up again.
---
No, I have a character built specially for rifles and shotguns and I have never needed to craft any shotgun shells.
---
Racial damage huh? Elaborate.
---
Yeah I end up spawning in alot of bases on Senneca Rock when it cant place me. I stay in the world just to check out what another person is doing in the same spot. Its a pain getting there so usually there are only cool bases up there.
---
The offending camps are generally turret bases - they WANT a bunch of monsters heading for their camp.
---
No they are actual rad resist. Idk who is giving you that information but they use the same effect that hazmat suits use just with a different modified. The name of the legendary effect is even "Hazmat's"
---
Well, I have been stockpiling all the salt I've found the last 2 weeks
---
Haha alright. I sent you a request
---
Well aren't you special? That's not the average users experience, based on _literally everyone I've ever spoken to but you_ on this subject. 
---
Personally, I use a 5.56 and a shotgun, and a 10mm, and the only gun I never craft for is the 10mm, because I only use it on low level trash mobs which can be one shot.
---
I’m just really hoping for some posts on here from people who suddenly realized nobody wants any of the hundreds of uber common recipes they’ve been saving for hundreds of hours but maybe I’m just a dick 🤷‍♂️
---
I think there was some data mining suggesting two dailies and an event so if that’s true lucky you
---
I've blown through so much trying to get some addictions and never have, what's the % of getting one?
---
Just have been doing that today. I added a small room, half open, detached from my main home, with a cooking station, stash box and the "friends welcome" lights.
---
All I have right now is the vault boy pointing into the door, I wish I could get the friends welcome sign because I'd love for more people to visit.
---
I think we need an incredibly large balance pass first because boy god you can either play this game normally or stand still and be near immortal lol
---
Well it certainly isn’t a rifle lol
---
Fallout 76 doesnt do
---
Hitscan..... your gun fires a projectile with a given speed... 
---
You have to lead your targets at range....
---
Awww.  Someone had their workshop contested.  Cute.
---
I just now realised that I'll have to expand my brewing porch.
---
I hope so :)
---
psn k-o-d-a-m-a
---
me and my crew are always building player friendly camps around the map
---
I mean it could be something to add to the legendary vendor when it comes out
---
I've found him south of the antique place, near Watoga like 4 times.
---
Just server hop
---
Same here I literally just spent all my caps on trash legendaries (and a bloodied dragon and bloodied harpoon) at white springs for another 30 or so bits to break down lol
---
Id offer to help but by the time I get on you will probably be right. Might flick you a pm before I do get on to see though.
---
Wouldn’t that be the cheer cheer cheeriest?
---
Looks tiny
---
Agree with everything except gameplay mechanic #8 - I only get 4 hours a day to play and already earn less caps than someone who farms for 8 hours a day. I don't want to have to wait 2-3 days to be able to use vendors again.
---
If the 1400caps/20IRL hours was per account I'd be fine with that to stop alt characters farming, but leave my one character alone!
---
So wait, you can fill the punch bowl with drinks?  How does that work?
---
And I'm not sure I have plans for the punch bowl.  If I don't, I may just acquire them.
---
Unfortunately even with the bow being dataminer I highly doubt it's going to actually be in there. Everything coming new with the patch is already labeled with a specific prefix in the data.
---
I think a weapons base weight sets its vats cost though
---
It's already at 30 with concentrated fire 3
---
Lmao. Fuck  fuck fuckedy fuck
---
I hope we get more budget, Im at max.
---
It's about to get shelved for awhile
---
Get the scrounger perk (and pharma farmer for stimpacs/chems) to help stock up on ammo. I also suggest using the hunting rifle, yeah the fire rate sucks but that's the point. Pick your shots and break you of the spray and pray mentality. Bonus save all the 45 ammo for when you find a combat rifle or lever action.
---
They sound NOT always drop 3 stars that is a horrible idea. They do need to take syringer and drill out of the loot table or give them legendary attach points. Wood armor also needs legendary attach points added so it can come out as 3 star. Just make every weapon and armor in the game able to be 3 star and we will be good
---
you saying it doesnt have to do anything with it, makes me think that you have no idea what your taking about, 
---
in you post you said that caps doesnt have real value true, but if you see vangard set or sentinel set going online for 150-200 dollars what you think its going to happen in the game. 
---
 "Supply and demand". Demand should have a stronger roll here. 
---
of cousre and that is whats happening when the supply is super low and the demand is great prices go up not the other way around. 
---
all and all after reading your post a few times it looks like you are just butt hurt you wanted to buy something but couldnt. it happens just keep playing maybe you will get it as a drop.
---
... got excited because ...? You stopped mid sentence.
---
I've only run into one once.
---
They are creepy as hell! Thanks for letting me know 😊
---
Now off to Google to find out what tax-evader-time is in reference to the empire.
---
Googled it and seems they produce both 1 ceramic and 1 concrete 😊
---
...80%+ of all ammo I get is for weapons I won't ever use. That theory is not accurate. I, too, get a lot of 50cal and 5mm, and I will never use either.
---
Yeah I have to admit I am very prone to that mentality. I use the hunting rifle already because it was the weapon my fnv character used. I’ll put the scrounger perk on when I play later. Thank you.
---
I am gulty of not "searching" containers
---
Unfortunately, knowing Bethesda its not the end. They have the fanboys, they want to milk them as long as they are able to.
---
Scrapping will teach you it
---
Looks great! I had a similar build idea at the crossroads by Top of the World, but I got so tired of moving my CAMP, I gave up on it! Awesome job!
---
-6 butchered humanlike.
---
I have absolutely no desire to have sentinel armor. That would be boring af. Also, my comment was discussing the differences between a “game currency” and one in the real world. People selling them on eBay because they think they can make money off of complete fools can do whatever they want. Not only do the community concluded cap values not necessarily equate to what some scumbag is setting as the price irl but is again not what’s being discussed here. I have no idea why you’re being such a hostile freak but have at it
---
Ooo would love to see that
---
You gotta share pics with us non-PS4 peeps, someday
---
Mine currently weigh 0.25 each :/
---
I have seen one attack early along the trail
---
yip
---
Well, we do have crossbows.  Although I wish I could fit a scope to it.
---
Now what would be amusing is if they put a slingshot into the game.  😁
---
It's in the atomic shop and its free
---
Oh sweet god please
---
Damn was hoping you were Xbox haha
---
Make sure to have science perks i think there are three in intelligence.
---
For me, I like small 1 handed melee weapons that are basic FAST speed, I have speed mutation and like running through mobs up close. None of my knives have bloodied or swing speed additional attributes so I feel like I'm missing out on a whole lot of fun. 
---
I love my 2 handed bloodied sledge +40% SS it really decimates most things and again I love being right up close, would love the same with a 1 handed.
---
If you're using a headset be sure the volume on it is up.
---
If on PC I can make you any combat armor piece Deep Pocketed (free if you provide materials).
---
Be careful crafting so many weapons - Bethesda could ban you because they will think you're duping. This guy once crafted 10 gamma guns to scrap them to learn new mods and got banned for "exploiting a system issue that results in item duplication".
---
A 3* double vats executioners lever action
---
I use a cross hair site. That works for me 👍.
---
I hope stack can be splitted (like: I have 30 crimson flux, and I want to sell 5 of them)
---
Suck it(backpacks) ya big tin can!
---
Are you at all worried the vending will be bugged in some way? I mean the worst case scenarios would be the wildest shit show on here lol
---
Yeah man, I have a full stash and 900 lbs of legendaries. My friends will message me and say, “Hey we’re going to fight SBQ, meet us down there. So I start my long trek from White Springs. 15 minutes later I arrive at the SBQ fight only to realize the queen died 30 seconds ago.
---
Did.... did you just reply to a sound bug post with ‘turn the volume up’?
---
I had a 4 star combat rifle and it did not have scorched damage. Was assassins for sure and 3 others i cant remember; think one was vats related.
---
A bag of hundreds.
---
Nukashine, the hoarder's wet dream in a bottle. You carry a metric ton of junk, no worries, Nukashine will teleport you to you camp ... or at least in the same universe.
---
Did you just post this on Reddit instead of contacting customer support and then get rude?
---
yes I thought there was something wrong with my Xbox and it turned out I had never turned up the volume on my new headset.
---
Heeeyyy I can see my CAMP from here!
---
*Sheepsquatch growl*
---
Sometimes if I'm in a whimsical mood, I'll run around with a drill and repair people's power armor.  That's about the only use I have for drills.
---
 I don't mind a system-wide chat in fact I think it's a good idea. As long as I can opt out and don't have to listen to somebody's potty mouth.
---
My post literally starts with asking for the correct place to post, and you reply with tURN tHE vOLUME uP. I also clearly state in my post that I can hear game volume at the start menu and also for a couple of seconds when I change the voice chat option. I came here hoping for a little help, not your ridiculous and clearly trolling response.
---
I think it should be a .5% chance and do a perma 10% exp gain, 25 max health and 25 rad resist. Something not to overpowered but not pointless to try to get and maybe add a cool down on each individual machine
---
Wasn’t me kiddo
---
You could try :
---
1. uninstall mods
---
2. Scan and repair game files through Bethesda Launcher
---
that's all I can come up with.
---
*I never have mods installed on my PC so probably it's not mods that r causing this issue.
---
So it wasn’t, you both replied at the same time. My bad. I’ma just delete this entire post and look elsewhere.
---
To be clear tho they were probably just scrolling past skimmed and tried to add that thought in because that legitimately happens a lot where people don’t realize they have their sound turned down
---
It would be cool if we could adjust the brightness of the lights if they were connected to a terminal.
---
Right next to one of those tin foil hats
---
I might just have to pay you a visit.
---
I have the same issue but I have a slow Internet connection so I blame that.
---
I have found if I enter VATS, pick my target, wait/pause for a moment (0.5-1 second) then fire I hit my target. 
---
Seems worse with certain guns especially the single action revolver and other .44 although not as bad.
---
Besides super rare plans everything I have is easily grindable so even if it wipes all items in the vendor machine I'll be fine
---
It'd be neat to be able to put on a tripod that gives you more stability while crouching.
---
They're transparent so shouldn't be an issue, but if a Scotchbeast gives you issues just switch to a Duck beast. Much stronger.
---
As someone returning to the game for this update, how exactly does "rebuilding your camp" work? Do we get all materials back, or just the pieces to replace, or something third?
---
ty
---
There’s 2-3 bags inside Blackwater mine where the event uranium fever happens
---
"Impressive, most impressive, you have done well my young VaultDweller."
---
Oh, then I most likely have it.  I always snap up free stuff there.  And in the creation club for Fallout 4 and Skyrim.
---
Whenever I get around to moving my camp for better sales on the new vending machines, I think I'll leave a bowl of NukaShine out.  👿
---
Try the demolition perk, it increases damage from explosives
---
I'm designing a crack den. 😮
---
Hahaha, yeah I did the same.. those Snally's are well hidden 😅
---
I'm going to experiment with that.  Since I'm isolated, I know I'm not going to get much traffic, so I'm going to see how long foods last.
---
After I load in those duplicate plans in first though.
---
Exactly. Sounds good to me
---
Nice
---
Crossbow could do with a scope or at least better sights, 10mm SMG needs a silencer, Auto Grenade needs more mods too. Be nice to stick a scope on the BPR as well so it had some sorta use.
---
17 cause I don't play cause its lonely
---
Just a guy who was sick of switching outfits to kill wendigos.
---
HOW DARE YOU CALL OUR GREAT LORD A ABOMINATION!
---
I'm excited too :D
---
Seems like any non auto is horrible. But in pvp I cant just sit and wait to shoot
---
Captainoob made a video about this one just a few days ago: 
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4M5ORi53PY](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4M5ORi53PY)
---
I have a camp in whitsprings...not with turrets but artillery to destroy those dam annoying torrent camps set up out side the windows. They get no exp and also cause major lag!
---
thanks for the info i didnt know that so i guess there is hope still
---
It should really be a commando weapon, but as a riflewoman it helps me I guess! I still would like to see it's perks changed though cause currently it's a bit silly it's not a commando weapon.
---
That's super original. Such a great idea. Good job!
---
What the fucking fuck. I have no idea what game are you playing, but its not F76, because in F76 TSE and X01 are shit, and noone is forced to use them. On the contrary, people using them are on average much less effective than those who don't. Balance changes coming out of people who have no idea about how the game works os between most ridiculous and ugly concept there is.
---
I'm just going to put in duplicate plans I would give away either to friends or newer players for free anyway.  So if said glitch occurs, I'm not really losing anything.
---
Or, watch the player and sit there chanting "please claim a workshop...oh...*please* claim a workshop." When they do, blammo.
---
I built a section for vending in my camp months ago, will only need a little rearrangement when I see the exact footprint the vending machine takes (which looks a little larger than I'd hoped).
---
Don’t forget the flatwoods monster.. he’s been in the shadows lurking too..
---
"Drink only one"  
---
You do realise that saying this will ensure some players will simply take all they can, because some people enjoy doing the opposite of a request, just because they can.
---
Or suppressing. They're good too.
---
Sure... if you want more diseases...
---
Agreed 100% I have no idea how this even happened lol
---
Hey wrecked! -))
---
Hah! Same here! I thought I could take them on, as I had cleared out the supermutants in the space station... I chose poorly.
---
so i cant give you an answer on that however i du suggest not actually start a new character for that quirk as im more than sure bethesda will sooner or later "fix" this i simply cant imagine they gonna leave it in the game so maybe take that into consideration
---
Oo yea that's a good point. If you're a pistol build would you mind trying that out please?
---
Please do! I'm doing plenty of grand reopening deals!
---
I'm positively surprised anybody else wrote "balance gud people stoopid", and even more surprised that these words of truth keep positive score
---
yeah. You should have. They're currently pointless, which is a crying shame.
---
Stuff assigned to fermenters are still in your stash, yet they accelerate condition, this would just be the reverse.
---
If the player vending machine is an extension of your stash, just with selected items showing, I might be a little cautious deploying one, as I suspect some players will check to see if there is a way to steal from the player through an exploit.
---
If there's stuff you know you'll reuse and re-place (foundations, walls, roofs, crops, crafting tables, power connectors, etc.) you can store it and re-use it somewhere else for -0- material cost. In some cases you can swap it 1:1 for a similar item like a doorway instead of a window or a flat roof instead of a slanted roof. In some cases tho you'll have to scrap it in which case you'll get a tiny fraction of the materials back which is unfortunate but whatever. If you're worried about material costs you can equip perks like home defense and contractor which will minimize building costs but it's always a good idea to have a ton of extra building material on hand (steel, wood, concrete, copper, etc.) any time you rebuild your CAMP.

I’m on PS4 too and I’ve been looking for a toilet seat and a bathtub for months to finally build me a bathroom.
---
What’s your PSN?
---
im having the same problem with my gauss rifle i got the feeling it happens on charging weapons a lot if you charge your gauss/gamma then enter vats and shoot i basically miss every time no matter the percentage only when im charging whilest already in vats i can land a hit
---
I can guarantee you that you've seen little if you guarantee us false things

Fool! He is there for our protection! D:

And would have to demolish/scrap/store your entire old camp (piece by piece) before starting anew, save the few parts you may wanted to reuse, ie the foundation?
---
I at least take the time to change disguises between samples
---
They should buff the other legendaries instead of nerf. Imo
---
Sadly, this is often because people kite 3 stars. But if a mob dies too far away from its spawn, it will meatpile at its spawn point. And in engagements with lots of mobs, the meatpile trigger can be short and sometimes instant. So if you have a disappearing mob, go check its spawnpoint and you may well find your loot there. But you gotta know the SP though, which is the very sucky bit.
---
If I have you all the resources would you be able to make me the X-01 jetpack at some point?
---
Sounds like game lag. It takes a bit for the server to calculate the shot.
---
What's that? I use both and am unaware of a bug?
---
I have over 100 absolute garbage weightless pieces that I've been stockpiling for weeks now, but this last week I've been keeping everything I get. I just hope there's one nearby where I spawn in, because I'm gonna have to walk there 😂
---
Oh nice! I suppose it does make sense :)
---
your in luck I have a bathroom bundle on sale for 100 caps! Bathtub, toilet and the portapotty. My psn is themightyboop (I think it might have the underscores same as here)
---
This might look like this but is not true. I add people who successfully kill me on survival. If I join a server just as you described, I join one of them et voila, I'm now in the manhunt zone I looked for. There are multiple concurrent survival servers, but much less than adventure. This makes it so that if you try server hopping often you'll end up on same server.

Love this! Would be neat of you could set up the electrical system to have a roadside button on the exterior that automatically opens both garage doors and switches the red traffic light to a green one simultaneously. Not sure if that's even possible. But holy crap this is awesome.
---
Worse than either. They have already said that it will go into your inventory but 10% of the caps will just disappear to support a "healthy game economy". So if you sell something for 1000 caps then the person will pay 1000 and 900 will go to your inventory.
---
I would just be happy if devs quadrupled or even doubled the ammount of (primed) .308 ammo you get while crafting. LMG is godly - for those few seconds it takes you to burn through one flux...
---
Yes I agree.
---
Nah these are some of the best! I love the ingenuity of each one I have seen. 
---
There was the guy who made the fire chamber, then the deathclaw maze and was tempting in new players in flat woods. that was hilarious. 
---
It fills in that NPC random encounter gap. There are some great ones in Fallout and even in other games like RDR2 than end you up dead, or nearly. 
---
This is what I love about this game!

Great ad lol. Also how the heck did you pose like that sitting? D:
---
Ok, thanks.
---
I'm sure it's something to do with being able to purchase  caps.
---
Purchase caps?
---
You'd have people competing to put their camps in the most heavily trafficked areas just for the inevitable extra vote when some of the best ones might actually be elsewhere where you're not as likely to encounter. Maybe if people could put their camps "on display", which would make their camps appear on the map as a possible fast-travel spot. I really like the idea of using voting machines for it.

---
It’s an economic control measure to make sure that there isn’t too many caps in circulation.  Leading to inflation and devaluation of the currency.
---
I found an interesting video from extra credits, explains the process for World of Warcraft.
---
It’s annoying but works.  Meaning that while you get less caps, hopefully the caps should retain there value.
---
I have a vampire swing speed rev sword. It’s basically the coolest weapon I have. I just wish they would buff 1h melee
---
Players trading caps to one another doesn't increase the number of caps in circulation by even 1. The only thing that inreases the amount in circulation is the ingame sources. Regardless the cap limit is supposed to keep that in check anyway and they havent said they are going to increase it (which they should with player vending).
---
I thought it was a social thing. 10% if you buy from the machine but if you sell the item your self you can circumvent that 10% skim. At least that's what I thought.
---
Yeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeessssssss
---
I literally killed a guy with 780lbs of junk on him once. Not sure why someone would have that much on them but I created a new character to store it all on.

---
Even so, why? Its MY machine at MY camp so I know some vending machine company isnt taking their middle man price. Lol. It doesn't help us to just delete caps.
---
Should I bring some ice and tumblers?
---
From post, for people that read only the title:
---
" Currently, there are 30 slots you can assign items, or stacks of items, to in C.A.M.P. Vending Machines at any given time. "
---
So, you can sell stacks of items, not only single items. Ammunitions, materials are marketable
---
When you kill an enemy, finish an event or sell stuff to vendors, the total amount of caps in the game increases. When you buy from vendors or fast travel, the total amount of caps in the game decreases. To keep the amount of caps in the game in check, these two need to be in balance. Currently as people don't buy form vendors as much the balance tips to net positive delta caps in the world. With player vendoring the effect is amplified, as an even greater proportion of stuff can just be bought off other players. This, however, without a "tax" won't balance the cap flow like the vendors do. If caps are created faster than they are destroyed, hyperinflation happens and money loses its value.
---
I'll be on tonight after the update so I will pay you a visit (also uk) as I'm trying to finish off my plans collection!
---
"The fake 'tash and glasses isn't fooling anybody LegitDeaThClawZz, I can see your name above your head!"

Me and two players stood between a camp and the door (We fired the nuke). When the ghouls came charging out we mowed them down before turrets could get a proper shot in. The camp owner came past and found he got nothing and promptly  left with is base to another server when he saw we were not moving. Once he left we moved away so new players spawning in could have their fun and loot.
---
Pretty sickle.
---
What, you don't pay taxes? They are just trying to increase immersion. 😆
---
There might be some new bugs tomorrow though lol
---
I dont get the reference.
---
No one buys from vendors already. When a player sells an item for 100 caps to another player the 100 caps stay the same it just changes owners. The total number of caps ingame stays the same. There will never be a cap balance with vendors as long as vendor prices are 10× player value and they never have anything worth buying.
---
I’m going to drop a line about being reasonable because it’s who I am and how I’ll be running my shop...
---
Caps are somewhat hard to obtain for anyone who isn’t a hardcore, works at home/jobless kid with time to burn. I’m speaking for the dads and moms who don’t have burnable time and the 9to5ers like myself who are here to burn stress... but bottom line is we are here for fun not monopolizing and alienating casual players by raking in caps at the expense of others. Don’t let it go the way of Crossout...
---
Ammo needs to be by type..
---
Energy 2c
---
Ballistic 2c
---
Explosive 3c
---
Special (bolts, cannon balls, etc) 1-3c 
---
Plans should be affordable at the very least, like not over 300c except for maybe super rare which should cap at 500c.
---
Legendaries should be by the price listed in the stats, unless you want to sell it discount by half to be fair in the case of higher end ones but that’s your decision.
---
Regular weapons and armor should be based by rarity and type... so a pool cue is worth less then a Deathclaw Gauntlet, just make it reasonably affordable cause it’s not a legendary so outside of things like Sheepsquatch weapons it should be a low end price.
---
Clothes by rarity. So common stuff like 5-15c, uncommon 15-25c, rare 30-45, and wtf where did you get that rarity 50-100c (leg work is included in the price as compensation for actual finding it). Exclusive quest rewards like Sheepsquatch Imposter stuff... under 250c with wiggle room for 300c.
---
Chems by utility ... food same. 
---
Stims/radaway and XP boost stuff 10c
---
Everything else 5-10c
---
Junk, half the asking price from vendors... or just 1c, you want them buying it as “hey I need that for x” without reminding them that it’s easier to find inworld.
---
Nuke zone stuff... 50-100c.
---
Bobble heads and magazines maybe 20-40c.
---
Power Armor... 150c limbs, 125c heads, torsos 155c.
---
That’s just my template for it... you can sell for less or jump by maybe 50c on every suggestion here but the basic idea is don’t be a prick and sell a lead pipe legendary or not for 3000 caps...
---
Also don’t go over 500c.... not many people are that wealthy because fast travel is a cruel mistress...
---
Take or leave it, I’m just here to voice me and my idea. Thanks for listening children! Awooo
---
If they want immersion then let's talk NPCs....
---
You are so not alone in this one, friend.. I was 100% sure it's some sort of a syringe pistol or whatnot.. Was excited even. Needless to say, reality was harsh.
---
Because Bethesda thinks that there are too many caps floating around, and banked. There are better ways to fix the issue, but this is probably the easiest for them. It would be better to tax the ptp market since that’s where the problem comes from but hey. The poor is always getting f-ed by the rich.
---
Mole WOMAN money 😉
---
I live there and I’m in constant fear of being obliterated by nuclear hellfire every minute, good thing I got access to the local vault!

I'll be on before and after so I hope to see you soon :)

I can't count how many rounds I have wasted on dead mobs standing upright.

Both here and in Fallout 4.
---
Yes, the balance is already a net positive. To make caps worth more this needs to change with more cap sinks. You are correct that during the actual transaction the amount of caps in the game would stay the same, but as caps are then generally only created, not destroyed, we get the current situation of people with multiple accounts all at max caps and market prices in multiples of the current 25k cap. The point is that the caps need to go *somewhere*. Implementing it as a tax on player vending is not the worst idea. They could've  also, for example, increased fast travel costs. Decreased vendor prices to increase consumption could've also worked, but that would also be counterproductive to the idea that people should mostly scavenge what they need.
---
They think you should play the whole game, not sit there and level up by server hopping. It’s a small, passive aggressive way to screw you up just a little bit. I’m not saying they’re right, I’m just telling you the logic one girl used when I asked her why her camp was there.
---
How do you get gates to work ÒwÓ never works for me
---
Awesome! I’ll be sure to be first in line.
---
May you sell me this for 20k caps please? I'm really tired to searching holotapes in my stash.. :(
---
Nuka World was my favorite Fallout 4 dlc so I'm all for this.
---
If we’re lucky, this ride will also never end
---
The exotic weapons parks were cut from the game, they appear in the survival guide along with other perks that were cut like grease monkey
---
i would honestly love to see more customization or make the lmg more viable, i fell in love with how cool it looked with PA during to first trailers before the game came out and tbh it's been a little bit of a letdown
---
It's to help control the amount of caps available. Everyone keeps saying it all it will do is cause players to increase prices. While they are correct they don't stop to think that that will only benefit Bethesda initiative. Increased prices means more caps sinking into the 10% and thus more being removed from the game
---
Hot and valuable now.
---
Any automatic weapon will run out of ammo real quick unless you keep crafting more. 
---
.50cal and 5mm both craft 180 per using Ammosmith 2.
---
I use mainly 5.56 and .45 and can easily go through a thousand in few hours.
---
Near each silo there is a lookout tower. Go to the top of the towers and look around with a pair of binoculars, scope, camera with a zoom and you will see the launch tube. A hint is look at the out houses near the tower, one is the elevator to exit the launch room so you can see your own launch.
---
My early game I hung around WV lumber very top left of map. Place a camp near the water for your purifiers, WV has enough junk and low level supermutents to kill that you'll be over flowing with metal wood aluminum and everything else. And a chance to spawn 3 fusion cores and power armor plus has all the work benches so you can build anything. And plenty of gunpowder and .308 ammo problem is it's a walk to any vendor. Plant corn as well since corn soup is easy to make and fills both meters.
---
I think some people will increase prices, I doubt everyone will.
---
Upvote for visibility - I'm tired of situation they adding new content while old bugs and fuckups are still there.
---
I tried it on FO4 but on PS4 with a controller its even harder. Hope I can build a nice base this time.
---
Yo. I’m looking for the electric chair plan and the tv plan. What you saying?
---
Anyone who dies via PVP just made an agreement that anyones junk is fair play.
---
That's why I do not PVP, my man touches my junk!
---
Dont assume bad intentions straight away. I've been devising some death trap camp ideas (thanks for some more :)), and anyone who dies doesn't need to worry about me stealing their junk. It's just something to add some more fun into the game.
---
I have been wanting to build refrigerators for awhile now
---
I think mine looks fairly decent.
---
Except for those damn tree branches clipping through my walls.  God I wish they would fix that.
---
I think you'll get sorely disappointed, most legendaries will probably be exchanged for scrip instead of sold.
---
I've been wanting to move from my spot in the middle of the Savage Divide for some time now, even though I like what I did with the place. Truth be told, building a cool place is the major draw for me, so a space that could actually help others could be a fun challenge! I'll see where most people are activating their vendor beacons and then find someplace that doesn't overlap too much, likely back in the forest.
---
Which TV? I've only got one at the mo (cannot remember which for the life in me) but got the chair
---
Not from pie. Maybe from some single player nearly impossible to beat type of dungeon, but I doubt those mechanics could be implemented.
---
Ive been doing that for the better part of last week lol.
---
Does have a bare slot on the back wall right now for where the vendor machine will go. Size dependant when placing it
---
I mean it would be a one time perma boost and it would take a long time to get so it would be a nice meme
---
Any TV is a good start! I’m at work all day but will be on around 8ish GMT
---
not me
---
I'd love the chainsaw to get some love, I've got one at 200% durability and it's a beast but can be so much more with perks and LVL 50.
---
But I can't see it being fixed any time soon, there's not enough people that use it or complain about it so not high on bethesdas to do list
---

The melee stuff is a left over from my old build, as are the fusion cores. I already dropped all cores below 75% most of them are 100% or higher.

With your suggestions i shifted some points around and ended with something like this :

---
I will still need some weight reduction until i get the correct Armour.
---
be well rested before doing events and then do event, get as many workshops as you can to get camp plans and some weapons plans and xp for defending, and go to the whitespring trading area and go through the vendors to find weapon plans
---
The Acid one should be higher yield and cap, simply because it is required for smelting. If you have multiple nodes of other types, you still need an acid node for each of those other nodes, or you can’t make the final product. Having farmed Hemlock Holes a great deal, the workshop itself barely gives enough acid to smelt the rest of the workshop (being crystal and gold).
---
The rest seem alright, except maybe nuclear material, since doing workshops usually entails the cost of nuclear material for a fusion generator.
---
Junk Extractors should have their pool changed, so it doesn’t give scrap that you can already get from other nodes (like steel, copper, etc.). Then the generation for screws, springs, etc.
---
Yeah it's like your firing blanks I have melee hits that do the same
---
why did i spend like 5 minutes trying to understand a video game economy
---
I haven’t got the plans but I have the mod
---
I'm from new zealand so could you tell me what is your latest time you would be available?
---
Can't add much about plans i'm afraid but if you have the cranberry relish receipt and two or more gourd in your camp you can get a 10% XP bonus by consuming.
---
Make the complete Whitespring run twice at least and youre on your way.
---
Works pretty much for me for the daily level up challenges at least.
---
On top you might get some good legendary gear on top.
---
Additional Watoga is an option for XP
---
Hopefully any amount of ammo counts as 1 item per type. Not holding my breath though...
---
The roadmap still has it for the 7th. They've been updating the map as content has been pushed back... but usually not before the actual patch launches. So, in theory, it is coming out tomorrow, but it also might not.
---
Does your CAMP save when you log off now or do you rebuild this everytime you log in?
---
Ever played Team Fortress 2?
---
So I would need to shoot you to prevent Preston from existing?
---
Don’t get your hopes up on that. 
---
It would be amazing to be able to do this, but I can’t imagine this getting implemented any time soon.
---
Upvote because let me be the home depot warrior i desire to be.
---
With a shiny legendary chainsaw and drill to fix up everything.
---
Well rested, have inspirational equip, make cranberry relish, then run the burrows. Bunch of max level ghouls, sometimes even a legendary or two.
---
Then just wait until they leave and sneak into their house...
---
Cool I’m on XB1 too will have to pay a visit too, I have a little Bar/Pub East of the mine at Whitesprings. What’s your gametag?
---
Very nicely done.
---
 So is it true with today's update camps can longer take damage ? 
---
    This would be great as I have refused to build anything nice as much as I would like to build as I did in fo4 but with ppl destroying camps just never cared to do so.
---
They need more mods for literally every new weapon. 
---
The 10mm SMG doesn’t even have a suppressor... (even the combat shotgun has a suppressor)
---
You can find the plans for the mod in the world. Have found several and will be putting them on vendor after patch. On PC.
---
Its a super rare event drop from the forest. Your best bet is to try and buy it off someone.
---
Bethesda: Dis you say repair kits? We heard you guys like repair kits, go buy some in store
---
Specific plans?
---
If you are looking for a specific plan you will need to google/research to find how and where to get it. That, or to buy the plan in the off-game market channels.
---
Looking around...there's gonna be a ton of bars out there. xD Fallout Pub Crawl Edition.
---
No it’s not being dropped.
---
I’ve lost two legendary weapons seconds after using them: nope not on the ground.
---
Also just lost one of my calibrated X-O1 legs right off the PA I was wearing.  Again, impossible to drop if you’re wearing it and it wasn’t broken, just gone.
---
No just to collect and sell
---
Ohhh that just sounds like such a useless Legendary 🥺 Long painful death🤪

" Currently, there are 30 slots you can assign items, or stacks of items, to in C.A.M.P. Vending Machines at any given time. " Direct quote from the link. Bullets are stackable, so a stack would be one "Item"
---
If i remember correctly there are a view bags (6-8) at the kanawha cementary in the far eastern shed next to the church. Also nice for tick blood.
---
if I find your camp I'm stopping by also vending machines will also help
---
I can confirm this I was trying to up mines damage then tried this card and it worked
---
Dare you to breed lol
---
"Currently, there are 30 slots you can assign items, or stacks of items, to in C.A.M.P. Vending Machines at any given time."
---
So, 30 items or stacks of stackable items. 100 ammo is one item, and a gun is 1 item.
---
I hate how bethesda needs to fix one stupi thing in months when any mod user (or good developer) could fix it in 3 clicks

---
Amy chance you're on PS4? I'm going to be an armor vendor, and I need as much ballistic fiber as I can get.
---
I got a Furious Handy Buzz Blade today, and it is the most glorious critter killer I have ever seen. Incisor 3 and 1 rank in each of the damage perks, mod it for electric, and when I stop by the golf course to see what pops up, I literally hold the button down and walk into the crowd.
---
Depends. For modding them you need the Science perk cards, but the damage buffs are dependant upon the weapon type, so heavy weapons, rifle or pistol. There's no specific energy weapon perk cards out that boost their damage.
---
That said I use a 3* legendary Gauss rifle, a 1* laser rifle and a 1* lever action rifle. The laser rifle is only any good against low level enemies, the lever action is faster and does good damage but my Gauss rifle is okay when I can afford to be slowed down by the charge time and reload speed to deal slightly higher damage. All my weapon damage perks are rifle and the tank killer one. Not ideal but it helps.
---
Spawns typically appears nearby, I tried it already, seems to be and older issue that was patched.
---
This is just outside the Whitespring Station Vendor. Our fellow Vault Dwellers spawn just on the road leading up to Blackwater Mine when fast travelling.
---
I know this area so well as I have my camp in the exact same spot. 
---
I used the sign as a wall for my house that's behind it and  I use the actual sign to advertise my shop. Where yout drive thru is placed I have a workshop for everyone to use.

They always “get quiet” in the weeks before a big patch.   Busy prep time, I guess
---
Yes a lot of the big eBay dupers. Which is why if you check eBay there has been a big increase in the items being sold that are duped.
---
I didn't say I expected 10 years of content at launch, but rather enough content to not get bored, which has been a fairly common issue that a lot of people have had.  I am using my brain and Bethesda continually fall short. I cleared the burrows when I was under level 60 with no legendary weapons, with a friend who was level 30, fairly handily. That doesn't sound like a dungeon balanced for two level 50 players. THAT is the problem. Bethesda to me have shown that they don't know how to balance their content, or make content that will last.  
---
I mean an MMO that comes out with one proper endgame boss (SBQ not counting regular SB) is pretty lackluster.
---
Also the main point of the 10 year comment is they don't know how to make enough content in a game like this. Or that's how it comes across. 
---
You also make a lot of assumptions that I have ignored everything else, I haven't. But a lot of it is rinse and repeat which seems to be the biggest problem I've found that people have.
---
As for me being entitled, yeah sure, I've been entitled to games of a certain standard and this game has fallen short of that upon release. That doesn't mean it won't be worth the money, but defending Bethesda over their content choices will lead to more burrows like dungeons. Hopefully they look at other MMOs and make the Vault their bringing out a proper raid. Not something I can sneeze on.
---
TLDR with the game that Bethesda have released I have very little confidence that the content as it is currently coming will all be events etc. that can be done in an hour, showing that they are inexperienced in this area of balancing etc.

No don't do that

Yeah I got this from the SBQ what a waste of a 3 star potential drop!

You know if it finally gets some love they will nerf the ridiculous extra damage it gets when you repair it to 200%

Well I will sell some shotgun ammo an 10mm for sure.
---
Oh my god your edit was frickin’ hilarious. I hope I stumble across your camp and find a shoeless joe ghoul wandering around.
---
I agree. The fact that you can’t feels like an oversight. 
---
Also it would be nice if stairs could snap to the left or right side of the floor, instead of just dead center.
---
I'm fully aware of that. But you would think that a game developer, who has a huge fanbase, would do their business with better manufacturing companies. Also, I was unhappy with 76 way before the delays with the merch and all of the complaints about the PA edition etc. 76 is horrible in comparison to the previous titles. Horrible. My wife and I are huge fallout fans and 76 has turned us away. If Bethesda comes out with an actual Fallout 5, or something along the New Vegas line, we may take a peek, but we will no longer get a game from them at launch much less pre-order.
---
Not till the update later today.
---
220. My friend is Level 360+
---
Just posted an idea for this 😃 but your camp is fair game even in adventure.
---
Why ?
---
You can't learn power armor mods by scrapping them. Visit the trading subreddit. You'll be able to buy a jetpack for 2-4k
---
Great Idea as I pickup alot of armour, Will be good for lower levels with the pocket mods😊
---
Thanks !!!

Ah, sigh dicks in adventure mode, I saw person with 5k bounty assuming its them, still don't get why it didn't show up that so and so is attacking your camp.
---
I hate searching them too. I feel like I read somewhere they'll be adding separate storage for some things in the future, but I don't know if holotapes was one of them. :(
---
Np I'm glad you did. In my eyes this is one of the biggest bugs in the game and it needs to be fixed asap so I appreciate people posting about it!
---
There making camps invulnerable with an update today?
---
Something to look forward too :)
---
Making workshops invincible unless your in pvp :/ because if your camp gets destroyed it’s your fault for hitting back. I don’t go to camps I just go to workshops the only time I have gone to someone else’s camp is in survival which isn’t worth going into because you get barely any caps
---
It'd be funny if you set up your camp in the free states, that you could refuse to pay taxes which would cause tax collector bots to come after you. The longer you go without paying taxes, the more intense the robots get.
---
Hope flux will sell especially violet, I need it to mod my excavator armour, as not many nukes have been happening lately.
---
Lol 40k for a tse laser is an absolute steal. You cannot find a single one like that being offered for caps anymore. To trade for one you're looking at a full set of sent/ass or like 5 god roll weapons.
---
Now i want power armor backpacks
---
Not with the new update coming in a few hours.
---
I have the plan. Let me know and I will be glad to sell it to you. I am usually on around 6pm EST. GT is Nothingopen
---
We need cap sinks. Heck we need even more of them. If they want the cap economy to be meaningfully limited at 25k we need far more ways to drain caps.
---
Well from what I have experienced and read, the warning your camp is under attack is buggy if its PVE or PVP. Ive come back to a mole rat eating my base wall sometimes and not even had a warning. Yet a day later, someone picked the lock on my extractor and it flagged straight away lol
---
Poor you, Bethesda won’t fix this for months
---

---
According to this, it's still slated for release on the 7th, so unless something has changed. We'll hopefully see it tomorrow.
---
I'm just cosplaying as a raider, it is the apocalypse. If you don't like it, get off the game.
---
/s
---
fuck griefers. I always love how they shut up or come up with an excuse when you tell them to go to survival
---
Hey Enclave, see you around quite a bit 😃
---
In this post I was talking about people that go from camp to camp to destroy for no reason.
---
However I just saw another post that stated camps would be invulnerable with an update coning? Is this true?
---
Yeah you right, they announced that there will be more special stashes when they added icon for Fermanter. I hope they will hear us. :)
---
Don't we all friend.
---
On Tuesday yea
---
Wow that renders my post I just posted moot lol. If this is true. It’s most welcomed 😃😃😃
---
When they do fix this though wooooooo weeeeee
---
Are you even reading what he says or just parroting your comment
---
Nah it was a person mole rat doesn't have your whole camp destroyed like a nuke hit it. I assume someone used explosives like those from enclave or mininukes, etc.
---
Every once in a while, yes.   I’ve must have taken a few hundred workshops and only had someone initiate PvP once.  Now all I get are “known” plans, lol.  I drop those off to newbies.  I usually jump to anyone with a “defend” event active, and make sure I wave or ❤️  emote as soon as I fast travel in, just to signal my intention not to kill them 😂
---
I also like to take a workshop that has a vertibot (Charleston airport has two), grab a few signal grenades from the landing pad box.  If I come across an area later where enemies are fighting with each other, i chuck one into the fray.  The resulting vertibot appears and causes quite the distraction 😁. Nuke cola, some chips, and watch the show.
---
You on pc, can sell you one 3000caps
---
Wow I’m so happy for this. Thank you for confirmation 😃
---
It will not be as useful. Shotguns count some “hits” as each pellet, so hit-based things scale great w/ shotguns. W/ a 2H weapon not so much.
---
Possibly.
---
Idk how its fair game if it doesn't even warn you unless you open the map and even then its a tiny objective, when some people might be tracking decent amount of quests.
---
🤠 just don’t hit anyone and your fine . My camp is never attacked by anything it’s to far from anyone lol
---
Its always fun when you hose down a group of anything. By any chance do you know how 308 ultracite you get with ammosmith? I havent found the prime reciever yet
---
Thanks for the advice.
---
We need to get more wall types and designs. The glass wall designs sounds like a good idea.
---
Death
---
Unarmed. Also melee weapon perks affect meat hook for some reason
---
Well I just learned camps wont be able to be destroyed with the Tuesday update but before I was brought up to speed I posted an idea you might get a kick out of just above this post 🤔
---
I don't suppose you'd be on anytime before that would you?
---
Indeed
---
Guys think about it being put in the legendary pool... Furious chainsaw 😍
---
I don’t attack other players but sometimes people ban together to try and find camp locations to destroy. But it sounds like that won’t be a problem after Tuesday
---
They are referring to a fake mustache and a pair of glasses changing the appearance of a character. Appearances change, in game name stays the same...
---
This. Is. ART! I have always wanted to build something epic like this, but I don’t usually have much time to play and even if I did, I still don’t have many plans that allow crafting of such beautiful stuff.
---
Yeah, that's true. The guide book was vastly outdated the moment it was released as changes had already accorded, nerf and such.  
---
So who knows. We may not see anything, which is kinda disappointing.. But hey I'm loving all of the content that's coming out.. Regardless if some stuff doesn't make it into the game.
---
system  of choice? I collect the teddies...need the teddies
---
Exactly, the drill needs some love as well!
---
Hhhmmmmm...interesting
---
Are you a lämp
---
lag.. he's the 5th one but didnt make it into the history books for obvious reasons
---
I also have one for sale
---
The answer should be easy. It’s fallout 76. They pushed it back a month. The 10% thing is literally the only new thing discussed between last month and today. Come on, we’re smarter than thinking bethesda had some philosophical reason to keep the ingame economy stimulated and working well... its bugs. The answer is simply the way they had it was fucked, and they needed a way to bypass some bug that we may never know about now. That’s the answer I’m sticking with because the explanation they give shows they’re not being truthful about the purpose of the 10% reduction.
---
Or Vault 76 if they are encumbered.   😉
---
Sell guns, aid, meat to a vendor and you have 1400 caps in a day without questing or events or caps loot.  Takes 3 min.  Wtf you mean caps only come from no life ?
---
Yes, that can be true.. But with what's been "labelled" can also be just be a short preview of what's to come. With the release of the patch notes tomorrow, we'll see what's been changed and added.
---
It will come...eventually. Just don't do all the server hops in one day or you'll go insane. Maybe 4-5 and then cut your losses.
---
Well bad luck on that, but at least rejoice that it should not happen from this afternoon onwards :) 
---
If you really have griefers are this, Id suggest if you ever want to claim a workshop, that you pack your own camp away and use your workshop as your camp while your online. You only have one area to defend if that's the case and destroying a workshop isn't exactly going to do much harm long run
---
Horseman? Are you on the right Discord or did I miss a memo?
---
So all camps in adventure are invulnerable and all in survival are a foundation with a stash box, might as well delete the wrecking ball perk.
---
With us getting the refrigerator mod with backpacks, and with the Pioneer quests also rewarding camp items, I wonder if one of those items will be some sort of cooler/fridge.
---
Seeing how they are going in proper order so far- It would be Famine; The Black Rider.
---
Whitespring has all vendors now so keep checking there? And I hear Graham sell the rarest plans so definitely check him out every time you see him 😃
---
If you get one and it's almost broken of course mods aren't going to improve the damage nothing well if you repair it then go to put mods on it there is a huge difference in damage. I get what you're saying the different mods don't increase the damage at all they all stay at the same no matter which mod you put on
---
Oh yeah, if we got some more mods for the crossbow would be nice. Even a red dot sight wouldn't go astray either.   
---
Aha, now that would be a David and Goliath moment.. Trying to take on the Scorchbeast queen wth a slingshot. Aha.
---
Doubt it...just got to work. Sometimes i am on earlier, around 3 or so but depends on the day.
---
They are releasing paint for all the horseman on PA? I thought that was a one off for War O.O
---
Wait. There is a limit?
---
Did I not read something?
---
I wish people would stop calling them raiders, they're just griefing assholes.
---
It's awesome but, personally, I'd scrap the big lion.
---
Yea unless some people  do what i do and take a workshop which enables pvp
---
Yeah, i remember reading about Grease Monkey as well. Hopefully, they make it back into the game at some point. But I guess, if they've been cut.. they've been cut. \*sad Exotic Weapon maker noises\*
---
I just want off center stairs so they can go up agents a wall.
---
You made a great version of the leather chest piece. Pity you can't wear it over the outfit.
---
30 slots. Stacks of items occupy one slot (or so I've heard).
---
Well it sounded like in the next update that Bethesda was going to make camps invulnerable but wrecking ball would still be effective against workshops 😃
---
Is that not the definition of a raider?
---
I've got two
---
I agree with this, expect famine then death.
---
Taking workshops is fine, I don’t get angry when I lose a workshop. Just stay away from my home.
---
Power Armor paints - the four horsemen.
---
i really hope so
---
AA is best for general PvP and even most PvE. All players (and even enemies) have armor, so ignoring 50% of that is worth more than the 25% damage bump of two-shot, and certainly better than 10% from assassin’s. 
---
To take down assassin sentinel players you need to get a bit more creative. 
---
1. Use VATS criticals. They bypass their armor &amp; legendary effects, but are hard to land in PvP.
---
2. Stagger them (which makes them move, bypassing the sentinel effect), using limb damage &amp; stagger perks. 
---
3. Make them glow in the dark with a gamma gun, ideally a legendary one with 50% more limb damage. Assassin sentinel doesn’t protect from radiation damage. This is extra effective if they’re a bloodied build.
---
Plague Rider came and went already- and if the order is correct, the Black Rider is next, and the Pale Rider is last. Here be previews of all four.  [https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy](https://imgur.com/a/ljv4gFy)
---
watoga notes?
---
The drive thru feature is very good, yes, but the rest of the place is even better.  Well done!
---
I don’t think you understand what I mean, I take your workshop because it makes you in pvp with me so I kill you then leave the workshop so it’s still yours
---
They're started putting out "horsemen of the apocalypse" power armor paints. They're pretty bad ass so far.
---
Fixed! Had to reconfigure my .ini file after the last update. Working fine now 😄👍
---
What those bakers do in their off time is none of our business. 🤷‍♂️
---
Before war was pestilence. I hope they all come back at some point though, instead of just a "here's a week to buy em. Get em now or never again"
---
Aha I see. I did see the Plague Rider but didn't like the look of it. Think ill get the Black Rider definitely and the Pale Rider is a skip.
---
Might have to farm some atoms lol
---
Holy shit you walked everywhere since level 5? What is overencumbering you?
---
Yeah. This seriously needs a fix. Easily the most fun weapon in the game, inspite of the fact most of the mods are broken, it only exists at level 20, there are no legendary variants and the damage is bugged to hell and back.
---
It’s just easier to lose caps when you fast travel due to lack of time to put in leg work so there is very much an “income” discrepancy between those who have time to spare. Sorry I realized I came across as an asshole with that phrasing in that post.. I just got my first day off in a week but insomnia kicked in and my ability to articulate is on par with a salty sailor who had a seagull shit in his coffee. I apologize for that.
---
I think that's one legendary I'd bother to do the PVP challenges for.
---
Put them on chassis...wait 60 seconds , it will be returned to your inventory
---
You know after 60 seconds of placing it it goes v
---
back into your inventory. Place the frame put the parts on and wait
---
can you provide the source that state this please
---
This is my dream!
---
Hey man if you want to post about how you like to kill people for no reason, that’s fine. My perception of you has changed a bit but don’t care. I was talking only about camps.
---
Idk if this works anymore but you can put high lever power armor on a frame and then walk away till you get the returning to inventory in 60 secs and then wait that time and it should be in your inventory
---
Agreed it will bring players together but there's still no way to communicate with somebody else though.  Without a chat tab this is a single player game to me.  I will definitely be visiting everybody's shops but it's still leave me without a way to communicate.
---
So I will most likely be the rude guy that walks in your camp, browses your wares, then leaves.
---
 I just want you to know it's not because I don't want to chat with you. I just don't have a way to.
---
Before some genius says "get a mic" , No, I do not want to hear your squeaky prepubescent voice. I do not like hearing voices while I play my games. Complete immersion breaking for me.
---
&gt; I'm fully aware of that. But you would think that a game developer, who has a huge fanbase, would do their business with better manufacturing companies. 
---
r/woosh
---
Bethesda that does pre-order item =/= Bethesda game devs
---
If you're fully aware of that, why did you then say that the game developer should work with better manufacturers? The game Developers aren't in charge of that, they're in charge of *making the game, not advertising and pre order items.*  
---
Then you proceed to talk about how you think the game is horrible and you're angry about it. I sincerly think you have a hard time understanding the concept I've laid out. You're entitled to your opinion, everyone else is also entitled to literally not care and ignore it. It's really annoying that you'd take a conversation about how the people who fucked up the pre-order items aren't the people who design the game and try and segue it into a diatribe about how much you dislike it, since not only did I not ask, its not even on topic.  
---
Don't play the game, we don't care that you hate it, and make a support ticket for your pre-order bullshit rather than clog up a sub thats dedicated to the game and people who *actually care to play it*.
---
i trigger this a lot when using my quad tesla...  so i experimented and found out that grenades and the missile launcher will still deal damage when it's active, but the auto grenade launcher wont
---
I can help grind you up to 50 if you're on Xbox
---
Ah makes sense now but who's this deathclaw guy? Some kind of raider?
---
Isn’t the burrows the new farming spot anyway?
---
So basically there’s a porch/overhang on the cliff out the front door. If you walk over you’ll see the mans skeleton with a mutated dogs body laying it’s head on his lap
---
I think they want to combine shitty skins with great skins. Death and war are badass, and plague and pale are meh. So i think Pale should be next
---
totally agree. a dude just posted a huge bug overview yesterday. over 15 different bugs. all should have been fixed already.. i dont need new items in atom shop every week but i need fixes every week. love this game and want it to rise and stay for a long while.
---
New expansion reveals the overseer has been using a secret network within the the player vending machines to collect caps to restore the common wealth.
---
I love this gun, but the ammo consumption and lack of any mods at all really means I never use it
---
Yea I like that tho lol destroying camps isn’t as fun because of how wanted lee comes out of your caps lol
---
This is probably known I’d imagine http://youtube.com/watch?v=ckbwbMdm5UE
---
Not true, you have to find the plans
---
Just give me a chainsaw gauntlet and call me Ashy Slashy.
---
How about The Savage Divide as a band name. You're first album could be called Super Mutant Misogyny.
---
It's 30 slots so 30 different items or stacks of items.
---
I don't know, can you?
---
Technically, synths *are* plants, aren't they? I mean, a lot of them *are* duplicates placed covertly with hostile intent...
---
40k caps for a god-tier item is perfectly fine to me, and doesn't automatically imply being a former duper. I don't understand how or why you would make this assumption. Making 1k caps an hour is easily doable in this game, which means you need to grind 40 hours for the caps. This is still much less grinding than god-tier gear in MMOs like WoW and Runescape. Stop decorating your house and start grinding for caps ffs.
---
You gotta use heavy perks and adrenal reaction to get decent damage. I run it like a bloodied even though its AA
---
Mole-money mole-problems.
---
Uhhh...sure
---
yeh mine is 1 foundation ever 4 foundations down....it's....alot...and they make sure lots of "unmoveable" things. I've done the best I can but it's TINY &lt;/3 this is epic XD
---
I didn’t know they had that lol I’m on PS4
---
Funny you should say so, I was also using a quad tesla the last couple of days when this happened.
---
What a vicious cycle that is. No one cares because it is broken, and most of the people who would care about it don't know it exists because it is bugged and doesn't drop as loot. If you are lucky, you will stumble upon one of the four far flung places it spawns, only to find a weak level 20 variant with super bugged damage. 
---
How many people are going to take the extra time to research and grind out a build that actually makes it semi-viable? How many of those are then going to go to bat for the weapon on the forums and be vocal enough to prompt any change? Such a bummer. 
---
It really is easily the most fun weapon in the game and it has the coolest mods by far. Someone clearly put some love into it before launch, shame there hasn't been any attention given to bringing it across the finish line and fixing all the various bugs.
---
I have one (and an instigating lever I believe). Max level too. 
---
You dont have to kill, but what do you have for trade?
---
Not for people to be too dissapointed - i see a lot of hype around these following patches , which is nice ofc. But tbh bugtesda is usually breaking or ruining something big with the patches , atleast for us that want more than to just explore and build camps
---
This is great! I've read how everyone is excited and I'm thinking, "I sell or scrap everything for caps and weight, so I got nothing to sell!"
---
all 4 were datamined months ago, so we already know how they look
---
Early on after the game launched I did attack a player base once. It wasn't my intention to grief anyone, mostly out of curiosity and maybe a touch of revenge. I logged into one server and found someone had a base built really close to mine just down the road. As a friend and I were wandering the road this other player attacked my buddy for no reason. I built an artillery in my base and popped the targeting smoke up onto the top of his house.  
---
I don't really do PvP but I was annoyed at the player's attack on my buddy and I was really curious what the artillery might do the guy's home.  
---
The damage was catastrophic. It pretty much tore a wide hole through the roof and all three floors of his camp. That's the only time I've ever deliberately attacked another player's camp and I regret nothing.
---
What is ironic about that is the repair kits aren't even effective enough to provide any real value as they only repair to 150 with the stronger version!
---
Didn’t Bethesda make a game mode designed to kill other players? 
---
Not looking to offend here but why don’t the players that are interested in killing other players go do that there?
---
Is it because you don’t wanna deal with the consequences?
---
I spent the past day doing much the same (though some was due to realizing my chosen location was plagued undesirable neighbors), and this is the plan I came up with (mostly due to the massive stockpile of plans/recipes I have hoarded to gift friends I convince to get the game =).
---
Your title made it sound like some click bait add on a dubious website. The actual post is useful info though, took me a while to notice all the different challenge categories and am currently working my way through them but didn’t know paint worked too, thanks.
---
Pale and plague are just paints with minor model changes and not worth 1400
---
Absolute god-roll weapon.
---
This is pbly intentional and not a bug. There can't be too many 3* legendary drops or they'll be not as fun to get.
---
Hopefully your vending machine gets a fast travel marker and no relocation is needed. That is my hope at least since my remote camp is cool as hell.
---
Whales will by them anyway, because they don't want to kill SBQ for repair kits with so much money in their pockets
---
Bunch of gnomes behind the Generals Steakhouse too.
---
Isnt there a blue one like this in the Overseers bedroom? It makes sense though, which lead to the hilarious mental image of fighting ghouls whilst one of these is swinging around your shoulders, spewing holotapes everywhere.
---
I always like to keep mine above 999, just so I haven't got to see the remaining ammo number slowly decrease over time.
---
I used to have that until i made my heavy char with a gatling gun, great sustain of ammo all the time and the durability of a gatling is amazing
---
We dont even know how it will work .., remember watoga candies ??? 5000 for a single star legendary 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
&gt; I cant create thread on trading forums, because of violating their policies 
---
Probably elaborate on that so people don't think you're also a scammer/duper/realmoney trader, because if you're any of those people won't care.
---
I concur.  I think posted that idea on the Bethesda forums around the time they first threw outvthe idea of player vending machines.
---
Haha SBQ reminds me I'm doubly screwed with this game. The only weapon I like is the chainsaw and the only armor I like is Ultracite. The hipster struggle continues.
---
What can you possibly sell level 1 legendaries for?  Nobody passed level 5 wants them and anybody under can't afford real worthy prices in the 20 min it takes to reach level 5. 
---
I think you've been wasting space dude.
---
A lot of good suggestions have been posted already but if they don’t work for some reason you could create a mule character. Find a good friend to give your pieces and then switch characters and then rejoin your friend to get the pieces back and store.
---
I had a tse 50 cal, minigun and handmade which i never used because all i can think about while shooting is how much caps i'm wasting. 1 round 556 ammo is literally worth 1 cap in the trading community
---
Just did that one on another char. Just gives you a recipe. Did you get All 4 side quests at the taxidermy shop?
---
not to far please. mines near it but not for farming, i just like the flat ground
---
your punch is like chips, you cant just have one.
---
I can't wait for player vending. I am going to only be selling chems 
---
Anyone should come check me out my CAMP is just down the road from the overseers CAMP and my PSN is the same as my username on here.
---
Ghouls slays , super mutant slayer etc ...
---
Maybe...
---
But it's my can of potato crisp and I say you can only have one!
---
Im no programming smart dude - i just remember   when people blaming dupers &amp; carryweight glitchers for bad server stability, would not these hoarders that clearly have hoarding issues if carrying 1000 pounds of worthless 1* items? Not taking sides but im just curious
---
 As much as this is absolutely needed I have never seen a moderator or dev post a comment in one of the countless threads I've seen about it.
---
 So I'm going to assume they don't know how to add a text chat into their game engine. Or maybe they do and it's just too complicated and too costly to implement. 
---
 I do not do use a mic nor ever will so a text chat function is absolutely necessary for people like me.
---
I agree it is amazing fun to use, mine has duel saws and the flame mod, it looks bad ass and the noise as your slicing through enemies is unmatched.
---
Mine does 43 dmg and 12 electrical when fully maxed at 200% but it's durability/dmg goes down too quick
---
And now who's the animal lmao
---
"Bethesda hates this guy, see how he made over 400 atoms in a short time. "
---
Look into mutations
---
"[Free Watoga!](https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Free_Watoga!)"
---
I got a bloodied one , it gives like hitkill in a lot of things , but the current 2nd and 3rd perks are useless for these kind of weapon
---
*Tch*...  
---
Well played good sir but you can still only have one.
---
Thanks, putting on PA station allowed me to put parts back on. Waited for 60 sec afterwards for it to be recalled.
---
However, I've got a number of empty PA chasis, and whichever I take out of stash just gets the armor pieces of the last equipped one. So Im still stuffed as it just replaced pieces I had on “empty” one.
---
Totally. In FO4 I had an automatic handmade called Pewpewpew.
---
Camping for farming purposes I can see being annoying.   
---
But Whitespring is a great CAMP area. The hotel's full of vendors, nice open areas to build, and it's very centrally located on the map which saves on travel costs.
---
They said if you put in a player vending machine at your camp they will be made public!
---
You should try to scrap some of those handle bars and see if they really give lead.
---
I got it on my 12th jump
---
Why not kill em?
---
just quit, or die. There are fights you won't win out there.
---
Why would repairing it give it extra damage?
---
don't come selling chems on my turf you hear.
---
I want to but all my steel gets turned into bullets and my stash is full of terrible legendaries I’m waiting to scrap.
---
It would be logical for the Black Rider to come last, since Death is the “conclusion” of everything. 
---
Also, I think BGS would keep the Black Rider for the end as it’s obviously a very appealing one (though I’m not fond of the style, I can’t deny the beauty of it, definitely an original one, that looks like it’s been “sculpted” in another world). Releasing it last will get people who eventually bought previous stuff to spend real money in order to get enough atoms. Clever move from BGS, painful choice for some of us! I’m personally a t-51b user, and at first didn’t like the look of the Pale Rider. But then I realized that its singular look, minimalist and yet intriguing, is actually quiet original and beautiful in its way. It looks like it’s been engineered to become either a biochemical weapon or a sophisticated power armor, capable of who knows what? Freeze without killing the user, so he/she can travel through time? These strange things on its shoulder look like Tesla coils, but what could they possibly represent or be used for? To absorb energy? Microorganisms from the air? Or perhaps it’s supposed to release something? Anyway, looks like a scientist pride, and I like it so far. Fingers are crossed, I hope it’ll get released today!
---
Hey, language!
---
:-p
---
Not perks but talons and twisted muscles mutations stack for gauntlets
---
Alrighty. Suppose I can find something else to use in the meantime. How much are you gonna want for it?
---
Is the only heavy weapon I can use.
---
I got an OK LMG drop for me a couple of days ago and after asking the heavy gunners in the community if after the recent buff this weapon was 'in a good place' and getting positive responses and compelling arguments made in its favour I was almost 'sold' on using it.
---
Then I started crafting ammo and dawned on me that I was going to have an aneurism 'feeding' it.
---
So, is back to my trusty Gatling and its judicious ammo usage.
---
Honestly bud, I can't speak for everyone, but the servers have been pretty much immaculate for me for the last couple months. I've been on servers where we kill the scorch beast queen three times in a row, and then spent another 5 hours afterword doing workshop farming. During SBQ fights there isn't lag, as well as her loot and others loading pretty much instantly.   
---
So for me, because my experience is so drastically different from yours in regards to the servers, I have to assume its a problem with your PC/Console/Internet connection. I'm not calling you a liar, just merely purposing that while you blame Bethesda for your disconnects, it could possibly be something on your end.

As for the balance changes, stop crying like a child and act like an adult. All things that over-perform in online games inevitably get tuned down. Specifically with shotguns; they aren't even being nerfed, they're currently broken and doing way more than they should. If these changes upset you, you might want to either consider calming yourself down or leaving the game entirely. There are bound to be countless more balance changes as the game evolves and adds new content, so I would prepare for that.  
---
Also use paragraphs please, it's proper etiquette, walls of text that aren't structured very well are both hard to read and usually hard to understand.
---
Oh, WAY too quick! Makeshift Warrior helps some, but I always carry 4 Flaming Long Bow Chainsaws with me so I can rotate through them.
---
Because it’s a melee weapon lol. Incisor and martial artist work with it. Other general perks like adrenaline and bloody mess too.
---
Yeah I’d like a source as well if possible
---
This....reddit gold but i'm already out for the month, sorry.
---
I'm surprised you don't have the survival guide.
---
Managed to sort it out with a bit of juggling....had to deploy couple of pa chasis until i could get a “clean” one to equip spare parts. This looks like a bug
---
if your on Xbox I'll buy all your ballistic fiber today.
---
Why would one farm concrete?
---
I appreciate your refined taste. We’re doing a scrimmage next week. Drive on by.
---
Because it’s not worth it I die I lose 17 caps at level 80 but when I get a kill i get 14 caps while in adventure I make 100+ caps off one guy
---
Falls under services.
---
It seems that not everyone has adopted this yet
---
I might. But It’s a big thing to fill the void right there. Id have to replace it.
---
You mean like server crashes for scorchbeast queen fights? FFS.
---
I hope so haha!
---
It was on the forums, can confirm
---
Faster to wait for the patch notes than find the link, lol
---
It’s what? Half hr?
---
Litteraly got my camp a few steps away from yours, got my an garage setup with more space for a trade station to be placed.
---
Looking good
---
Your really active in the fallout reddit community. I would gamble that you play the game a lot. Why not just get your 1400 caps everyday?
---
The drive-thru is always dropping plans with every Spaghetti Burrito purchase. *For when you want spaghet on the go!*
---
Yeah i know that isnt a bug , but atm the 3 star creatures are pretty rare and  ranged weapon has:
---
22 diferent possible perks in the first star
---
8 diferent possible perks in the 2nd star
---
10 diferent possible perks in the 3rd star
---
Melee
---
18
---
4
---
6
---
And armors
---
22
---
11
---
13
---
Even with a 100% certain 3 star drop the chance of got a perfect item its so low ... and i didnt considered the number of possible weapons and armor.
---
Imagine got a godroll perks in a pool clue ...
---
No idea it just does it goes from 2 damage to 30 at 200%
---
I got all logs and listen to them all again and again
---
I have all tape logs I done everything I can do
---
XB1 😕 but knowing that our camp lights up on the map is very promising!
---
Holy crap!
---
Insane!

I do i run an AA lmg and everytime i check out the ammou count i gotta make more even though i have 1800+
---
We’ve got it all. ShopSmart. Shop S Mart. Now with drive thru.
---
Thank you for checking!
---
wasnt on last night.  
---
Should be on tonight after I get the update.  I'll add you...
---
Not a bug . Name your chassis for future reference. We all used to have to deploy our many chassis to find the right one.
---
Btw, little offtopic, where can i setup the "Enclave" tag after my name ?
---
Technical issues are better.
---
That isn't how bug fixes work mah dude... At all.
---
Are you sure? You can check under challenges.  Mine glitches during beta.  I physically had all the tapes. But under challenges the first 2 were still not found. Had to start another character to obtain them.  Hope that helps. :(
---
I can't believe the cap limit. I've played 3-4 hours a week for two months mostly exploring and no farming, I'm at 14,000... If I farmed or wanted to use the barter system this would frustrate me to an end. The end of playing the game, hahahaha... Ha....
---
As long as you dont take a workshop or add anyone to your team, you should be safe.
---
3 star monster : drop a non legendary item like a drill , looks pretty broken to me , since the 1 and 2 star monster drops the legendary item for sure.
---
Because I think it’s wrong that if I kill a guy that is level 150 I should get 150 caps instead of less than 20 it just doesn’t make sense
---
Wise words friend
---
&gt; I keep running out of ammo and tend not to have a melee weapon.
---
Yeah, I was that person, until the first time I ran into some gulpers and found I had 3 rounds of .38 left.
---
Now I always have a backup melee weapon.
---
Cheers.
---
Or don't be envious little bitch and let that poor guy waste his life sitting there... It's not like the're hurting someone.
---
It saves. If someone is there you can choose new world or start over for free somewhere else.
---
Right!? 
---
I did the challenge to get the TS .50 Cal, was a great 20lb paperweight to hold my inventory down. Ended up selling it just to reduce weight.
---
Exactly 😂 If I have at least 1000, I'm happy, because I don't even know what I got🤷🏻‍♂️😂
---
They have to have direct power from a power line.
---
I'm looking forward to the quests. I can't ever seem to get enough stuff to do in the game (admittedly, I'm poor at grinding and not that into crafting).
---
I’m on mobile and I did it like this, tapped on r/fo76 then the options in the top right you tap on that and there’s a “change flair” option
---
Dang ight man thanks
---
Well, the bow is in the game files so it's just a matter of time...
---
Your wrong there are raiders and there are griefers there is a difference
---
I guess you could use it if you wanted to raise a ghoul army
---
"This guy figured out how to make 400 atoms a day from home with this one simple trick."
---
Exacavator can be build at several levels, with 45 being the lowest level.  
---
I got the mission at around 32, completed the mission and gathered the mats by  about 38, but didn't build it until 45 (highest level for excavator).
---
IIRC, I was already a 35 and had a complete set of T45  and 51 before I found all the parts for Raider.
---
I mean.....  he’s not cheating or exploiting.  This is useful legit info.  I hacked the same terminal 15 times to get some atoms. I just saw another one for kills with a sword. I’ve never used a sword. Now I’m going to find one and head to whitesprings. All legit in game ways to make atoms.
---
I got the atoms but not the trophy
---
It's a easteregg to Sokkas Sword from Avatar
---
Neat!
---
My CAMP (PC) is just outside Flatwood near the Red Rocket along the road.
---
It's The Flatwoods Bar and if you see it, all are welcome.
---
Im very limited currently, i hope they add a construction and road work week to make it more authentic.
---
Don’t go full carebear on workshops
---
My character is actually the origin story of the courier from Fallout New Vegas. Eventually he got an anti-aging mutation (kinda like what ghouls have minus the actual ghoulification). After years of adventuring in West Virginia he decided to start wandering around the US wasteland. He traveled to DC and the Commonwealth before heading west where he was shot by Benny and forgot who he was for a while, before regaining his memory just before Fallout 4 takes place and heads back east with Veronica and ED-E to find traces of his past.
---
Have you run a second character yet? If not I suggest it. It won’t take to long. You know exactly what youre doing. Just ignore everything but overseers logs.  My best wishes. Hope it unlocks for you!!!
---
I hope to see this during gameplay some time. Where exactly is your camp located?
---
Sounds like that is on Bethesda for nerfing survival. Either or, my coral isn’t with you. Workshops should be taken knowing there is a risk to what your doing but also a reward. I just don’t like the people that find a camp and destroy for no reason or reward. That’s fucked up. When taking workshops it notifies you that you are taking those risks. And what you do is perfectly within the game parameters.
---
Absolutely! Also, with all the different raider armors, they are awesome!
---
We pay taxes so that when the Free States vendor says “all items for sale, tax free” it actually means something lol
---
+karma Thanks for the tip
---
Yea the only time I ever destroy a camp of someone gets mad enough to message me for 3 days straight then I go and destroy some stuff
---
Oh cool so I guess Bethesda had SOME Easter eggs in the game because I had never found any and I’m quite the pop culture freak (well not anymore cuz I didn’t get that reference but you catch my drift ;)
---
Okay cool, just figured it would be good to avoid confusion. Under the sub box there is a community options button, its under there.  
---
Also I read through the discord logs, I get what you're talking about, just some kid who wanted to not hold up his end of the deal.   
---
Also somewhat off topic, asside from the fact that when you buy a duped item you're kind of getting ripped off since for dupers they're easy to aquire, but I don't quite understand how that would matter in general, weapons are weapons, duped or not. Since there's not any way to tell, it seems like people just being petty.
---
I've been watching 1 particular item very closely the past few days, since I first noticed that some was missing.
---
I purchased 20 Bulk ballistic Fiber from someone early last week, the following day I did some trading and acquired another 400 loose ballistic Fiber, I have used approximately 80 ballistic fiber in the past week, when I first logged on yesterday I only had 293 loose, and 8 bulks left in my stash, I played for 1.5 hours (Used 12 ballistic fiber for armor repairs), took an hour break for dinner, and when I logged back on, I had 213 Loose, and 2 Bulks in my stash.
---
I submitted another Support ticket to Bethesda, but I expect nothing in return that I don't already have (a canned email that indicates they don't have the time, capability, or resources to even bother investigating such things).
---
Looks very professional. Like something Bethesda would actually use in one of their Fallout games.
---
Brick walls
---
Another random player and I were doing that same thing yesterday.
---
Then I used an orbital strike on the turret CAMP and let my new partner take me out.
---
I found these at grafton steel, in the smaller building at the back in a locker.
---
Yes, it'll work on all of them
---
 [https://bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview](https://bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview)   
---
Literally in the into the vault. Please check google.
---
Or turret camps at Whitespring but that’s kinda of irrelevant now because everyone should be turning those lenses to harpers.
---
*wakes up at fissure site prime*
---
I think the vending machines of the trailer weren't made for trading. But to work as the ones at the station. A place to buy ammo and aid from yyour camp without the ability to sell things
---
Yep.  IGN shankwell.
---
My camp is across the tracks from the Whitespring Station.
---
Yea people that do that should automatically fired on
---
If you take the road along The Mire he's got a few spawn points, I saw him once in a blast zone near Fissure Prime too, which was rather hilarious.
---
Haha yes, I have this with fusion cores too! Got to keep my power armour running. 😅
---
No
---
not really.  I keep (at least) 1000 of any caliber I use regularly. 
---
Given it takes me about 200 rds to deal with a standard SB and its entourage, and the "worst" I've gotten was 4 of them back to back, that leaves me 200 to spare.
---
Plus I'm melee, so once the SB is down, I'm back to no ammo required :)
---
“Bob” was 40 years old when the vault closed.  As a scientist for ARPA, he was working in the vault when it sealed so his family did not get into the Vault.  Unbeknownst to either Bob or the other vault dwellers, his undiagnosed Alzheimer’s started to take a great toll on him. He woke up late on Reclamation day to find the vault empty,  walking around he was able to exit the Vault, and now wanders around West Virginia looking for a Starbucks so he can finally get the only joyous thing he can remember - a large caramel macchiato...
---
I see what you did there.  If Pompy is as tough as Phoenix, I'll let him do all the quests for me.
---
That's why I am hoping the player vendor and legendary purveyor will be done right. They have severely nerfed legendary spawns in the wild and the rewards from events have gotten much worse. I still get syringers and drills from legendary mobs. That's why when people get good legendaries, they jack up the prices.
---
😂😂
---
Legendary Vending is supposed to fix the legendary item gameplay loop, generally meaning its meant to help you aquire specific items you're trying to get. It hasn't been explained how it will work, but they are very aware how the trading currently works, and a very easy fix is to devalue all legendarys by making them less RNG more grind.   
---
Basically, If I can attain the things I want from a legendary vendor, why would I ever bother doing trading *unless they make it worth my wile*. I know Bethesda likes the fact there is a trading community, but they really don't like that certain gear is so hard to obtain it costs money.
---
Oh! I had no idea! Thanks.
---
Also painful when it has limb damage bonus
---
You and me both mate.. you and me both. Lol
---
I look forward to boring myself to death again getting the 100,000 tickets
---
not in inventory ! i had that happen with my excavator suit that i just got .. tried to enter .. game froze log back in , and its gone completly .. wasted alot of time getting that suit ..
---
Only a matter of time!
---
Honestly most of theese perks seem super weak compared to explosive or even +10% dmg while aiming or  + 25% fire rate
---
No. Atom shop items (including items with Atom shop paints on them) cannot be traded/dropped.
---
well everyone found a Legendsry Wooden Armor
---
No, Atom shop paints make the items not visible in the trade window. It's one of the nice perks of the Atom shop paints, you can't accidentally sell or trade an item with an Atom shop paint because the item doesn't even show up in the trade window. Also, you can't drop it either, or at least not without going through a confirmation dialog that tells you if you drop it the item will be destroyed.
---
Atom shop painted things cannot be gifted or traded so i assume they also will not be able to be sold.
---
I dont mind to trade legit stuff for items which I dont have, bcs I like to have wide collection, just for fun. What bothers me, is that there is not much to do to prevent such experience - no matter the trade deal.
---
If it works like dropping items, then anything with an atom shop icon  will self destruct as soon as you drop it.
---
The geography that i stands compares you superior.
---
Yes would be fantastic. Rather than just guessing what bizarre place you'll spawn at.
---
 want my Level 25 Excav P.A to finish that quest?
---
I often wondered why there isn't a red dot scope in the game for any weapon.
---
This is what bugs me. Every post that comes up about chain saw runs the risk of them nerfing it. If people knew, secretly, and would shoosh about it, no one would worry about the chain saw :(
---
First rule about chainsaw is we don't talk about chainsaw
---
roflmao how tf did you get downvoted?
---
&gt;Ammo needs to be by type.. Energy 2c Ballistic 2c Explosive 3c Special (bolts, cannon balls, etc) 1-3c 
---
No with a few exceptions 1 cap each it'll clear out my inventory. Seriously you can craft 180 5mm at a time I'd assign 1/2 or 1/4 cap to 5mm of I could.
---
Besides the Market will be all over the place for a few days maybe weeks then prices will stabalize.
---
I'm pretty sure they were removed from her loot pool.
---
30 types of items. Not 30 individual items.
---
that build there looks about like my friends sniper build that we just finished working on. like that you took int up to 8 so you can have gunsmith and weapon artisan to get your weapons to 200%. you shouldnt have much issues killing anything fairly quickly with that set up. my build i posted below is a lil different since i use explosive weapons but i have a hard time beating him to tag things before he kills em. 
---
its a race sometimes but im 255 and hes i think 99 now so i dont mind letting him get more xp than me since he is still playing catch up, but i have to tease him that i am gonna start headshotting things if he dont share.
---
Somewhat lol
---
While I don’t necessarily have an energy weapons build, I use select mods to optimize using the Plasma Flamer; which, is arguably the best barre mod you can attach on the plasma rifle.
---
Rifleman and battery pack is all you really need to use it. The plasma flamer is affected by rifleman for whatever reason. Battery pack helps reduce how heavy plasma carts. can be, considering you have to hold thousands.
---
I would also suggest adrenaline because this weapon has the capability to take down numerous enemies within its available 300 plasma carts.
---
No. It will offer items and possibly mods for purchase. Most likely a batch of say 5 items that they cycle weekly.
---
My first thought, "dont want my guns to expire". :D
---
But we all know that Bethesda keep doing the opposite. 
---
If you watched PAX east Todd clearly said you could "'re roll" your legendary items yet in inside the vault it change and now it appears you can o my "purchase legendary gear using script" Absolutly  no mention of re rolling items. 
---
Don't get your hopes up.
---
Also de-valuing items only works if you flood the market and Bethesda will NOT do that.
---
I like everyone's enthusiasm in here, but are you all aware that people will simply be opening their MAP screen and clicking on your camp to buy? They won't be coming in person unless they want to tour. Yes, we will all be able to see other people's C.A.M.P. location, but the vast majority of purchases will just be from the map screen...
---
If you hit it with one repeatedly from the moment it's shield drops it has a really bad time too.
---
Agreed. Just keep hopping a few times a day. I had nothing for three weeks then hit two in two days.
---
Nope, I had the same idea but it will not let you sell any armor with atom shop paint on it.  When you try and trade it won’t even list it in your inventory as available for trade until you remove the paint.  I think it’s BS because if I bought the skin I should be able to do whatever I want with it IMO......
---
“You’re finally awake”
---
Yeah, that makes sense. I think it's too much too ask to allow for basically free good loot for everyone.
---
Can't wait to start checking out people's camps.
---
Wish me luck dude im dying for it. But i guess youbare right best stuff comes when you dont expect them
---
Great job!!
---
I love this idea but unfortunately people will down vote it. I made a post yesterday talking about how the nominal fee in the vending machines will only make prices go up. There needs to be a banking system in this game. That way the max cap issue is over. Charge a service fee to have your account. Also the vendor bots need a serious overhaul. They dont drop anything any more. Pooling the caps to 1400 was a good start but they still dont have anything i want to buy except bulk junk, mods, and the stuff people foolishly sell to the vendor bots(that i resell). 
---
There are a million ways to make money in this game. What can i spend it on?
---
The most unlegendary legendary of legendarys.
---
Lets already blend in the legendary presentation screen to show you how legendary it is and also 10 minutes later again from nowhere - because... legendary.
---
Do ya mean Northwest?
---
I got a second character at level 4 I have to play with that one
---
Chainsaw level 20 + dual bar + flamer mod + weapon artisan perk and it grinds up pretty much anything that isnt armored.  I believe I get 47 phys/17energy from this, chews things up like a melee minigun.  At lvl 45/50 it would be ludicris and get nerfed pretty quick would be my fear.
---
Thats only a suggestion .... cause the current 2nd and 3rd  are almost useless for Mr handy , ripper and maybe in a future for drill and chainsaw...
---
I hope bethesda implement new perks for this kind of weapon ...
---
A game dev could know better what kind of perks insert in this weapons ...
---
Better to death them.
---
I never claimed they weren't legit, fool.
---
I was just saying that I put 500 hours into this game. I'll probably never play it again, but it was fun once.
---
My bet:  
---
Selling a randomly generated wide selection of weapons and armors for set amounts, possibly with a degree of randomness on the prices.  
---
eg: 1\* @ 10 scrip, 2\* @ 25 scrip, 3\* @ 75 scrip, all +/- 50%  
---
Then you endlessly server hop hoping for the vendor to load with an item you want.  
---
Possibly weighted prices for specific stats, but I reckon that'll be too difficult to maintain when future balance changes swing the meta considerably.
---
Cryolators own that event. Just turn the imposter into an icicle and everyone's free to smack the life out of it without any real danger.
---
I mean hopefully the solution will be that you can get the exact legendary you need from the vendor, so trading item for item becomes less common. 
---
Because there is no auction house, the player trading community has turned to a pretty unhealthy place. Generally, its easier to do and harder to grief if weapons or armor are sold and bought for caps. So, because of the instances of people to do item for item trades, the risk is significantly increased.  
---
Honestly, I don't see them making item for item trades easier, since its also the least inclusive way of trading. Any player can accumulate 24000 caps, but only lucky ones (as of right now) can aquire specific legendarys that are acutally used for item swap trades.
---
Trading is not implemented in-game, and as such is risky. You should know that and accept it. That said, you can always rely on a middleman. I personally don't really like the idea of a trade done half today half tomorrow. Those things left undone are ...wrong.
---
You'll hit one eventually. In the meantime, if you find Core Assembly, and/or Emergency Protocols and have the caps, you might pick those up and resell them as they are in demand torso mods as well. And needless to say.... Calibrated Shocks!
---
I hate wooden armor so much and the leaf covered mod for it is even more infuriating
---
Ok you win, have a good day
---
I use rifles.. nothing automatic...
---
I like to keep around 400 on me when I go out doing runs...
---
267.
---
Yasss I love my cryolater
---
I got ghoul slayers radium rifle :/
---
Oh fuck
---
Yea! Can't wai....zzzzzz
---
Let's be real. Way the armor works in this game all low dmg/high fire rate weapons are bad by deafault.
---
That would allow me to get everyone travelling to my CAMP right in the middle of some 10 rad emitters. Interesting...
---
I love the game itself but it is very clear the Bethesda put no real though into the economy before they launched and has made no real effort to fix it. Player vending is not a new thought. The vending machine was in the original teasers so they new they were going to have it all along.
---
The only way to fix it properly is to introduce a single auction house or market place where everyone can access and trade. 
---
It doesn't have to be complicated. The trade mechanics are already there(sort of).. Just have a location where you can access,search and place items for sale, the items can be stored on a separate server so everyone can see them but no player can get there...job done, market fixed.
---
afyer about 3 weeks the price if items will fall massively as people will constantly under  it each other untill we reach a sustainable price.
---
OH SHIT YOU ON XBOX TOO?
---
If modern MMO social climates are an indicator, I doubt it.
---
Holy crap these things are convenient..
---
Yup. That's the idea.
---
Sell lvl 5 and up pocketed leathers for them new folk.
---
Maybe charge like 10c. Less if I'm good on materials.
---
“It’s not a restroom, it’s my office”.
---
There is no problem with setting up a camp near a landmark.
---
It becomes a problem when you make it a mudhut with only 4 wood foundations and a bunch of large generators, powering 10 missile turrets, directly aimed at the golf club's ghoul spawn locations.
---
If you do this, you *deserve* your camp destroyed.
---
I also am curious where this "+25 radiation resistance is disease resistence" comes from.
---
The latest info I have on that is [Aten_ra's bug round up](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/anaav4/unofficial_but_comprehensive_bug_roundup_armor/) from February. He shows that the effect is set to `SET` instead of `ADD` . He is a data minner so where does the other information come from?
---
You only get them from the whitrsprings bunker now
---
That sounds like a better solution than my go-to, which is campfires.
---
The game has Skyrim bugs so you're asking too much
---
That's almost exactly what I was thinking, down to those exponential rates for various legendary tiers. Hopefully all those cheap junkie's lead pipes, that I have accumulated so far, will be somewhat useful.
---
They will fix the chainsaw and power drill....for the cosmetic upgraded versions they put in the atom shop, much like with the Assaultron Head
---
"Stacks" most likely means selling X number of an item for X caps
---
How about a game with no parameters at all?
---
Thanks for sending me these, haven't played in a while bit still appreciate you send me this
---
Indeed, gatling fo life bud, we need a skin for it that alter its visuals!
---
No guessing for me. Facing the same solid beauty of a rock on the opposite of my camp. Every. Time.
---
I saw that damn stone more often than mole rats and they are everywhere. I named it Roxy.
---
Id be for that! A centralized location for a player hub. Also a universal chat window for the server would solve some advertising issues. Make a post on that server saying you have things for sale or you are looking for things. Not everyone uses Reddit/facebook/discord for trading. Ive made some of my best trades with random players i come across.
---
I had the vendor spawn the other day, while there was a camp next to the train station. Suprised me..
---
I'd totally buy that :)
---
Me to! But, i hope Death rider skin comes today 🤘
---
It is fantastic for stealth builds. I wish it could come in 2 and 3-star flavors, though.
---
Hah hah. No.
---
Whitesprings train station. Then follow the road north next to taco bell, the sole surviving restaurant from the franchise wars.
---
Insert xxx amount of  scrips to get a random 1, 2 or 3 * item = heavy rng as now
---
I'm hoping for a partial rerolling which allows you to reroll one of legendary effects the item has, just like the Divison and Diable 3 had. So I've been hoarding 3\* items that have near perfect rolls... Well, let's see how it turns out.
---
All that stuff works with gauntlents too, but Gladiator works only with meat hook
---
Yea, I know by now that. It was perhaps my fault, because I have history to do such trades with other people, and never had issues. Thats why I was caught off-guard.
---
Yeah just for kicks and singing different recently I used it to farm whitesprings works perfectly fine
---
With ordinary vending perk cheapest are 2 caps. And it's not Bethesda choosing to let something, they are not allowing us to set the price in digits.
---
Raiders will be raiders?  
---
Which means raiding vendors and quest givers from opposing factions. It means not meekly paying a small fortune for a stim pack and getting next to nothing for a legendary missile launcher which will equip their enemies. It means not empowering their enemies by completing quests for them and receiving nothing of benefit in return aside from a negligible amount of caps or exp they could've just taken from someone else.  
---
How about: toxic griefers will be toxic griefers, even if they attempt to use a 'roleplaying' excuse to justify their spiteful antisocial gameplay because they can't stand by their actions and admit their pathetic attempts to ruin someone else's experience?
---
I will be. I'm situated on the highway just outside of Morgantown. Gonna do a full rebuild into a bar/store setup complete with neon signs
---
Or the Doom chainsaw...yeah, we need these things.
---
I’m sure people will line up for my revolver ivory grips and Mr. Handy buzzblade plans.
---
&gt;But we all know that Bethesda keep doing the opposite.  
---

&gt;If you watched PAX east Todd clearly said you could "'re roll" your legendary items yet in inside the vault it change and now it appears you can o my "purchase legendary gear using script" Absolutly no mention of re rolling items.
---
I didn't watch Pax east, but I don't see how them changing how to address the legendary item loop means they aren't going to do that. I also wasn't talking about the inside the vault, I was talking about the Bethesda day's conference (the most recent even't they've spoken at about fallout 76), just as a point of order. This sort of thing happens all the time in game development, *especially* in a live service game like 76. 
---
&gt;Don't get your hopes up.
---
I mean, they've fixed almost every major issue the game has had somewhat reasonably, they understand that the entire endgame is making legendary sets. I don't expect a button that just shits out everything I want, but I don't think its unrealistic to hope *for the exact thing they've said they will deliver*.
---
&gt;Also de-valuing items only works if you flood the market and Bethesda will NOT do that.
---
Why not? There's no Atom value associated with in game items like weapons or armor. There's no real incentive for them to not fix the loop *they have acknowledged is broken* by making these items easier to obtain, hense somewhat flooding the market with them. 
---
I think its prudent to point out while they don't intend to devalue what people have achieved, it also doesn't help them if its a very small portion of their player-base. The  average playtime is around 4 hours per session, so its not unreasonable to assume a large portion of the player-base are not part of the somewhat small highly geared section of the player-base that would be the most likely to see legendarys becoming easier to attain as devaluing their "Hard work"
---
The problem so much isn't whitespring camps, but rather Whitespring turret towers that just kill everything and no one gets XP or items.
---
You sell your \[3 Star\] Quadruple Vats OneShot Explosive Shotgun to get \[3 Scrips\]
---
So you can buy another Weapon randomly generated into the Purveyors Inventory exactly how the Bot Vendors work which will probably cost around \[20-50 Scrips\]. Why? To get rid of the huge amounts of legendaries farmed and stocked up by people with 2 accounts and 10 characters. You will not get a guaranteed improvement method for your op weapons to make them even more op. Just a randomized casino legendary slot npc. Just hope that you don't need to server hop 500 times just to find 3 star legendaries like you already do to get a x01 jetpack mod.
---
Getting 20K caps is incredibly easy and fast. Until you allow people to easily creaft headwear for 1 rubber and 1 cloth and sell that for a ridicolous amount of caps, well caps mean nothing.
---
15000 ammo for minigun. And I started thinking that I need more. That's why I'm using melee for now.
---
Meh...tbf PA already has calibrated shocks, so I'm content with the change.
---
I got it yesterday. In my first try
---
If your on Xbox I know a guy that could give you a x01
---
Jetpack (if he has them in stock) for 1000-2000 caps
---
If I don’t get a goddamn water slide, we RIOT
---
Great idea! I’ve pretty much stopped claiming unless I want some quick supplies and I also give all my known plans to low levels so sometimes I claim so I can get more, or will hop in if it’s a low level defending their claim so I can give them a hand and some supplies and plans! I love the random acts of kindness in the wasteland.
---
Did the same on Power Armor just picked up a load at Watoga, and the train station. Paint them there, scrap, repeat. For weapons I just did scoped and stocks as they didn't require much only a load of adhesive.
---
Great build, I just started my camp there, but I have more of a "toll and store" tipe entrance on the top of the bridge and my house under the bridge. When I finish it ill send some pics.  
---
Really like what you did, gave me some nice ideas :)
---
Me. When I was level 40-50.
---
Until I switched to melee/gatling plasma.
---
Although there's more than just ammo anxiety that caused me to go melee.
---
I did name them, I think this is a bug.
---
In my stash I have
---
- T51b (named)
---
- Excavator (named)
---
- 3 other bare unnamed chasis
---
If I pick any of the unnamed ones, they will always have parts that are fitted to named T51b one.
---
After I managed to put my Ultracite PA into the stash (named as well), all unnamed ones started having parts from ultracite pa.
---
Really? A whole tripod?
---
It's she not he. We really are going full tilt on the speculation rather than reading up first, eh. Anyhoo, the articles suggest it's just another vendor.
---
Fuck a suppressor, the 10mm SMG needs a god damn front sight.
---
Whoa weird. If it keeps doing that after closing and reopening the game I'd for sure file a bug report yeah.
---
Pepperidge farm remembers!
---
Oh...... I think I sold or scrapped on of those.
---
FUCK
---
Bro i think it’s a sword, not sure though
---
Lol, removed serum recipes, didn’t remove ultracite limb plans which are free now
---
They said they were removed from Her levelled list in the last patch.
---
Said that they also said that drills had been removed from the legendary levelled list(s) and we all know how that turned out :P
---
Heard treasure Maps are a good way to find plans cant confirm tho
---
Wall of text below.
---
As I said my character is named Pvt. Beck Brightstar, but was born as Rebecca Hoffman in the Vault, but before that, little story for her parents.
---
Her farther Joseph Hoffman was a famous musician from the Town of Helvetia, he played the guitar and was touring all around the country. On one of his concerts for the military in camp McClintok for the graduation of the new cadets he met her mother Mary Stewart. Mary was an aspiring athlete who was preparing for the Olympic games. After a quick flirt they started dating. Mary and Joseph were chosen from Vault-tec to enter Vault 76 for their achievements and on the event of a nuclear attack they should be prepared to get there as soon as possible.
---
For one year their relationship was blooming and they chose the date of September 3rd, 2078 for their wedding. However on October 23rd, 2077 the alarm for nuclear attack blasted through the streets of Charleston. Mary took her belongings and with the help of her brother, decorated veteran from Anchorage, one of the first soldiers who used power armor, successfully reached the vault. Mary insisted on waiting for Joseph, but she wasn't given a choice and entered the vault. Her brother was last seen heading for camp McClintok. Joseph wasn't able to reach the vault in time and it was sealed. Mary wasn't able to tell him that she is pregnant and soon gave birth in the vault. She named her newborn girl Rebecca after her grandmother and gave her the surname Hoffman to honor her father.
---
Rebecca was one of the few children in the vault, but since she was the only one without father, the other treated her very badly. So she remained somewhat distanced from the social life. She excelled in school and was called often called very bright by her teachers, but because of her distance from her classmate almost like a star she was nicknamed Brightstar.
---
In her free time she often trained in the gym and read books of the knights of old times, often dreaming about being in their place. Her mother, now part of the vault security, told her stories of her family. Rebecca then thought, that she could be knight in a shining power armor, helping the people of Appalachia and fighting the enemies who dropped the nukes, separating their family.
---
When the vault doors opened Rebecca rushed to camp McClintok, which she had only heard about. And because she was from the vault and these lands were not familiar to her, she stumbled to the town of Flatwoods. There she learned about the Responders, as if faith brought her there.
---
Rebecca completed their training and on the road to the mission in Morgantown airport she went to check her mother, who stayed behind to ensure that all vault dwellers safely emerge from the vault. Before she reached it however she saw a humongous flying beast with the most horrible screech in the air near the vault. It was heading towards her and despite the fear sneaked in the first building that was in front of her and observe the beast. When it vanished in somewhere in the south, she continued to the vault and found her mother on the stairs badly hurt. Brightstar was now a Responder, so she gave her mother a stimpak and carried her to Charleston's AVR Medical Center, where she learned about the vaccine for the "scorched" plague.This meant nothing to her, but Mary was starting to develop some kind of illness vaguely similar to it. So Rebecca embarked on a journey to acquire it. She traveled to the Top of the world ski resort because of the radio message and met Rose. Beck as her mother often called her, disliked the stranger raider bot, but had no choice to obtain the information needed.
---
On one of the missions near Huntersville she found a power armor lying in the bushes. She accidentally stumbled on it, while sneaking in the bushes, hiding from a group of tall green humanoid looking creatures. While trying to open the armor, she noticed that it's hatch was fused. Luckily Beck found a blowtorch near the lake and started to heat then slam on the suit with a hammer covered in a dirt rag to lower the noise. After two or three hours she was able to open the hatch. And then she noticed the body in it. Mummified, but still in the military fatigues. The dog tag identified the body as sgt. Brian Stewart. Her long lost uncle! She then found his military id and personal holotape containing his diary. After playing the holotape she understood her uncle's horrible fate. The nuclear blast has sealed his hatch and he was unable to eat or drink for 15 days when he finally fell from exhaustion and died near Huntersville. She promptly burred him in a shallow grave and vowed never to use power armor abandoning her dream to be a knight.
---
Now with her uncle's id she traveled to camp McClintock. Where she learned the basics of military training and earned the rank of Private. Private Beck Brightstar vowed to clear the state of West Virginia from all evil creatures or humans.
---
Wall of text from me as well and I tried to tell only the important parts. My character, currently level 70 has never set foot in a nuked zone or used a power armor. She fears nukes, because it shattered her mother's world and power armors, because they killed her uncle. I am a sneaky commando wielding two handmades and a lever action rifle. Often helping newbies and resuscitating every player in my vicinity who asks for help.
---
TL;DR Lawful Good ex-vault dweller turned military to honor her uncle.
---
P.S. Copied from another similar thread, but it is still my backstory, but since the game is pushing me in the nuked zones more and more, I now own an excavator power armor, which I maintain on a daily basis.
---
We have an architecture snob I see. I've built dozens of elaborate camps, but now it's one square stairs and turrets in order to be mobile; which the C.A.M.P. is intended to be.
---
I feel like people are getting the wrong message from this post. And dude I’m on your side. I was simply trying to suggest a solution for the problem which it’s seems you may not have read about in the final part of the post. However this is all irrelevant due to the update coming up on Tuesday. We don’t have to worry about “griefers” destroying our camps anymore (at least this is what I have been lead to believe)
---
Oh, you and your facts. Wild speculation is the spice of the reddit life...
---
My guess is they might have a changing inventory for the Purveyor of named items for sale, kind of like an atom store for weapons/armor with scrip as the currency.  The Purveyor sold named items will have pre-determined stats like the weekly Survival challenge rewards.
---
At least that's what I'm hoping they come up with - any RNG based system will just create further frustration.  Selling legendary mods would be even better allowing us to build our own custom perfect sets, but I'd rather not get my hopes up too much.  It would allow us to basically take any 3\* and make the perfect set of prefixes.
---
.50 CAL (expl) = 5 000 - 10 000 rounds. My main weapon.
---
5mm = 2 500 - 3 500 rounds for my gatling "side arm"
---
Ultracite plasma garling = 6 - 10 to "warm up the queen".
---
oof.  I'd argue that if you are a Fallout fan and like MMOs, then maybe then it's worth it under $30. But if solo is more your jam i'd wait.
---
thanks, it truly helps!:)

"It's mole MAN, not mole LADY, AND that's a scientific fact!"

Buyer beware
---
Well yes... But actually no
---
Your are not alone, same here, most i played with are gone, lol
---
I have a lv187, lv97, lv30 and a lv32 alt on Xbox and a lv90 something on pc , hahaha
---
It keeps getting better, and after todays patch it will be even more great, i have played since first beta hour :)
---
Ever notice how the construction lights cast a dim aurora even when they aren’t powered?
---
For starters:
---
Luck: bloodymess3
---
Strength: Incisor3, martial arts3, gladiator,
---
Charisma: Tenderizer, lone wanderer
---
I alos like glowsight and green thumb for nuke zones.
---
It should be RNG based.
---
I'd love it if we got to provide the base armor/weapon.  I'd love to try to get legendary effects on Enclave scout armor.
---
If it's just "buy from a randomly rolled legendary pool" then the pool needs to include *every* weapon and armor in the game.
---
This is absolutely brilliant!! Now I kinda want to rebuild my seedy dive bar/hotel to cover the road it's on, instead of just abutting it... got 35 min til the update, I can TOTALLY do that. Also, your little writeup is priceless :D
---
As a guy who's always looking for new plans, you can bet that I'll be coming on over to take a look!
---
you have to do the questline first.
---
i know that the whitesprings trainstation has a poster to the left of the door next to the tinkerers workbench. you "read" the party poster to start it.
---
You go back to Biv each day for a new daily quest and get the plans that way.
---
You dont need other Peoples weapons anymore and you can ignore there hilarious prices. Just farm legendaries and put em into the scrib slot machine to get yourself a 3 star weapon. It's not guaranteed and random, but with 500 legendaries on 5 different characters from 3 accounts you are going to be very very pleased.
---
How is it different from Fortnite killing / looting?
---
It sucks when that happens in Adventure, but in survival you expect it.  Yesterday in survival I was scrapping some stuff and cooking a bit in my camp when I hear an all too familiar hiss and sputter of an artillery flare.  I quickly attempt to log out but for some reason it is taking forever.  I can hear the shell whistling and then the joyful sound of the main menu music.  I don't think it actually hit my camp but when I log in tonight that will tell the tale.
---
That being said in survival the few times I have come across someone's camp, I've never started just blowing it up, that's kinda lame.  You gotta be more clever, more creative, such as rigging their front door area with a couple of Nuka mines then hiding in the bushes and hoping they come back before the mines despawn.  Truth be known, I've done this several times but have only had it pan out twice where the person actually came back in time.  Helps to have chameleon gear and improved sneak to avoid turrets.  Also helps to be playing the theme song from jackass on a loop.
---
Have to do the brewing quest to completion. Find the party poster at the train station to start.
---
Luna Last, vault baby. Upon exit she wanted to see where her dad lived and went to school. Loyal to the Overseer and viewed Vault-Tec as humanity saviors. Learned of Vault-Tecs deeds and experiments at VTU, she got shook but still believed in the good of the Overseer. Upon killing the Overseers lover, she broke and now abores Vault-Tec and lost faith in herself and all she knows. She found the cult and is looking into their dealings and awaiting the coming or a sign to guide her.
---
If only the Wounding (Deal 25 Bleed damage on hit) prefix was in. My Ripper was a thing of beauty.
---
you can also click fast enough to apply standard paint  and confirmation button after that twice or even three times, this way you'll get to your challenge goal much faster. (And with less resources spent to apply different paint) the game registers additional clicks towards crafting challenge goals client-side.
---
5k+ on 5.56
---
2k+ on 5mm
---
5k+ on Prime .50cal
---
1k on .45
---
Mostly use AAE handmade and on events suit up on PA and pull out my .50cal
---
5mm is for my limb damage gatling gun, that thing is fun
---
.45 is for my zealots combat rifle and use it mainly for scorched and anything under level 50
---
pick up your little camp thing in the edit mode and move it somewhere else in your camp. it will love where you respawn.
---
but its random as far as i can tell where it actually puts you.
---
Shop smart. Shop S Mart
---
Harpers Ferry, down the alley passed the vendor that leads to the chemist workbench. There are about 10 bags
---
Probably the same bug that makes a deal no damage to begin with
---
Unarmed as others have said. And (been a while not sure if they fixed it) but one handed weapon perks used to stack on fist weapons as well.
---
It's just laziness I am too lazy to power up the reactor and it's faster to build generators I usually try to power up all three plants.
---
For sure I can't wait for this update. Lol I don't want to go into work today and have to wait till I get out to play.
---
But can they if they have hostile turrets near them ? Doesn't it count as an enemy ?
---
I'm on xbox... sn Dookiestorm... ya dont need to do anything for me though... just happy to share the info
---
Nope, you are not alone.
---
My friends quit to go back to modding FO4 - to be fair they are working on something quite amazing - after it became obvious that this game was a clear departure from its predecessors.
---
I did get my daily dose of flak for 'staying behind' but I pressed on and now I have my very own party of four functional and geared toons which allows me to play a sort of 'solo+' mode.
---
I find myself at odds with the devs and the 'PvP crowd' on occasion but all in all is fun.
---
Well Everyone is saying the same thing so I wont spam you all with individual :(
---
I assume though that if you sell a chassis it will have all the pieces on it though? Minus the paint of course :/
---
I feel like I might have a sale on PA sometime or open up a workshop to craft and sell them lol

Nuka world dlc trailer
---
This post is dumb
---
This is cringy.
---
But I had the same for my Fallout 4 character.
---
Not the exact same.
---
I still keep doing it.
---
I look back and cringe.
---
At this point I'd buy it at a high price
---
Are you compromising your health? No? Then play the mf game.
---
specific items each week/day similar to that guy who shows up in destiny each weekend. but this guy stays there.
---
Are the other hold-trigger-to-murder weapons like the ripper and mr handy broken the same way?
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH 😁🙏
---
Not true, still almost no difference in damage
---
That's awesome! Nice work. I hope we get vehicles someday for this reason. :)
---
i got one spare, Beth ID : Khaithan
---
Ooh, Nukashakes! An American tradition, never mind the radiation! Or the blue glow of Cherenkov radiation from your delicious, whipped-cream and cherry topped Quantumshake!
---
You should totally get some halloween candy from the Watoga event and put a bunch in a bag in that bowl every day.
---
On now?
---
Probably goes along the lines of a sharper chain.  For a real chainsaw a sharper blade cuts better than a dull one so as you use it it dulls and needs to be resharpened. I'm not sure about the 200% thing though, a dull chainsaw would still do massive amounts of damage against flesh and would cause massive blood loss.  So whether its at 100% sharp or ultra sharp 200% it wouldn't really mean anything when your using it to hack and slash your way through a creature.  Same thing with the Mr. Buzz Blade which is just a circular saw on a sick.  Both of these weapons should be blood spraying death machines worthy of your best horror movie scene.
---
But it's still worse than both the Ripper and Mr. Handy Buzz Blade. Both of those have the same very fast attack speed and increased damage from over repair but they also benefit from damage perks.
---
Added, will pay a visit tonight! From the Netherlands.
---
yep, request sent
---
You mean Xur? Yeah, that might work, too.
---
The vendor's probably gonna be close to useless. Let's hope not.
---
The entire purpose of the vendor should be to be able to get *good* legendaries easier.
---
Let's hope it's actually going to be like that.
---
I will proceed to assume the vendor as a human, and I also assume it'll be like current vendors, only you can sell only legendaries, and some Terraria-like "reforge" option is also possible.
---
Come to think of it, maybe there is. I don't read reddit too much.
---
In an Ideal world:  
---
Like with plans, the Vendor will sell every possible combination of legendary item, with scrip prices for 1\* being relativity low, and 3\* being almost absurdly high (example if  selling a 1\* =  1 scrip, a 3\* legendary would cost 300+ scrip). This would eliminate RNG for players who grind a lot, as well as allow players to entirely avoid player trading if they choose, while not devaluing all legendary to the point they are worth nothing in player trades. 
---
In our world:  
---
randomized vendor list of assorted 1\* to 3\* legendarys,  the list is of curated weapons and armor combinations, especially for 3\*, with some odd combinations thrown in for variety.  Scrip costs for this system would probably pretty low because its RNG.
---
are you part of a discord group that banns scammers? you can just show them the evidence and they wont be doing it anymore.
---
Yeah i also would like to know 10% is a lot of money but where are the 10% gonna go to an admin accont???
---
yea that guy.
---
 i couldnt rememebr how to spell his name. i wrote Zer but it didnt look right.
---
Well that sounds just great, "luckily" I crafted &amp; scrapped 1 at a time because the only mod I really wanted was the suppressor. Well, at least now I have a bunch mods for the Handmade...
---
Hm shows you as being offline
---
I honestly wouldnt mind doing like a grocery store or whatnot. My solution was to just stock up on non-perishables. Blamco Mac, Insta-mash. All canned and boxed goods really. Think it'd be a fun idea - wont make any money but meh. **Flavorful**.
---
I dont know where to go. it is not obvious enough
---
What is your ign?
---
Game seriously needs a cap sink, something that makes us need to spend caps and also wants us to spend caps on. The 10% tax is insignificant and means nothing as many people all ready have 20k+ caps and nothing to spend them.
---
I'm almost maxed and can't find anything to spend it, so how will I sell items to other players through my vending machine as I can't get anymore caps. If they buy it, will they lose caps and get the item and I lose the item not get the caps?
---
*Hands OP the controller/keyboard*
---
Need a fix man?
---
To farm the queen
---
It's the justifying and legitimising of the 'I'm a raider' cop out that I'm objecting to. I've yet to hear of a 'proper' raider RPer and I'm not even sure anyone would saddle themselves with such a gameplaying hinderance. Besides, there's a PVP server now. No self-respecting 'raider' would set foot on the 'carebear' server
---
[Get away from her you bitch](https://i.imgur.com/6Mp5H9a.gif?noredirect)
---
Nice stuff. I'm 50/50 about what you wrote, most of the Bugs have to be adressed - yeah, but your "mechanic" part is a bit iffy, much of that stuff is subjectiv. However, what stings me the most is the "mechanic" regarding the removal of the artificial rad resistance on PA and Hazmat - all i can say to that is, you can have as much lead lining as you want on the armor pieces you wear, there is still stuff that is exposed to the raw radiation, like hands, face etc. while in hazmat and power armor you are "sealed" in.
---
Theres actually quite a few, i dont get alot of them myself but thats cause im coming to realize im from the last generation and the new gen kids have their new crazes haha.
---
Second nuke to kill the SBQ instandly
---
Whitespring second nuke to make longer loot time?
---
Should've sold the map🤷‍♂️
---
It's way more immersive to loot a super sledge off a dog.
---
Yeah definitely does, noticed it couple of weeks ago. Will report a bug.
---
I don't like folks advertising 'half base price' like it's a deal. I can effectively get 50% off from robots with bargain boosts and selling more to it after the buy to get some back.
---
No. You get various items from him, but the plans are given to you for completing the initial quest.
---
You have to remove a skin in order to sell anything to a vendor bot
---
Terminals can be used by multiple people. If the actual terminal is in use the next player will open it on their pipboy.
---
More sights would be a treat, but I'd be much happier with a suppressor for that stealth bonus and how the gun has been modifiable with them in the past.
---
One man Army is the strongest heavy weapons perks for pvp.
---
Why do it at whitesprings though?
---
Damn you! We alcoholists are oppressed enough!
---
###
---
What a trooper !
---
Looking good bud, hope I come across it some time.
---
came here to say this! :D
---
im online, did you accept the friend request?
---
Haha, Cheers bro, I did the same drive through idea, but mine is on a railroad bridge.
---
May the caps flow through your gates.
---
Mobs per square foot at white springs is insane. Plus tons of flux.
---
Y'know your also breaking the rules of this sub now, I assume you used m76 to trade with the scammer, so just report the guy to the mods.
---
Hopefully weekly and not server based don't need another server hop reason
---
I'm all for them giving you guys this. I just really hope if they do it, they make it so it can be disabled or controlled as to who you will see it from. It would frustrate me to see people advertising their goods or my mom on it. If yall hate griefers your gonna hate spammers more.
---
It's a cap sink. If you charge more (the ~11% to compensate for the 10% loss), you're removing **more** than the 10% base charge from the economy. This is what Bethesda **wants**.
---
So if you actually want to "fight the system", you should charge less. I, for one, look forward the your below market prices to get back at Bethesda.
---
Play the hell out of it and have fun. When you finally move on at some point, you'll know you got your money's worth out of it.
---
But why do it when it's already been nuked? Maybe it's not obvious but zoom in on my picture and you see overlapping nuke zones.
---
Yes I do!
---
Really I just like to be prepared so if someone drops on prime I can just up and go. Except I try to keep above 10k 5.56 for an extended full-auto nuke zone trip.
---
But it takes 3 pieces of wood and 2 steel and 1 concrete to fix it all in a matter of seconds..lol
---
Whitesprings - despite numerous... rebalances - is still the most reliable place to nuke for 'spawn density' and is not bad for certain fluxes.
---
There are other locations of course that are favourable for different varieties of fluxes but when it comes to 'having things to mow down' and the coveted chance of legendary spawns WS is a safe bet where other places are hit and miss.
---
Besides, is bloody convenient with shops, stash and the very useful sulfur spring all within spitting distance.
---
You’re right - I read that as more plans to craft with the fermenting station!
---
Atom shop confirmed P2W that's it I'm uninstalling this was the last straw
---
Maybe itll spawn a second queen?
---
People worse than Himmler or Hitler do exist.
---
It does, but why the perfect overlap and not make it different as possible, and why do it at whitesprings at all?
---
I should save these - and drop them at all the atrocious, no class floating camps I come across.
---
I'm hoping they make the inventory large but maybe reset weekly like how the survival challenges work. That way they can avoid more of the "server hopping the game" style
---
I agree with the 10% tax but i feel the buyer should pay it, not the seller. Taxing small business doesnt do anything but drive prices up. Sales tax is a fact of everyday life. Buyers pay 8% sales tax in indiana. Base prices stay the same and the consumer pays the tax. 
---
But in the end i have multiple characters at max caps. I need things to buy!
---
Ha! If I have more than a hundred .308 or shells, and two hundred 5.56, I’m “loaded”. If I had a thousand, I would suffer from carry capacity anxiety, and succumb to an overwhelming urge to shoot everything.
---
It's some formula of the position of your camp and the direction and distance you came from. It's *really* hard to narrow down. But, yes you can influence your spawn point with the actual CAMP machine.
---
I had forgotten about the 'kill a scorched with a crossbow/BP weapon/plasma/sword' which give 80 atoms each, so farmed the forest for a bit last night and bumped mine up nicely.
---
Hi, I already reported it there. The point of this thread is written in my very first paragraph.
---
So to begin with, Player vending was already inferior to idea of AH and to outside trading communities...Not only is it locked behind RNG and encouraged to even more server hopping, it also is limited by slots, what makes it even more tedious to find audience...."Anyone want Explosive or TS handmade for 100 caps?", No you can't get, because there wasn't enough space to list these items."Want daily alcohol recipes/PA plans/armor plans for 20 caps ea?", No you can't get, because there wasn't enough space to list these recipes. Then you server hop for few hours and find seller who sells these items, but for 10x the prices and it is all because sh#tty RNG design.
---
Hopefully its a per player inventory, and you wont have hundreds of players sever hopping only to find all the good stuff already gone
---
I do so hate those floating camps... new target!
---
Deep pocketed, shadowed, and (with one exception) ultra-light mods have to be learned from plans found in world. 
---
You cannot learn them from scrapping.
---
Randomly generated lists of weapons and armour the same as other loot tables.
---
PLUS she's in a different location every time you server hop, so you can't even just stay at one location and hop to refresh the list until you get something you like.
---
Unfortunately im on pc :( thanks tho
---
I have 2 guesses.
---
1: When choosing to nuke somewhere you can't see where has already been nuked so they don't know Whitesprings has been nuked.
---
2: Maybe it respawns all the enemies again so they can farm more.
---
I can see, the Reddit community invested a ton of points into Intelligence. Perhaps over 15.
---
I’d love that so much
---
That would be cool as fuck
---
or send me a request
---
AAE firerate is an impossible roll
---
Caps will be lost if your are at max
---
Play like I do, don't get more bullets until your out of bullets , fuck server hopping for materials to craft rounds, fuck buying bulk on Reddit
---
It goes into the void - much like when you sell stuff to vendors at max caps.
---
I see you know your Kevin Costner movies.  +1, carry on.

Someone downvoted you for your lack of google it seems :P

(i'm nice enough to send you the link but not nice enough to vote you back up :P )
---
Why are people obsessed with Squeeze?  
---
I've encountered him once, I believe. I ignored him, probably because I was busy killing enemies.
---
Change the targeted limb/head, and then change back before firing. Happens to me too, the hit % isn't accurate until after the switch back.
---
Yall act like FO76 PVPers invented murder/ theft
---
Yea two at WS is kind if weird
---
Looks like you character needs some chicken scrips, you starving man.
---
How do you sell them when you already sold a pile of weapons and the vendors are out of caps?
---
I just want them to fix armor mod plans. I finally got all my BoS, but there are others to get too
---
Theres been enough puffery about so-called griefing to last a lifetime
---
It's extremely seldom I agree with several points in a list like this. Here I agree to all with some discussions on small details like how the vendor times would work. 5 hours with a 350 cap limit? 4 hour with 280?...
---
I'm curious how long the lines might be at whitespring station if the machine can only serve one person at a time.
---
Not saying I doubt you, in fact, thos was what I was expecting. Do you have a link to where or can you tell me where this was discussed? Its gonna be pretty crappy vending if this is accurate. Having to keep a running total of the shot you have on sale in your head while watching how many caps you get from quests, dailies and crap like that.
---
No, go away
---
My group has lost a lot of people of the last few months. I find myself playing by myself or with 1 or 2 people more often than not. I don't know what platform you're on, but if you're on xbox, I'm down to add you to my list and journey with you.
---
I've been doing "defend workshop" events when they pop for other people's workshops. I'm ... 70%? certain I've recieved plans for that, without being PvP tagged. Need someone else to have workshops on the server, though.
---
Thanks, I don't care about reddit points.
---
Where are you guys finding handmade rifles? I found one when I was level 30 and I'm 150 now.
---
I don’t know if I have anything you’d want, is there anything in particular you’re looking for?
---
I though he said that it was one of the bests quests they made for 76, so like Mistress of Mystery tier (I could be misrembering though).
---
I will make a character just to use a chainsaw and a sawed-off to fight dead-ites. I may or may not set them up to be hot-swappable  in place of full on akimbo...
---
Yep. Like other mmo shooters with a similar vendor, tends to be a set selection of items.
---
If a level 70 (approx) can't even cause damage to a level 46 (griefer, bait?) with a super sledge who's standing still, then there's a problem. 
---
This has happened. PVP was on. Either a cheater or that OP sentinel shit.
---
There's a reason I'm in pacifist mode. And boy, I'm not turning it off again, piece of shit griefers can have fun trading with me to see my equipment, they can destroy my camp all they want, I can move it for 40 caps to repair everything, but they can't kill me. Most importantly, I remain calm, go get a glass of water, and enjoy.
---
You can find more meatbags at the General Steakhouse, and around RobCo facility too.
---
Exactly, they'd kill the game if they allow "re-rolls" on specific items. Eventually, you'll have everything you every wanted, but that applies to all. So, whats left? PvP where everyone has god roll gear, or PvE where there is no challenge, and no story to speak of, soooo, game over.  The fun for me after ALL these hours, is trying to get the right stuff w/o cheap re-rolls.  Those of you thinking re-rolls would be awesome, are not thinking about everyone getting to do the same.  I'm more interested in the Prestige system...give the ppl who've put a TON of time into this game something that sets them apart from the rest. Special perks etc...
---
Honestly, i have an upgraded drill and it tears through the queen.
---
"You are suffering from starvation"
---
Hurry up and get rid of all those then and eat!
---
They said the purveyor will sell legendaries for script. (Stupid name, star tokens is better) so that's what I would expect.
---
No rerolling. No adding effects to a weapon.
---
That’s what I thought. You could put the mat in the middle of a trap
---
Cool, so I can buy all of your stuff and resell it at *actual* market value.
---
I've learned that plan. Do you need it crafted?  
---
I understand a random person on the fo76 subreddit might not be that trustable, it's ok.
---
Hell yea!
---
All I've used the drill for is destroying the terminal in silo when I ran out of ammo.
---
And then somebody actually drops 1000 caps on your cranberry relish and squirrel stew.
---
I have that much and more on 4 characters.
---
Nah, I need the plan so I can craft ammo. I have the receiver on a gun I bought. Lol

I think you mean shop smart, shop S-Mart.
---
And you're the reason why we can't have nice things.
---
Seriously though, I'm certain that part of the reason they were removed was because of the threat that someone would do something similar (or had done), and that's not a good customer experience.  Granted, by the time you're traveling to stranger's bases, you're probably equipped to handle a little playful griefing, but I've seen some pretty elaborate traps that I'm glad I didn't run into.
---
I even had a plan to deal with griefers that involved both bait and consequences, but it never really became an issue, so it was never put into place.
---
Maybe if they programmed the mat so that the owner (or maybe anyone on they're team, but probably not) would arrive at the mat, but other players would arrive at the 'normal' spawn point.  I can't quite imagine a way to exploit that idea, though my morning coffee hasn't quite kicked in yet.
---
It’s coming.  Relax.
---
Brosicle that's quite the armory you carry .. only thing I carry is a gamma gun for degenerates and a shotgun for everything else .. never more than 2-300 shells .. had a bug in the past eat all my ammo for my active gun so I limit it nowadays not out of fear but out of awareness, I'm not afraid of anything!
---
Chems/Grenades however require tenderness, care and devotion and constant attention and caress, kinda like a female, so my beloved soul mates, nuka grenades, whom I adore and am always sure to acknowledge their beauty in the sunlight, never diminish below 10-15 or my psycho stash or psycho buffs .. yeah or medx or well yeah anything I can snort/shoot or smoke basically.
---
Lol it was me and I do it everyday... all I do is farm queen
---
This is not true, not even in the slightest. They die because they time out. The responder bot has about an hour long life span.
---
"Rise and shine, Mister Freeman. Rise and... shine."
---
Yeah. My case is a bit extreme: sitting on a pile of 70+k .50 cal bullets and the closer i get to that 70k mark the more i feel like i'm running out of ammo. I understand that this is enough for at least a month of vary active gameplay if not more but i just can't help it.
---
I learned this a long time ago, when I was level 30-40 and got my Ultracite PA from Belly of the Beast.
---
Every person burned alive in my flamer chamber gave me thumbs up while learning new definition of "scorched".
---
It had a pressure plate with "no step" on it that opened closed doors. This doors had "private" neon label, and there was open doors on the opposite side, with all the amenities and a "public" neon sign.
---
When you entered the private room, it only had locked doors leading nowhere, and a switch. Switch had a "dont switch" label nearby. Switching it activated sirens, gamma traps and flamethrowers. There was some ridiculous cable management which triggered the gate to open for a while, until the trap erased a wall that held necessary power connector. At that point the switch still turned on all death machines, but left the doors closed and the scorched visitor wondering.
---
Each to their own but its a no for me. I prefer to wander the wastes discovering every little detail. The fun of walking the same place 4 or 5 times and then realizing that I've passed something I never noticed the first time is so much fun. I just find that sometimes vehicles/mounts take the fun out of it
---
I play too much. 3 days ago i had roughly 4k 5.56, I'm down to under 1k and it hurts. Gunna have to buy more
---
Only a few more hours until people like this are extremely disappointed . Watch it be like a 3 item limit per 20 hours
---
I saw the insult bot once, when I was level 40, and I interacted with it. He only followed me and said nothing.
---
Ohh, I want!  Hmm, but ten caps, that will take a while to save up. Can I put it on lay away?
---
So true. This game is a joke.
---
"How to make 400 Atoms, from your couch, RIGHT NOW."
---
Even with Class Freak rank 3, the penalty is still -50% energy weapon reduction instead of -12%. UI says its the latter but it doesn't change anything when you check your actual energy damage.
---
It is fucking ridiculous, isn’t it?
---
I leave one nukashine and some random other alchohol. I also have a sign saying drink roulette. So they know they are taking a chance. My camp isn’t found much so the only person whose bothered taking the chance is my friend.
---
You need the plans to craft ammo? That explains why I have Ultracite Ammo craftable as a level 28.
---
It's near the tennis courts on the outside of that concrete gazebo. Located on the outside of the wall. Looks like a drinking fountain!
---
I’d be happy if you could use different ammo.  A .38 mod would be amazing.
---
I encountered him SIX TIMES doing the charleston responder bot farm. He will pop up on the road above the pond.
---
It is Scrip, in refferal to old company store currency from the mining town days. Basically an instore currency, as opposed to caps.
---
Lol. Yeah. If you find the prime receiver plan, you unlock the ammo for it as well
---
I think they will have those machines at all the train stations.
---
skooma?
---
I already run a similar heavy weapons build as an alt (lvl 92) and love it. I can always re-spec my main (lvl 237) to it. I did it as a true BOS build using only BOS armors, PA’s and paint jobs. It’s been fun thus far. Worth a try.
---
Warp into the golf club cut thru the tennis court to your immediate right side see the rounded stone structure with stone columns supporting it? theres a fountain inside around it's inner ring .. now drink young one and be cleansed!
---
I'd post a pic but I don't take pictures of fountains, esp public ones
---
Ace Hardware Chainsaw Mechanic here, my disappointment is immeasurable and every day since release has been ruined.
---
They already can launch you from lvl1 to lvl 400 in one weekend
---
First, it's a drinking fountain. It's out under the circular thing with columns in front of the tennis courts by the golf club.
---
Last night and a few other times I didnt even have 3 mins with it... and the 2 times it died for no reason someone had spawned in... so it may be coincidental but I don't know
---
Lost in the void
---
Actually, that's something i don't like. Just when i thought Whitesprings was becoming the hub it was meant to be, this happens.
---
Yeah, name your chassis. Was a pain in the ass for me, getting a specific power armor set out of my stash, before pa renaming. Was a 1/7 chance to get the one I wanted. Ugh.
---
Unless you have a god roll, nobody should be using a minigun regularly.  They have been, and probably always will be, ammo hogs.
---
I used to have ammo anxiety, until I landed my bloodied Gatling gun. Now life is great.  I can sustain my ammo needs just from the random tin cans I find from exploring.
---
Fast travel results in exactly the same problem though? At least in a vertibird you are still immersed in the world as you travel to your location.  
---
Just to be clear, I'm all for exploration and anything that can be done to encourage it. I hate the current form of teleportation fast travel as it encourages the opposite. That said, we need some method of traversing large distances and I would much rather do it on the mini gun of a vertibird than magically teleporting.
---
Conspiracy theory: The 'wastelanders' seasonal updates will be an update where a vault becomes a city full of NPCs, who's the overseer of this city of survivors? our lord, our savior, the man, the myth, the solo slayer of the SBQ, the absolute mad lad, the griefer slayer, Wooby.
---
Your anxiety is my ammo, ha!
---
Melee 4 life y'all.
---
It’s not a popular opinion anymore to want harder challenges or have a challenge in general. The fact is that this game is oddly balanced rather well. They did a great job on making sure that each build and armor set has a matching counterpart to be the bane of existence.
---
The only thing that I’d agree with is if one build or armor set gets nerfed, then all armor and builds need to be equally nerfed. Each build has strength and weakness as it is. There’s no need to actually target a specific setup.
---
Pfffft, you have no idea of the struggle of drill mains
---
FYI- those are still great to use in Whitesprings if people are farming ghouls. Easy to tag them with that and enjoy the exp/loot.
---
Have they said you will be able to choose from his inventory ? I was thinking it’d be more of gambling/random items
---
Keep mine in the 300 range... like to live on the wild side
---
You are asking the guy who whipped a fast U turn on the highway yesterday because he saw a large cardboard box full of solo cups spill out on the side of the road and was thinking, Plastic! I need that plastic!!....
---
So, no, you are fine.
---
Riddles 😫
---
Yep, I get ammo anxiety when my 5mm drops below 1000, and my 50 Cal drops below 2000. Then I get steel/lead/gunpowder anxiety after crafting ammo, lol
---
780hrs in and loving it
---
I've actually seen a lot of people on this sub say they are returning. Hopefully Bethesda keeps dropping new content.  Honestly the best thing they could do right now is and more end game stuff like the imposter.  I think a lot of people just moved on because they had nothing left to do.  We need more big bosses to fight and dungeons (not the burrows) to explore.
---
Yeah, it is coincidental, I've spent a good long time with the Responder Bot vendor. Several times "holding" him for others to shop. 60-minutes was about the longest he lasted and I've had multiple people join the server, fast travel to him and buy from him without him ever dying. Now, people can and will kill him, but people spawning in is 100% not ever how he dies.
---
a lvl 54 scorched conqueror one-shotting high lvl people with a two-shot explosive anti-armor pump-action shotgun sounds like a great experience I can witness. but for the same reason, there would be tons of balancing issues and complaints about the legendary enemies being impossible to kill.
---
I got calibrated shocks (one, and only for one leg) and jetpack for the X01. Not using it until I get a second calibrated shocks. Calibrated shocks was on a server I was on for a few hours. In my opinion, just play the game and routinely check the vendor. 
---
Scrapping power armor won't help you. It doesn't work like that, buddy.
---
Routinely check while normally playing or serverhop for a set amount of times each day. (10 times?)
---
While serverhopping, ALSO check Appalachian Antiques safe in the Cranberry Bog and the Forward Station Delta.
---
Could be useful plans there.
---
I guess there goes that idea of selling off the thousands of rounds of ammo I don't use.
---
I'm about 673hrs and still playing
---
This is a question I was hoping we'd know before it goes live. I hope it's not like regular vendors where they have 'x' amount of caps available for you to sell to them, but in reverse (ie - you have 24,000 caps currently, so you can only make sales for 1,000 caps)
---
I got a mule with still 3500 weight full of legendarys haha 
---
I hope I can put more then a few things per hours or day in it😂
---
500 rounds for shells, 999 for 5.56 or .308, and anything less than 2500 5mm makes me uneasy. 10mm I keep for "plinking" cheap enemies.
---
I understand that.  But for a level 20 white it does a shocking amount of damage.  Just saying it works well now for being what it is.  Be careful what you wish for, it's Bethesda.
---
Best karma idea ever!
---
May they choo choo choose yours as well.
---
I'm lv 265 and I had no idea this existed...
---
I like to leave those... and some raw fedalizer (misspelled I know) and some toilet paper.. and sometimes a nuke mine under it if I'm feeling spicey haha
---
Seriously who is this poster? Lol
---
What some people do for fake internet points...
---
I don't play 76 any more
---
Dude, people will buy legendary for the new scrips. Not me. I just want affordable stimpacks.
---
Ha! Don't worry I'm not a scalper or anything. I just strait up found a better rifle and kept this one because someone would need it sooner or later. 
---
I'm hardly looking to get rich. 
---
Any legendary shotguns would be cool for my lower level alt I just started (any level) Shells and Stimpacks and plastic and the like are always appreciated too. 
---
I also collect swords for my main so I can eventually deck my pad out like Hitori Hanzo's attic. Don't care about level or effects but it should be legendary. 
---
Or any combination thereof. Discount if you want to help me shuffle some things between a few of my characters. 
---
Up to you man. I'm just going to toss it into my store's  vendortron later tonight anyway.  
---
Won't be able to play until later tonight. 8 or 9 PM EDT but I don't mind helping you out. My psn is HRockit. Hit me up with a request and message saying who you are.
---
Only met it the once and would prefer seeing it more than the lottery bot.
---
It gets to "congratu...." before I shoot it to oblivion
---
Ah damn, thanks anyway
---
It's a good idea.. maybe alittle more work on it... but I'm with you.. people are taking advantage of other people far to often
---
Bethesda being Bethesda i expecting them caps just to vanish beyond 25k. But what i would like to see is them to remain inside the vendor (kinda like a bank), from where you would have to transfer them to your inventory when/if you so wanted..
---
With ammosmith, it's 40. Throw super duper on to help. Still a bit pricey, but it does melt scorched.
---
What’s the point of spending caps for scrip if u can go white spring and get a lot one star legendary items
---
You get the win for the video!
---
Damn and blast it all over the place. Ive been inside the place before looking at the middle area of the structure thinking it was there. 
---
No wonder I missed it as its on the side practically hidden by the flowers above :/
---
Any of these?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Category:Fallout_76_concept_art
---
Set it higher. Id say 5k
---
Think thats the best part! How fast can you make it die! Haha
---
I mentioned it before but got kind of downvoted to Hell about it, but if you look at the machine and the photo from last week's inside the Vault the guy is standing there cheering like he won something from a slot machine. 
---
At the top left of the machine there are 3 slot reels, just like a slot machine.
---
There's a couple of handles on front too. 
---
I'd like to think the best but I I think this whole thing was put together to get people to break down their duped legendaries and clean that stuff up quite a bit.
---
Long story short, I'm not breaking anything down till we see how this turns out after a few days.
---
We know that the script is tied to the level of the weapon, but maybe there is also a slot machine mechanic think gives you more or less dependent on your outcome with the reels. Maybe they don't do anything either.
---
Nah there are certainly some things that are underwhelming. My theory is that explosive heavy guns were purposedly made weak in the first phase of the game to diverge majority of the playerbase from them, so that new players don't complain they are forced into single bazooka build they can't reliably afford.
---
There are also trees such as junkie or berserker that desperately need appropriate perks that would make them comparable to bloodied, which I think is a prime example of how total of in-game synergies for given path should look like.
---
There should be for example perk giving you serendipity-like chance to dodge bullets based of number of armor pieces you are not wearing.
---
Drug addiction should be reducable, made permanent with starched-genes-like perk, and give specific advantages in very bonkers situations.
---
The way to fix balance is to expand whats underwhelming not to reduce something thats in its prime.
---
Do you think it would be a better idea to just take the prime off?
---
Sounds helpful thx!
---
Will try that after the Servers are back on today
---
My bet :
---
1 scrip per * exchange rate
---
And any legendary effect to "buy" or re roll 500+ scrip
---
Hopefully it's a slot machine mechanic where you roll through the 3 different sets of legendary effects.
---
1. Basically craft (non legendary) whatever item you want (if you know the plan)
---
2. Give said item to Purveyor
---
3. Choose primary slot and randomly roll with (x amount of scrip). Keep rolling till you hit the primary effect you want.
---
4. Choose secondary slot. Roll
---
5. Choose third slot. Roll
---
I'm guessing the rolls will be total RNG except that you are only rolling each affix instead of 3 at a time.  This would eventually allow you to roll/grind a perfect item.
---
Just my 2 cents.
---
Or just emote with a camera in hand. 😆
---
I think that was their idea for the sheepsquatch imposter but the reward isnt good enough for the challenge .
---
I've been overencumbered since I started farming legendaries some 35 levels ago, so I am perpetually bouncing off the weight limits
---
As such, even though I have higher DR armor, I prefer Excavator for the extra carry weight.
---
My practice when entering any camp is to close the door before I try to walk through it, if it locks, I have no desire to enter your camp and get trapped. If it doesn't lock, I'll look around.
---
And then, people will ask 5k for a 1* Legendary...
---
haha I've still not done that yet. I'm too scared.
---
I’ve completely run out before and was lucky enough to find a board, so that’s what I killed the SBQ with, it was probably me and my board that carried the other 20 people too I’m sure. Probably.
---
4 gunpowder, 5 lead, 1 violet flux, 12 steel, 1 ultracite makes 40 rounds. 
---
With Ammosmith 2 it makes 72, with super duper you get 30% more as well.
---
In Grafton, near Graninger Farm, there’s a destroyed house with a mattress in it. (Usually super mutants spawn there for me.) on it there’s a rotating set of clothes, and I’ve seen the Drifter Outfit twice. :)
---
Oh please you drama queen (if you're not joking). Pay to get a few more atoms, not pay to win. You get no gameplay advantage with this other than potentially not having to use as many materials, BUT with the right weapon and the right mod, they're STUPID cheap to mod anyway, and cost like a unit or 2 more of something if not applying paints. Since un-modding somethings counts as modding it, it's practically like half the required materials for the challenge anyway. With a board and the spiked mod, it's like 1 screw and 2 steel or something, and there are plenty of weapons with similar dirt cheap mods (I don't have skins, and that's how I did it around a month ago). Paints just allow you to do it slightly faster with a particular weapon, and paints still require materials too. It is a very, very marginal "advantage", and the only exception is power armor mods, where it's actually a decent advantage, yet you can get the nuka cola skins with marginal effort (not so much the quantum one though with how much it's still being server hopped for). You can also get the prototype X-01 paint upon unlocking the plans for X-01.
---
It's still less annoying than that stupid nanny bot who tells you a long ass nursery tale
---
I’ll call her “Mole Mam” in my circle of friends. I expect to spend a lot of time with her
---
Yeah exactly. I mean you can’t give caps away right now for legendary weapons so why not give them some value.
---
Get smith 2 and it gets extra 80 thus giving 180 each craft.
---
I am a shotgun primary user and keep about 500-700 on me, 500 fusions cells for a tesla, 500-1000 5.56 for a handmade, 500-1000 5mm for a gatling, and 50 2mm for a gauss rifle.
---
I keep a 1000 each in my stash that I grab when I need to.
---
If anything I still have an ammo abundance and try to keep rotating weapons when one ammo type is stockpiling too much. But playing bloodied with adrenal reaction mutation, I tend to use a lot less ammo because I kill faster.
---
For SBQ fights I try to melee whenever she lands which saves a lot of ammo. And I have a bloodied melee weapon which will actually deal more damage anyways.
---
NEEEERRRDDD!!!!
---
My friends list is always grey as well .. cept a select few who use me as a way point. Sometimes it gets tedious and aggravating, well most of the time it's tedious and aggravating .. but .. well anyway it's fun to play and unique in it's own right and the freedom is nice .. plus I look like a raider and consume drugs so I found my home.
---
I do play with a couple on the regular and it's always much more entertaining but it's also fun playin solo and creeping people out.
---
I see your point.  Maybe either (1) have limited time items so people feel the need to convert caps versus grind or (2) set the cap transfer cost based on the time it typically takes to farm a 1* (lower it).
---
Not to mention that the 'fix' sometimes asked for insn't what Bethesda wants to do.
---
I get that everyone wants all 3-star mobs to drop 3-star items - and I'm a fan as well - but I'm pretty sure Bethesda made it the way it is on purpose, so 'fixing it' isn't on the menu.
---
Now, on fights like SBQ and even the imposter sheepsquatch, where the encounters are difficult and time-limited, I can certainly see making a guaranteed 3-star drop would be fine.  But the idea is that 3-star legendaries should be unusual drops, if not rare, are more than likely the intended outcome.
---
Now, drills/syringers in place of regular starred drops I'm sure is a bug, and it's just lazy that they're still on the loot tables.  Same with untracite armor plans and a few other things.  But unless I Missed some announcement somewhere, 3-star drops have never been guaranteed, and I don't see that changing.
---
I’ll check it out! IGN Molybzen
---
Exactly. That will be the next nerf...
---
It’s not rare but it isn’t common either. Spawns in a number of places where outfits like Greaser Jacket, Radstag Outfit, Surveyer Outfit, etc spawn.
---
Hi, i already did. The point of this thread is, if there should be dedicated sub for letting people know the scammers tactics - to prevent future scams.
---
That's what I ended up doing. It was the only gun I was using for a while (I'm a stealth melee build). I did just get a nice lever rifle, so I may switch it back for sbq. If it's your main, I'd take it off.
---
Not enough selection IMO. The game only allows 16 players on a server at a time. The odds of someone happening to need one of your 30 items is slim.
---
I agree
---
I see you point on several issues and I must say it is nice to actually have a discussion :)
---
As far as changing things after anouncing them I know it does happen however Bethesda have a really nasty habbit of making an announcement then not telling people things have changed untill the actual day it's supposed to come out. It's really poor business practice and it makes people loose faith in the company and its product. Making changes if fine but be open and honest about the changes and why and they will never have a problem.
---
&gt;I mean, they've fixed almost every major issue the game has had somewhat reasonably,
---
That's the problem. If you purchased a car or computer or anything that didnt work properly and took it back and they only repaired it "Somewhat reasonably" you wouldn't be happy. 
---
&gt;Why not? There's no Atom value associated with in game items like weapons or armor. There's no real incentive for them to not fix the loop they have acknowledged is broken by making these items easier to obtain, hense somewhat flooding the market with them. 
---
I see what you are saying but if you make it really easy to obtain "GOD" roll weapons and armour then they are no longer are special meaning they have totally de valued what people have worked hard for meaning that there is no end game. The only way to fix it is to stabilise the economy and either introduce new and exciting weapons and armour (which I imagine they will do) and are doing slightly with backpacks etc.
---
Probably not much.  It's not "rare," but it is marginally harder to find than some other outfits.  I know I've seen one at the Whitesprings vendors.
---
Asking that here is like asking the bar if you are an alcoholic.
---
We are all fine here and have our ~~drinking~~ Fallout playing under control. I can quit anytime I want.
---
Who's more foolish:  The fool who asked a question cause they didnt know, or the fool who didnt even know to ask a question.   Cause I'm feeling pretty foolish for not evening realizing this was a thing.  Upvote for this post enlightening me.
---
Yeah, I read that too. I'm not saying that's the only spot or that's the way the machines will work. More that it might be a popular spot for people to be parked over-encumbered wanting to unload lots of legendaries.
---
Now imagine if they slipped a Berserk power up on there for melee builds.  lol gibs everywhere!
---
Well.. I guess we should have the choice to either defend it or leave it.
---
Far out, I’ll check out what kind of stuff I have to offer this afternoon, I could help you shuffle some stuff too. I’ll shoot ya a request later!
---
I just want a legendary one 90% less weight one. I already have the flamer and dual bar mods ready in my stash to replace my existing chainsaw.
---
What's your chosen melee? I have a few but my electrified mr handy buzz tool is my favourite :)
---
My Furious Dragon would be a better option.
---
Assuming you can 're roll weapons (seems less likely now since there has been no mention for agaes) or that the vendor actually has decent weapons to sell for script. Seriously don't expect Bethesda to have gotten it right stright out the gate. I imagine It will be months and months before they get the balance right
---
They should sell scrip on the ATOM SHOP cause it's more "convenient" then having to spend time earning caps and or actually movin about the map collectin legendaries to turn in
---
Haha, as you should be. You will die, or crash the game...or both 😖
---
Melee is comparatively OP to ranged weapons for a reason...u gotta be in my/its face all the time to make the kill even if its just one hit.  On the other hand, i nice ranged weapon build can hold VATS on your head long enough to take you down w/o you getting a single hit.  Against the relatively weak enemies in PvE, you'll be fine.
---
I'm not reading that but I probably disagree. Dupers fucked the economy indefinitely but it still kinda works. Let Bethany do her job because the ad hoc economic theories I've seen on this sub are pretty poor.
---
Right now if you have a 1 star item what do you do with it? Sell it to a vendor because no one wants it .... so if you can get 5k to instantly scrap it... people with huge cap stashes will most likely burn through spending whatever they can. :)
---
I have encountered him 5 times in the Cranberry bog and 3 times in the Mire.
---
I'm almost positive I'm going to despise her.
---
As much as I hate repair kits, they're really not that beneficial unless you have no scrap at all. Even then most melee weapons can be repaired with little foraging for materials.
---
That’s laughable.   Melee is far cheaper to repair and with less breakage than ranged.   And repair kits don’t make any build more lethal.  Your logic misses twice.
---
Hey I wouldn't even think either was foolish before I checked the video out!
---
I was starting to think this fountain was some sort of player myth that had been created due to the amount of time id scanned the place looking for it lol
---
"Drink from the sulfur fountain, cures all ailments, HP to full and grants temporary 10 points to all special stats"
---
I was thinking it would evolve into that myth lol
---
Sorry, that was what worked for me but I'm out of ideas.... Good luck, I hope you get it figured out.
---
No, I literally just want the rest of 1 sight. We currently have half of a set of sights on the gun.
---
That’s not cheap in my opinion. And therefore, these players will fund the future game content, which is fine for me.
---
I think it's dependent on the gun my tse combat rifle can't point blank the broad side of a barn, meanwhile my repeater rifle without a scope can shoot for miles in vats and hit every time.
---
We don't have patch notes yet . They come with the update in few hours.
---
You know where it is now, but I just wanted to say, yeah, don't worry.  I had heard stories of this magical spring and even looking at the *springhouse itself*, I didn't see it.  The grating made me think, "Oh, do I have to activate it somehow?"  No, it's a completely ordinary drinking fountain.
---
Do a few events and you will never need stimpacks again. It seems I have an excessive amount
---
Yeah could not agree more. My guess is a 1* item will cost 50-100 scrip , a 2* 500 and a 3* 1000 scrip. Maybe a little too high numbers but.
---
OR they will actually let ppl reroll to bring out more good items on the market. But my guess still goes with option nr 1
---
Duh duh duh... another one bites the dust
---
This is probably the first game that I've popped out at 500+ hours. And I've played a lot of games in my time. Luckily I have people that still actively play as much as I do. And I've made a few randoms along the way.
---
I've never played a Fallout in my life except for this one. Most of the time me and my crew don't even really do anything. We just doing random stuff and chat. And I feel like we always have a blast.
---
axe body spray and stickers
---
I bought one, one of my favorite pieces of Fallout swag I have at the house now. Great quality and the story / drawings are fantastic
---
How is this not an actual cocktail we can make
---
I never said repair kits make them better.
---
Repair kits offer extreme convenience since you can repair anywhere instantly now. 
---
I agree melee is already OP in how easy it is to repair, but repair kits do add a degree of OPness.
---
Yes and give people who duped heaps of guns and have multiple characters full of caps an immediate advantage... No way
---
Signed, i love my flamer-long-bow-bar-chainsaw now already! Would love to see it more powerful!
---
I fast travel to my camp and appear far away from my entrance. My friends spawn in my flooring and I have to remove my floors every time.
---
This will be bad if other players spawn to camps to do shopping. Those mats will help them spawn at the entrance.
---
You will easily make 300 or more atoms before your melee weapon breaks so to me it's worth it.
---
This sounds good but then it can just be abused. I could just put food in there I wanted to store for myself and set it @ 25k caps to sell. I'm okay with having a fridge and refrigerated vending but you really need both to have either without abuse.
---
If you are on PC, I will help to rebuild
---
I'm sorry but that is just a stupid comment. Melee weapons break like.. Never. And are cheap asf to repair. And nobody will go out to kill stuff with weapon that is about to break to make use of them kits.
---
\&gt; power armor is already woefully weak when compared to &gt;legendary armor 
---
I'm still trying to figure out how regular armor beats PA.
---
Just looking at the DR/RR numbers, the average PA piece beats non PA.  (Even at -15% from (critter).
---
Yeah buying legendaries with real money, what a great idea! Not
---
There is a cemetery along the western River with a shack at the top of the hill that has a few bags.
---
To me the fact that you don't have to fast travel or search for a weapons workbench during a quest is OP.
---
Instead of which, were you so inclined, you could just put 10 rad emitters around the default spot that people currently spawn in at.
---
I had one and when I got hooked up with the crew I run with, I got another and they didn't know you could actually get a pie from the machines. So I explain the whole deal and this starts a competition among the other 3 guys against me.  Rules are you have to get one out of the machine.  One finally told me he got one and I  told him great, but now I have 3.  Made for some laughs and all, but I get on Sunday and he tells me he now has 5.  I conceded to the new Preserved Pie King. (I'm still going to activate that machine everytime I see one though)
---
Time to pick up some scrips with those dump legendaries.
---
Chewy meat, stringy meat...
---
What are you talking about? What level are you even at?
---
Fair chance it’ll be unbalanced when it drops. Question is, will it be worth it to load up at first for the nerf later, or will it be a steep price at first with a recalibration later (and more waiting)
---
))) that’s sneaky... 
---
then they can’t sprint or fast travel
---
I'm addicted too, sometimes I login and just stand at my camp for an hour or two, doing literally nothing in game lol
---
Just re place the camp in the same spot it should auto repair all stored items
---
they collect shiny things.
---
I guess you're a r/FilthyCasual that never breaks weapons in one sitting. To me they're worth it because you can make a ton of atoms before it breaks so why not repair with a kit?
---
Correct. 
---
Inside the vaults for patch were split. First they told about these scouts, then week later about vending and scrip.
---
I'm so excited aswell. I redid my camp this weekend for the vending.
---
This exactly.
---
With targetting computer!
---
*the bane of all players*
---
I moved all the way into a vats build and got sick of things like this never improving, so I slowly moved away from it (sadly)
---
What if the structure is too complex
---
It depends on the weapon... If it's a hunters 10mm pistol than yeah it's vendor trash. If it's a max level Bloodied handmade it can be easily sold to another player for upwards of 5k. If it's a 2 or 3 star with a crappy prefix like Troubleshooters but is explosive it can be easily sold for a few thousand.
---
I've had a 4 star machete for quite a while, it was a three star and I add the sacrificial blade mod and it went up to a 4 star. 
---
Makes me wonder maybe it's another mod that makes them five stars.
---
I'm level 57 so not high, but daily and weekly events yield a lot of atoms along side general achievement type goals which give atoms. 50 atoms is really cheap.
---
Nice, but where did you get that "SALE" sign, never seen it :/
---
I'm willing to bet it'll be like how Splatoon handles the re-rolling on outfits
---
You have a outfit with certain stats. Let's say 3 slots. You use the currency to reroll the three stats randomly. And whatever you get is what you get. And if you have more currency then you can do it again.
---
Also if you have an outfit with only two slots, then you can use a certain amount of currency to add another blank slot. At least that's what I'm thinking. It works pretty good in Splatoon. And it's also harder to get the currency because it only happens like once a month where you can get it.
---
Yes.  My primary guns are the my various Gatties &amp; 50 calls.  I get anxious falling below 10,000 rnds of either 5mm or .50.  I have almost 15000 each.  That said, I will tell you me and three others killed the SBQ and I thought I I was surely depleting all of it.  After she died, I was surprised how much I had left.  So fire away!
---
If your factual premise were correct (which it’s not since Bethesda wiped multiple copies) such persons would already have all the 3* items they could ever want and thus would be scrip-ritch either way.
---
Why would you even buy the inferior versions in the first place? You can easily get a large amount of improved repair kits by just killing the SBQ.
---
I can see 'insert xxx script and an item' to get a random roll of the same item type with the same number of stars, with all the stats re-rerolled.  That would be...interesting.
---
I don't think that's what we'll get, but I can see that as a way to consolidate the various contradictory statements that have been made on the subject.
---
The other option would be a diablo-esque 'buy an item, see what stats it has' kind of system.  So each day/week/server hop you'd get a choice of 5 weapon and/or armor types, you buy one and it shows up with a random 1-3 stars and legendary effects.  It could even be random armor types (so you get a left arm, and it can be different styles, as well as random legendary effects).
---
I think we'll get a re-skin of the survival system though, 1+ set choices per week, buy it or don't.
---
Just what we need. A screen covered with some buttmunch posting the same item every 2 seconds for hours, alternating with your friendly neighborhood racist spouting their nonsense. Yay.
---
I'll call that a hard pass on any server-wide broadcast channel.
---
This. I’ve said this in many other posts...  the PVP for work shops should be limited to the grounds of the workshop.  I’m all for people being able to contest it, but there is no reason if I don’t show up to fight you for it, that you can use that as an open opportunity to pursue me around the map. 
---
TLDR: Workshop PVP should be confined to the workshop arena.
---
No problem. We can't rebuild America by hoarding everything from everyone else blah blah blah.
---
somebody yesterday posted about getting on the roof and healing the ghouls with a gamma gun 
---
and just them  let trash the camp
---
Also I have rank 5 melee repair perk whatever it's called so my melee takes a long ass time to break. My build btw is a power attack sneak build which does 1.2k damage per hit with sneaking and chameleon armor.
---
I got one from a rooftop, it was an artists home / studio where he would paint etc.  pretty cool but I don’t remember which building it was.  There was a table and lawn chair where the skeleton was and the pie was on a table, perfectly preserved out in the open lol
---
That's true, but 50 atoms is soo cheap.
---
Same.  I hoard them.  Have 35 now.  Most of them 100%.  Players get angry when I won’t sell them.
---
I was thinking about this for a while:
---
I think one of the out of left field mechanics is going to be A) SPECIAL RESPEC OR B) Ability to trade a legendary to BREAK DOWN A for example 3 star perk
---
Card into 3 1 Stars or to take a star down or up. 
---
I really think this is going to be something the purveyor will be about in addition to the actual legendary stuff
---
The real question for me is not how many slots, but how many caps you can have.
---
whats the point of selling if your maxed on caps?
---
i got another one! i got another one!
---
or or maybe they sell crates on the ATOM SHOP that contain repair kits and maybe 1-2 randomized skins/scrip OR a randomized legendary cause it'll be EVEN MORE "CONVENIENT" to skip bringing scrip to the vendor ...
---
omg this is genius, I should charge just to allow reading my ideas
---
And I want the cockoo clock plan if I ever find the guy....
---
frag grenades
---
I would be freaking out if that’s all I had.
---
you could get TS and AA because they were being duped by the tens of thousands, FFS.
---
It gives you the option to find another server when your camp can’t be placed, do that. You may have been picking popular areas
---
I may be mistaken but I thought the Purveyor was later this month, that it was player vending this patch
---
I was able to change out the stairs just like we do the walls🤷‍♂️
---
I’m lvl 114 on Xbox and my base is set up near Vault 76 on the over look near Gorge Junkyard! It’s set up for people to come and chill, I’d love to see you there.
---
A buddy of mine and his friend (who are both absolutely single-minded legendary grinders) have occasionally nuked Whitesprings 2 or 3 times (over the course of a few hours) in order to keep an active nuke-zone at the site. Their goal is to overlap them by no more than 10 minutes, so whenever one nuke-zone fades they’ve already got the second one in position. It’s exceedingly stupid.
---
I can see it now. “H: BE Thirst Zapper fresh drop from Nuka-Robot W: Ass/Sent BOS Combat armor full set”
---
My character's name is Ganon. He was a miner, just like everyone in the Ash Heap. When the riots started happening, Ganon retreated deep into one of the mines. Little did he know, this wasn't the only issue happening that day. The bombs fell while he was deep in the mine hiding. After a few hours, he emerged wondering if everything was alright. Little did he know, the world ended.
---
Before leaving the Ash Heap, he went looting, breaking into houses and stores looting food, water and other resources. After he looted the food and water he needed, he rushed to a nearby shack that the miners used for storing personal belongings before heading into the mines. Here, he found a prototype hazmat suit, but it was too late. The radiation from the bombs have already modified his DNA, giving him the powers of a marsupial.
---
He ruled the Ash Heap for 20 years, looking for the best loot and killing anyone/thing who comes near his mine that he has claimed as home. After living in a really dusty mine in the Ash Heap for 20 years, he left to wander the wastes, wondering if there is anything left. Sure enough, there was... 
---
(Fallout 76 starts here btw, Ganon encounters a dweller, trades with them and becomes a trader)
---
r/iamverysmart
---
did you forget that repair kits can be used on guns too or......
---
So I should basically try to find a good obscure place to do a real build, and then not settle for whatever server I'm placed in? Is it often that my camp should be moved? I think I saw I can't fast travel if I'm over encumbered, which is all the time for me, is there anyway to combat that?
---
Thanks for your help!
---
Rippers I believe can go to 40, and Buzzy Blade go to 45, but they can both get legendary drops.
---
you will be able to sell for scrip only for now
---
I very seldon have server disconnects anymore. On the otherhand I quite often get crash to desktop when playing on PC.
---
I saved up a bunch of 3 star melee stuff. Some of those items have a ridiculously low weight. The wood armor is a good idea though. Never thought about the shrouded mod.
---
Yeah but this legendary recycling program might bump up the price of old ,once useless, vendor trash.... and that’s a good thing, because I know people sitting on like 200k caps.... so if they can buy a bunch of 1* garbage items at 5k caps ea.... it will help deflate the economy a little.
---
I look forward to the day where I don’t see posts asking for over 25k caps for a single item again.
---
If you can call someone a filthycasual with 1000+ hours in and experience from beta to this moment, then yes, im a filthycasual. I have never broken a weapon on one sitting. I have backups. And i rather use my atoms to something better and more lasting like those high cost PA skins than one time use crap like them kits.
---
Exactly what I got on reddit looking for just now. I’ll be sure to spread the word.
---
Yep the Purveyer is next month or so but from the [blog post last week] we get this:(https://bethesda.net/en/article/3ExPLDXM5fgLJm9WiWLGrK/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-patch-9-preview)
---
&gt;Once Patch 9 is live, you will be able to find Legendary Exchange Machines at Train Stations around Appalachia. Load up your inventory with the legendary items you no longer want to keep, place them in the machine, and then collect your Scrip. The higher the star-rating of your legendary items, the more Scrip you will receive. The more Legendary Scrip you have when the Purveyor arrives, the more legendary weapons and armor you will be able to buy!
---
We will have more details to share on the Purveyor next week. We hope the addition of Exchange Machines will help you free up some storage space and fill your wallet with Scrip while she travels to the surface.
---
Got mine from my first imposter Sheepsquatch kill. I'm torn between keeping it if we can ever display weapons or scrapping it with the scrap legendaries DLC
---
It normally works for me and I build quite complexly (but I’ve only had to do it twice)
---
It was probably autocorrect and OP missed it. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve sent people the word “ducking”
---
Well they don't call it the "Waste(ed)lands" for nothing!
---
And boards maybe? Someone has to keep buying them lol
---
I wish you the best of luck
---
Better Homes and Glue Gardens...
---
Well, it works for GTA V.  But you are entirely missing the point of this thread, which is focused on remedying caps inflation.
---
As someone who really wants to use energy weapons, any buff to them would be welcome considering how outclassed most energy weapons are by ballistics.
---
Then you can do some vocals...
---
They’re releasing the legendary scrapper today to “prepare” for the purveyor’s debut some time next week or so
---
I’ll pay you a visit when the updates live, I’m always after plans
---
.. you're right! my mistake..looking forward to this patch a little more now :)
---
looks like it's time for useless squandering. not much point in hoarding caps
---
Of course not. My point is how the repair kits make melee self productive as in no ammo requirement and the only downfall is that they obviously break as does any weapon. But, since you gain atoms by using them they essentially lay for themselves to get repaired making them infinitely self productive and hands free no grind required to keep them operating.
---
Well we will ask you again about how many atoms you are making a week when you are higher level and already done most of the challenges etc.
---
I haven't received one in any recent run, but then I never received them back when they were supposedly a thing either.  From what I understand, they've been removed from her loot pool.
---
Great idea! Anything to make energy weapons relevant again
---
Radweed
---
Probably at least 50 so my opinion that melee is superior still stands.
---
At the beginning of the game atoms are easy to get, sure. But you’ll eventually run out of regular challenges, and your last options will be to complete daily (60 atoms approx) and weekly challenges (about 120 I guess?) or spend real money to get more atoms. Challenges can be really time-consuming and not really enjoyable in my opinion, that’s why I would not say that 50 atoms are cheap. If you consider it cheap, you’ll soon change your mind because you’ll end up broke and suddenly realize that the atoms aren’t so easy to get than they used to be.
---
Ha! I am actually excited to see what the results will be. More submissions will mean it will be more accurate which we all benefit from!
---
Last weekend, I found a L4 outside whitesprings, took out the L68 ghoul that was attacking.  
---
I dropped about 25 plans and recipies, they dropped me 2\* LMG.
---
My bet is that the “scrip” will work just like the Halloween candy from the Monster Mash event. You turn it in for a random legendary.
---
Then you’ll have to rebuild but none of your stuff will be broken
---
I want the time when the patch will drop
---
Lol i love when Grahm gets in his meat conversation
---
at the moment, there is nothing special at super high levels...you just have acquired better gear, and have all the cards you could want to respec. your char.   unless they really spice up the "prestige system" that's coming, then its a slow death.
---
It's easy. As long as part of the label says metal, it's probably good.
---
But yeah, been listening to metal for almost 20 years now, only recently found out that apparently I'm into groove metal (Lamb of God) and that there is neo-classical metal, which also doesn't sound bad.
---
Sadly, no. I think I’ll just spend some time looking at YT vids of Mothman. I need a full 360 of him for an art project
---
10 AM Eastern US
---
Oo 9 am, thanks mate!
---
There is always a reason for ppl to cry, this bethesda games not US government that you can make a post for every little problem you personally experience.
---
This sub isn't much better for it. Someone posted a video once accusing people of "griefing" him.
---
You watch the video and no joke it's him with 3k stims using a duped legacy explosive laser, calling everyone a virgin as he attacks them. Blatantly sweating, breathing down the mic because... it's his life?
---
You tell it was nothing special, he's the griefer, wonder what he done to have 6 people attack him before he started recording mid fight (convenient)
---
He then got aggressive, sent me a link and like an idiot i followed it, got DDosed for 5 minutes and couldn't comment, even had taunts like "aw can't connect to comment?" And because i called him a "dickhead" i got banned because he reported my message, for 3 days. Despite me being the victim? And that was in THIS sub.
---
What a fucking joke.
---
Well i gues thats what i will do
---
there are challenges to kill enemies with ranged weapons as well too, you know. 
---
and ammo is pretty easy to find. 
---
honestly i think you’re giving the kits too much credit. pretty much everyone i know saves them for emergencies, like if your weapon breaks during an event where you can’t leave to go repair it
---
Well, I will say 30 is quite a little. And yeah I have a heck of common plans I'd like to sell for pennies. I wouldn't actually want to manually list them on by one for sale. One by one, select this for sale, select price. How about fucking no.
---
But 30 is still quite a little. 
---
Drugs and few alcohol types, thats about 10. Say 5 junk types, 4 useful and in demand, the fith being something you have a heckload of for cheap. You've already used half! That's too little for any decent legendaries you might be willing to sell for caps, or some handy plans people might actually buy.
---
This will probably mean as players can't list most they can have plenty of, they will list just some, and to compenate for lesser sales, the prices will be set to pretty high. Which just results in less vendoring.
---
But I will try to make best of the feature non the less.
---
You're a piece of shit. And your grammar is as well.
---
An end to all the "how will player vending work" posts.
---
Repair kits are useless, it's cheaper and more beneficial to fix the gear than use a repair kit.
---
Really, I live in PA and have never run out. The lowest I've had is like 3. Do you also use a laser gatling or jetpack?
---
You will feel so foolish when you are higher level and have more xp on the game :) But it's cool that you think melee is superior :D
---
The filthy casual comment was a joke (jesus christ downvoters). Also, ok, yeah, I understand now. I assume generally that most people aren't super grinders with 1000+ hours, so I thought it was weird that you don't make the little amount of atoms it takes to buy a repair kit. But, since you have backups it makes since why you wouldnt need them. I'm not to that point in the game yet so this works for me. I'm only level 57.
---
&gt; I see you point on several issues and I must say it is nice to actually have a discussion :) 
---
Way better than having a bitter argument IMO lol
---
&gt; As far as changing things after announcing them I know it does happen however Bethesda have a really nasty habit of making an announcement then not telling people things have changed until the actual day it's supposed to come out. It's really poor business practice and it makes people loose faith in the company and its product. Making changes if fine but be open and honest about the changes and why and they will never have a problem. 
---
You're not entirely wrong. Their communication of these things started off very poor, hiding changes from patch notes that they figured were not important to the community as an example. My only counter is that they have improved in those regards, though I will also concede that compared to some game devs they are still doing a sub par job.
---
&gt; That's the problem. If you purchased a car or computer or anything that didnt work properly and took it back and they only repaired it "Somewhat reasonably" you wouldn't be happy. 
---
I'd just say that as someone who has played every bethesda game, I've personally gotten exactly what I expected. Though I have been pleasantly surprised with the update frequency and balance changes, when compared to what previous titles got post release, which is why I'm assuming they'll continue to do what they have. My expectations are tempered forsure, however I'm still generally very happy with my purchase of the game
---
&gt; I see what you are saying but if you make it really easy to obtain "GOD" roll weapons and armour then they are no longer are special meaning they have totally de valued what people have worked hard for meaning that there is no end game.  
---
I don't know if I'd go as far as to say they should make sought after 3\* legendarys easy to obtain, just easier than now by allowing them to be obtained with less RNG through grinding. The reason a lot of these weapons and armor are so expensive is because they are so "hard" to obtain, since its all RNG (or you know, the small circles of dupers who still exsist). Bethesda knows that's the issue, so I'm just assuming they're looking to cut down on the RNG enough to make those items more obtainable without dropping the market into the ocean. I'm sure there's a middle ground that could be reached
---
Thank you for your honest information. I haven't always been an endgame kind of person anyhow. Is the level grind worth it?
---
Thanks for your opinion, edgelord.
---
What a spectacular post. Your parents must be very impressed you can still type despite having been aborted.
---
I'm level 110 solo player and enjoyed every minute of it. You get to pick perk cards every level from a specific special but some perk are only available based on your level also you get a pack of random cards every 5 levels.
---
It damn sure isn’t treats for humans. The lousy liars.
---
I've been using the All Rise super-sledge since Lvl 50. But frankly, I'm getting pretty tired of the constant crackling sound while holding it and the loud ZWWOOOSSH! when swinging it. So obnoxius... &gt;_&lt;
---
For the first few days, I plan on putting something in the vending machine that has some appeal, but I don't need (ultracite scrap maybe).  Something in demand enough to be worth stealing.
---
And I plan to sit up on a hill with my sniper and recon scope to keep an eye on things.  If PvP starts, I'll be prepared.  If non-pvp trouble ensues, I'll just jump servers and wonder if they survived the resulting fall.
---
My build isn't great and I can do 1.2k damage with a sneaking power attack. Which I use to farm watoga.
---
Technically 10mm legendary wouldn't be vendor trash as you can make it a 2* with the scorch killer mod and get more scrip theoretically.
---
I was about to make a post and ask where the global chat is. Im a new player and this is something every MMO should have.  
---
Perhaps a OPTIONS to have voice and typed chat. Plenty of people dont want to talk or dont want to bother with mic's so a typed global chat should be implemented.
---
I have 50+ improved repairs from sbq , so your pay to win theory is garbage
---
There are two ways of putting down your power armor. On is placing it so you can enter it and use it. When doing this it is owned by you and nobody else can interfere.
---
The other way is to drop it. That way it's not owned. Anyone can take pieces off it or make it their own by entering it and if a server crashes the power armor is lost. This last way of dropping a power armor can't be done when it has atom shop paint.
---
I find that to be a good reson to paint at least a single piece of your PA with atom shop paint.
---
I "only" have an anti armor bolt-action, but with that my plumber-style sneak sniper is doing fine. Actually using a non-legendary pipe revolver rifle for most normal mobs.
---
melee player running at person with gun.
---
person with gun shoots melee player.
---
I do think it'd rather odd they want us to trash all our legendaries without having the faintest clue how it'll work for cashing them in. Sure, there are plenty of no-brainer junkie/end/weightless rolling pins where you'll just as happily chuck them on the floor, but there are plenty of mid-range items that you could get a few k caps for eventually which might be preferable to trading in, depending on how specific the choice is on the purveyor.
---
I want a whole album of Grahm ramblings tbh
---
He's joking.
---
THIS
---
Do you know a good place for a trading community online?
---
Commando build here. Ammo anxiety is my life. I try to keep around 1500 each of 5.56, 10mm, and 45, but it's hard. SBQ fights eat up most of that.
---
I have got 3 new stalker melee weapons and can't use that effect because my character has no sneak
---
Don't scrap pa armor for plans, nothing happens
---
Any way to influence your friends spawn point?
---
They always spawn in a hole that I have for people who try to enter from the room.
---
You can’t get out of it without fast traveling.
---
Hah, who's going to sell shotgun ammo for 1 caps, when they see a lot of players selling like .44 and 10mm for 2-3 caps. And if someone sells, there's good likelyhood that vending machine is going to be empty.
---
I might personally try selling 5.56 for 1 caps. I've never really sold ammo, I've brought most and crafted 5.56 and shotgun sells, with materials from all the junk I've found.
---
All these rewards that I just have dropped or sold...
---
I don't knock people for getting them from the SBQ, I'm just stating that the melee build pays for itself to get repaired if and when you don't have an improved repair kit and don't feel like fast traveling to camp during a quest or don't have the materials to repair.
---
It's all about convenience for me, I don't care about atoms so I just buy them.
---
they may have fixed this bug but at one time if you had a calibrated shocks mod in your inventory you could manufacture the calibrated shocks for both legs if  you had the materials
---
If i get below 3000 5.56 rounds I feel like I'm out.
---
I have a 25% rate of fire increased LMG. I have 5000 rounds and I have Anxiety of using it. I by the time I kill one SB, i will probably be down to 200
---
I was going to put spoiled brahmin milk in mine but seems kinda mean...
---
My camp is currently near the edge of the map. Every single damn time I FT there I end up out of bounds and have to re-fast travel to my camp to end up in the camp... Why it only puts me out of bounds when I initially FT I have no idea but it's annoying as all hell and I'd love to be able to spawn in where I want.
---
What do you mean not supposed to exists? They clearly do.
---
True, but, I don't feel like going back to camp just to repair because that's too much loading screen. I'm a glutton for convenience.
---
Problem is, once you've used up all the "Do X 76 times" stuff, the next threshold is over 1000, so that's a lot of armor paintjobs. The dailies and weeklies have been getting more time-consuming too.
---
You must be new
---
I amd 2 of my frienda built where nobody else builsa. Ontop of seneca rocks or whatever it is. On top the mountain its a good spot up there. But somt steal it from me. There is a big crevasse between it and have 1 person build a bridge across. Goood luck.
---
Can't argue with that, mines is to keep using the work bench. Lol
---
&gt;I'm just wondering what happens when/if you hit your 25k limit and more caps come pouring in? 
---
Exactly the same thing happens as in any other situation you get more caps, while already having 25k caps.
---
Bug if true
---
Anywhere between 200 and 800 stimpaks
---
Around a hundred fusion and plasma cores
---
Thousands each of shotgun shells, .38, .45, etc
---
Hundreds of railway spikes
---
A few hundred grenades (mostly used up or sold now)
---
At least one weapon for each ammo type
---
One of each outfit I have ever found, stored in my stash
---
One suit of each power armor in the game, stored in my stash
---
A decent bit of flux (over 100+ combined)
---
Over 700 cans of dog food (down to 300 now)
---
~200 nuka cherries
---
I also used to carry around a lot more junk back then, I might be the only person on this sub who had to sell 200 ballistic fibers to a vendor in order to free up space
---
I'm a simple man, I see ammo I pick it up. Except for explosives. Those abominations can burn!
---
With Bandolier rank 2 I never worry about ammo weight.
---
Was his name HH Holmes?
---
Is 406 hours new?
---
Holy hell so many questions here goes ...
---
\[SOLO\]
---
it's fun as a solo as long as you enjoy these type of survival/free roam games and don't get easily burnt out on grinding.. it does get tedious and aggravating at times .. bugs/repairing/farming/grinding etc and is much more entertaining to play with other nerds just like any other game so become a social butterfly and soar young one!
---
\[ENDGAME\]
---
Endgame right now is .. farming resources cause you can't hold unlimited amounts and grinding for levels to modify your build and for legendaries. A legendary weapon, a good one, will completely change your gameplay and makes things much easier .. BUT they are planning on adding in dungeons/raids etc to contribute to end game activities
---
Hopefully in the future too more ideas will come to light, like enemies capturing territories etc and other special multi day/week events but for now just dungeon/raids are planned.
---
\[PERKS/SPECIALS\]
---
The perk packs you get are random for cards up to the level the pack is for yeah, and right now no way to turn em in or a respect option .. the only thing you can do is each level after 50 you can either pick another perk card OR move a special point from one to another .. which is kinda shitty as it'll usually take you double the levels for whatever change you wann make(half for changing specials, half for selecting the new cards, unless you already got em) AAAAAAndd you can change a perk card from 3 stars to 2, you can only repick a card from 1 then raise it to 2 again so be careful of what cards you bring to 3
---
PS if youre overweight alot keeps only large amounts of the resources you frequently use/need like lead/steel/acid/plastic everything else bulk in the tinker bench and sell and only keep like 30-100 of those materials .. armor weapons should be scrapped to learn mods and legendaries soon to be sold at the scrip vendor or to players if they're good.
---
I would highly assume they will, just like with player trading or selling to bot. Select amount, select price.
---
You can either choose a place to camp and change servers until it can be placed or move it around to where ever you're exploring. I recommend being mobile until you've got the map explored.
---
I like the pedestal camp. One or two foundations and a set of stairs leading up to more floors. It helps when trying to move your camp around. Build it like a giant mushroom. Sometimes you'll just have to break it all down and rebuild from the ground up.
---
Don't bother blueprinting your base. Just move it, the set up will get automatically stored. Blue prints are bullshit.
---
We all know screws are the true currency of the wasteland.
---
Does the game force you to group up? I usually don't mind playing on teams so long as everyone is playing together. I am very hopeful for this game!
---
Hey, I'm down to 600 with weight reduction perks and armor. It used to be above 1000
---
They are in your stash. You just mark them available.
---
;)
---
.. I feel like you, but as was pointed out to me, if you confine PvP to the workshop area, people are gonna be a royal pain in the ass just stepping over the border to disengage, then hop into it again, then off again, ad infinitum..
---
That was me in Fallout 4.  I had ~500+ hours in that game and barely scratched the surface of the main storyline. All I did was collect settlements and used the budget glitch to build glorious, massive castles that reached to the heavens.
---
CAMPs in 76 are still fun, but nowhere near as cool as what was achievable in 4.
---
This is awesome! Do you have all the neon drink signs in there? You should collect all the cigarette abd cigar boxes you can and sell em..also wear a grimey wife beater and jorts...im in ohio..thats our drive throughs lol.
---
Either way ..super cool
---
That’d actually be really friggin’ cool.  Wouldn’t even mind dying in it. Just make sure I put my junk away first lol.
---
Scrip  = Halloween candy
---
I'm guessing the mechanics will be exactly the same.
---
This is all fantastic information. It answers many of my questions and I really appreciate your answering them for me.
---
Yes, as far as I'm aware your camp is visible to everybody on the map except wanted people. People are also unable to damage your camp stuff unless you're in combat with them
---
You wish it was that easy. I'm a stealth melee build so chameleon doesn't let you see me and I sneak up and use my 40% more lower attack damage 190% total, to take most of your health with a 1.2k damage hit. Then by the time you turn around I finish you off with a couple hits before you can even aim down the barrel or.... reload. Lmao. This scenario has happened many times already. Fear the stealth melee build.
---
I wouldn't mind getting a few more usable legendary drops myself. But 3* drops every time is too much. I guess balancing the game is the hardest part.
---
Christ! How do you have almost double my play time and not know this?
---
I'll look for an area up there! Thank you!
---
Just place a new camp, can be just inches away. Everything will be rebuild or in storage...
---
Death rides a pale horse...
---
Are you serious? I've been activating those machines since fallout 4, so almost 5 years. To see it grab the plate evenly and pick it up blew my mind
---
Won’t people just start using scrip as currency instead of caps?
---
Except in your 'ideal', that's nearly 500 options, per weapon type, per level bracket. Good luck loading and scrolling though 100s of thousands of weapons to get to your Vamp War Drum :p
---
You may have misunderstood my question, noob 😛
---
Metal picnic table plans?
---
Awesome, I couldn't really figure out how blueprints worked. I was thinking about a big tower as a new build because it would basically fit anywhere. Thanks for the tip!
---
Vendor items are sold from your stash and food expires in your stash, so as of now it will expire.
---
My camp is just beside a cliff.
---
With player vending I want folks to spawn in, just on the cliff edge, facing into the void.
---
I think I am mildly evil
---
Hot dog!
---
affects.
---
Lol.
---
where does the repair kit come in
---
Visible on the map, yes. Fast travel target hasn't been confirmed as far as I've seen.
---
I love Nuka cola themed stuff
---
Its because they find them on humans all the time and figure they're good for something since they seem to obsess over them, but never think hard enough to figure it out.
---
I don’t know. But they usually start around 10am est
---
Lol mKe sure you have marsupial
---
Its a bug. It happens to me occasionally.
---
Quickly leave vats and re-enter and it will fix it.
---
If I have been missing constantly with 95% accuracy, I leave/reenter, and start hitting immediately.
---
One spawns near my camp every other load in.  Always Level 20, 1 DMG.  The wood board is a better weapon.  This totally needs a boost.
---
Absolutely no idea what that means
---
After I give you back your junk because I'm not mean and it's all fun and games :)
---
Seriously. So many fucking armchair developers in here...
---
Anybody at Bethesda could *also* fix that shit in three clicks if they were bored in their bedroom, instead of working through their already pretty full task lists.
---
The perk and mod problems are the bug. It only being level 20 and there being no legendary version is likely a deliberate choice. Can you imagine an over-repaired bloodied or furious level 50 one? It'd chew through everything way too fast. As it is you hardly get time to enjoy the amazing sound it makes on most enemies.
---
One idea I can give you if you want a controlled test, use the scorchkiller mod that adds a legendary mod. Craft all level variants of a gun and add the legendary effect and that way you have the same gun, same effect, but different levels! (Granted that this method works for getting scrips lol)
---
http://imgur.com/gallery/LI0ggwu
---
i can just stick a vending machine somewhere
---
I feel like searching through those 100s of weapons alphabetically would take some time sure, but also then I get the thing I want so I don't know if I'd mind lol.
---
Sadly, I came a bit too late for physical discs. It's all online for me. My issue is that I can't even tell what differentiates metal and rock. I've got lamb of god, bullet for my valentine, verjnuarmu, allegaeon, trivium, in flames, avenged sevenfold, ice nine kills, etc. I'm pretty sure some of that is considered rock and some metal. Hell if I know
---
My nickname is 13 years old, blame the Magness that used the name first on the PSN.
---
More stash space
---
And here I am with 400 .45 rounds thinking that'll do!
---
couldn't agree more. Melee (even one hitters) are useless against a ranged VATS build.
---
I can hold VATS on a melee player's head long enough to (1-3) shot them.  People pay soooo much on the market for SS and Bloodied melee, and its like only useful in PvE IF you want to get in an enemies face ALL THE TIME.  In PvE, it takes me about 1/5 the time to kill 10 SMs, as it does a melee player.
---
50 atoms isn't cheap for a consumable item. It's about 50 cents per repair. (Well a tiny bit less but still) Also a 200% repaired melee weapon while using Makeshift Warrior lasts forever before breaking. 
---
FYI anyone with any common sense has a back up weapon RK's are just for dumb people with a lot of expendable income. 
---
Let them have RKs I'll play smart and with a back up.
---
Not a bad idea, that aught to work quite well. I'll do that myself later when teh servers come online.
---
Yep, I do. I'm running a Shotgunner build as my primary and only use shotguns with this character, so I'm always making shells. I'm now over 25,000 shells and counting. :D 
---
For my heavy gunner alt, I try to keep at least 5,000 of each type: .308, .50 cal and 5mm bullets.
---
It says right on the opening screen that the servers are going down at 10am edt. What makes you think it’s cancelled?
---
No, I'm a stealth melee build. What is ammo?
---
Should start in 10 minutes
---
I have found that spawn point to be where the CAMP was initially placed and can't be moved. The worst part of it is that it's often below the foundations and they're stuck and have to fast travel away to get out.
---
I know of people placing the CAMP in trees, high up. I wonder if you could make visitors fall to their death when the new player vendor machine lets everyone fast travel to your CAMP. There will be new traps and mazes that will be worse than ever as they are now indestructable.
---
You can't get explosive and fire rate at the same time, nice try though
---
Id help but I never focused too much on getting those mods, I know that for melee theres also the sacrificial blade mod that adds a legendary effect (can try the same with machetes
---
without the repair kit you wouldn't be able to give the junk back? or you wont be able to do the damage?
---
Wow lots of questions and these are the best answers I can give. 
---
For your base you must be picking popular locations for your build but if your a solo player that's good news because you can just sever hop until you find a map where your spot is free.
---
I'm mostly a solo player and I've found that playing this game is all about making your own fun, setting goals and completing them. It's like any game really it's fun alone but way better with a friend or two. With almost 500 hours I'd say 350 were spent alone so I've gotten my moneys worth.
---
For weapons and mods your going to need to break down those weapons for the mods that go with it, for example if you want 10 mm pistol mods you need to scrap 10 mm pistols. Same goes for armour. Power armour mods can be purchased from vendors. 
---
Perk cards are yours forever and while leveling from 1-50 you get to choose skill points as I'm sure you've noticed. But they are finite so spend wisely, don't worry because you can move single skill points with each level after 50 but if you mess up to heavily it can take a lot of levels to fix so try and have a build in mind. Also you can spent special skill points with level and you can switch to a different category to buy a card somewhere else. For example you can take a point in strength and a card from agility. The card pool for what you can choose from is based on your overall level in that special category, so if you can't find the card you want, you may need a more points in a different special category. Card packs are random and a cool way to get card you wouldn't normally be able to get because you don't have enough special points spent yet.
---
And for the endgame, well that's up to you. What do you want to do? Grind for legendary weapons and armour? Track down all the side quests? Scavenge scraps and sell them to your fellow players? The end game here is all up to you and some folks get bored if they aren't being held by the hand and told what to do. I myself have been trying to perfect my characters overall rifle damage and buy up mutation serums. So get out there and have fun, don't worry about what then end game is. If you like this game you will lose hours of your life without a care. And if you don't well sorry to have wasted your time.
---
I'm thinking they released the scrapper early to judge how much scrip is going to be in world before they set the prices on the vendor later this month. I have a bunch of 1-3 stuff to scrap, but haven't decided yet if I'm going to do it now, or hold off until closer to release.
---
I know far harbor is widely regarded as the best of the fallout 4 dlc but I really liked the nuka world aesthetic.
---
I was thinking about taking a spare Powerfist with me. Is it worth?
---
I repair my Power Fish once every few days. God you people will whine about anything.
---
I put my punch bowl on top of a mounted yao guai head. Only the grown-ups can reach up that high
---
I am lol [https://imgur.com/XhcXJYE](https://imgur.com/XhcXJYE)
---
Beats looking to the loading screen for an hour.....
---
Yawn.....
---
Ok, that's annoying... I didn't think of that. But I thinks it's more annoying that people who have their own fighting arena (The survival mode) can just hunt you down like this in adventure mode. The only solution for a player like me, who's not at all interested in pvp is not to take workshops. That kinda sucks!
---
The other thing is that they could have solved this problem in another way. Leave a designated worshop zone while contested and loose the workshop instantly? Something like that, but I don't understand why they desided to go with this solution.
---
They should make it so that if they step out theres a 10 second period where they are still engaged in the combat before it lets them out to avoid the annoying truth that people would do that.
---
No you still can without it obviously. I'm not saying it's required, but it's convenient for people who I guess have expendable atoms.
---
You took a workshop without pacifist disabled? LOL
---
dam 3.5 k shotgun shells, i'm happy when ive got 500 shells on hand. Different perspectives I guess
---
You made the choice to defend it when you took the workshop. You could have chosen to leave and not take it in the first place.
---
I think that everyone gets at least the basic mod for pistols from the firebreather quest so it should actually be a pretty good way to standardise it
---
I kept getting addicted to booze doing the daily challenges.
---
Chance of getting addicted to booze? Drink 30 alcohols in 5 min in game. Made me an addict most of the time.
---
Never used addictol before the booze questline and daily challenges. Now I have a stack just in case.
---
Absolutely.  I let mine get much lower than you, but still have that nagging feeling with it.
---
I haven't changed my camp in a while (it's harvesting junk and has a huge tato plantation for cap harvesting with the Green Thumb and selling perks).  But I like to keep materials in stock at certain levels (min. 6 bulk of essentials like steel, aluminum, oil, screws, springs, etc.  I don't care about bone shards, leather, cloth, wood, etc., so only keep 1 of those).
---
Even with the ammo building perk, I mostly main a .308 sniper, explosive Gatling gun (5mm), 5.56 furious handmade and a couple melees (blade of bastet and lightweight rocket sledge).  I have a legendary lightweight MRV fatman for occasional overkill.  I carry two X-Proto power armors (one jetpack, one stealthboy) with the lightweight armor perks.
---
Even then I still maintain reasonable carryweight.  Building up too much ammo also stresses me out due to storage space.  Looking forward to selling off a ton a legendaries I've been hoarding for the scrip update today to make room for farming ammo.
---
add bird bones and you can stay airborne for quite a while...so much so that it sometimes become annoying.  
---
"Lvl 3 legendary glowing one right here"
---
"One sec...still in the air...."
---
Happened on more than one occasion.
---
HAHA! you got it...wish i could get on a PvP server with only melee peeps....what fun!
---
Got a 3* pool cue and some other legendaries stored up for tomorrow. Curious to see how it will work. Glad to also contribute to data collection
---
and some of those people have guns... so how does repair kits give the edge to a melee build?
---
Now add bird bones to that and you will really have fun.
---
Lol Power Fish.
---
Also, yeah mine breaks every few days too when I'm not GRINDING. So that makes buying repair kits even more of a fuck it type of thing because of convenience.
---
It's unfortunate, but you can only do this once sadly. The atoms will still dry up and you'll still have to rely on the slow drip of dailies or give in and buy. That's how their marketing strategy works.
---
...and if the defending player jumps a few inches outside the boundary of the workshop? Your ridiculous system would create issues you aren't considering.
---
For example.
---
Everyone is looking for legendaries. Wait a few hours and you should be able to get a legendary lever action from the player vending machines.
---
my thoughts as well..show us plainly the level of the player contesting, then give us the option to hand the workshop over peacefully..
---
lolz
---
LONG PEW FOREVER!!!!!!
---
I reckon most of that is metal. When thinking about rock, what comes to my mind is stuff like AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Hendrix, Shinedown... Stuff like that.
---
Lazy coding, and an unwillingness to prioritize it for a fix.
---
Yup. These guys want to be able to take workshops with zero risk (while still reaping the benefits) and don't care what issues they cause in getting their way.
---
Yes, totally they don't weigh much and you can easily switch to another 200% repaired weapon.
---
PSA the higher the weapon is repaired the more damage it does.
---
Took the same picture of me 20 times because, in some regions, you don't have to take them in specific areas. 
---
You should have get a pretty good ski sword when doing the main quest btw.
---
My dream weapon is an aa 10mm with +crit dam
---
, less vats cost
---
Oddly enough I haven't been having ammo anxiety in 76, but I do get it in other games. I expect a real soldier would find the term 'Oh no, I only have 1000 rounds of ammunition left!' rather odd.
---
I'm playing revolvers and shotguns on this character, and usually make ammo up to 1000 whenever my stash is full again. I haven't had less than 600 rounds for some time.
---
Not 100s, it's literally a few hundred thousand. There are 3500 different 3\* rolling pins alone :D
---
Did they say you can fast travel to them, or just that they'll show up on the map (with mouse-over information)?  I can't recall exactly how the feature was worded.
---
Yep, contrary to what a lot of armchair economists say balancing stuff like this isnt easy, and at the core you need data to make choices, so them releasing this part early is a very smart move
---
People dont like to read, youll also start to see the “am I banned?” Posts during the server downtime
---
In an effort to save ammo, I’ve been using the slugger perks with my level 50 super sledge. Bout 252 damage. This is super dope when you get a legendary sledge that swings 40% faster.
---
It's really cool seeing how Whitespring has become kind of a central meeting zone on the map. I'm sure we'll see a lot of vendors popping up around that area. Hopefully the whitespring nuke zones don't reach that far south
---
That would be pretty tragic since my stash and my (excavator equipped) character are both maxed out with trash legionaries to turn in.
---
I'm a stealth semi auto/melee build. Lol. Aside from my IE lever I use to get sneak dmg, it will be my main
---
It makes them self productive so they pay for the repair kit and don't require a side grind for that as well as they don't require a side grind for ammo.
---
Well done. These are wonderful answers. In your opinion is there a certain "build" that I should be investing in to help with solo? I know there are random solo perks, but I am more often than not a sniper/rifle kind of player and try to get my stuff done from far rather than right in the thick of it. 
---
As to the end game questions I guess I would do a little of everything, I typically do end game searching and things like that for the best weapons and armor only up until I feel overpowered at which point I usually stop playing the game. I'm sometimes a completionist and other times not so much. I guess the only way to figure it out is to get to that endgame first! Thank you for your help pal!
---
Because this makes it a simple yes/no flag.
---
Otherwise they have to actually work out where people are on the map, and do a calculation.
---
i wanted to use the "action hero" 50cal, because you know it's cool, but after seeing how quickly it would spend ammo compare to a gatling gun the anxiety kicked in and now it's sitting all comfy in the stash waiting for the "display items" update, such a same, you don't know how badly i want to go around with an mg42 it has beign my signature weapon from dod to ro ect
---
Bloodied explosive prime LMG for the Queen,
---
Instigating handmade and a silenced explosive handmade for daily. An OP hammer for bad situations.
---
You are thinking of going south down the highway right?  If so that would be cool to get it set up.  I wish there was a way to join the same server or reserve your spot one time to the next.
---
They're saving for milk. Milk of human kindness (tm)
---
1. Your camp is in an area where someone else has built and due to the lack of players you keep getting sent to the same server
---
2. The game gets really boring when played solo and the game is basically dead atm
---
3. Breaking down weapons is the most efficient way to upgrade guns but you can find mods and plans for the weapons and attachments so no it’s not the only way to get new guns but is the most common way
---
4.the only cards that are random are the ones you get in the card packs all the others planned depending on your level and no you can’t get rid of old cards you can only keep getting new ones and once you reach level 50 you can spend a level to move one of your special points
---
5. Endgame is lacklustre with only two things to do, kill the scorchbeast queen and the sheep squash imposter. The majority of endgame players min- max due to the severe lack of new content coming to the game at a reasonable pace which has almost killed the game entirely
---
LOL dumb phone. Fixed it. Anyway, if you do the SBQ a few times you're set for a while.
---
Sounds like it could have been a creature?
---
Oh man, if only I could buy a 200% repair kit for 150 atoms, only a man can dream.
---
Well, it should be if you travel to the workshop to contest the capturing of your workshop it enables the flag.
---
You don't go, or try snipe from outside. You don't have pvp flag on and can't do/get damage.
---
Would it though? What happens when you go out of bounds in a sports game... you loose amigo. 
---
So if you left the confine of the workshop the person standing in the workshop would continue to do pvp damage while the guy who it’s trying to exploit the system, stops doing damage unless he’s in the arena.
---
There's about 7-8 in Huntersville in one courtyard, making up a very creepy little scene with a teddy bear.  Please make it go away...
---
Sorry, on PC. And have near max caps all ready.
---
... Good point.
---
All correct except SD doesn't gives you "30% more". SD gives you a 30% CHANCE to get double when crafting items if at max level of card.
---
Also be aware it will only award the standard amount if it hits,not the upgraded ammosmith amount.
---
I used lever and rifles for a bit .. but a legendary changes everything, drastically .. right now I switched to shotguns and am rocking 25% reduced vats cost 50% armor ignore 50% increase VATS crits combat shotgun with all the lovely upgrades I could slap on this sexy metal monster and shit melts .. pretty sure all build VATS/sneak etc eventually come to rely on legendaries as regular weapons just don't cut it past a point.
---
I got tired of the sneak build because too many times I would only get one or 2 shots off in combat and then be in caution loosing my added damage and it seemed like a waster to burn points on perk cards just to help that and now instead take more damage perks that help through all of combat
---
Ha amazing. I’ve gotta try this.
---
They fixed him in the last patch.
---
I might try out bird bones just for that. The only thing making me avoid it is the -4 strength. Is the -4 strength brought down to -1 with the class freak perk?
---
No I understood, was a typo on my part, my bad.
---
I know what exactly what you mean. To counter this one of my main weapons is an Ultracite Gatling Laser and I use power user. Ever time I hop on I claim a power plant. Then I'm getting 3000 rounds every ~25 mins without having to do anything.
---
Bloodied explosive lever about 700 before adrenaline
---
They are your stash. Items stay in stash until sold
---
I replaced all my stairs the day it came out without any problems. What's going on here
---
I don’t think they’ll do that because in some way that circumvents the max amount you can hold
---
This is true only for the meat hook.
---
You’re right.
---
Thank you for your honest review. I've followed it a bit while I played other games (monster Hunter world mostly) and was concerned that the lack of new things coming to the game would have me losing interest quickly. I plan to give it a shot but as always am a bit skeptical of things. Fallout 4 and NV are hard things to follow. Skyrim also.
---
I don't think they can do it from home, honestly.
---
Companies tend to be fairly safe with game development and one of the ways you keep a game from being leaked is to only allow people to work on projects in house, because it's easier to ensure a computer in house is secure and watched over then one brought home, even if it's a company computer. Hell, for game developers that buy engine tools from other companies, they have to spend hundreds of dollars to buy a license for EVERY SINGLE separate employee, because no one is allowed to use those tools without one.
---
The actual vendor is coming either later this month or early next month from what Bethesda said. The legendary scrap machine is coming in a few hours.
---
I would also like this, and include a Doom Slayer skin for power armor.
---
Yes class freaks just negates it to -1
---
yep
---
Only if its not yours.
---
If its yours, you can only fill it.
---
Which is a bummer....
---
A. take powerplants and get the fusion core generator running yields 3 fully charged fusion cores per 24 minutes. 
---
or sometimes 
---
B. go to whitesprings murder the sentry bots for mostly full fusion cores.
---
it is slower using the powerplants but they are 100% fusion cores and im not murdering friendly npcs so i prefer it :)
---
Yeah, I’ve been playing since day one, and I got my camp attacked for the first time last week. A quick server hop took care of that.
---
My All-Rise was always around 311 damage at 200%, I played like this for hundreds of hours. This weekend I thought “I have an extra 20+ perk points to move around, let’s see how ridiculous I can get my damage output.” Went for sort of a glass cannon build and now do 750 with all Rise, and it increases into the 1000’s after a couple kills. Went from your average filthy casual to a one man army quickly
---
The legendary vendor isn't in this update anyway, is it?
---
YEAH BITCHES! 
---
\*flashes gang signs\*
---
Ps based upon your absurd response to a logical explanation, I knew you played on xb1. Your post history confirmed it.
---
I'm definitely trying this out then. Sounds like fun.
---
We know that there is not. They put out their road map.
---
Not me, I’m still camped out in the mountains near white spring
---
Bloodied deathclaw gauntlet 2100 without chems 3700 with. Or the bloodied lever at about 800
---
Other players seem to always spawn in the exact center of the camp zone (aka the first place you dropped the CAMP)
---
The cost is too much versus the reward table. The unique rewards were fast to acquire and legendaries are easier to get else where.
---
is there a way for others to add locations? i noticed there is like 5 plan locations but ive found more than that so im just wondering if others can add stuff?
---
how do people even get to charge 40k caps? I thought the limit was 25k.
---
Did I have to tell people I was joking?
---
So strategy is completely out the window? The workshop owner should be able to dip in and out of the bounds of the workshop with the fight continuing as normal. This isn't a sports game where you "loose" for going out of bounds.
---
I primed it. Works fine for sb duty.
---
My entire things is filled with vodka. Just vodka
---
Can't see it happening. No human NPCs to fly them. No Brotherhood, no gunners, no railroad, no minutemen, all the people that under the right circumstances would do the actual flying of the vertibird.
---
Beyond that, they can barely increase out stash, you think the servers can handle 10-15 vertibirds nipping around, rendering in larger portions of the map at a time?
---
In Fallout 4 there were two points in the game that stood a high chance of blue-screening or completely freezing. In the vertibird with Danse heading to the Prydwen.... and in the vertibird with Tom, heading to the Prydwen. Passing over the city in a vertibird caused lots of render issues and could crash the game entirely.
---
TL:DR Nice idea, never gonna happen.
---
It's cool pal thank for your help
---
I would say not “nothing” with others. Can you imagine getting that bonus energy mutation from being irradiated while swarmed and you have no energy weapon on you or stashed? 
---
But boosts/reductions would be great for sure. Just not reduction to zero.
---
Its not in the game
---
Bethesda's goal: keep people playing. When in doubt, add more RNG.
---
As someone who's been using a melee build, I only recently discovered the magic of the Gatling Gun after finding a Two-Shot variant. Swapped out some perks to a Power Armor heavy gunner build and holy moly is it fun! Plus, I didn't need to change up any SPECIAL points to use it. 
---
Time-to-kill isn't quite as fast as my melee build but it feels like I have nearly infinite ammo, and with the perk that gives heavy weapons a chance to cripple, I can shoot down Scorchbeasts then follow up with some melee action!
---
Mostly i use the propaganda flyer or the church note from Charleston. But i think i've should add this too
---
Ive been using TS Gatling Gun mixed in with a Troubleshooter's +1 Strength FFS DCG lately
---
Yes... for adventure mode PvP. Survival mode would have no rules.
---
Paid.
---
Payed is the past participle of pay in the sense of "to seal (the deck or seams of a wooden ship) with pitch or tar to prevent leakage".
---
I assume that is not how people are getting their weapons and armor.
---
No, but there are machines to redeem legendaries for the currency used at the vendor
---
The ability to scrap legendary to obtain script to bring to the vendor is being implemented, they are essentially letting us stock up for 3 weeks before the vendor is released
---
I switched to melee BECAUSE of my ammo anxiety.
---
I still stockpile 10mm
---
Yeah if you charge before entering vats it won't hit you need to activate vats before charging
---
I don’t think you can handle it
---
lol not so quick, if she spits out Legendaries for you you’ll be in love 😍
---
I wish lmao
---
This is an honest suggestion: if you are playing solo and haven't played fallout then try fallout 4/3/NV, they are similar games but better in literally every single possible way.  This game gets such a bad reputation because it's like 5% as much content and story and far less mission and quest diversity and interactivity. Like seriously, if you like this game, play one of the others and prepare to have your mind blown
---
True, thats what i dont bother with any ammo i dont use
---
I got a troubleshooters faster fire rate exploding mini gun, and a TSE Cryolator, that event is my butterzone.
---
Primarily melee but I got a two shot explosive Tesla rifle months ago and I carry that around. I have the batteries included card at rank 3 so I carry like 15,000 cells around at all times plus 30 fusion cores...
---
I swear I had one a while back.... no wonder I can’t find it anymore
---
In Adventure, PVP is entirely opt-in. One of the only means of enjoying PVP is via workshops. If you don't want to PVP, there are plenty of other things to do.
---
And a junk extractor too!
---
Sorry I was unclear; by “at home” I meant if they didn’t work at Bethesda. None of those fixes are difficult, that’s why random modders can make them easily; the problem comes when you have other responsibilities and higher-ups to answer to.
---
Vendor isn't. But machines that let you turn legedaries into tokens are coming today.
---
Enjoy spending "free" atoms on a garbage product sooner or later you'll run out of "free" atoms and buy some. We all thank you for your contribution to the game.
---
specifically. i'll shoot 5 time at an enemy in front of me and none will hit. like i see the pock mark in the top left corner hit somewhere.
---
Garbled muffled: "Quit yer hogging my services. I sell you 5 pieces of gear already. You no come back until tomorrow."
---
Obviously no
---
Maybe you were thinking of the railway rifle, it looks kinda similar
---
Lol I feel your pain
---
You can thank the bad apples. They used it to glitch where they weren't suppose to in beta. They no longer exist. And likely wont be coming back.
---
The vendor is not but the legendary scrip machines are.
---
Not really sure what my system has to do with it, but sure. It's not like I am trying to hide where I play games. There's nothing absurd about considering the repercussions of bad ideas.
---
I usually only have 300-500 5.56 and around 1500-2000 50cal. It’s too fucking tedious to grind for any more. Might be my one bitch about the game. Constantly fucking grinding to even keep the low numbers I rock. I get why people use melee builds so frequently.
---
Instigating gauss rifle with 3x max rifleman, covert op, bloody mess. Base hits around 250 ish, lots more with multiplayers.
---
Mobs I use vampire/action hero .50 mg, 2 shot auto grenade launcher. 
---
Tse handmade for everyday use
---
Gutter to save ammo whilst farming lower level areas.
---
It's not in the game and would be a bad weapon for this game since you need junk for crafting and repair. You are literally shooting money at people with a junk jet.
---
Legendary vendor isn't coming till the 23rd
---
Your probably an over weight 16yr old with acne from all the Doritos and my dew game fule you drink ... I can see I met my match. I concur to your superior line of thinking.
---
Ws vendor sells it
---
I run into him at the intersection North of Dyer Chemical frequently.
---
You should consider selling Mr. Fuzzy too...
---
i doubt that too :)  But caps going poof because of 25k cap is silly too. But we will see in few hours :)
---
Get that Wehrmacht love going with the MG-42! Also, why is that gun even in this game. Like so strange that that is the real world weapon they have in this game.
---
&gt; **bloodied** explosive compound bow
---
Why stop there?
---
well the edge for ammo is that they can damage things at a distance. potentially killing things before they get close to do dmg.
---
melee, they can do more dmg but they have to be close, with a risk of getting damaged.
---
I want what you’re havin’ buddy
---
Or something opposite to grounded. Add 100 DR with 50% less damage to ballistic weapons
---
What’s wrong with XB1 players . judging by the subs , we have the highest population
---
I think you can set them in Workshops. I remember seeing one when I was test building my boxing ring at Thunder Mountain.
---
Hes talking about the player shops that are going to be added this update though
---
It’s Bethesda, as much as I like the good work they’re putting into this game they’ve still got a rep
---
A workshop with a vertibird pad should give you fast travel options.
---
Id put it on a decent cool down though
---
I really hope so.  I really don't want to have to move my sweet camp spot just to make it easier for people to get to, like by every train station.
---
Ah, forgot those were getting added
---
And as a reminder, Bethesda said that scrip is not transferable. So make sure to transfer your junk to your primary before cashing it in.
---
&gt;No one is buying ammo for 1cap each
---
Alright well, nobody told me alright
---
I bet a cold Nuka Cola on - Wooby the most unknown of the horseman
---
Boards and meat.
---
Cap sink might be the cost of the vending machine plans?
---
copy and paste of the halloween candy machine, maybe you can buy scrip in the atom shop at some point.
---
I wish there’s a user’s manual for stalkers’ rolling pins. Do I just hold them and look at people menancingly in the shadows?
---
Make it rain dude
---
Nothing wrong with Xbox players just most are children with children’s mindset.
---
this is a grand idea but my guess is this will be overly simple for judging how much you get back.
---
You’re welcome buddy ;)
---
Which sucks but at least we can get rid of the legendaries we've been stockpiling to clear stash space and fill our personal vending machines with the other stuff.
---
I'm an overweight 36-year-old who eats too much steak. Not seeing how that in any way de-legitimizes my points. However, it's cute that you tried to use "big" words you clearly barely understand in your misspelling-riddled reply.
---
Don't forget there is a fissure in that area, ergo griefing via kiting radioactive fart dragons to people's stores would be a thing.
---
Oh nice! Looks like I know what I'll be doing this evening!
---
Yeah I bought the patriots one and it was VERY expensive
---
I really wish this was a method of fast travel in the game. I would only get around this way
---
I'm there! My former gas station/garage (work in progress on PC) is at the 1st intersection south of Whitespring
---
Turn on pacifist
---
This is so cool!!
---
Time is going by soo slooow. I just want to sell chems to strangers!
---
Oof.

Vertibots. We don't need a human pilot.
---
Sorry fam, sometimes people make grammar mistakes, happens.  
---
You would be surprised. A full Assasin/sentinel set is about 40 american on ebay.
---
I already talked to my wife about making sure our games were updated so we can play as soon as I get home!
---
Get rid of the mutation.
---
I need to be comfortably above 999 or I do get a bit anxious.
---
That said, I craft ammo to reduce the amount of steel in my stash.  I collect more than I can sell, and it always feels bad to dump it, so I farm lead from Lucky Hole and make ammo.  I've got way more 5.56 for my Handmade than I really need.  On the order of 30k, last I checked.
---
(Between the Bandolier perk and a pair of junk weight-reducing pieces of armor, it weighs effectively nothing.)
---
25K is the game limit.  Know the limit, Stay within it.  Game wasn't designed/intended to be played with mules that serve as extra stash for players trying to find every way of cheating the system.
---
I am most looking forward too the 10% tax. Can't wait to see what my tax caps go to in Appalachia
---
Increase your Strength score, or complete the quest Miner Miracles for a suit of power armor that will raise your carry weight by 100!
---
one of us....one of us....one of us......
---
Sad, used to work for all fist weapons, guess they patched it out since i last played
---
Spam?
---
Get the good doggy perk - lots of dog food scattered around.
---
Once I got that, the need to farm for food dropped significantly.
---
Pretty much the only thing I was using plants for was to make adhesive, but seems like I'm swimming in that now...
---
...and Inert flux takes care of most of my hydration needs.
---
A cuckoo clock if I remember correctly.
---
being able to clear some stash space is always welcome. be nice to get in there, perhaps with a broom and an air freshener..starting to smell like a hockey bag, all that sweaty armor and greasy guns and such..
---
They trading works now is, if you are at max caps and sell something for say, 5K caps, it will be removed from the buyer, but the seller will not recieve anything. I’m can almost guarantee it’ll be the same here
---
I have one of those and I have fire in short bursts. Full auto that mag lasts &lt;5 seconds and when its empty I'm pointing at something else the recoil is so high.
---
Get rid of unstable isotope and electrically charged. I was hitting a friend even though he didn’t initiate back and didn’t go in pvp mode. But they would both proc and I almost killed him while he was afk.
---
It happens to me all the time, 1 or two plants get stuck in the 'ripe for harvesting' version, when they are not ready to be picked.
---
I think its to do with the way the server sends data, sometimes the client get wrong info, and doesn't seem to re-request any info, so unless the server send an update to the item/plant (which it wont), it stays exactly how it is, no matter what you do.
---
I think energy weapons are slowly becoming viable, plasma guns are getting a buff right now I'm gonna mess with them and see how they go
---
This is the only answer honestly.  Otherwise you just have to be ready to beat down anyone who touches you.
---
It’s a mutation.
---
we heard...
---
Build wise I to am a sniper, it depends on what type of weapon you want to use and then I find building around that is the best way to go. Now I'm going to mention if your going to be op melee is the way to go, I don't know how to build one though. As for my build I'm very heavily invested in weight management, rifle damage and resource gathering. I also have a good number of mutations.
---
With the game being offline atm I can't look at my build but perception is very important with all of it rifle focused skills. I also have a bunch of mutation based skills in luck. Lone wanderer in charisma is good if your solo alot. 
---
This could help nail down build before you use to many point in the wrongs skills like me lol.
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/
---
Well I'm still playing after 4-digit hours, so something is keeping me going.  BGS seems to be serious about improving the game, so I think that's why I still play.  Basically, I see so much potential, that I cant quit...but if they dont reward the higher level players, then I'll prob. Quit. It's annoying when ppl shame me for my level, and I hear over the speaker some guy saying you think you're special cuz of that number. I AM special. I put a ton of time into this game and submitted God knows how many bug reports to make the game better for everyone.  So props and respect to all the high level peeps out there even if the game does not reward you for all your effort.
---
It's part of the environment.  The place is a shell of an old shop that's parched atop a cliff at the end of a wooden foot bridge across the dried-up riverbed. My CAMP/Shop is built around it, incorporating it into the build.
---
That's all well and good until you do that on survival, and are no where near a train station. And then enemies are outside attacking it anyway... 
---
I really didn't think that through.
---
yea can't wait to test out the new plasma gun buffs
---
Did they fix addictions being removed upon logging off? That's the real reason they were useless. And the major special debuffs.
---
Lmao, wish my tse weapon lasted that long.  200% repaired, perks for reduced weapon breaking,  lucky weapon perks...  if it went thru 1000 bullets I'd be staggered
---
I set up a whole in the wall camp just outside of Whitesprings station off the train tracks, just posted about it before. It’s a bare essentials pit stop. Armoury, weapons, stash box and vending machine with a bit of deco 
---
A lot of people are setting up awesome camps in awesome locations, I used to have a nice camp setup but I thought I’d try something new, and also see if the convenience is of any benefit to the few good items I have for sale
---
Xbox here, maybe it's a PC bug
---
More like spam comment
---
I’m going straight to the atom shop to buy that sweet ass death rider skin then working on getting one of these back packs. Might need some extra coffee tomorrow. Really wish they’d release these on a Friday lol
---
Didn't catch ya before the patch. Will be back after the patch goes live. :)
---
Spam
---
I have a furious ripper. It's fun but like all very fast weapons it needs to be buffed. The only way for them to be viable right now is to over repair them but even when that's been done to the chainsaw it still does less the then ripper, a small handheld chainsaw. Makes no sense
---
&gt;My fear is the wasteland tycoons/former dupers will use their multiple mules 
---
Such traders don't handle much caps.
---
Just added an extra (optional) question to account for crafted legendaries. I'll split out the data as well now
---
Strange in numbers currently breaks Adrenal reactions
---
I would like to ask y’all out of curiosity only:
---
What is there to get from the imposter sheepsquatsch event since y’all keep grinding it. 
---
I personally think it’s a pain in the ass event and avoid it at all costs. 
---
Please let me know if I’m missing anything cool!
---
Good idea
---
lol where have you been?
---
I got a drill from the imposter sheepsquatch.   I was a bit pissed.   So I went on a knee drilling rampage.
---
Lvl 68 super mutants go down suprisingly quick.   
---
Fyi.   You can unlock upgrades when you scrap drills.
---
I've had a tent marked "Trading Post Soon(ish)", with a bunch of random items and boxes and such scattered about like I'm unpacking and setting up, for like 3 months now. 
---
Needless to say, I'm super excited to finally be able to get that all sorted.
---
Use your camera bro, works like magic. It will display the items names in the upper right corner of the viewfinder, just use it to scan the site and when you see Imposter sheepsquatch, walk slowly in that direction until you find it. What they really need to change is not the stealth body but the intentional garbage loot.
---
Turn pacifist ON or remove the mutation.
---
This, he doesn't dissapeare per say, he cloaks. It sucks but you have to keep a close eye on where exactly he is when he dies.  It gets really hard finding him if you dont get to him before he explodes
---
People consistently buy shotgun shells for 1c each and occasionally 5.56 for 1c each
---
Yes please having to deconstruct your entire building to change the stairs or turn them round is a pain in the ass
---
You have heard. Not everyone.
---
So I get to have a big fat fuckin target on my back while you slink around, setting the terms of engagement while I'm kitted out to fight PvE? Here comes Mr tempo with his PvP gear and cards, and he even gets first shot! Guess I better go sit and wait in the corner for the stealthy fucking assassin that doesn't even show up most of the time. No fixes needed, no sir.
---
Were you on Xbox, I’d happily buy your Anti-Armor Gatling Gun. But holy crap, that’s a ton of legendaries!
---
When you can't spot the Impostor Sheepsquatch, whip out your camera. Angle the frame so that your view is parallel to the ground and slowly walk around the combat zone, swiveling to make sure you don't miss a spot. As you do so, pay attention to the text on the right-hand side of the screen which lists the subject(s) in the frame. 
---
With enough patient wandering, you will eventually see "Impostor Sheepsquatch" listed! Once you know that her (invisible) body is in the frame, begin to lower the view angle. By paying attention to whether the name disappears as you walk or turn, you can narrow down where the body is to the point where you either spot the visual distortion or suddenly have the ability to loot it.
---
Youve heard of Gaben tax... Now get ready for Todd tax
---
I like the event itself and it's a 3* enemy so he can drop 3* loot. It's one of the more challenging events if not the only one and i like that.
---
Friday release would kill my Saturday mornings, lol. Glad they release on Tues, makes me shut it off at a reasonable hour
---
&gt; and occasionally 5.56 for 1c each
---
Looks I picked a good ammo to stock for no reason, 8k caps here I come, thanks!
---
Try near lake Eloise.  There's a fissure site there, so head south or southwest.  I'm in that area, haven't been attacked by a scorchbeast yet.  Several locations with water there.
---
Other options I like - near the flagpole and ponds at the Devil's Backbone (outside Huntersville), or one of the ponds south or southwest of the monorail elevator NW of Fort Defiance.  The backbone has wandering mobs occasionally, but the elevator seems pretty clear of disturbances (just stay away from the ants and deathclaw to the east).
---
It’s a necessary evil :(
---
Legendary exchange is not in this patch. It's coming on 23th of this month.
---
I have a lvl 40 furious ripper
---
Isn't skooma just fermented sugar water? That's just undistilled rum. Yawn!
---
yeah that mutation was more trouble that it was worth for me. my issue was going help other people defend their shop and getting tagged by npcs proccing then setting the whole camp and owner against me. to be fair the owner doesnt know youre attacking them on accident they just see "being attacked by XXX"
---
Yep today we stop grinding and start shopping 🛍
---
WIll just have to increase my prices then...
---
Exactly this happens to me too.
---
When I rebuilt the CAMP of one of my characters I built a Motel and everyone spawns in room 11. I can't rent that out if everyone is going through it all the time.
---
Workshops have always functioned this way, since the beta. Bethesda has never commented or addressed this, so after 6 months I assume this is what they intended. If this was not intentional, they would have addressed this by now or at least mentioned it. It is likely there are programming difficulties or limitations. If they confined workshop PvP to the zone it would be exploited, just like any other PvP game with "safe zones". If they removed PvP from workshops all together what would stop me from capturing every shop on the map for 8 hours? The reality is workshop PvP is here as is and "raiders" will continue to workshop gank for junk and caps for as long as it is profitable. Of course there is gonna be a large influx of ganking after the survival rewards and drop rates were gutted. If you want to avoid this, don't take a workshop. If you do take one, simply crouch around this completely negates someone ambushing you because they can't see you. And bank your junk, it's not hard. Stay safe out there.
---
I had it turn on, he jsut break my stuff to make himself wanted and do the same thing again.
---
For me ammo anxiety kicks in at under 4000 5.56 and 3000 .50 cal, I can’t believe there was a time when I ran around with only 100 bullets of one type or another lol
---
No. I was talking about the canned meat.
---
I wonder if you get more scrips with higher charisma?
---
I'm looking forward to literally everything this update has to offer.
---
I’ve been making mine into a self sufficient brewery “Bubblegum Brewery” with a special board and a beer garden called “feargarden”
---
Only problem is I keep running out of camp space, and then I’ll see some other guys building which is 3 times as big with heaps of chairs etc :/
---
Well yeah i could do that but Bethesda also could stop releasing skins and fix this bug
---
The patch just got released this morning and I don't browse the sub reddit every single day.
---
God forbid I missed a detail and wanted to make sure no other person missed it. But go on, please.
---
Thank you everyone for the good suggestions and offer to help. 
---
Will try to move it and hopefully all will be repaired and if not I'll just do some nuclear grinding and sort it out again. :D
---
Really hope they fix this in the update. :)
---
I'm in a similar boat. I used to have 30+ people to play with. Now it's just me and my 1 partner ripping it up in survival.
---
I'm in the same boat. I really hope there us more then one vendor machine. That things is freaking huge.
---
THis. Use your camera, takes care of the headaches entirely.
---
What’s your theory on pricing Chems? I’ve never actually looked if the value in your inventory matches the value they sell for at vendors? (Understanding we get much less than the value if selling to vendors)
---
When does the new patch go live today?
---
either look up items on the discord reading market or other trading places to see roughly how much they are worth.
---
or jsut put it in roughly how much you think they are worth,
---
that is a sweet shot.

Interesting tidbit from a SBQ fight last night:  Luck of the Draw 3 was proc'ing rapid-fire (about every 5 seconds) on my chainsaw with the trigger held down while I was sawing into her head.  
---
Also, with the flamer scope mod attached, my chainsaw does equivalent damage to The Action Hero w/heavy barrel and no perks.
---
I think it's best to think of it as a zero-range gun, because it sure acts like one.  Especially on bullet-spongey targets.
---
This way players who maxed their caps can get rid of some, faster than ever before
---
Pokey bits to stab people with
---
Actually, when someone initiates a capture attempt you are flagged at the same time. You have a choice which gear and cards to use while workshopping (I make a lot of changes for that, though I don't have a good assassins set so I am also in PVE gear). The whole point of taking part in PVP events is to be on your toes. All of the issues you mentioned are problems with YOU -- not the game.
---
How do you even get to max caps? I bulk stuff and sell it all the time and occasionally buy plans or legendaries from the vendor bots, but I’m rarely above 3000.
---
Yeah, saw that on the announcement. I'm not upset because I'll be selling excess crap out my stash with 0 effort.
---
Something more valuable? I'll mark it up 10% or sell it on Reddit.
---
&gt; And beware of random invites, as they might then have a friend initiate pvp on them once you accept the team invite, tagging you for pvp as well.
---
You see them ? I don't. I do send out them though, but it doesn't work. I don't get how people should be afraid of random invites, since they generally don't exits outside of maybe few who do that.
---
Envisions such journeys to be had all day...
---
gets home....
---
Plays with camp all night...
---
Yes.  But it's worse than yours.   If I'm below 12k I start farming.    
---
I have 11k shotgun.   Havent actually used any in a 100 levels.   It's all from picking it up.
---
Hey just don’t complain when there are 30 other posts just like this one when your trying to find Info on the new patch.
---
Would go perfect with today’s new patch
---
Prices fluctuate often. Items that are currently "hot" often change. The only real way would be just like selling something in real life. Watch the market (reddit trading pages) and see what the same / similar items are selling for.
---
Same, haven’t even got chairs or tables yet :/
---
Yes and it never goes away. First 500 what my feel good. Then 1000, 1700, 2000, 2500. 
---
I don't worry about running out, but I always feel better when I end the day with more than I had. I just got a TSE handmade which is helping a lot. So much more powerful than the lvl 35 AA handmade I've been using.
---
*boom*
---
now this guy survives!  thanks for the tips, im gonna have to use the front door mine technique
---
it can be hit and miss some days, it helps to build near a busy spot, but hopefully if the vending shows us on the map more people will be able to find you
---
Well...now that you mention it one of my camps is a "Gentleman's Club".
---
Thank you! I'll look for that armor, and is strength always a good start to level regardless of build?
---
I wish I had your resolve I'm saying I'll go to bed at 10 tonight but I'll be up untill 11 or 1130 then struggle to get up at 430 am for work. Because I won't stop playing I know it. I will AFK while I sleep to see if I sell anything. Can't make caps of the shop isn't open.
---
I dont think the craftet mod will count as legendary to be honest. And if it does, they will patch it out.
---
Just increase the sale price by 10% lol...
---
well over 100 as in level 28765 or as in level 101 ??
---
when was the last time you played? they have fixed a fair few bugs and exploits since launch.
---
Out of curiosity, what platform are you on?
---
I'm on PC and this has never happened to me.
---
Ok.
---
I've recently lost some stuff... and know how you feel.
---
Had to "farm" for materials - especially flux - and it really ruined my day plans.
---
)) on the brighter side - I have some extra materials and will be happy to help out.
---
IGN: Zisai (on PC)
---
I have had several level 40 rippers, but I don't think I've seen a level 50.
---
There are still many issues to work out, but as of now the game is more than playable, with disconnects being really rare (They do happen from time to time, but it's not every 20 minutes like it used to).
---
I like turtles
---
Scroll down.
---
New patch
---
There are 5 tiers ranging from 50 to 100 plus
---
The +40% power attack damage is amazing on my instigating Buzz Blade. It'll one shot high level super mutants when it's over repaired.
---
Because you touch yourself.
---
ok... so either my build sucks or just dont know wtf i am doing.... How in the name of Harold are you all having so much ammo? 
---
I use ammo smith and super duper but i dont ever over 1000 rounds of anything. I have a riflemen build with tank buster? perk. I rotate between the fixer .45, a custom made hunting rifle 308, and Assault Rifle 5.56.
---
What/how are you stocking up all of this ammo?
---
Game update
---
you can build a decontamination shower in your CAMP, which will remove your rads when you walk through it. it takes some fairly rare materials to build it (some of all the stable fluxes) using Contractor\^2 is a good idea when building it to save on materials. congrats!
---
They are updating
---
Literally
---
50 - 100 there are 5 ranks like with weapon mods
---
And you were at the caps limit of 25000 and didn't even get any of them.
---
I have no idea either, just figured id mention it so someone could test it tbh
---
But I already finished downloading it...
---
Is there a limit to LScrip?
---
Wow
---
I believe there will be different mods we can apply to the backpacks. The carry weight will change depending on how you set yours up. Probably around 100+ carry weight.
---
No, i do not have that problem, but i specialize in making ammunition for not only myself, but my partner and any other partner I come across in the wastes.   
---
Most people have the Steel, Gunpowder, Acid trifecta that keep that from properly producing heavy ammo at a sizable enough clip to keep them fully funded during their endeavors, but this is a non-factor for me. 
---
I've distilled a lot of great information on how to grind out materials to efficiency and i have to say, once you've learned a way to do this, its helps a lot.
---
The true answer is to use ORE and to SMELT all your shit out when possible, to have a Camp ontop of an ACID location and to take Hemlock Holes, immediately when you can. The acid buildup over an hour or two of playthrough, will easily outpace your consumption if  you're like me and switching weapons from 50 cal to Gat Plasma or 5mm. I have 0 issue keeping up. In fact-- ive started neglecting materials because it wasn't worth it for me to carry anymore. The only thing I pick up now are things with Acid in them. 
---
I try to keep aat least 2000-3000 round on each weapon at once at a time. I hold 26 plasma cores and 10 fusion cores. I also main explosives and keep those on tap. AMA.
---
My dude plays the guitar for a solid 30-40 minutes before I am actually playing lol
---
Because nothing screams 'fresh nuclear wasteland' better than popping out of a vault and seeing a bustling economy and people waiting around to send you on shopping missions.
---
If caps were harder to come by, I'd be with you on hating the tax.  But I have plenty of caps, and I don't even try to max out the vendor cap limit.  Once you are well over 50 and spend most of your time farming, caps come easy, and this is an uncapped cap source added to the top of things.
---
If it becomes an actual problem for the economy, it's easy enough for Bethesda to remove the tax, but until then there does need to be a cap sink to keep things in check.
---
I think she'll be a vendor that re-sells legendary weapons and armor that are compiled from scrapped legendary components from everything on a server that's been recently scrapped at the machines. So she's probably going to be loaded with all the stuff nobody wanted in the first place, but rearranged so maybe more desirable than it was.
---
Pretty pumped to play through the Pioneer Scouts questline!
---
That said, time for a bug list!
---

***THE BUG SHOWCASE***
---
Here's a few more yet-unfixed bugs that I **personally** think should be higher priority!
---
* Nixie tube CAMP items are broken and display every number at once, seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/g1i2dji)
---
* Gatling Gun front sight ring is not aligned with the center of the screen and thus is totally unusable, seen [here](https://imgur.com/a/eEC0gzU)
---
* Explosive Vents on Power Armor legs have no effect whatsoever
---
***Bugs and Oversights***
---
* Iguana Soup incorrectly requires [Squirrel Bits](https://imgur.com/a/oKxFRul) to craft, instead of Iguana Bits
---
* If you open your pip-boy while you have a camera equipped and unholstered, the camera [clips through your arm and pip-boy](https://imgur.com/a/GNdUaXJ)
---
* If the Free Range event has previously timed out, and begins again in the same location, the brahmin from the first iteration of the event will still be present and [have bugged names](https://imgur.com/a/tCaznx5), such as 
---
&lt;ALIAS=NAMELOC_BRAHMIN01&gt;
---
* Event - Battle Bot - Hornwright Bunker Card Alpha/Beta don't get removed from your inventory on event completion, and also do not stack, thus [bloating the misc. tab](https://imgur.com/a/jBYXAQD)
---
* Using an emote or entering a photomode pose with the camera unholstered teleports you a random distance/direction
---
* If you have rebound your VATS key, the camera zoom still prompts you to use Q to zoom and not the rebound key; hitting Q does nothing
---
* The 'Take Camera Pictures of Wildlife in the Forest' challenge has an entry spelled incorrectly, 'Ragstag' should be 'Radstag'
---
* Inputting movement commands too quickly after leaving a workbench will sometimes cause you to immediately re-enter the workbench
---
* If you already have the Silo Code Piece that a specific ghoul/scorched officer drops, their body will never stop beeping
---
* The Defend Workshop quest sometimes says 'overrun by Sheepsquatches', regardless of what actual mob is attacking your workshop
---
* Atomic Shop - Nukashine Beer Hat does not count as a beer hat for challenges
---
* Oversight - Losing/dropping/selling your Veil of Secrets prevents you from accessing the Order of Mysteries ever again, unless you make a new character to obtain a new one
---
***Quality of Life Wishlist***
---
* Ability to lower the volume of generators and extractors
---
* Let the owner of a punch bowl also have the option to drink from it
---
***Gameplay/Balance Wishlist***
---
* Would like more weapon mods, many weapons have either zero craftable mods or only a prime receiver, including, but not limited to: the LMG, Crossbow, Spear, Assaultron Head, Bone Club/Hammer, Cultist weapons, instrument 
---
weapons, and protest signs
---
* Would like ProSnap Deluxe Camera lenses to increase the distance at which they detect enemies/locations, at least for the purposes of challenges
---
* Add the Bone Hammer/Club to the legendary list
---
***Feedback - New Content Challenges***
---
A bit of a new section for me, but wanted to throw an opinion out there. I like that the new challenges tie in to the latest content releases, but I think this structure could use a bit of tuning. Introducing dailies/weeklies 
---
that require new item(s) **on the day/week of release** only encourages people to rush through the content so they can finish these challenges. I believe that pushing these challenges to a week after that content drops would be 
---
a good compromise, as it would give people ample time to find/earn/learn the items/recipes required for the challenges, rather than scrambling and server hopping to find them ASAP (as seen with the Camera update). 
---
Cheers!
---
i think i remember listening to a youtube video saying around 75. i could be completely wrong as i cant remember if that was for this game.
---
Welp, I've never been to one of these so early before
---
Guess I'll just sit here and wait for everyone else
---
That’s not curing inflation, that’s legendary inflation and makes all Legendaries immediately worthless
---
Yes!  Also the bargaining perk?
---
Was wondering if luck might play a roll, or even some of the luck perks, but think it will be CHR/bargain.
---
The servers apron a leak and had to be patched with duct tape. This happens.
---
Thanx for the reply mister!
---
I think I read somewhere that they cap at 40 which sucks
---
They have to update their end also and test to see if it works
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
yeah I do hope our pets will be included in the immunity
---
I would probably manage to kill one or two people who killed me in this way, don't really wanna play the game like that, but I could have.
---
But what's stopping a really op pvp equpit guy to take all the workshops so no low level players can take them. For them it's a big risk to take workshops.
---
And everyday i might add..
---
The lore diverges near the end of ww2 i think so the gun may as well exist in both our time and fallouts
---
I'll be dropping by tonight! Awesome build!
---
Yeah I can take down a level 60 super mutant in a couple swings but when things get serious I use a 50 cal which mows down everything. I can usually kill a scorchbeast with it in 1 clip and this is at level 40 myself
---
What I find to be odd is team mates spawn right inside my house when they fast travel. I spawn 100 yards away on the cliff edge. Lol.
---
100 yards is 91.44 meters
---
You can build it at your camp and walk through to lose all your rads. Not super rare but also not super common. Looks like they go for anywhere from 300-900 caps on the trading discord I use.
---
Are you on xbox? If so i have then...will gladly put them up for ya. Plus i just wanna see this place lol
---
well fuck. they will be offline for a while. im sure 90% of this sub touches this guy when they are sleeping.
---
Anything with DPS increase is good. Base DPS increases are Firerate, armor piercing, two shot, explosive, all flat damage boosts. Firerate and explosive are the only ones in second slot.
---
Contextually sensitive dps boosts are instigating for 100% dmg increase on shots landed if health of target is at 100%, 
---
executioner for 50% dmg increase for all shots landed on targets with 40% less health, 
---
Furious seems to be a 5% dmg increase caps at 50%, so after 10 shots you will do +50% dmg.
---
If you're fighting targets that die from two shots, instigating is best, if they die from between three and 14 shots, executioner is best, if they need more than 14 shots furious will win out in DPS.
---
For the health contextual ones:
---
bloodied which can scale to like +150% dmg if you're at low health
---
Vampire's, which gives you brief health regen on hit, super nice with a sustained fire gun if you don't mind the DPS loss. I have a vampire's SMG myself for quick heals I switch to.
---
5.2 for Xbox...
---
(-\_-)
---
Right now, if you sell a weapon to a vendor, you get roughly 10% of its value. So I’d say you trade in * weapons for scrip, and it’ll be a 10 scrip to 1* trade from the vendors rng inventory. I also assume there’ll be a limit on how much you can trade a day.
---
No one would use energy damage boosting one
---
Thx, Will test it out. :)
---
If you use search function you will see that there are posts with exact same question 3-4 times day for past few weeks.
---
No, I meant I assumed people weren't getting their asses smelled by sealing the decks of wooden ships with tar.
---
Not saying it can't ever happen.  The Fermenter works the same way - the items are stored in your stash but they have accelerated fermenting speed.  Just needs to be reversed for your idea.  Honestly I like the idea of food spoiling slower when being sold, we can actually sell meals then.
---
Do you have to initiate this capture attempt before engaging the owner? I was under the impression you did not.
---
Yep done that "take 20 pictures in the toxic vally" well ok, *snap snap snap snap....*
---
I am a melee build, but run with a shotgun, lever action, and tesla. Shotgun for enforcer, fuck those permastagger bears. and I use the lever action to plink low level mobs and just fucking around in general. The tesla I carry to tag mobs fast if needed, and I like the arc animation. But for the most part I carry like 500 shotgun shells though I am down to like 200 on my main, might have to transfer from my mule. like 500 fusion cells, and I currently have like 900 .45, I have been getting a lot from dead mobs. And like 7 or 8 Fusion cores for the power armor I only use for nuke zones, and when I am over encumbered. 
---
I do collect lead and gun powder like I run a heavy gun build. I have like 100+ bulk lead on my mule. I have a hoarding issue. Excited for player vending to finally be able to sell the stuff without interactions with other players. lol
---
Melee builds even without power armor completely trash on every enemy in the game. You can easily ouch 450 damage with a power fist with no drugs or legendary gear. Blocker perk and some decent armor makes a joke out of most enemies damage output. Fireproof means you can just ignore a scorchbeast u til it lands. 
---
Yeah some asshole with a 2SE handmade will dunk on melee for PvP, but most players don't even bother with PvP at all.
---
wells hit that sucks im sorry it happened, im sure there were groups of players going around destroying every camp they could find last night before the patch hits
---
I found a screenshot that said lvl 120 so somewhere around there. Last I played was in January
---
ps4!
---
There's been talk about a refrigerator but never any real answers from Bethesda.
---
With grape mentats and Hard Bargain 3 I can get vendors down to 4 caps per  shell. 
---
I'd gladly pay 2 or 3 for one.  Even 4 would be kind of OK since I don't have to swap perks to do it.  Sure I'd prefer cheaper but I can find caps a lot more places than I can find plastic.
---
1000x this
---
Looks Awesome!!!!
---
^^^ +++++ !!!!!
---
&gt; Backpacks will remain visible over outfits and armor but will be unequipped when you step into a set of Power Armor.
---
What the hell? They said last week they would work while inside Power Armor. Way to make Power Armor even more redundant, its not like legendary regular armor already outclassed it by a mile ..
---
You  posted this in time for them to fix it.
---
You def want to curb that fire rate, instead, focus on trying to get the speedy receiver and anything that ignores DT because as far as I'm aware, there are no attachments that address that deficiency with this particular weapon. Also-- if you start speeding up this gun, it becomes quite easy to start wasting your ammo, and that's the exact opposite of what you want, right?   Two-shot and explosive are still the fixes you want, but if you get armor piercing on a GR, dont hesitate to keep it.
---
Damn, those are some really big patch notes, guess I'll give it a try after not playing for some weeks
---
I did it on PC the day the new stairs were put into the shop. Standard replace function just like walls.
---
They had me at backpacks, but then they added player vending and the legendary script...this is awesome. 
---
I hope they continue to add and improve the game for years to come, I don’t ever see myself quitting at this rate!
---
How long my nigga?
---
Plus they are asking the people who are posting on a sub for a game.  Most of us obviously like the game so of course most of us are going to say it is good.
---
Nice trick
---
lol +1 for kevin costner jokes
---
Just remember that house was that gross before the bombs fell- and from only a single one day party. 
---
But they were trashing it on purpose because they were being evicted.
---
I haven't even looked at them in weeks. After they let the camera dailies/weeklies stay in with no camera available to complete them, for over two weeks, I figured the whole idea had zero support from Bethesda in the first place.
---
r/woosh on my part goddamn. That was a good one hahha
---
...and remember, only a commie commits fraud!
---
Ooo, I'm jealous then. My lever is just instigating. Still digging it though. 🙂
---
I'll take Roxy over being 10 feet deep in irradiated water.
---
Yes. You initiate the capture attempt, which flags you both at the same time. As always with a surprise assault, you have the advantage of knowing that it's coming. But you both are flagged at the same time, so someone defending who is actually paying attention can easily kill you. It's VERY easy to see an attacker coming even if they aren't flagged yet.
---
They haven't said, but probably a few hours
---
Dude, he hit him up wanting to buy junk. He was trying to rob the guy.
---
unfortunately you kinda summed it all up in this case, it does seem like this shouldn't have happened in the first place
---
I did it on PC the day the new stairs were put into the shop. Standard replace function just like walls. Could also change their position in the same square space.
---
I'm excited to get to try them out. I'm somewhat pissed though because they recently decided I guess that they're not allowing us to use them with power armor (they went back and edited the section saying you'll still have the benefits.)

---
I have been doing this for awhile for certain calibers just to get rid of caps also.  I also hit the healing aid vendor machines.  I don't want to create another toon just to store caps on.  I don't trade much because that's not my thing, and when I do, I usually trade for items, not caps. But, like a lot of players who have been in the game since launch, I have been challenged to find more ways to get rid of excess caps.  Fast travelling without the perk, selling and buying to the vendor without the perk or drugs are also good sink options too.  I'm sure lots of folks do the same.
---
The higher the star-rating of your legendary items, the more Scrip you will receive from Exchange Machines.
---
Said already
---
54 mini nukes. Her ya go.
---
Woah, you can get some karma for that one!
---
How was he admitted into 76 anyway? Evan probably deserved more.
---
That's awesome and a great tool!!! Thank you. I'll look into perception. The hardcore melee build isn't really my style, and being super overpowered takes all the fun from the game in my opinion. Thank you for the help!
---
Good news for you, they changed the mechanics. Patch notes are up. Workshop owners must enter the area to be flagged for PvP. The only way for you to be handled now is at the workshop itself. Remember to crouch!
---
Yes.  You only need the perk (level 3 card) to Tame it.  Once you send it to your camp, it's yours forever, until it dies.  It takes up a small bit of your camp budget.  It used to be about as much as a turret.  I don't know if the cost was lowered when turret costs were reduced.

Why post this when the patch notes are everywhere.
---
Brilliant!
---
I agree!  I think one drink per persone per punchbowl per hour or even day is good... one player being able to drink ALL that alcohol just isn't healthy! 
---
jokes aside,  I made a post about this that didn't seem to get much traction
---
Right now im sure the devs are very busy with the new content rolling out and the patch, but I hope at some point they can address this
---
As it is its very hard to keep up with the punchbowl as most everyone just keeps drinking because the game simply keeps giving them prompts to do so
---
/u/Ladydevann
---
Well it is a fun game but as soon as you reach endgame it looses all traction

Batteries Included perk card!

Not transferable between players. It could still be valid for all characters of a given account, we don't know that yet until the patch notes are up.
---
I am dissapointed that you have decided to implement repair kits in the microtransaction store. It feels gross.
---
I really doubt that most players want all those trash common plans you have around.
---
Ah, so no PvP until the cap attempt. That's good, but it still means if I am busy doing other shit away from the shop I am most likely fucked unless I'm checking the map every minute. No, the system is still too stacked against you as defender unless you stick by the fire with your finger up your ass watching the work bench. Whatever, they aren't worth it anyway.
---
So Wasteland Whisperer and Animal Friend are unfun and pure garbage now ? Whats the reason behind this ?
---
 **Legendary Armor Effects:** Sentinel, Cavalier, and Assassin legendary effects now have a 75% chance to apply during combat.
---
* Also fixed an issue that could cause these legendary effects to double when using certain equipment combinations.
---
* **Dev Note:** Prior to this re-balance and bugfix, combinations of these legendary armors could make players effectively invulnerable from damage, particularly in combat with other players.
---
if you on ps4, buy it from me! I'll trade you for gears, or something else!
---
My camp located north of hunters ville, at the lead vein(or whatever it is, patch?), has this odd thing, that every time I fast travel to it, I end up on the road nearby.
---
But that's way below the camp and I would need to go around a fairly long way, because the camp is high on cliff. But instead, I do a second fast travel and I get right at my camp.
---
While oddly enough, other players seem to be able to fast travel to it just fine. If I start my game in my camp, then Im also up there in the camp. It's only fast travelling elsewhere, somehow leaves me off.
---
So yeah I'd really love that fast travel target thing.
---
Yes. I was exploring the Pleasant Valley Resort when I found a Port Diner. Oh look a Port Diner I have the worst luck on it. 
---
I pressed it and oh look the claw is going down oh wait it grabbed the whole plate?!?!?!???? I WON!!!! With my 6 Luck
---
Blessed :)))
---
Good thing I've been farming more high end plans.
---
There is SO MUCH GOOD here. Like... This is the single best patch to date. Backpacks, vending, legendary recycling, appropriate buffs AND nerfs. I'm blown away. You have my support 110%.
---
What the hell..... The camera, the typewriter, the fannnnn! That is awesome, all of it!
---
It’s being fixed in the update
---
Patch notes:Workshop owners must now enter the bounds of the Workshop before they are placed in PVP with the contesting players.
---
Can you command a few times under this command? So I can upvote you more?
---
It's really easy to see an attacker coming. They're already flagged and probably have to run to catch up to you. If you're watching your back -- like you should in any PVP situation -- you can definitely get the jump on them.
---
I have TONS of gears, but im XB1 :/
---
You can literally get way more resources in one hour wandering around and fighting enemies that’s an hour at any workshop. 
---
Farm a nuke area for flux and make 100% fusion cores by the dozens! 
---
Workshops aren’t worth the hassle at all...
---
Oh baby, hunting rifle buff!
---
The personal terminal sound so COOL.
---
For the people who were building there properly I feel for you.  For the the scumbag turret farmers, good riddance you lazy bastards
---
Same. I can’t wait any longer lol I need to unload all this weight at the legendary scrapper.
---
*Note: Our previous article on Backpacks stated they would remain functional while wearing Power Armor. This was incorrect and we apologize for the miscommunication.*
---
Well that's disappointing. Might I ask when this correction in communication was made?
---
BEST UPDATE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
im a little too excited right now
---
I have a deep, tremendous fear that she'll be like Kash Nunes from Star Wars Galaxies. Kash was a sullustan you could trade a currency to and receive randomly statted ship components of your choice of component and level. He could grant absolute absurd god tier items, but 99.9% of the time it was trash. 
---
Players would no shit build altars to him in their in game houses, and sacrifices were made regularly in both space and ground pvp. He was a cruel god, but those who received his blessings would live a lifetime of reward. Over the course of a decade, I have seen his grace on occasion. A great deal of my life was spent trying to appease him.
---
From what I’ve seen in the market. It’s the same IRL. Something is only worth as much as someone will pay for it. I’ve seen items pop up and sold for 3k, then a week later the same type go for 20k cause the buyer has so many caps, they couldn’t be bothered negotiating. 
---
You know they sale type.
---
5k
---
6k
---
6.5k
---
20k, on right now. 
---
Anyway, I’d say set a fair price based on what you personally would like for it. Maybe do a quick search for the baseline to get an idea. Of course this also touches on the down side to player vending machines. There’s no negotiation. Set price or walk.
---
An a absolutely necessary and brilliant change
---
OH MY GAWWWWD
---
Welcome WS Station Turrets CAMPs!
---
ProSnap Deluxe: Using a Photomode Pose or an Emote while the ProSnap Deluxe is equipped no longer results in sudden teleportation.
---
Idle curiosity. I finished the quest, but it didn’t list any reward items other than caps. Does  that mean I’m bugged/screwed, or will they just be in the build menu now?
---
They can’t steal anything from your stash...
---
I definitely do not have his resolve. If I were truly a responsible adult I’d just not play during the week because I know how I am lol.
---
In case you aren't aware, thats workshop.
---
I would say so, yes, it lets you carry more, some perks reduce armor, food, ammo, and chem weights, so it’s always useful in some way
---
What a bunch of assholes. 😅
---
So much yes lol
---
People will bitch so hard about not having a back pack in power armour though. Personally I agree with it. makes sense.
---
&gt;Hunting Rifle: Increased the damage bonuses provided by the Prime and .50 Caliber Receiver mods. These mods now respectively grant the highest and second-highest damage increases of any Hunting Rifle receiver mods.
---
I'm speechless I love this change so much...
---
&gt; **Hunting Rifle:** Increased the damage bonuses provided by the Prime and .50 Caliber Receiver mods. These mods now respectively grant the highest and second-highest damage increases of any Hunting Rifle receiver mods. 
---
Be still, my heart
---
Mutations: The Empath Mutation now interacts correctly with both the Strange in Numbers and Class Freak perks. 
---
Loot: Fixed an issue that could prevent a player from receiving a legendary item after killing a legendary creature on busy servers. 
---
Hunting Rifle: Increased the damage bonuses provided by the Prime and .50 Caliber Receiver mods. These mods now respectively grant the highest and second-highest damage increases of any Hunting Rifle receiver mods.
---
aww yiss
---
Those are perk cards that could be going to more survivability perks :/ and even so switching them in and out is inconvenient in a video game where we’re supposed to have fun.
---
bruh, wood armor so garbage, you cant even find plans to craft it
---
I’ve thought about that myself, from what I remember you can get into a vault if your spouse is accepted which is my reasoning as to how he got in.
---
shaddup they said they were sorry
---
Same duck I mean duck I mean fuck autocorrect
---
Awesome. I look forward to trying this stuff out. Maybe I'll see you in game! I'll be the one looking around for what to do!
---
F for my cute little bar there :"(
---
I hate those turret camps !
---
They only exist at 40; if you go to craft one, the only level that exists is lvl 40. No low-level rippers exist at all.
---
Any thoughts on if the sentinal nerf will be affected piece by piece? So each piece has a 75% chance to proc, or if it will be over the entire set
---
Fair enough, Frank
---
Bye bye, Golf Club camps!
---
**Class Freak:** Now correctly suppresses the Grounded Mutation’s negative effects.
---
It's good to hear that. Thanks.
---
No more punch bowl activities? 😟 Hope it comes back
---
Though I'm too new to experience most of the things this list mentions, they make sense to me. 
---
For me, I'd say biggest PITA things: 
---
Fast travel cost. Walking takes way too long. Make prices more reasonable for lower level players who don't have a lot of caps. 
---
Camp construction/blueprinting still too rough around the edges. 
---
I don't understand for the life of me why stash boxes need any limits or why it would possibly impact 'server performance' unless there is some serious programming bugs. I mean, it's literally a text list of a few dozen to a couple hundred items, why does this impact anything?
---
Lag times on login annoying. Also, (Xbox) why do I have to click EVERY TIME to acknowledge that I need to sign back in? When I get back to the game, just load me to the main screen where I can select play or Atom store and be done with it.
---
Unarmed is the worse
---
Is that comming today? Thought that was another later patch.
---
Does anyone know what was wrong with the punch bowls where they felt the need to deactivate them?
---
Been posted 4 times already
---
teach a man to fish: I can still help you out if you are struggling with Ammo production. It'll take like 15 minutes, and you'll get like 1000 steel scrap or better, (super duper for more than that). Just LMK
---
Same! I’m not too far from Whitesprings/the train station, but I’m out of the way enough that my location concerns me a bit. And I don’t want to move!
---
I like these changes.  PRAISE
---
I don't get very often to play, maybe two or three hours a week, so if I'm enjoying it perhaps they can fix it by the time I get to the endgame. I'm no stranger to getting super high level and dropping the game because the endgame is stagnant. Thanks for the tips stranger!
---
This is seriously the best update ever.
---
I can taste the salt now
---
The actual vendor is coming later. But the scrap machines are coming today.
---
* **Hunting Rifle:** Increased the damage bonuses provided by the Prime and .50 Caliber Receiver mods. These mods now respectively grant the highest and second-highest damage increases of any Hunting Rifle receiver mods.
---
Finally the .50 will be a .50
---
Considering the drill etc., are on the legendary loot table can they be turned in for scrip...
---
i would add the advice, try to place your shower in a protected location. i have come back to my camp to find wolves or molerats chewing on the shower (among other things) repairing it takes more flux.
---
You can make one!!?? I'm on PS4 but I appreciate your offer. Is that something I could eventually do as well?
---
I need 10 45. And two 50. for SB so a total of 12 bullets. If I'm lucky I can get away with half of that.
---
Idk what build I wanna run after having the same experience.  Vats just seems almost like a necessity with every try hard running 600 different buffs all the time
---
I'm relatively new to the game and the idea of having my camp destroyed really put me off building one. Happy to see I can build without being greifed!
---
If they never re add the punch bowl filling out of just forgetting I’ll be disappointed.
---
Had a feeling
---
Lol. Yeah. It's pretty nice. If I manage to stay hidden, I can 2 or 3 shot mid level deathclaws
---
So you're saying that Steelheart is...
---
👓👌🙂
---
😎
---
...back on the beat
---
Hopefully just the golf club :( I enjoyed the flat land for my house and the convenience of the shops nearby
---
But they said....
---
Yes. That would be great. Just thought I'd offer a temporary fix in case they don't.
---
Thanx il take that in mind!
---
Its a gold sink. Its like how there is trade tax in other mmorpg's. It's a necessary thing.
---
&gt; Legendary Scrip can be used to buy legendary items from the Purveyor, a new “Legendary Vendor” who will be arriving in Appalachia on May 16. Prepare for her arrival by exchanging your items for Scrip.
---
HER!!!
---
Makes sense. Wouldn't fit under it and it didn't make sense when they said that originally.
---
Hence BGS should increase the cap limit again. The limit was 10k before... are you saying that was a correct maximum price for items too?
---
Good bye golf CAMPS, and finally they fixed the rain leaking through my CAMP!
---
Literally right now,  in the patch notes.  I’m not sure why people would expect backpacks to work in power armor when regular armor effects don’t work in power armor.
---
Either/Or. Sometimes you want to move your CAMP a little bit or you've got something funky going on with how it's built and the game won't let you take it apart piece-by-piece so it's best to pack up your CAMP and re-place it. The structure(s) will go to storage as-is but you'll likely not be able to place them exactly the same so all the component bits will be stored and you can rebuild it into something familiar yet new. Or you can start at the roof and take it apart piece-by-piece. Your call.
---
Think of it like Legos: Do you want to slowly dismantle and organize all those little pieces or do you just want to smash the thing to bits and build something completely new and different? It's your call.
---
Can I have a shiny Bloodied Two Shot Explosive Chainsaw please?
---
Now I don’t have to waste my orbital strike beacons! Weeee
---
"Muh overpowered crutch armor I paid real money for is no longer making me invincible Badthesda!!1!!1"
---
Seems like the unruly golfers had already been "fixed" within the past week - on separate days and between a large number of server hops, I saw at least one or two of the golfers every two or three visits. I was thoroughly whelmed when I finished that objective and received...nothing but the thrill of having it finally off my to-do list. Still! This update is nothing but good news and changes.
---
* **Vendors:** Now reliably trade in Armor Mod Plans that were previously randomized, including Brotherhood of Steel Combat Armor mods and Deep Pocketed Mods.
---
THIS MAKES ME SO HAPPY!!!
---
Honestly I'm just gonna look around other peoples stores and I'm gonna set prices based on that.
---
I’m so excited to get on today and update my camp with the terminal as well as the vending machine. 
---
I can also finally get more stash space after I trade for the legendary script!
---
Everything here is good.  Reasonable nerfs, reasonable buffs, a bunch of QOL improvements, and a ton of new features.
---
If everything works, this is a hell of a good patch.
---
Well they've been listening and trying hard to please everyone, the purveyor may be their sweet answer to all the 'I'm high level at 89 yet never got an explosive shotgun, this game sucks' threads. 
---
My only concern is who will continue to grind when legendaries become super easy to acquire. The legendaries themselves are the end-game content, now they want everyone to have easy access to them.
---
ROFL!  So true!
---
Oh it's going to be sublime. Yes now the game will take some skill :-O
---
Great update.  Looking forward to playing.
---
Shit sorry that was me. It's dark in here.
---
It'd be nice if workshops just functioned differently in the different game modes. I only take one now if there's a challenge for it, been killed too many times while minding my own business to care about them anymore. Instead of making them a contested area in adventure, make them a team oriented area with benefits for working together to build one up or whatever.
---
Oh shit, I didn't even think of that!
---
I read that if you have turrets on your camp then they may turn hostile towards someone trying to damage your camp ... even if they cannot do damage? So then your turrets do damage back and you are in involuntary pvp? I have no easy way to test this ... after the patch it would be good to do some friendly tests (I am on XBox - GT HenryWills)
---
Lot of good stuff in here, but let me be perhaps not the first to request that we can have an invisible backpack.  I have 3 characters who’s asses must be seen!
---
Thats Power Arms BRO
---
I had around 17k 5mm before killing the queen 3 times in a row and ended at 7k 5mm and im not gonna lie. I have a lot of anxiety from thay because of how fast my gatling gun chews up ammo.
---
You mean you wouldn't, the only reason energy weapons aren't used by players is they are weaker than balistic atm
---
Gross man why is your hand all sweaty??
---
That's also true. I usualy get one with fusion cores on the other side of the map for easy travel.
---
I used to use them much more when I was low level and if someone tried to take it from me, I just let them.
---
Yeah! Sweet! I have a .50 caliber rifle but the only reason I went with it over .308 is that you can make 100 ammo at a time with .50 (for some more metal). It seemed more efficient (with the trade off that unlike .308 ammo you don't find .50 everywhere).
---
SAME. There are so many great changes in this update. I was excited before. Now I am EXCITE.
---
Really? I did not know that! First I thougth it may be a problem with my internet connection, but it has happened  a lot latley and I have two more videos saved of it happening to me..
---
Man, sprinting and fast traveling are such intergral parts of this game for me... Why would you ever need more than 20 stimpaks? What could you possibly need that many fluxes for? My head hurts
---
Seems like a really good update. Hope there aren't too many bad bugs that get added.
---
Hopefully they've disabled it until they fix people drinking everything out of it at once, a limit needs to be added.
---
Makes perfectly sense 👍👍
---
&gt;**Legendary Armor Effects:** Sentinel, Cavalier, and Assassin legendary effects now have a 75% chance to apply during combat.  
---
&gt;Also fixed an issue that could cause these legendary effects to double when using certain equipment combinations.
---
***Praise the lord, and pass the ammunition...***
---
Mom's spaghetti...
---
Thanks for your tip I will try it out.
---
FULL STOP!
---
It is now possible for high-level Unruly Golfer Feral Ghouls to spawn at the Whitespring. This should help higher-level players more easily complete the “Kill unruly golfer feral ghouls at Whitespring” objective.
---
Finally, I'll be able to complete the hardest quest in the game!
---
&gt; Exploit: Fixed an issue that could allow players to skip reload animations for certain weapons.  
---
RIP double barrel shotgun
---
Will personal vending machines be separate from stash boxes?
---
Another update and still the discover locales within each region challenges haven't been fixed? Please, Bethesda. I've found every location on the map. Just give me the challenges!
---
Ok, cap
---
I just started loving my heavy gunner with PA. Is it viable to play without PA?
---
Hunting rifle 50 cal buff? very nice
---
Cav n sent will still be op, just like how tse is still pretty op. Just brings it down to a good level. And this is coming from someone who runs a full sent set haha. I just want to know how it will proc, piece by piece, or as a whole set
---
‘ Corrected a Weekly Challenge timer that would have outlasted the inevitable heat death of our universe. ‘
---
Is Bethesda privy to something we don’t know yet?
---
Theres many way to do it, but the one Bethesda chose to - I really don't understand.
---
This is why I stopped using workshops, just find a node in the wild wasteland and build a camp on it.
---
No, at least jet pack not yet but I will only use that for exploring and photomode locations when I get it.
---
I just like having plenty spare but hulk if mine are in stash storage as they are so heavy and I'd rather use that for hauling kit or other perk cards if I give up the Batteries Included perk card.
---
If I understand correctly, we can build up to four vending machines in our camp but not somewhere else (I e. Workshops) ?
---
Would be interesting to not only have a small shop in my camp but to have a franchise across Appalachia (not that I have the means to conquer many workshops anyway)
---
Vendors now sell bos combat armour plans. YESSSS!!!
---
I am perma-overencumbered and I used some Nukashine the other day when I was miles from my camp, figuring anything closer would be helpful. Naturally after I blacked out I had only moved like 200 feet away. Waste of a good drink.
---
PC sorry mate :(
---
&gt; **Backpacks will remain visible over outfits and armor but will be unequipped when you step into a set of Power Armor.**   
---
&gt; Note: Our previous article on Backpacks stated they would remain functional while wearing Power Armor. This was incorrect and we apologize for the miscommunication. 
---
WAIT WHAT, this whole feature is now useless to people who play in PA, thx bethesda, ruined.
---
How do you use so much? I use an Instigating 25% fire rate gatling gun on trash and a Bloodied 50 on the queen herself, I usually use ~500 rounds of 5mm and anywhere from 1-2k 50cal rounds on the queen depending on how long the fight lasts. I don’t trigger queen fights, but I join every one I see, they’re rare on PC these days though. 
---
I have about 5k rounds of each squirreled away though, so I don’t worry about emergency crafting; it’s only when that stash dips that I actively pursue ammo.
---
That's assuming I'm not neck deep in one of these easy to use menus I need to fuck around with every five seconds to keep my food and water topped off or crafting some ammo and pulling weeds while waiting for that acid extractor to top off. If I'm hyper vigilant and waiting for PvP, then I'd give it to you. But it's rare enough I don't even know how it works properly. Suggestions? Yeah, I got one. Give me a button to abandon the workshop when little chameleon sent cav boy comes by in his bathrobe. Good start anyway.
---
Not really salt, itll still be the majority of the time and its not a huge nerf, pretty fair for me and I have a full set of all three
---
Perhaps because they specifically stated it in their article back on the 25th and I would just like to understand when they made the decision to retract on that statement. If it is in fact the very day of the patch then that's rather shady is all.
---
I feel like you should read the bug fix list before you post yours. Several are already listed as fixed. I do love the lists though, it's good work otherwise!
---
Keypad? Those are an option??
---
I may just try Survival mode again. Along with the cap reward adjustment, it sounds like they are actually trying to make it fair.
---
Judging by your instant downvotes I bet you might be right.
---
No fun allowed, get out
---
I can make about 1-2k caps a day. I can see getting to 25k if it was my goal to be saving money but I'm with you. I imagine people that have 25k or more enjoy that aspect of the game and are doing a lot of trading.
---
People act like 75% percent isn’t a very high chance to proc. The armor will still be very good.
---
Mutations: Empath now correctly interacts with class freak.
---
Does that mean the negative will now be effected properly?
---
Lol gg
---
As a melee focused character I begin to panic when my stash of unused .45 ammo drops below 2000 you know in case of emergencies
---
Ah okay, good news!
---
&gt;Grognak's Axe: Can now correctly be repaired beyond 100% Condition using the Weapon Artisan perk.
---
Rejoice my fellow Grognak Axe users! We will reign once again!
---
This drill shall be the drill that pierces the very Heavens!
---
Brilliant
---
Fuck
---
Yea it didnt make sense since armor doesnt work inside PA
---
[YEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAH!!!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6YMPAH67f4o)

Tips for new monster tamers:
---
* YOU MUST BE TWICE THE LEVEL OF YOUR INTENDED PET.
---
* You will need either Animal Friend 3 or Wasteland Whisperer 3 depending on the type of monster you're taming.  You don't need both.
---
* As far as I know, you don't have to have high Charisma to be successful.  It likely affects your chances of success, but it's not absolute.
---
* Your pet must be a single spawn in a random encounter location.  If it's a guaranteed spawn, it won't work.  Look for places where random dead traders, monster-vs-monster encounters, unexploded bomb, etc. happen.
---
* You can get things like deathclaws, mirelurks (regular, hunter, and king), mega sloths, mongrels, attack dogs, chickens, and brahmins.  If you Tame (and send the pet to your camp) and follow it home, you're going to have to defend it from everything along the way.
---
* Your pet may get stuck due to bad pathing.  Ex: the National Radio Astronomy Research building is in the way between my camp and the road, but my pets have made it after getting stuck and then warping.
---
* Your pet's perception may totally suck, just like a turret.  Sometimes they don't get involved in camp defense unless they get shot.
---
* A level 30 mirelurk king is strong enough to kill 3 level 60+ super mutant primus/warlord types and survive.  A level 21 deathclaw hits very hard, but is kinda squishy.  Mega sloths are tough but don't hit hard.  Chickens, domestic dogs, and brahmins are unable to defend themselves properly and will probably need your protection.
---
I think this is so that people won’t have to wait in a long line to check out the vending machines.
---
Ha, I love the name! I didnt have enough budget for letters :(
---
Good stuff mate!
---
[YOU GOT THAT?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFriRcIwqNU)
---
O.O
---
I must check this tonight!
---
Same.  I've been waiting months to check that box.
---
IT sucks BALLS, this whole new feature is pointless to me since i play 100% PA/heavy build.
---
Yes but each costs 2k ish caps if you buy from a person for receipe but about 150 per mutation if you dont want receipes.
---
Cure for ammo anxiety.... stop wasting bullets on the glitchy queen...consider this... your reward, if you get credit, is 100 caps, some queen body parts and 100 more xp then regular scorchedbeasts... oh and the same ultracite plans you've gotten the last three queens... why is that worth the hours you take scrounging mats to make bullets? Just to waste it again? If there are other 3 star mobs that show up, how often to you find their meat piles? And if you do get so lucky, was it really worth the 1 star item you got that you're just saving for when we get to ",upgrade" a bunch of 1 * garbage for a "better" (hopeful) 1-3* item? The queen is fun to defeat, but it's not really worth the hassles of replacing bullets...
---
I really like the imagination of so many of these camps. With the player vending and seeing all this creativity, I may finally change up my 2x2 efficiency/ease of placement layout
---
Ammo anxiety is very real, but it keeps me in business. I expect with player vending being added, lots more players will have lots of ammo for sale.
---
You can't have those three effects on the same armor piece. Also, if you're saying that you encounter people doing this so rarely...is it an issue that needs to be addressed even if you are right? (you're not, but let's go with it).
---
I love my chainsaw, mind you it only seems to be powerful with 150% repair, and it steadily goes down hill after multiple kills, and damage to the saw it self? It seems to have that sweet spot for a short time after repair.
---
I didn't even notice, sad children haha. I must be onto something!
---
Nice. I too fart that way
---
I have a piggy back question.  Is there a handmade prime receiver (semi auto) and a handmade automatic prime receiver?
---
Yes. Fuck all of you people who would initiate pvp in workshops just to fast travel to wherever people were to kill them.
---
great idea!
---
&gt;Iguana Soup incorrectly requires Squirrel Bits to craft, instead of Iguana Bits
---
Have you ever actually seen Iguana in this game or fallout 4? The joke is that its squirrle but its been re-named because no-one eats squirrel.
---
Bethesda is bs sometimes implement an op legendary everyone gets it, and then they nerf it.
---
Never before have I felt such a desire to scream from the rooftops " they actually fucking listened to us!!!!!"
---
Camps at WS Golf Club gone is the best thing I have read on this forum all year.
---
The scorch killer mod takes about 15 ultricite to craft, which limits how much you can abuse that mechanic, even if it does work.
---
That red backpack is going to be mine.
---
&gt;**Punch Bowls:** Can no longer be activated and beverages can no longer be placed within.  
---
&gt;**Dev Note:** Who’s been spiking the punch?! We’ve had to disable the functionality of Punch Bowls for the time being, but you can still build and place them in your C.A.M.P.
---
OK .... but .... why??
---
I think there's markers that appear on the map when you open a store. So there could be 25 ads... you wouldn't want more
---
I've been taking them the whole time (800 +hours) I like the new fixes but I have only been cross map sniped a couple times. if you like taking powerplants and rebuilding Appalachia's power grid and if you're on pc tell me your ign and send me a friend request I would be glad to help you farm fusion cores or defend shops, I am always willing to die once defending my friends workshops. my ign is garlandtd
---
That's a great pic!
---
^This even when I made new alts to test builds I have not taken a single workshop as I had more than a few bad experiences. Now I can farm those sweet free plans with my lower levels again!
---
big step in the right direction,but not far enough.
---
if I read other posts on this subject, the main reason for contesting a workshop,is to initiate pvp,and for no other reason.
---
need to take it out completely. take the workshop, its your lock stock and barrel. Penalty :- you need to stay there. log off,swap servers or step outside a given boundary, its now free. Only way. If you want pvp then survival mode is where you go.
---
(and someone will find a way to break that as well)
---
Oh yeah that's possible. Hopefully they'll address whatever the problem was next patch so I can send more people on a trip with my Nukashine.
---
&gt; Workshop owners must now enter the bounds of the Workshop before they are placed in PVP with the contesting players. 
---
Thank you!!
---
This is the one thing I wished they didn't remove
---
There needs to be some type of specialization for characters that consume and produce caps (think trade skills), or things to dump common resources in to that provide some benefit and value. 
---
In a good economy, everything has some value even if it ultra common. Right now, caps to real value has a terrible conversion rate because you can just print your own 1400 caps easily from things you grow or collect from your camp each day. Resources out in the world are insanely plentiful and every character can do everything because there is no specialization.
---
&gt;Vendors: Now reliably trade in Armor Mod Plans that were previously randomized, including Brotherhood of Steel Combat Armor mods and Deep Pocketed Mods. 
---
..!
---
I love the change to Canned Meat Stew so it doesn't spoil, too. Before I thought it was stew made out of canned meat, but the way the event plays out it makes more sense for it to be meat stew that's canned... my point is, good change!
---
So can deathclaws still be tamed by the other perk or now you can’t tame them?
---
PS4 here, downloading the update now
---
It’s pointless because it doesn’t cater to you? Cry more
---
They do take a lot of weight in my stash.  I walk around with 4 on me.
---
One of my characters is a non-pa heavy gunner/unarmed and he wrecks shop.
---
oh I am also trying to start a new playercorp of engineers called west virginia power company. for RP and rebuilding infrastructure type play,
---
Here you [go](https://pastebin.com/tqgkw5iW).
---
Yeah, I kinda saw it as free fast travel... im saving them money!
---
To me and everyone else that play heavy build....duh.
---
"Destroyed" is the wrong word, everything has a damage state that you spend a couple of resources to restore.  Even walls just leave a wall frame up that you can walk through, nothing gets deleted when it's 'destroyed'.
---
No, that would just make collecting the pie mandatory. People would crowd around the machines in an attempt to boost their xp by 10% permanently. The 25 health and Rad Resistancrs are also nothing to cough at. Way too high of rewards, and characters without high luck skills are punished for not wanting to spam E at the machines.
---
It did have scorched damage. For sure.
---
Then do it.
---
I'm assuming it's either the fact people are sent on random trips with Nukashine (Which I personally think is hilarious).
---
Or maybe it's people turning up and drinking it all themselves.
---
I'm fairly sure they'll change something and add them back in.
---
LOL brilliant they will never get my 10% !
---
Real money? The eBay fairy must be laughing all the way to the bank.
---
Caps I can understand but pay2win has risks, one of those is patch changes to your OP gear.
---
This was redacted some time ago as an update in the patch preview from may 25th.
---
It's related to weapon range. The vats hit stat doesn't seem to accurately factor in hit chance from range drop off. A good test to see the effect of this is the take a combat rifle and build it with the shortest barrel and a suppressor and then build it with the longest barrel and no suppressor. If you use suppressors there's also some really poorly thought out math with the range stat, because they used a flat range reduction of -30 (no matter the weapon type) that stacks with the flat rate barrel length range reduction. On the combat shotgun the range for short barrels is 36 (72 for long), so factor in the -30 for a suppressor and the range can drop from 72 to 6 if you use both range reducing mods, making the hit chance so low the gun isn't even usable at melee distances. If they'd used percentages it wouldn't be so bad, because a 50% range reduction applied for both a short barrel and for a suppressor would leave the gun with a range of 18 which would still be very short but would at least be usable within spitting distance.
---
\*Narrator\* - And no one bought his shit.
---
Bad gnome.
---
I have a vampire's ripper and the thing is hilarious. You hold it against anything and basically you have infinite health, but the downside is that it does barely any damage. Great fun but don't attempt without adamantium skeleton, white Knight and lucky break.
---
But with full lucky break, it's actually a unique way to repair your armor!
---
Such greed
---
Still no Handmade skin *sigh*
---
I have 1 to add for PS4, but dont know if it was fixed today.  If you bring up the emote wheel and then press R3 it will give you a blue screen.
---
&gt;Items you’ve assigned to Vending will not be removed from your Stash. Instead, they will display an icon next to their names so that it’s easy to tell what you’ve placed on sale at a glance.
---
From the above, no.
---
Go ahead, that is what capitalism is all about.  The game has to take caps out somehow and this is fair.
---
Your  Power Armor and utility links are the same.
---
Yup, there is Elder I got that one. Just for some weird reason sentinel isn’t in 🤔 also try booting your luck I think that has something to do with it
---
we already went over all this last week...
---
Utility link is the same as power armor
---
Looks like a great patch..
---
people are getting melty already.. lol
---
OH MY GOD THOSE BIRD GAS MASK THINGS
---
I love the 50 cal hunting rifle buff. Where can you find the mod though? I’ve been looking all over for it.
---
WTAF.  It's like they demand we use leg mods.  Then again, I guess since most leg mods don't really work...
---
I do need more furniture! Bathtub, Tabletop TV, and a few others...
---
What is your PSN tag?
---
&gt;  I don't feel so good 
---
Spider-Man swung by your CAMP, then.
---
Then they need to equip refrigeration capabilities to the power armor.
---
Canned meat stew no longer rots! I’m going to do feed the people every time its up!
---
That's awesome. Haha
---
OP understands Capitalism. Liberty Prime would be happy.
---
Thanks for marking this NSFW, very risque.
---
Good thing those heavy guns fit in our pockets, right?
---
WTS .308 Ammo lol
---
Happy to see Plasma take it's rightful place near the top of the food chain
---
Probably each piece is my guess
---
Oh come now.  That gives room 11 a special feel.  Charge more for it!
---
Grognak repaired past 100%?
---
I totally just came.
---
What items do you use and how did you arrange your perks/stats, if you don't mind to tell me. I am still a beginner :)
---
Yes I saw this also. I made this post before I saw the patch notes. However even what they are describing still will not let an owner get rid of a workshop. But I will say that it is a major step in the right direction.
---
It's hyperbole I used to show how little I think of some of these armor buffs. I'm also saying I don't fuck with workshops anymore after getting ganked mid event. It's fine on the other side I'm sure, no waiting around wondering. You get to pick the when and where so why would you complain? Nah, it works well for you as is so no point in arguing. Ta ta.
---
Following for salty ptw players lol
---
Plague doctor mask **hype**
---
I’m totally getting the pink rainbow backpack!
---
I will be shopping around.. whoever has the best prices gets my caps...
---
so did they just throw red paint on the bone raider excavator armor and call it a skin?
---
I am about to spend so much goddamn money.
---
&gt; * Heart of the Enemy: Fixed an issue that prevented players from repeating the Heart of the Enemy Daily Quest. Cranberry Bog now offers the repeatable version of the quest every other day.
---
&gt; * Heart of the Enemy: Quest markers that point players to quest locations inside Vault-Tec University now correctly lead them to the best door to get to the objective.
---
PRAISE BE TO ATOM! I'll be able to finally do this quest for the first time since November!
---
Its a "convenience" fee - you save yourself the time of meeting the person, etc.  Not bad at all - besides caps are mostly meaningless in the endgame anyways.
---
As long as my other items can't be accidentally sold. This is a good idea.
---
No joke, gotta love Bethesdas thinking. I get they don't want it add more carry weight for power armor and give it even more advantage over regular but now I have no reason to do the new quests. I exclusively use power armor
---
I like this...
---
The Vending Machine doesn't have its own storage space. It does have 30 slots that items can be assigned to, but those items will remain in your Stash and count toward it's capacity.
---
The may 25th patch preview has an updated statement stating it was a misunderstanding about using backpacks in power armor, it was updated sometime ago. Power armor + backpacks would be an intense carry capacity.
---
Hence why you're stalking the forums instead  of moving on with your life. Admit it, it's a good game with some annoying flaws, kinda like everything that's worth liking.
---
* ***Enemies:*** *Fixed a visual issue that could cause Feral Ghouls to spawn wearing too many clothing items.* 
---
I'm sad I never saw this bug
---
Survival is still bad. Get only 50 caps per player kill in survival? Whose dumb idea was that? Onto pvp again in adventure mode then
---
Thanks! I'll have to take a few more pictures later.
---
I’ve never been afraid to take a workshop when needed.  I took over a power plant yesterday for much of the day to farm fusion cores.  Granted, I can craft them now but I also do it for the plans.  
---
Even though I am a high level player, I suck at PvP because that isn’t my build.  So it’s not like I win when people challenged me.  The worst that could happen, though, would be losing caps and junk, and I always dump my junk before taking over a workshop.  
---
For me, I’ve only really used workshops to learn plans.  I’ve found that I can farm what I need a lot quicker by just traveling the map hovering up stuff, once you know what to look for.  
---
I think that there are two workshops left in my list that I have never taken over to get that achievement.
---
Love the furnishings
---
What will they farm, I don't get it.
---
&gt; **Grognak's Axe:** Can now correctly be repaired beyond 100% Condition using the Weapon Artisan perk. 
---
BGS, you're listening to us again!  Awesome :)
---
"Nope, we ain't going to fix it." -Bethesda
---
"However we will release soon a new skin for Chainsaw that can be bought from Atom shop at price of 1000. We hope this will help to solve your problem." -Bethesda
---
I figured might as well make it nsfw considering the title.
---
Instead they should make it a free-demo zone, anyone can destroy camps there and no consequences. 'mommy mommy they blew up my turret camp but they're not wanted, can you build me a new one' 😭
---
You mind a short explanation ? Im lvl 303 and never had a shop or pvp lol
---
ahhhhhhhh….good thinking
---
That fish
---
very motivational!
---
But it is all warm and moist....mmm
---
LMG is great now damage wise but keeping it fed is a huge burden. You get like 20-ish rounds per craft which is awful.
---
I’m debating on priming mine just because you get x86 per craft for the ultracite ammo.
---
Right c’mon Bethesda pls give us a handmade skin
---
Right, this actually makes sense because there can usually only be one person trading with a trader/machine at a time, right?
---
Which makes me wonder, what if two people use two vending machines of the same player and buy the same item at the same time (bug alert 🤷🏻‍♂️)?
---
You can just get the chatmod addon
---
https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/151
---
Not sure. To be honest I can't think of a reason I would care to return to a workshop. Places like ammo facotry, steel yard, and power plants I stay at if I want to farm. Other than that I just like the free plans and XP while I am leveling a new character build.
---
well they just fixed it like I suggested so neener-neener
---
I loved nuka world, favourite dlc of fallout 4
---
I have some friends that have been stock piling legendaries, they would be interested in contributing to this also so thank you.
---
With trading launching tomorrow and a zillion mellee  characters sitting on a mountain of  ammo, this anxiety is about to be a thing of history if you're happy to buy for 1cap per round.
---
You're capped daily at 1400 - one can easily sell some 1* legendaries for 2-3k which even after tax its a lot of additional caps coming in.  If you can still use the caps, the machines are not a bad thing plus with fast travel people on the server can check out multiple machines.
---
I just gave away like 60 partial charge (50-99%) ones to clear space, I still have 50some to give away. That’s ignoring the 60 full charge ones I have. But I rarely use jetpack and VATS, rarely use power attacks, and never use laser gats.
---
An hour ago
---
My Nuka-Cola business can not come soon enough.
---
Define viable. I never use PA unless I need the excavator carry capacity to fast travel.
---
hehehehe deathclaw sausage sounds like an actual food they would put in this game
---
NP! So before, I would take over a workshop, which flags you for PVP if someone contests the workshop. (AKA tries to take it from you.) Which is fine, I got no problem with that.
---
However, griefers started teaming up: One would contest the workshop, while his buddy would find you on the map and kill you and your teammates. Didn’t matter where I was on the map. Second they contested it, his buddy was there to kill me. 
---
It was really annoying and unfair, because a) it’s a sneak attack when most of us weren’t specced for battle and b) they didn’t want the workshop. Just an excuse for hunting other players. 
---
Check my post history: A lot of people were discussing the problems this was causing. :)
---
I appreciate the offer, but I'm on Xbox.
---
No real headcanon for mine, just handed the control over to my wife and asked her to make something cool as she's better with making realistic faces and stuff like that.
---
Ended up with a female that looks very wastelander, facial features are very much "if Junkrat from overwatch had a daughter". 
---
No real story to speak of but I enjoy the look. The wife has to make all my Bethesda game characters because I'm not too creative at it lol.
---
They've explained in articles, your backpack will still have its effects but the outfit's backpack will be the one that's displayed. At least with the Traveling Leather Coat there's an (equally rare) Leather Coat that doesn't have a backpack, but I wish I could disable my Union Uniform's backpack to display one of the new ones!
---
The chance for 3* is never really that big
---
Thanks. I like it when it's hectic. The more the merrier.
---
Fella that replied in 'my' thread suggested that, and it does make sense.
---
For 1 additional flux and ultracite you get a much more sensible yield.
---
The yield is kind of OK I guess for single shot weapons like the hunting rifle but for something like the LMG it should be the same yield as the 50 Cal ammo.
---
Are you on drugs?
---
Have you not seen all the stuff being fixed and added and balanced, like all the changes to tse weapons and buffs to some and bug fixes etc.
---
As a non PA heavy user, losing 45 percent armor piercing really sucks, as well as the accuracy buff. (Stabilized)  
---
I am still able to kill things however with adrenaline reaction, the 3 heavy gunner cards, level 198 by the way. 
---
What they should do is make Stabilized half as effective while you're outside of power armor.
---
A couple more:
---
Plague Walker will turn every living creature hostile if you get close to them, including sometimes the Brahmin during Free Range.
---
Discover locales challenges still won't complete even though I've discovered every location on the map and have been back to several of the locations stated in the challenges multiple times.
---
the download has already happened, and the downed servers started about 10am EST..
---
That's what I've heard. It's on my list to check out as a farming location. It's just so far away. =P
---
Ahh.. thanks.
---
If we are lucky some nice sales sign will pop up as plans at the vendors or in the Atom shop, we need some advertising :D
---
This is a non-issue.
---
only if you are overencumbered, otherwise you can fast travel out
---
already dropped. jsut waiting on maintenance which doesn't have a specific end time.
---
Not sure why that is a good thing but OK!
---
For me it was tiring of killing a wendigo in a clown costume. I tried just the hat, the hat and outfit. It still kept reappearing ha.
---
Hopefully I don't have to do it one more time and the bug has been fixed for that too
---
Yes they do. I do it regularly.
---
Ammosmith will give you a higher quantity per craft, super duper when it triggers will double the result per craft.
---
Still a little confused how the legendary vendor works...
---
Will they only have certain legendary weapons for sale? Are these scrips a blanket currency? Like I trade in a 1* ghoul slayer gamma gun and can use that currency to buy a 3* AAE 50 cal? But only if that weapon is available in the shop?
---
I think if they have certain weapons at certain times that will give people to incentive to play at different times. I'm interested either way to see how it really works
---
I'm sure it's the Vintage Nukashine thing. Probably to prevent screwing with low levels.
---
You can pull ghouls there and/or to the bots. Not as easy as the Golf Club but it works.
---
Yes, but I believe I read somewhere, that when Super Duper procs, it is only doubling the base amount. I could be wrong, but I thought I saw that.
---
I've been over there for a while but I moved off the road itself.  It's a nice place.  Good for fast travel, merchants and the scenery.
---
On the other hand, this is an indirect Junkie build buff.
---
So you don't get to pick which workshops you'll take and when you'll go take them? Ok bubba.
---
yea i dont understand this either.
---
Excellent news friends indeed
---
I'd more more upset about the fact, that if you're at the 25,000 caps limit, and sell something from your player vending machine, you don't get jack squat at all from the sale. Those caps earned just goes poof.
---
It will never be fair so long as trading exist
---
Haha not anymore bud
---
It was necessary. No more immortal BS.
---
Good question
---
Everything is awesome!!
---
That’s kind of the point. We’re trying to get caps flowing again in the economy.
---
This update rocks!
---
And it would fit under outfits that already have backpacks?  
---
More to the point, if I can design a backpack with negative weight, I can probably figure out a way of strapping it to a set of power armor without breaking into a sweat
---
YESSSS!!! .50 will finally be .50
---
&gt; **Vendors:** Now reliably trade in Armor Mod Plans that were previously randomized, including Brotherhood of Steel Combat Armor mods and Deep Pocketed Mods. 
---
Let's all sing "Hallelujah!"
---
Sure.  But only if your power armour is ACTUALLY a refrigerator with arms and legs.
---
They should make it so you can see a preview  what someone is selling when you hover over there camp on the map. So you don’t fast travel to the camp and all they have is salt in the vending machine lol. Also nice the they fixed mark III stealthboys but, I think the regular ones and phantom devices are still broken from the favorites wheel.
---
Turn on your Pacifist.
---
And I think Gauss.
---
Tbh the only reason I really want is I water farm the landfill, that’s the only real reason I want to be able to travel back over there. Can set up bulk water production in four different spots, get ~50 water swinging through every 30 minutes, plus the free stimpaks for defending
---
That definitely would be cool, but they might need to fix stealth/sneaking in general to make it a viable weapon, not shoot 1 enemy and now they all know where you are (especially considering that arrows are quite silent)
---
Yeah i'm on ps4 though how do you make that much ammo?
---
Sentinel/Cav/Assassin users and Whitespring campers on suicide watch.
---
I believe Bethesda once stated that crossplay will never be possible no matter how much we want it.
---
Believe me, I want it as much as the next person, but reality is often disappointing.
---
I’m afraid that I don’t trust the legendary machines to be completely bug-free, so I’m gonna hang on to my many exterminators pipe rifles, assassins robot armor, and furious pool cues.
---
Everyone
---
Seems obvious now you describe it, thanks, something to look forward too LOL
---
Ain't like the reload on the Gauss is terrible.
---
I just saw a video of a guy using a spring trap in his camp, combined with jet pack, power user, bird bones, and kinetic servos and he literally flew across the map (with a little help from some coffee)
---
It is a small thing but I really wish more people would acknowledge it so that the devs can fix it. Probably would take someone 5 min to change, but no one else seems to complain about it so they are leaving it as is.
---
Backpacks working with Power Armor was a *TYPO*?!?!
---
What the *FUCK*. Why does Bethesda hate Power Armor?
---
It's already so much worse than normal armor because it can't benefit from legendary effects, which i understand. Power armor mods on average are at parity or better compared to most 1-2 armor pieces. But why couldn't we just have this?
---
As a heavy guns main, I don't really have the option to not use power armor (in combat at the very least), so I tend to just always run with PA since jumping in to a suit mid combat is a bit of a hassle sometimes. This revelation really has just drained all my excitement for backpacks, and honestly the entire patch.
---
Is it though? Does it say that in the patch notes?
---
Excellent work!
---
I wish they added more character challenges. Tried of always comepelting daily and weekly challenges.
---
Survival isn't bad... It's incomplete and still being balanced.  They need to stress more Survival elements and emphasize the pvp less.  I want lower carry capacity, diseases that stay till cured, and higher damage, similar to Survival in 4.  However, nerfing the poprock shooter and the invulnerable armor will make the mode even more exciting. 
---
I've not played in Adventure since it came out.  I just can't go back.
---
Jesus we are already up to 9 pages, I remember when it was only like 4 or 5
---
...And they just disabled the punchbowl  with this patch to prevent this. It was fun while it lasted.
---
);
---
that's the downside of the mutation..not sure if Class Freak helps that particular negative or not.
---
Same. I've been looking for Deep Pocketed Mods/Plans for so damn long, I was questioning if it was even possible to get the damn plans.
---
Pa users have enough carry weight already.  This will be good for those low strength builds that actually need it
---
It’s only temporary.
---
Really curious about this one! I wonder what exactly it will tell us, hyped to see what this is exactly!

It might still be possible to kite creatures to camps and have the creatures wreck up the place.

Hmmm... he's into skeletons ? a really perverted Gnome, lol
---
Lmaoo clever
---
Good for u ! 👍
---
But the fridge :/
---
Just know what for everything they fixed they probably broke something else
---
Well is actually a PVP Survival not a CAP farming mode.
---
I have Class freak. It doesn't help it.
---
Yup, they work together.  From what I've seen Super Duper does not work when bulking items, or modding weapons/armor.  But if you are crafting things like new weapons, new armor, food, ammo, alcohol, etc. then yes its sure does work.  Not sure if it works when you're crafting power armor pieces though, I don't do a lot of that. so I'm not sure.
---
You could build in white springs?! I avoided that place since I couldn’t level up fast enough to be there yet
---
And what happens with your food does the refrigeration stop working when you equip power armor?
---
Love it, Nicely done
---
Its going to be per armor piece.
---
Sales numbers may vary based on charisma\*
---
I think that’s on the trading subs and what not. 
---
If I head over to a vender and they have the ammo I use, I’ll usually buy it for 1 cap each just out of convenience.
---
Can we get an F in the chat for my AAE Combat Shotgun
---
This patch looks amazing overall.  I am disappointed to see that scrip cannot be traded.  I was really hoping for an alternative to caps....
---
Darn, I had a nice camp in the back of the golf course next to the bunker. I didn’t even put up turrets and kept to myself, but now I gots to relocate
---
I’ve had the same team of players kill me twice.  The first time I figured...  fine...  you want the workshop, it’s yours.   But they killed me a second time while I was trading, well away from the workshop.   That was annoying to say the least, so I just left the server to go to another one.   I wasn’t about to continue playing their game.  
---
I found out that they could challenge for the base, back out, but still be able to PVP me.  They were taking advantage of a bug/loophole.  
---
My point is that they were annoying, but as long as you are regularly scrapping and storing your junk then its just an annoyance.  Leaving the server is always an option.
---
Yeah, it will please the 4 guys who use that.
---
I have a special perk card ready and waiting for all those posts lol
---
https://imgur.com/gallery/6DWifO0
---
Also, when fast traveling to the defend event, many times it places you inside the factory.
---
Thanks for sticking around :) I enjoy reading their notes, almost every patch there's a number of things off of a few lists getting fixed, nice to see
---
Not me. Survival will be more ridiculous than it already is..
---
But mah punch bowl...
---
Should show in your build menu. The fermenter and brewing station don't come as plans, it just "learns" automatically at the end
---
oblivion
---
Try doing events that you pass by, they normally reward Radaways, Stimpaks, and some caps.
---
/u/Valseek
---
lol most of them are dumb little kids anyways, a lot of 'mommy mommy' and tears tonight
---
Sorry dude, you’ve been voted off the island! 🌴 joking 🙃.. I love this game so, hell yeah!
---
Gus Gorman asked a similar question once. It didn't end up working well for him.
---
Sympathies for people who spent a ton of caps, no sympathy for idiots who spend real money on items.
---
Thank you for the info! Will definitely keep an eye out for those. I'm particularly interested in Vampire's, as I've been using a Vampire's Auto-Shotgun for health recovery when I need to fall back from melee or use the Enforcer perk to cripple Scorchbeasts, but it's stupidly heavy compared to the Gatling Gun (go figure).
---
That's a good point. Fuckers ruined my grandchildren to the 978th power's surprise!
---
Hopefully tells us when daily’s and vendors reset maybe. Would be nice if it showed where grahm was at on that map.
---
Thanks for the info!
---
To the “It just works foundation” as a charitable donation. Free tax deduction.
---
I think bulk junks cost way more than that. rubber cost me like 78 caps with 20+ charisma.
---
"Explosive Shotguns: Fixed an issue causing Shotguns with the Explosive legendary effect to deal double damage, rather than the intended +20%."
---
If you notice in my highlight reel, I pretty much only die to explosive shot guns. Level 30 or not. Maybe me losing my entire bar of health in power armor with one shotgun blast was less of me "sucking" and me showing off obvious balance issues.
---
Playstation won't allow it
---
HYPE.
---
Shoot all the junk I get from taking players workshops, free ammo
---
me too!, but at least it saves time meeting ppl for small profit....BUT, really dont want to FT everywhere to find stuff. i read something about hovering over a camp and it shows current inventory???
---
lol check my yt channel DamoPlayz and see the vid i did on a pvp server ridiculous lol
---
True, but the market has shifted to be trade heavy for the good stuff. Looks like I have some shopping to do.
---
Interesting math - 266 caps isn't a lot of profit.  However I just use spare junk to do this so its all profit for me.  I thought you were going to compare the cost of selling helmets vs. selling bulk junk of what it takes to craft the helmets at first until I read further of the comparison you did.
---
Ah, I see what you are saying. What if in the vendor windows your known plans you could sell sorted to the top and the vendors list sorted known plans to the bottom? Is that a win-win in your book?
---
Makes me think of that Fallout 4 concept art for [Institute Power Armor](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/00/12/0c/00120c1edf8d5b293a058eb096b988e6.jpg)
---
The void
---
But seriously, probably the same place that caps go when you fast travel. I would just recommend keeping an eye on your caps at all time.
---
Or morrowind ayy

Platform? I'm on PS4 and haven't seen this, I don't think. Have seen the crouching during emote selection crash that some Xbox users have mentioned, though.
---
The pylon thing isn't the actual reason i'm pissed i just feel like we deserve a game that isn't filled with major bugs like these after 5 months of the release
---
Read the new patch notes
---
Boo-urns! :(
---
Can’t drink from punch bowls anymore?!
---
Aww,  I spent hours crafting a duck ton of nukashine for my shops grand opening tonight.
---
I have 160k ultrasound .50 cal ammo currently, so I guess.. Yeah. Every activity I do contributes towards ammo crafting and also happens to be a good way to farm mercenaries though, so it isn't a problem.
---
Patch notes state if imposter dies without being clocked it will not become cloaked after death. They’ve fixed it
---
Caps: Instead of scrapping minor junk, sell it. If you’re walking around inside whitesprings, for instance, the vases and ashtrays sell for 1c or so and there’s over a hundred of them. Same for other trash elsewhere. Beer bottles, dishrags, etc. 
---
Stimpacks: check bathroom mirror cabinets and first aid boxes on the walls.
---
Yeah that’s a good point.
---
PC
---
Thats a nice looking camp! I bet it looks better in person!
---
Cool, do you have a TV and the small black coffee table set? I've been looking for those for a while.
---
Todd's pockets of course
---
Yeah, feels good/bad. I grinded super hard for my set. But it was definitely one of the the most entertaining adventures I had. Plus that stuff was broken. I got pretty sick of the stand still and jump battles, first to crit or stagger the other wins. I genuinely feel this will shift the PvP in a very positive direction.
---
&gt;Legendary Armor Effects: Sentinel, Cavalier, and Assassin legendary effects now have a 75% chance to apply during combat. 
---
Also fixed an issue that could cause these legendary effects to double when using certain equipment combinations.
---
&gt;C.A.M.P. objects and Structures no longer take damage from other players as long as the defending player, and their C.A.M.P. defenses, are not hostile against their attackers.
---
&gt;Players that are not actively contesting an owned Workshop cannot damage the objects built there.
---
Now we wait for the griefer's to get upset that they'll have to go to Survival to destroy people's camps.
---
When the game first launched I met so many cool people who I played with every day for the first month... Now when I log in each day, they are all offline and haven't seen them since December. Still play every day but I miss that first time exploring fo76 with a buddy.
---
Into the void...
---
To the Chinese , they have to finance those liberators somehow so they putted back doors in the vending machines in apalachia, robco and vault tec where too cheap to made those in the west
---
Dosen't make you any less killable lol
---
Yes they introduced it that way to help people who’ve been hoarding items for months to empty out their stash to prepare for it. Helps people with weight and stuff.
---
just a wild guess
---
Can confirm this happens with me...pc
---
Wow now i don't know how to feel
---
Well shit,.... that's several days I wasted server hopping till I found the BOS legs.
---
I saw complaints that visitors could drink all the booze in one go. I think they just deactivated it until they figure out a fix for it.
---
That foundation restriction is gonna be HUGE for what you can do now
---
I'll have to have a look at hunting rifles again.
---
But you lose the 'WOAH, 80 ATOMS FROM NOWHERE'. Hahahahahahahaha.
---
Yup same, easier than organizing to meet up with someone via reddit, especially if i am also able to sell my unwanted ammo types at 1c/ea. Easy choice to buy at 1c/ea if i happen upon a vendor selling the type i want.
---
Ok , thanks for the straight explanation 👍
---
people hoarding hundreds of thousands of caps and not knowing what to do with them sounds like a bigger problem.  at least cap limit forces them to participate in trading
---
I have never once had this happen on PC and I spam eat spoiled meat all the time.
---
If someone actually pulls that off, then I think they earned that griefing.
---
Basically serendipity
---
Oh shut up, I was shooting someone with that set with a 500 damage BE Gatling Gun and he was literally receiving no damage, how are you supposed to deal with that if you don't have one of those OP sets as well (Besides maybe stealth and praying they don't see you)?
---
Finally I can complete my armor collection
---
As far as I understood, that\`s exactly how it\`s gonna be
---
I checked in on this and Deathclaws should still be able to be tamed by Wasteland Whisperer.
---
That was the whole point in putting my punch bowl out though... le sigh
---
Yea the people who spent real money on in game items can be put in a stack and beaten with a stick.
---
&gt;Our previous article on Backpacks stated they would remain functional while wearing Power Armor. This was incorrect and we apologize for the miscommunication.
---
BOOOOOOOOOO
---
So at this point should i just give bethesda my bank account?
---
Was just about to write the same lol 😂
---
Amongst the highlights:  Workshop owners must now enter the bounds of the Workshop before they are placed in PVP with the contesting players.
---
Or the trading posts asking for all that steel to XP farm.
---
I dont care either way, its a fuckin game.
---
Nuuuuuuu 😱
---
The Whitesprings Golf Club is now a no-build area.  AFAIK, the green is still fair game.
---
From what was said here in the notes, it appears Deathclaws WILL be tamable using "Wasteland Whisperer" now instead of "Animal Friend".  What is in question, now, actually... is if MegaSloths will be tamable AT ALL -- the notes say that MegaSloths can no longer be pacified by EITHER card (in two separate lines).
---
but, but, but, that is so fun, lol :)
---
I wish I could give you karma for this.
---
Elder Scrolls VI merchants inventories
---
Now all I need to do is to remember this. Damn, here comes the hard part.
---
People can't buy anything out of my stash either.  This is a new feature.
---
There could be bugs, and I don't feel like testing Bethesda's ability to provide a bug-free feature by putting 50K caps worth of legendaries out for people.  Since player vending machines are a new feature, it's possible there will be a way to exploit the thing one way or the other, and I'd rather give it a bit to see if bugs are introduced with it or not.
---
It's probably where the taxes go too
---
Ha! What platform are you on?
---
Awesome. I get to annoy my friend today with that being stuck in my head. Thanks.
---
This will be my #1 now next to "You'll never see it coming" from Persona 5 in a high pitched voice.
---
He shall be pleased.
---
Ebay
---
I’ve heard about this a long time ago, I’m level 201 and still have no idea where this fountain is, looked for it since level 25
---
It was good while it lasted.
---
I can finally sell all these useless legendaries I've been hoarding. 😌 
---
Hello inventory space.
---
On one hand I think that’s a really good idea, on the other I would be *way* too tempted to blow other people out of the air.
---
Like, at this point it’s a reflex to just shoot at vertibirds.
---
stealthboy &gt; crit to the head
---
if they're invisible themselves,
---
stealthboy &gt; power attack
---
oh wow, that was *so* hard.
---
Ditto. 
---
It could be used to make a wasteland internet so I can post cat pictures.
---
I will give anything for
---
THE. GRASS. DEATHCLAW
---
I am so happy they made this change. I was getting sick of being hunted across the map by griefers.
---
im disappointed the backpacks will not work in PA.. i was hoping we could bolt it to power armor
---
Wonder how many players can fit in their.
---
It's still best in slot, it's just not godmode. Wearing a single assn sent piece is still better than a full set of power armor in pvp.
---
My god I'm so happy. This made my month. Everything I wanted and more! Thank you for the hard work. Backpacks, vendors, I can actually sell all my bad Legendaries to a vendor, not feel guilty and recover all that precious stash space... And you buffed plasma gun! Absolutely amazing.
---
I have like 300 shotgun shells. You don't know what ammo anxiety is.
---
**Plasma Guns:** Damage increased by 30%.
---
Happy about this one.
---
Like maybe you can make your own at your camp and you can actually pilot it and other people can ride. Apocalyptic Uber
---
I think your sarcasm detectors are malfuntioning
---
I wear PA in nuke zones actually.  I've fooled around in there wearing just the rad suit, but you're a glass cannon.
---
I can confirm, all this is still true.
---
Man, i feel stupid. Walked into that area looking for it and absolutely missed it.  I was walking around the tennis courts and trying to drink from the water coolers.
---
Thanks!!!!!
---
Ya, sounds like the purveuor will just  have a list of items for sale. No rerolling unfortunately.  Guess we will find out next week!
---
My only thought is the original description said you could share mixed drinks in it, but in practice you could select any alcoholic beverage, so maybe that was a glitch and they couldn’t fix it in time for the patch, so they disabled it for now until they could have it working in a later patch?
---
Power armor is already OP what are you talking about?
---
You can buy the plans for them at watago station and maybe harpers ferry

"BETHESDA BANNING PUNCHBOWL DUPERS, NEW PATCH BREAKS GAME"
---
At this point, I would *pay* caps to get it out of my quest list, so I ain't even mad about that.
---
The BEST part of the update. Now I can actually decide if I want to fight for my workshops or not, Instead of having to log off the server so I don’t have to deal with griefers following me all over the map.
---
It said in the patch notes they would
---
They did push the camera back a week, so only fair one is brought forward :)
---
Honestly, a fully perked hunting rifle is already good (not great, but definitely good).  Depending on *how much* higher the damage is, I may go back to mine as my go-to weapon.
---
(I can already one-shot most normal mobs with it, even without a headshot, but I've got stupid amounts of perk points in rifleman).
---
let's see..it's fixed on the first fix, gets broke on the second, fixed on third...yup, confirmed! it's fixed!
---
Needed to balance builds.
---
lol isn't that how it works
---
I think it would probably be okay between the console versions but i would not want it with PC due to the different input methods, different settings and hackers/modders etc
---
That's a good point. I did save 10k. That's a pretty big chunk when you can I let carry 25k.
---
same, that nukashine backpack would look so good on my nukashine PA :D
---
survival..
---
Someone said you could farm XP and caps by server hopping and doing this repeatedly. Didn't verify but too late now.
---
Coming to an Atomic Shop near you...
---
check the current patch notes   [https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1GzFRJ3M5wmdnunkTDcbHZ/fallout-76-wild-appalachia-patch-9-notes-may-7-2019)
---
Yea.. this sucks big time. Sorry us PA users no fridge backpacks for you. Or other cool mods.
---
Survival exists, dummy.
---
Faction based Atomshop stuff confirmed I guess? Starting with responders.
---
What if the defender only flags when they show up to defend? I don’t think anyone is really suggesting they can can use the workshop edge to disengage. It’s silly that the attacker can change the state of a player on the opposite side of the map. 
---
If it’s uncontested, the attacker should simply win and take the workshop. Locking the defender into PvP until they leave the server is stupid, once they’ve lost the workshop. They could choose or not to contest it and become the attacker.
---
Sooo much goodness here!
---
Well all you have to do is balance it to make them not paper thin. I’d keep them only destructible in survival mode as well.
---
Is everyone who PVP's a toxic griefer?
---
I just did a character all the way to 60s in survival, knowing I saved myself 20% of my time feels pretty good. I’ve jumped on to adventure just for the camp vending because I’m not sure what will happen there as of yet
---
then don't use PA? you just proved my point, PA, for the most part, is useless in pvp. nobody who knows the first thing about pvp would get into a fight wearing excavator.
---
&gt;Plus, only stealth builds work with what you are suggesting
---
uh, no? literally anyone can pop a stealthboy or power attack. crit too, albeit less efficiently so. and secret agent is only a 3 point investment.
---
Very good point.
---
Awe. Wittle baby mad he can't be a douche. If you're aggro with the person you can still demolish to your hearts content
---
Actually looks like bloodstains. But yes.
---
Loving the assassins sentinel nerf, just needs more ya know?  Like instead of 15 and 8% 
---
Sentinel should reduce damage to 8% and assassins should reduce to 5% 
---
People should NOT be invulnerable unless you stagger them.
---
I have my vault suit on still.. I dont even know what there is that can replace it..
---
Impressive.  Still cruising along with a 1\* executioners combat rifle.  
---
  Guessing my damage numbers are low because for rifle, I only have the 10% damage and 20% ignore armor perks, not mutated, and so far, have not tried bobbleheads/magazines?
---
Easy there, Dora.
---
I’d love a landing pad next to my crib 😎
---
I feel like if that was the issue they would simply disallow Nukashine like they did with other drinks, seems overkill to remove the whole functionality
---
Agreed.  The area around the clubhouse was just no bueno, but out on the golf course proper I've seen some of the best camps since they made Whitesprings the shopping hub.
---
I have two characters. One wears the 76 Vault Suit for under armor, but spends most of their time in power armor, so it's only visible when I'm crafting at a workbench. The other doesn't use PA as much but has a different (strength-boosting) under armor.
---
Oh thank god. Sorry about that carry on.
---
😂
---
I’d like to buy a TSE combat shotgun. That’ll take lots of caps. Like saving for a large purchase. If I ever find one, I’ll be my normal poor self again.  I just had a lucky week finding calibrated shocks and jet packs in the enclave bunker.
---
BEST PATCH TO DATE
---
Oh man that weird cultist shit. AND RESPONDERS/FIRE BREATHERS FACTION STUFF? Personally i’m not getting those but BLESS IT ALL FINALLY FACTION CONTENT
---
Bless, been trying to find deep pocketed combat for a long time.
---
I know. I would like to be out of power armor but its just not realistic for Heavy Weapons.
---
People around here like a lot of wine with their cheese
---
Because people who buy a lot of atomic shop items or people who trade a lot of stuff for gear in game are not the problem. The people who spend real world money to buy it from other people are the problems. They can be mauled by rabid dogs.
---
They pushed back vending a month lol I’m an glad to get vending and Legendary scrapping at once now, a lot of weight to be shed
---
apparently not youre pretty butthurt over the cap cap
---
But being mean with mean people doesn’t feel the same...
---
I hear you.
---
There are quite a few bugs that by means of having been exposed to them for 1300+ hours they are now really grinding me down.
---
At least I have silver linings here and there. The servers - which is kind of the foundation here - are substantially more stable now than they were at release and there is a clear 'feeling' of improvement over time.
---
Don't get me wrong, we are far from 'there'. I played D3 for 3k+ hours and if the servers would have been even half as unreliable as the FO76 ones have proven to be Blizzard HQ would have gone down in flames.
---
But there is improvement. And not just in this particular matter, just in general, things are better than they were.
---
That - at least to me - makes a huge difference. Seeing that there is a willingness to improve.
---
I alternate between scrapping and selling weapon loot. I am to the point now where I keep 10 or 20 of bulkable scrap in my inventory. When I exceed those numbers I begin selling scrap as well. High level super mutants carry Assult Rifles and Sharpshooter Assult rifles these sell for 6 - 11 caps per. 
---
Pretty much everything you pick up is at least 1 cap, weapons are usually 3 to 5 and get up toward 15.
---
FINALLY.
---
Which will be good, I don't do any pvp at all but I could see how it could make pvp very stale
---
Free relocation though!
---
Are the terminals limited time or are they in the shop permanently?
---
Absolutely. Wrecking ball perk should be awesome to remove camps in free-demo zones, it's essentially if you want to ruin others' game, be prepared to repair your own, everyone deserves to have some fun.
---
Ik, the sent cav and assassins sets need even more nerfs but this solid start
---
Marine wetsuit can. Road leathers. I forget what else.
---
I don't get it, they even said it that they will function, but now they take it back.   
---
So this whole new feature is pointless to every PA user, and every new update that comes to it in the future.
---
wait it can go under other outfits how did i not know this...
---
People get the fallout sub mixed up with the psychic sub I guess
---
Same as my name here. Sir Veyza
---
Base building, Bethesda, Kevin Costner jokes. Thanks Fallout for making today a little more special. Drive through for a hotdog some time.
---
Maybe they think time travelers are going back into their past, our present, to play “OG Fo76” like WoW players who just like playing the simpler Vanilla WoW.
---
You got a genuine LOL there. Thank you for that.
---
Is that salt he is holding? I'm sure there's potential with the good with salt perk.
---
I know this dude, it probably wasn't his hand.
---
Can this change in future please? I’d like to role play a post apocalyptic brewery and I don’t think I can do that and have space to play new quests etc with 800 stash. Even if the the vending machines had a separate stash limit of 200-400 I’d feel like I was In a better spot to do this.
---
I understand that having more than 800 storage per stash will stress server or console cpu loads etc. But if it were separate inventory no player could have both open at a time. Not sure if this helps as I don’t know the engine but if it’s something you guys can look at I’d be grateful :)
---
No no no because people can be mean back to poor lil u/thekame in survival. 
---
What he really means is what way is left to grief.
---
damn it! I best go do some chores then to make time go FASTER!!!!!! ;)
---
I get where you’re coming from but the workshops were always intended to come with some risks. There are a lot of resources concentrated in a small area. You can’t get decent gear without risking attacking high level enemies/areas ( in theory, remove the market from the equation for a second) which in turn comes with some risk. 
---
I’m really happy with the change to how pvp is initiated. If someone wants to take a workshop, great, go for it. At least now you don’t have the constant threat of getting insta-killed while you’re trying to talk to graham or something. 
---
Personally I think it’s a great compromise
---
This patch is so fucking awesome. So wow. Super bug fix. Much patching.
---
Not sure if it's bugged but I found my last 2 at 12 o'clock and 1 o'clock slightly outside the bubble if that helps.
---
yup, still wear it and visible beneath my leather pieces. I've been radiated so often it's melded to me now, like a moleman :)
---
You can but in the time it takes you’re better off just hitting west tek or something.
---
No, plague walker scales up if you have diseases. Whilst I don't do damage to creatures, they go hostile to me.
---
I'm okay with it if there's a lot of weapons
---
They can still spam melee attacks until you reciprocate, or a PA/mutation dmg affect procs.
---
I actually have about 2 dozen Mr. Fuzzies as well. That’s partly why my 290 estimation is so high. Counted the Fuzzies as well.
---
Of course. I just found BOS plans last night and thought free money. I cant have anything valueable.
---
O God, how much more ceramic plates do you wanna hold?
---
I'll believe it when i see it.
---
And, if you have a complex camp layout, the best thing that you can do is blueprint it in sections.  
---
My camps tend to be designed around the land where it sits because I like the design process.
---
If you ever have to rebuild your camp in the same spot, it’s highly unlikely that you be able to place the whole camp.  But you should have no problems rebuilding it in sections.  
---
Granted, most just build their camps off of a single set of stairs because they can plunk it down anywhere.  Which is perfect for when you are starting out and need to scrap often.  
---
But once you start building more complex structures you really should learn how blueprints work and start using them.
---
WTF I love the institute now
---
You jest, but...
---
They put out a roadmap for spring, summer and autumn of 2019.
---
The only detailed one is for spring, and while i am sure there is nothing the size of Nuka World currently in sight, there might be something in 2020.
---
Umm, that's not sweat...
---
No. Praise GODD.
---
Hot diggity damn is right
---
It only missing the 1% camp budget increase I need for the amazing new stuff I don’t have budget for 😂. 
---
Genuinely really excited about this patch.  Great job Bethesda on implementing the changes we all wanted to see!
---
I use to wear a shielded vault 76 jumpsuit, replaced it when I made my shielded vault university jumpsuit.
---
Generally complaining my dude. Clearly I wasn't directing this toward you.
---
Not armor pieces. Full outfits go over all armor and underarmor.
---
Spent about 30 mins (looking for my wallet, wife moved it on me) trying to find a reason not to go to work this morning, just so I could play the game once the patch was finished.  Unfortunately the wife told me where the missing wallet was when she saw me get the phone out to call the boss.  :(
---
Are Snallygasters no longer TAMEABLE for CAMPS if they're now removed from Pacify using Wasteland Whisperer ? AND are you going to look at fixing Tamed Pets because they vanish and then its server hop to get one again.. it could be better if Tamed Pets were like Brahmin with a related camp item they can tether too and be replaced/repaired.. Like a Dog Bowl that unlocks if we have a Dog currently tamed,,, we lose the Dog Bowl if we tame a Deathclaw and instead have a Deathclaw nest in place of the Dog Bowl.
---
we could hope, but i doubt it. it would be easy to just make a slightly different skin and sell that to the people who missed the original.
---
Yeah I am a rifleman build and I use a .50 hunting rifle. This will def be a welcome change.
---
Ha!! 
---
Sadly, you won’t be seeing me since I’m on Xbox. But I strongly recommend getting the Pharma Farma perk under the Luck stat up to level three . It lets you search containers for more chems, so soon you’ll have an abundance of stimpaks and other chems like radaway and disease cures.
---
Can we get an explanation of why the punch bowl was disabled, I thought that was the point of it, to not be sure of what you were drinking?
---
Lol, I cracked up at this. You made my morning 🤣🤣
---
People can come and poo on your bed....
---
Now it's fuck everybody, cause you'll still get one shot in PvP. The one set of armor that was effective, is not the issue. And its still the best, because no other armor affixes matter for shit in PvP.
---
Really hoping it’s mole miner gauntlet plans. I’m going to make bank if they are 😒
---
Yeah, saw that... Typical me, ask about stuff when it's no longer a problem... :s Still wonder though why thay did it in the first place. ;)
---
Does this game have text chat yet? still waiting on that before I jump back in.
---
Sounds like free mats to me
---
lmao yes! This would actually be awesome for my support character. I eat and heal for everyone on my team lol.
---
I also bought the vault tec power armour paint. All my builds from fallout 3,4 and this I have been a member of Vault tec tasked with buildi g a vault tec army and taking over the wasteland.
---
But honestly even if I was a low level I'd find it funny and all they have to do is fast travel back to their camps and they lose nothing (I've never had nuka shine put me right in the middle of combat. They seem to use peaceful spots for the random spawn points).
---
I think the vast majority of people aren’t/weren’t going to come big bad wolf and blow your camp away. In over 500 hours playing I had one 1 person shoot up my camp. If you have something you don’t want destroyed lock it in a room, not an entire camp. Or like I said stick out a bench and a box, I know those people use other camps to do this so why not do the same.
---
It’s all good.
---
Are the mailboxes a way to send items back to your camp. They talked about doing that when they announced repair kits.
---
i have been saving my atoms i might wait and see what this new patch gives us before i go and buy the bundle
---
They need to get money from somewhere XD
---
I am about to throw so much money so they can keep doing this. Fellow happy whales, feel free to join me!
---
Fallout community is awesome on Reddit...or least for PS4 so many great dwellers hooked me up with stuff they don’t need because of higher level. You would be surprised what a post could do to bring some quality items to enjoy the game better.
---
Oh that is absolutely huge.. I have been playing at half health since I got back into it and can't find radaway anywhere!! Can't craft it either
---
Fine and dandy. Who really cares. It's a damn video game. My excavator holds 200 extra lbs I can't hold out of power armor. So the back packs level the playing field for those that play without them.
---
Go play survival mode if you wanna be a dick thats why its there
---
Every single online rpg style game has "pve" builds/gear and PvP builds/gear. What your basically arguing is that pve builds/gear should compete with PvP..in a PvP situation. Its silly to think this way
---
Rather it be fuck everybody than oh this guy is literally invincible 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
Oh ok, well I mean it does make sense though. Maybe they'll release P.A storage unit mods in the future that could look like metal backpack instead of jetpack or stealth mod etc
---
2)
---
dont think this will do anything on the markets. they are still the most powerfull pve/pvp mods.
---
I will pay 750 atom for Dora backpack
---
My alternate account is named G_R_O_G_N_A_K_
---
I'm a bit excited for this one to day the least.
---
...then take the PA off if you want to use the backpack?
---
easy Dora
---
errr. you guys know that critical headshots just shread everything? Doesnt matter if the enemy has a good build or a full ass/sent set geeez
---
They will still one shot you. You better make that 25% count.
---
I think so too and honestly harmless. They can just fast travel back to their camp (or this point any public camp)  and they lose nothing.
---
There, there, it’ll be back.
---
What tf can you get on the fallout 76 black market that you can’t get on the fallout 76 bazaar.
---
People filled it with Vintage Nukashine, placed their camps close to the Vault 76 in the FOrest area and sent newbies travelling all over map, losing their junk in parts of the game where they could never reach it.
---
Fun for the prankster, less fun for the new people who lost all they had.
---
i keep as much ammo as i can physically find/craft for each type i use....always......
---
Out of interest, after 1,000 hours what is there left to do or get? Surely you have all the items and money you could want?
---
My personal favorite:
---
 **Weekly:** Corrected a Weekly Challenge timer that would have outlasted the inevitable heat death of our universe.
---
Yeah this is acceptable. Don’t have to keep everything open, just 2 bare essentials
---
Same here. I threw down a desk TV because it *sort of* looks like a computer monitor but if I can play holotape games on this one I'll die happy.
---
&gt; **Tracking Terror:** Fixed an issue that could cause Son of Fluffy to spawn as a legendary.
---
Damn, my CAMP is right next to his spawn point (was there before the new quests) and I always thought it was normal for him to be a low level legendary. I guess no legendary farming from him any more.
---
"literally invincible" is not and never was a thing.
---
U sure bored is the right word? Lol
---
That would be a good perk card to post too lol 😂
---
I agree. I can see not allowing the added carry weight but i have been waiting for the fridge.
---
Scrapped mine by accident...
---
Oh but why did they have to make like 90% of all backpack skins atomic shop only ?
---
I can’t find it...got a link?
---
Yeh I would to dude. You get alot of atoms ingame. I think from launch ive earnt around 9,000. Ive only spent around £20 in real money and i have alot of the items from the shop.
---
Also really happy about death not curing addiction anymore. It's going to make junkies so much less aggravating to use. I won't need a hundred mentats anymore.
---
Do you go to every new post just to copy / paste that "Easy Dora"?
---
I’d buy 500 .45 rounds for 500c, it’d save me some materials and last me for a week or so
---
I have no idea what you wrote. Maybe you should try using proper grammar and spelling, and then I could understand you insane twitter style rant.
---
I think one issue was that people would go around and drink everything out of peoples punch bowls. I filled mine with booze and it was empty in a couple hours. Pretty sure one dude drank it all.
---
Like you wash your sheets anyway ;)
---
I'm seriously considering altering one of my photo gallery pics to be this instead.
---
agreed. this is my role playing I guess..there's a ton of armours that are statistically better, but the leather just looks and feels nicer.
---
ive had my camp blown down several times. mostly from bored "PVP" Players. most of those times where when i left doors unlocked. so i built an outdoor scrap zone. still does not stop camp crushers.. at least before this patch
---
can you explain further what it is because i cant find it.
---
Its still the best armor and caps are easy to get, so I still expect them to go in the 20k range per piece tbh
---
I know that tiny succulents are kind of A Thing these days, but are potted cacti really that common a decoration in West Virginia?
---
Im gonna be hesitant to doing that still. Not sure how rewarding it’s going to be scrapping my legendaries when I can’t get something in return yet. For all we know the legendary vendor could be a bust like the weapon rewards in survival not being that great either
---
you mean the whole two times, with different phrasing?  eyeroll.gif
---
Yeah I do understand that just wished it wasn't so expensive to get these items. I'd be interested to know how much profit they've made on the atom shop.
---
Kill somone pit 300 dirty water in their bag
---
I think Bethesda claimed that they could have done crossplay but Playstation refused. It could have been added way back when they were developing the game but now they say it's too late to implement it.
---
Sent assassin cav nerf. Lmg is gonna be the new meta
---
A 'quadruple' double barrel is not bad. High damage and 8 shots instead of 2 makes a big difference.
---
Not everything but it's a start i guess. Hopefully what they write in the patch notes sre actually correct.
---
True, but you can't ignore the long periods of silence and pretty backwards mistakes. Lately it has all been up!
---
Yep, I've already edited it out. But thanks!
---
If you can’t stagger someone then yes they are “literally invincible”
---
I had an anti armor explosive handmade with tank killer yesterday. This ignores a whopping EIGHTY SIX PERCENT of armor. Mr dumbfuck OP assassins sentinel was taking a whopping ZERO damage per hit. Yeah no thanks, shit needs to be reduced to 8% for sentinel and 5% for assassins or completely removed.
---
My work benches are in a seperate building and open to everyone. 
---
My camp is by a river and has a cooking station. Get silly with the boiled water all you want.  
---
Howerver, my home is my castle and you are not a princess. Stay out.
---
Yep. When it drops below 999 it’s time to start farming.
---
I'm genuinely impressed in the absolute abundance of changes and improvements, all looking absolutely step in the right direction. 
---
I am so happy I can start selling all my useless 3* Legendaries and have actual stash space for important items. Backpacks, player vending, from an average Fo76 solo player with no online friends, this is really massive.
---
Also, my 3* Bloodied plasma gun just became a godly weapon.
---
I choked on my drink reading that one lol.
---
Build a fence or put up some turrets. I’ve seen 2 super mutants in my camp and that’s all I’ve ever seen. They only spawned when I fast traveled so no damage done
---
Bos
---
*laughs in Vanguard*
---
Protip: Don't pursue OP, broken builds. Shit always gets nerfed
---
Slap on some p/a, grab plenty of stimpacks and head for whiitesprings golf club, then the burrows and finally westec. You’ll have legendary items up the wazoo in no time.
---
I’d offer to run you through the areas myself but unfortunately I’m on Xbox.
---
How does high luck help?
---
I imagine you’re right. I think this shows that they could do even more adjustments with them later, depending on what happens with this change. They’re obviously watching it. I’ve never had an interest in these types of armors myself, just haven’t really cared.
---
Looks temporary
---
I occasionally sell some of my mutation syrems to friends to sell to other people as they play the game longer than I do, and I always laugh when he says he manages to get 750 caps for the Marsupial I sold him!
---
They went over this two inside the vaults ago
---
Down the drain. Be careful selling when you are near the cap limit
---
Hahaha overkill maybe
---
That would be hella cool
---
I find that hard to believe. I've seen two since launch. 
---
So, when are we banning high levels who one shot everything from whitesprings? Because they're a much bigger "problem". Or are we not doing that? Because we're hypocrites.
---
Why should power armor get special considerations? It already serves a function that no other armor can and it has its own unique mods. Its supposed to be a utility item, not your mobile home.
---
The refrigerator will be very nice. I thought having a permanent refrigerator in your camp would have been a bit more suitable.
---
Does the legendary scrip work like trading in caps? As in, will charisma/barter skills affect the amount of scrip you get for each item?
---
Your camp can't actually get destroyed permanently. Just damaged. You can repair it from your C.A.M.P. module. Or just move to a new location for a few caps and you can plop down everything at full health again.
---
Per individual item instance or per type of item? For example, if I have 100 stimpacks in my stash and am selling stimpacks, will I only be able to list 30 individual stimpacks, or will listing stimpacks mean someone could buy all 100 in my stash?
---
Whitesprings, west tek are good farming spots. Every lvl you can either increase one of your special points or pick a perk card. You don't need to choose a perk card which corresponds to the stat you increased. The higher your stats the more perk cars you can equip. Once you've picked a perk card you'll always have but you can equip and unequip it. For example you increase intelligence by 1 so now you have 2. Now you can either pick any perk card displayed. You could also pick a strength perk card. Each perk card has a lvl and if you have 2 lvl 1 intelligence perk cards and your intelligence is 2 then you csb equip them both. Hope this helps. Oh and also if you have 2 of the same perk cards you can combine them and make them one though this is permanent so watch out
---
Who knows maybe they will make a P.A torso mod for refrigeration? Fingers crossed 🤞
---
Its probably the keys thing. I fail to see how that's a big problem, but Bethesda might think otherwise
---
that's what i was asking. what is still good.
---
not sure if it was completely clear as its almost 2am and im waiting for the maintenance to finish
---
How cool would it be if you could leave MESSAGES on other players machines? 
---
Or.. maybe not.
---
Sooooooo many great changes.
---
You have to claim hoh and have a dependant under lvl 18
---
So reading this, I'm going to assume you're one of those soulless asshats who watches the map for people to take over workshops, then abuse that system to engage people in PVP, even though you don't want the workshop.
---
No. WE can. They might not.
---
A newbie who just got a few screws and spring to his name, holding on to his little junk for his life and having no camp yet dying in a far end of the game while not understanding whats going on might not  find it as funny. On several of the servers I been on people deliberate made camps close to Flatwoods and offered punch with Vintage Nukashine making new players lose what little they had. Some probably had not even learned about fast travel yet at that point.
---
Fun for the prankster. Not so much for a new player who has not even learned basic controls of the game yet.
---
You genuinely got downvoted for being honest. Anyone who played FO4 on PS4 knows vertibirds are something you save before using. As cool as it would be to travel around Appalachia in one I think there's a good reason it wasn't implemented.
---
My post is referring to post patch today when the sentinel effect only activates 75% of the time
---
As a heavy gunner, I can go through crazy amounts of ammo and I am constantly looking at my remaining stock. At least a half of my time in 76 is crafting ammo en masse. I try to keep my .50 cal above 9k, my 5mm above 2k for my gatling and 4k for my mini, .308 above 2k (it would be higher if they weren't so expensive), plasma core above 10 and fusion core above 20 (usually I restock around 15 and then push it up to 40).
---
Didn't they say you can bulk thing in vendor machines? Maybe ammo?
---
&gt; The Whitespring: C.A.M.P.s can no longer be built or placed near the Whitespring Golf Club.
---
Thank God. I hate those fucking camps.
---
Lots of good changes in this update!
---
Who downvoted me lol
---
Why does the game need to tax anything?
---
Sounds familiar... ;)
---
What next? "Ohh, here, a full AAE or TSE for 5k caps"- Game lacks of things to do, no problem. Instead of actually giving things to do, lets remove even more things to do.
---
Amazing photo
---
I know the pre-release access was staggered by platform and access to the xbox insider program, I was just teasing you a little.
---
But you take the risk of dissuading the player from buying your stuff.
---
That minigun skin and the responders pump action look good
---
&gt; The “Kill a Wendigo While Wearing a Clown Costume” objective no longer reappears on login after it has been completed.
---
Gonna miss that free 20 caps from every WS farming run....
---
Yeah, It should have started downloading an hour and a half by now. At this rate, no one will be playing until hours after servers are back up. What the hell bethesda.
---
What’s the difference? Sincerely curious
---
I’m expecting another version of monster mash except with candy and server hopping.
---
Really could be so much more, and a way to combat the duped items if you could slowly build up to your god rolls with effort and luck.
---
I’m honestly only scrapping 1-stars until I see how purveyor actually works.
---
• Gatling Gun: Gatling Guns that have the Sight Ring mod now fire more accurately down the sights.
---
its been 84 years...
---
I was fortunate enough to have a decent weapon and PA, so I started farming whitesprings nuke zones about L27.  
---
Not that it was easy then - died a few times during the learing curve - but it was doable.
---
Thats said, take you time, follow te questline(s).  You'll be taken to level appropriate areas (most of the time).  Learn the lore and enjoy the scenery.
---
I hope its fasnacht masks and not the rare ones.
---
This is kinda what I’m worried about. I’ve seen issues where randomly, an item even in a separate tab from what I’m working with will get selected and moved if I go to fast. Like in the fermenter, I’ll temporarily place some ammo in it before it kicks it back out. That may just be client/server sync and everything would be fine but the possibility that someone spamming buy could get stuff I didn’t intend to sell is why I’m not going to be an early adopter.
---
Same here but I did not see that mentioned anywhere in the patch notes...
---
But isn’t C.A.M.P. decorations supposed to be marking misc/junk items in your stash to be place-able? (typewriters, teddy bears, etc.)
---
While I can agree with you, the Devs do not. The experience for the new players are probably too important to them to be turned into Nukashine-roulette.
---
Harness, raider leathers, there's several items. It's all listed as under armor in the workbench.
---
Wow. The servers go down for less than two hours and we all go crazy with end of the world theories.
---
I run a TSE Gatling as my main and an executioner Explosive LMG as backup. The LMG  come out when i need to kill something(s) really quick. I can pop out of cover burst fire with it and go back and usually that's enough to kill a top level SM. Basically the DPS far exceeds the TSE Gatling. 
---
Since a good number of my legendary Runs gets me what i need for ammo, i can craft quite a bit every few days.
---
Aww granny! You gonna have to move!
---
Yeah I agree, that’s why I said I never mess with peoples camp. Sometimes when I do come across them I’ll check them out, leave a gift or 2 for them, scrap my stuff and then on my way.
---
I’m not going to destroy your stuff, kill your Brahman, masturbate in your bed and eat all your food.
---
Anybody know what does the the text say on the Responders shotgun? I can make out "First to the" but I can't figure out what the last word says. Fight?
---

\*hugs her Instigating Prime HR\* &lt;3
---
you don't say?
---
I spend 99% of the time in PA. I'm pissed.
---
not at all. I'm just saying I don't see them as the literal devil as most here seem to. at the end of the day, even with all that advantage, my 1\* handmade and power fist can take them down just as well.
---
you don't need to be stacked in order to be successful at pvp.
---
Agreed. I think they tried it slightly with the Asaultron recall cards
---
I built mine right beside the Train station. Nothing but benches.(weapon/power armor/armor) I loved the convenance of selling nearby. I didn't do turret farming( what ever that is) people would use my came all the time and I liked it. Going to miss building there.
---
Level 375 with 6 level 60 - 120 alts. You're not alone.
---
I'm pretty bummed that the backpack won't work with power armor, but honestly, with the addition of the legendary vending machines, I'm going to be swimming in freed up storage space, haha.
---
&gt; Nukashine: Several new “Wake-Up” locations have been added to Nukashine.
---
Time to get drunk!
---
Have you tried restarting the launcher? Mine's downloaded already
---
It isn’t. It’s a great patch.
---
Is there a good place I should add the Gatling laser/plasma dissappearing ammo bug that's been driving me crazy recently? Id like to be sure i get it in the right place and I'm new to reddit. Thanks!
---
I didn't have a camp there. Mine is near Charleston.
---
From the data mine post, it looks like it's going to be a tall, standing terminal like you use to register for the responders in the first quest.
---
it's not always like that, trust me. A glowing legendary mole rat will tear the guts out of your camp in minutes and all someone has to do is walk by for mobs to spawn.  More doors will probably be unlocked due to today's patch, but I'm not the only player to get attacked from behind when repairing something at a workbench by something that just sauntered through the unlocked door.
---
The cost of scrapping and rebuilding my bed made me end up losing mats, but I get what you are saying.
---
Ill add everyone when im feeling better. I had bad sushi and now feel like i need a few stimpacks.
---
At this point the daily vendors reset isn't no longer problem. If we started to be able to remember all 7 reset times, remembering 1 isnt problem and even if you don't remember. They all share same cap pool, so....
---
adding a /s can help XD I got your joke though!
---
Are the servers back up?
---
News to us all!  Last week it was, anyway.
---
workshops yes, camps no.
---
/s or?
---
Or the toons going fro 1 to 50 in like 30 minutes
---
Luck of the draw. I saw 2 up until about a month ago, now there is one there every day. Not the same one either.
---
Maybe lol haha
---
What was so bad about people camping at the golf course? Or are you being sarcastic?
---
Bloodied
---
And the whining babies who fail to understand PvP mechanics, yet somehow think they have the knowhow to dictate changes to PvP, should be flayed alive and dipped in lemon juice. Then rolled in salt.
---
I understand the frustrations with this gear, and I think the nerf was not a bad thing to be honest. But even pre nerf I never had an issue killing people with this gear, it's as simple as 1 or 2 vats headshot Crit. And if you build perks for PvP/vats damage, vats criticals are a dime a dozen and deadly. Like any other game, this results in certain weapons being more effective in PvP, such as a handmade vs a heavy gun. (Handmade will almost certainly be better for PvP). You just need to build your character for the current PvP meta if you want to reliably compete. With this in mind I don't foresee power Armour or rocket launchers being meta anytime soon :/
---
Look at the clown shoes selling it on flea-bay... and people actually buy it. I’ll wager over half those that do are train station spawn shooters.
---
Golly gee ladies, those little things which make the PVP world so enjoyable for the masses - or nawt. 
---
Harvesting numbers with exploits and extremely difficult to find if not completely unaffordable by anyone who doesn’t live in their grandparents basement. Ridiculous mostly duped OP gear and little player merit. Yeah, you’re cool. Hard pass.
---
Because, you know, it just doesn't make sense to toss a bag on the GIANT FUCKING MECH that's powered. Nah, you get that carry weight boost \_bareback only\_ because some dev at the company lost his one fucking functional brain cell.   
---
Most of the patch notes make me cringe if I'm honest.
---
Frickin' finally!
---
If you go to this site you'll get it I think;  [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks)
---
Worth nothing is when you level up and choose a special point, you can freely choose a card in the other specials, if you use the filter (z,c on pc)
---
People were  building turret farms which fucked it for other players
---
You got any neon letters?
---
Agree, tested it out with buddy last night, outline becomes harder to make out and you become more clear or less blured.
---
The difference is negligable, but there.
---
I think it depends where it is yeah. I have my camp in the mire and never any trouble. I get people rarely but when I do take what you’d like. Half the time I don’t even take it because my stash is always packed and I don’t need it
---
I keep seeing by people say extractor and I’m level 60-70 and I still have no idea what you are talking about. Care to explain for me?
---
Why would you assume that? I have literally never done this, ever. 
---
Grow the fuck up.
---
Yeah it's been fixed 😎
---
its going to be like this all day...
---
sploosh, says my sniper
---
Not going to lie, this was A LOT of cool shit. How to afford it all..
---
I confirm, was claiming a workshop for a challenge and some guy fast traveled, one shot my ass, took my junk and *poof* away just after...
---
Thats the problem with things like this.
---
&gt;I'm not reading that but I probably disagree.
---
That's not a good way to make any informed decision.
---
Maintenance usually lasts until it's over
---
Backpack invisibility mod would be lovely
---
Does make them more killable though.
---
I was wondering if I’m in a event or like killing legendaries in white spring, does everyone get the loot from the body? Or only the first person who takes it? Thanks.
---
Right now getting caps is easy.  You get it by doing events, killing mobs, and selling to vendors.  The number of caps in the entire game world continues to rise.
---
The more caps in the world, the less worth they have.  Why do I want your 10k caps for my weapon I am selling?  I already have 25k on two characters!
---
If Bethesda does not take out some of those caps, and the global amount of caps continues to rise, caps will be worthless.  With this 10% tax, they are taking out some of the caps.  That paired with fast traveling and buying things from NPC vendors will take out some of the caps.
---
Nope. You're not "choosing to PVP". You're choosing to run a workshop. People abusing that mechanic to murder you is griefing. 
---
Especially if they don't _need_ to kill you to take the workshop. 
---
If you're not planning on actually running the workshop, you're a griefer. If you're going to abuse the mechanic by having a team member challenge the workshop then kill the guy at a distant location when it's not needed, you're a griefer. 
---
I'll grudgingly admit that with the system as it exists, killing someone actively in the workshop is a valid non griefer move, if you legitimately want the workshop. 
---
If you're killing non-pvp players just for the luls in adventure mode, you're a fucking griefer.
---
ok those of you who do the image datamines please either stop doing so or consult with someone who datamines the actual data files. You are getting a lot of things wrong. Mailboxes are not utility items they are just floor decor
---
Really? Hit an instance with a low level farming half way through and this has always been good for me.
---
I thought wooden armor sucked ass just like you but legendary max lvl wooden armors are pretty decent imo. It's cheaper than dirty water when it comes to repairing it
---
Maybe it depends on plattform and time, but i can ensure you i've seen those camps every day. Banning people for one-shotting enemies? This sounds insane. It's one thing to prevent people from ruining the fun in game by making it at least harder for them. But to ban someone for being good in this game (or for spending way to much time in it\^\^) just isn't reasonable in my opinon. And to be honest, even suggesting such a harsh action seems very strange.
---
True
---
That is exactly what I'm glad to be stepping away from for a hot sec.
---
They'll be back up when they're back up. I'd say the average downtime has been 4-6 hours.
---
I'll go to the Excelsior Model home like I do every day first thing.  Then, I'll check to see if AWOL is up.  Then, I'll move on to the next stuff.
---
I'm sure this is petty but I think we should still get the buffs in power armor. They said that it would, miscommunication or not they want us to "run and gun" more and spend less time in bases/ crafting tables. Maybe if we find a way to monetize it they'll keep their word. Smh
---
It's right there in the post:
---
&gt; **Weapons:** Plasma Gun projectile visual effects now correctly appear to start from the barrel of the weapon when viewed by another player.  
---
&gt; **Weapons:** Plasma Gatling and Plasma Gun projectile visual effects have been restored.
---
This is a great patch, and all of these changes are good to hear. 
---
Anyone salty about the legendary armor changes, or explosive fix, have the wrong viewpoint about a multiplayer online game with PvP elements.
---
Sure, I have cav/sent pieces that I should've sold pre-nerf, but am I upset about that? Absolutely not, I'm just happy that this will help mitigate everyone running around with a copypaste build.
---
Sorry to direct tag, but you guys have been doing good work, and it's not your fault that marketing got so fucky at launch.
---
Dudes with weapons playing the game actually attempting to hit shit is different than an automated death factory slowly fucking you in the ass without lube on.
---
Even if the servers weren't down, you're supposed to complete a series of quests in order to gain the lowest level backpack. If anybody has a backpack immediately upon logging in after the update, then I would be highly suspect.
---
I said golf course.
---
It's the Whitestone golf course.
---
You're thinking g of resort.
---
Thats nice dear.
---
L26 is that area between learning the ropes and having a powerful character. (too strong for the forest, to weak for the divide)
---
There are many things to do to keep yourself occupied and entertained on your way to L50.
---
Mysteries quest - its a multi-part quest with increasing rewards after completing each part.
---
Roses quest - again a multi-part challenge with a nice reward.  It'll take you all over the map.
---
Excavator quest - this will give you the plans for excavator armor.
---
Wild Willies quest - its just fun, with a nice weapon as a reward.
---
I think you accidentally a word.
---
I’m excited to be scared lol
---
I’ve only participated in PVP on a few occasions, in response to people having a crack at me, but from what I’ve noticed 
---
1. Power Armor isn’t good for PVP. 
---
2. Build is king. Wasting perk spots on things like item durability or picklock weakens you 
---
3. PvP in fallout is a 5 second who gets the jump wins kind of affair. If you’re not expecting it, you’re probably going to lose and lose quickly 
---
I could be wrong and maybe I just haven’t happened across sent/assassins builds, but there’s a few people in the 100+ range who are explicitly interested in pvping who I seem to stack up against fine when I’m not surprised by them 
---
Happy for alternatives
---
You on PS4?
---
Yeah, this was a really good idea and I don't think I've seen this specific solution mentioned before.  We frequently asked to reorder the fast travel so that you wouldn't go through all the prompts before seeing the "You can't fast travel" message.
---
I hope you aren’t lieing
---
It's all about the springs. I had a guy try to sell some to me for 38 caps a spring? I sell them for like 3 caps each
---
Turn off your vending machines when you get close?
---
the backpacks are like packs that go on your back. and they hold stuff.
---
servers are still down until further notice.
---
I don't use PA because it feels too clunky. So I'm glad that finally there is something for me in this game!
---
It doesn’t say, but I imagine if you go to the WS Resort you can find the one. I would assume the BoS bot is the one it will be.
---
If you pay real money for in-game items you are a dumbass
---
it's a case of same difference, really. not to mention that, at least here in Fo76, whales/rmters are more or less on the same ground when it comes to competitiveness.
---
I’ve been stashing a max lvl junkies black powder and crolator for just this moment.
---
this guy Scientific Methods!
---
Get rid of my useless 3\* legendries...… got around 200 of them, check if adding a 4th star will give more scrips at the legendary vendor machine, set up a vending machine and sell all the aid items I've been hoarding
---
Oh ok sorry
---
Stop wasting my time by not answering the question
---
Hahaha cry some more
---
I hope so
---
A whole bunch a datamining and amazing patch notes, and these are the two things I am most excited about lmao
---
You must have been one of those "cool" professors in college. You know the one at all the parties!
---
This is a meme
---
It would be like the tshirt canon at basketball ganes..e eryone beating the hell out of eachother for a desk fan
---
Did you crit him in the head? Did you shoot him over and over to try to get stagger? Did you use grenades or a weapon with radiation?
---
How about you shut up and do some fucking research into PvP before acting like you know what you're blathering?
---
Also 500 damage is low.
---
Whar is the carry weight of them
---
Yes! Every single one. Never have I felt the need to be in Power Armor all the time except in the final hours of Fallout 1. Made my slave in 3 live in it cause she was always dying. Only used it during one play through of New Vegas, and simply hoarded them in 4 for my collection.
---
I'll show up anyway.
---
From what I know, you can't use VATS on players that are crouching, even you walk up behind them.
---
I missed this reading the notes. FINALLY!!
---
Me too. And I've been there since I started this whole shindig. 
---
I bet we are safe though. It's pretty far from the clubhouse.
---
If you stay in pacifist that’s no problem though right? I kinda love it when people do that to me. Just sitting there wasting their time. I’ll stop what I’m doing and toss a couple emotes at them then go get a drink or a snack or something and let them get it out of their system.
---
Lmao very delicious. Finally
---
All great advice, thanks a bunch fellow Wanderers!
---
So we know you have bought stuff given your strong defense of player selling in game items for real world money. Get fucked
---
Yeah I’m sure they will.
---
This. I'm just waiting for the backlash if the vendor comes out and scrip with worth far less than people assumed. I'll cash in the junk ones I already have this week, but won't ditch anything decent yet.
---
It's not in these patch notes here... but in the Patch 9 Preview they posted last week:    
---
&gt; When others hover over your C.A.M.P. on the map, they’ll see your name and player icon, as well as the number and types of items you have marked for sale.
---
I am mostly going to be selling Fasnacht plans for people who missed the event, so I am guessing I won't really be competing with lots of other traders.
---
Good luck fellow trader!
---
Unfortunately the game engine is not really designed for that kind if use. It's a real shame
---
The conduits are finicky, you have to kind of change the wall to a doorway then change back kind of thing but it’s much nicer aesthetically 
---
(I don’t have the advanced connectors so not sure if that’s different)
---
Huh, never thought of that but it makes a good point.  I was thinking about how much everyone is hoarding and it makes sense they have to plan for that.
---
I thought it was odd when they first said it would. As is the glorious excavator master race can't lift enough already.
---
Yes. But it takes a crazy amount of weight out of your box in the meantime.
---
I have mine modded to shielded for the huge over all stat bonus. I rolled some terrible mutations trying to get the ones I  wanted and the shielded helps me balance that out.
---
Lmaooo, thanks for the reminder of one of the best scenes ever
---
The real question is, why would people pay $400 and up? Stupid.
---
He was endgame and very clearly bored out of his mind.
---
Good point.
---
Hello :) Come on in and take a seat by the camp fire my filthy amigo. Enjoy your stay! I'd amend your 'flair' to state what system you have the game on :)
---
Theyre great. You wear them on your back, they attach with these straps. You can also put things in them. Like a gun or a pencil or some lunch.
---
If people did pay 400 Dollars, I have 400 examples on how a fool and their money can be separated
---
Depends. You talking about workshops? You should only be in PVP if you both want to fight over the workshop. Otherwise take the damn thing and leave me be. I only wanted to get a couple of camp plans from it.
---
Someone contested a workshop of mine for half a second or something in adventure mode, travelled and found me, shot me in the back while I was fighting a group of super mutants. Then shot up my power armour while I was dead. That person is a turd. They had no intention fighting people fairly or they'd be in survival if they weren't such a bitch. If they genuinely wanted to contest the workshop, why did they shoot me, destroy my armour and server hop?
---
not to mention I'm pretty sure each mod will calculate separately. so the chance someone will actually deal full damage to a sentinel/cavalier is almost nil.
---
There are also challenges specific to other PVP stuff, like Survival. Do you want Survival to completely change to accommodate you?
---
Maybe use some tactical deduction. That's how you deal with that. You're part of the problem. The ignorant casuals that think they know PvP.
---
Its like every online game - everything eventually gets nerfed until the game dies
---
I love this
---
lolllll
---
One possibility no one has brought up yet is maybe it will be random, like Diablo 2 gambling. You select an item type and the number of stars you want, buy it, and you get random effects.
---
Me personally, I have all necessary amenities outside my structure, including crops, purified water, stash, and benches. I even have posters hanging that invite people to make themselves at home. 
---
And no I don't use other people's camps, I respect their space, but if I were inclined to stop and scrap at someone's camp then a locked door would be a clear message that I shouldn't do it at that camp. I would move on.
---
It just means that 25% of shots will now actually get through, meaning my legendary minigun is now more deadly against them
---
Hopefully they activate it again. I created an extra place with a free drinks sign to place it, filled with Nukashine. That was funny.
---
My punch bowl...😢
---
I worked so hard on my post telling you people to take only one and what? It was for nothing?😖
---
Oh well at least pvp got sorted out! Get stuffed losers!
---
Yeah. They discussed it in earlier patch notes, and since the mailboxes are in utility with the personal computer, and punch bowls instead of decorations, Im guessing its happening.
---
Imagine this happening; every star on universe is extinguished, life went extinct a while ago in whole universe but "weekly" challenges still have a couple of million years to end
---
Well Canned Meat no longer has durability so you can sell those and Fasnatch donuts I guess.
---
great arguments, completely debunked my case
---
Its what you pay to a Automatic system. The caps sink need to exist somehow for the good of the game economy. If you are adding 10% to your items you are likely selling less than normal
---
Yeah, that's unfortunate. I'm guessing it will be reverted once they notice all the unintended problems this causes.
---
Right, you'd also still be able to transfer whichever item you received for the scrip, so not the end of the world.
---
So i can actually finish the nuka shine quest now?
---
Hail Sithis
---
They also never added calibrated leg armor but no one's complaining about that.  Deep pocketed x5 is the same as one calibrated pa leg, so perhaps this is an effort to bring the non pa builds in line?  There are a few situations that require pa like nuke zones, but no situations that require you to not be in pa... except maybe swimming?
---
[https://imgur.com/p3EBWdH](https://imgur.com/p3EBWdH)
---
its called antiseptic
---
So you want backpacks and refrigerates in Power Armor? What's next, you want a toilet in there too?
---
PA has less effects that affect combat than normal legendary armors. Only armor stats are better. And we have more restrictions, like negative effect of sneaking, unable to swim, need for fusion cores as fuel etc etc. You can have 5 different legendary effects on your non-PA armors to fit your style and combat situations. Be that pvp or what not. PA has very limited effects like this.
---
No, they'll sell 30 items that you've marked for sale from your Stash.
---
You gotta be careful of what you're selling, then
---
And they are breaking so many rules. Pretty much every game is against real world trading specifically because it is someone else profiting off a game developers hard work.
---
There are lots of things that are people's choices. Doesn't mean it is a good choice or they should have made that choice. Because I'm pretty sure if I made the choice to cough in your face or cut you in line you would have something to say and that it was my choice wouldn't be a valid argument.
---
percentage change that a specific skill will trigger when crafting is significantly higher when luck is higher.
---
That ur pickup line for all ur nerd students...while u play ginuwine pony in background
---
Backpacks giving you benefits while you are in a PA feels a bit awkward. Maybe Bethesda could add something for PAs if that becomes a balance issue but so far, I have no problem with backpacks not working when you are wearing PAs. IMMERSION
---
It’s gonna be a buyer’s market at first. Stash liquidation is going to be real. Prices will rise as time advances. Look on FO76 bazaar for going prices on items you’re trying to sell, or a comparable item, and then go left or right from that price.
---
I'm happy you liked it and were pleased with the quality! I thought the print on demand site did it pretty well, glad I decided on that spiral binding too.
---
It’s fun to read the people overreacting after a patch. 
---
Today has been particularly good.
---
A very good point. Thank you!
---
Geez. Someone farms
---
That firefighter gear looks great, especially the red and yellow excavator skin.
---
If they made some more legendary farming spots in Watoga it would compete with WS. Right now WS is just so central and easy to farm legendaries.
---
You'll be fine. It states specifically the golf club. Train station and rest of Whitespring, the greens etc., should be fine to build on.
---
You can still become wanted. Just lock pick something that doesn’t belong to you. And there’s still opportunities for pvp in adventure. There’s just checks and balances now. But I do agree with what was said in the comment above. If you want to grief and pvp unhindered, play survival.
---
I'll let you hold mine if I can hold yours.
---
It's as simple as scrapping a wire!
---
We'll just have to make sure we never have more stuff for sale than caps we can hold.
---
I am betting that the best stuff just stays item for item trading only.
---
Not that close. Mine is near the lake beside the Charleston fire dept, west of the Pylon Ambush Site.
---
Don't forget the actual lawn.
---
i’m sorry i didn’t make the game
---
I didn't even think about the fact the servers are still down. When do they come back up?
---
Thanks. Didn't think of that. Btw. If  I'm wanted their turrets will make their camp vulnerable.  I hope
---
it is against Bethesda's ToS to pay real world money for in game content.
---
so if you actually paid for anything, you are an idiot. and if you paid $400, I think you need to be medically diagnosed
---
So you are going to have less sells
---
Never mentioned you specifically, just those who abused the broken design.
---
gg
---
Look at Fallout 76... out here giving us great patches and new content (for free). I played so much that I kinda got burnt out, but I'll definitely be logging in soon to check out the game after these last few patches. Nice!
---
I mean I’ve had it for a bit, the problem I have is you need assasin sent to compete in pvp, but then it just gets patched like tse and now shotguns and sent armor.
---
Just wish they’d do it right the first time
---
slightly annoying, but I feel it is worth the trade off. My personal take.
---
Farm nuked flora. inert flux is a great water source that is easier to carry stacks of.
---
 You have to know a few things. I have seen 57 a tick from the chainsaw and that's devastating. 
---
 I love my knives too much to run a V Fast weapon but I have played with them. The biggest problem is how fast they degrade.
---
I understand the math ,but this will make the vending machines useless as carefree devices.
---
You're going to be off selling the 'old way'.
---
No tax ,no loss of items for zero profit.
---
Player vending machines were supposed to make life easier ,not mmore work.
---
I wasn't talking about the packbacks lol thats a good thing -_-
---
I said it before and ill say it again. This is what happens when you let non Watogans into the city! These illegal citizens blow up cars, destroyed all the legendary robots and some of them shot up the school. We need to send those Vaulters back west where they came from.
---
I miss the days everybody would just discover new content together. Datamines ruin the mystery for me 😑
---
Yes! I can finally not be on edge when I’m away from my camp!
---
Add the ability to shoot the mounted minigun and it's perfect.
---
All is fun and games until it flies through a nuke zone and you dont have power armour on XD
---
Well, God rolls for you maybe... RNGesus hates me, so I am guessing I will re-roll Stalkers-traits time after time on all my melee weapons until I run out of Scrip.
---
For the first 50 levels, you assign points to each attribute, and select/assign perk cards. More points in an attribute == more perks. 
---
After level 50 you can select a new perk card, or not take a new card and instead move a point from one attribute to another. 
---
You may want different perk cards active for different circumstances. For example, I might unequip “Green Thumb” (get 2x plants when harvesting) in order to assign “Picklock” if I need to pick a level 1 lock.
---
people with their parent's credit card
---
Exactly I'll never have more value in my shop than what will net me max caps
---
Really want a combat shotgun skin
---
&gt; The only reason to still use Power Armor is for a heavy weapon build that uses stabilized
---
Which by the way, will now be more deadly against people using their god teir armor since it will now only function 75% of the time, a minigun will be getting a lot of rounds past that armor
---
It was favorite place on the map, and they nerfed it. Now its just kinda sad.
---
From what I've noticed now teams of high-level players are going after grifters. What sense would it make attacking someone's camp or causing a problem if you're only going to die soon anyway.
---
Lmao, you can still form a train of enemies to attack bases. This just made that method even easier to accomplish with no drawbacks.
---
Yes it’s all over
---
When they are ready apparently, they don’t give a timeline or ETA. But from what I’ve seen people say 1-3 hours from previous experience.
---
Bethesda just needs to add a bulk ammo crafting option just like we do with crafting materials, then we can buy/sell ammo sub-1 cap/round.
---
I figured that's why the vendors almost never sell ammo like 5mm, and also don't buy ammo from players at all because the price would be too high for certain types, so they just killed off selling  ammo to vendors all together. But if you bulk 100x 5mm you could buy them for 25c and sell them for 4-5c at vendors for example, and the economy wouldn't get out of whack.
---
Bulk ammo is truly the solution to several problems.
---
good bot
---
Well then, let's give non-power armor the same massive resistances, durability and fall damage reduction.
---
Don't you get that one for scrapping hunting rifles?
---
I just want a bos insignia on the chest, is that so much to ask for?
---
I’ve actually never had my camp destroyed lol
---
It was changed
---
THIS MADE ME SO HAPPY
---
Yes. Game is shutoff thanks to you.
---
*”Note: Our previous article on backpacks stated that they would remain functional while wearing power armor. This was incorrect and we apologize for the miscommunication.”*
---
**[weeps softly]**
---
I’m also under the impression that with a 10% tax, you can only sell items for a bare minimum of 10 Caps since 8.9 Caps, 7.8 Caps and so on would either lead to abuse of the Caps rounding up to the nearest whole number which would completely ignore the 10% tax or rounding down to the nearest whole number, costing you an extra cap in the process of the bug occurring
---
&gt; I'll admit, I stopped playing 3 months after release because I just felt unfulfilled when playing. 
---
Have you thought that maybe you have a problem with your precious bodily fluids?
---
I first became aware of it, u/Gaelic_Platypus, during the physical act of love... Yes, a profound sense of fatigue, a feeling of emptiness followed. Luckily I — I was able to interpret these feelings correctly. Loss of essence. I can assure you it has not recurred,  u/Gaelic_Platypus. Women, er, women sense my power, and they seek the life essence. I do not avoid women,  u/Gaelic_Platypus... but I do deny them my essence.
---
There's been a few things that have been data mined that have yet to go on sale. The riders of the apocalypse skins were data mined months ago but only just came out
---
Build new camps, check reddit if i can scrap legendaries, scrap legendaries, check reddit if backpacks work, get backpack, check reddit if PVP  work, go on survival,
---
Yes and no, if a 'sorry' emote came out the same day I could go with that. Both of them have been asked for since the BETA, so they got it half right :P
---
I guess so.
---
\*gasssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssp\*
---
Yep, permanently lmao.
---
Nah, they'll be back up in a bit, it's patch day man.
---
Yes. They are shutting the game down forever.
---
Tuesday is always patch day. Check the other posts.
---
Inert flux ftw
---
I love these posts. All I've wanted since I started playing was to open up a shop and not have people destroy my camp just for fun. Now they can't, in theory, and the salt is hilarious. Go be griefers together in survival, pick on someone your own size.
---
So attacking people who are willing to attack back is boring, but messing with people who don't or can't fight back is fun?   
---
Thats some sniveling cowardly behavior right there.
---
I just think that there needs to be some sort of danger in adventure mode. Survival is barely playable with the horrible server issues
---
Yessss. Some kind of surreal mash-up of Busby Berkeley choreography with Clockwork Orange violence.
---
Plague doctor mask looks nice
---
What kind of question is that?
---
I mean, when you log in it literal tells you "we took the servers down for maintinance". Plus you would have had to update your game before even being able to open it.
---
Hope u got to play before. #sad
---
Lol was this all just a dream?
---
this is my only argument.
---
why can't my power armor have a food cooler?
---
I dont mind if people take them, I only minded the PvPing on them when I was sat at my base and an intruder broke into my home and killed me half a map away from my workshop
---
Yeah that's 100% of the reason i pop them in pvp all the time. So i cant be vats'd. Otherwise i stand zero chance as a melee build. I don't really care for the invisibility part. 
---
My buddy and i are pretty equally skilled in the game, hes bloodied sniper and I'm melee tank, and after pvping each other for fun, it was clear that i couldn't possibly kill him even once when he could use vats and crits. Like no chance. If they removed stealth boys from the game, bloodied snipers would dominate all other builds. It would be objectively "the best." His perception is like 20+ all the time. He always sees me first, and uses long ranged weapons with auto aim and crits will just ignore my build and armour perks.
---
Sometimes it just, doesn't, work.
---
Isn't that a good thing?
---
Ya but you have to be able to access the munitions factory workshop workbench thing to contest it. If you barricade the entrances it’s impossible to contest
---
*Heads to eBay for some black friday deals.
---
Jesus crust the tin foil suit
---
Yeah, I do.
---
A common theory is that this isn’t a bug, and we will continue the quest in added content down the line.
---
There are tent plans.. (shit)
---
I see what you did     .
---
It was fun while it lasted.
---
Since I'll be heading to bed soon (Kinda late in Australia), I'll be browsing other players shops to see what they're selling and get an idea of what people are likely to purchase.
---
Your the last one to find out but it’s been all over the news apparently they are scrapping all fallout and elder scrolls games and shutting down for good. Elder scrolls online is safe tho.
---
Dude, it’s scrapping a wire. You’re just tryin to bitch.
---
I missed this one but I'm laughing my fucking ass off
---
Be happy.....lol
---
Then don’t use it?
---
Mate... I walk round most of the time with locksmith still equipped because I forgot to put my rifleman perks back on after picking a lock... how am I supposed to remember to do that? It's an obvious fault with the game that should've been sorted since day one with the fact you lose caps trading. If you don't have space for caps then the trade shouldn't go through. The same way it does with vendors.
---
Go to someone's camp and buy something
---
You can use AA weapons if you want to break away from having to use the Anti-Armor perks, since up to a point most armor penetration isn't needed.
---
Simple math. I have 19,000 in caps currently. There is the potential to make 400-1k on any route that I currently run (including events and such). I can get 1400 from vendors. 25,000-19,000-1,000-1,400=3600. Don't list anything (I mean total vending stash) for more than that and you have no issue. 
---
As far as cap limit. Buy stuff.
---
Either way I'm satusfied with this update, looks like they addressed a lot of issues here and currently, my alt levels have decreased
---
&gt; but this will make the vending machines useless as carefree devices.
---
Vending machines are not carefree devices. They consume stash space to store things for sale that could be used for other things.
---
Plus if you are unaware of what your cap count is at shame on you.
---
I bailed early when this game seemed doomed. I've lurked and lurked. Hoping to jump back in, starting from scratch, when things are better. What's your opinion? Is it time for the lurkers to wade back in?
---
I did for a while, but the damage sucked.
---
Definitely a troll.
---
I can't remember based on the map as it was my first time exploring south in-depth. 
---
I believe it was wither Welch or Lewisburg. The house has a destroyed first floor with a ramp to a second floor survivor living space that bridges across two building roofs.
---
It's really dark. I had to take a short break after reading and watch some comedy because of the feels.
---
If there are armor sets selling for 30k+ I would have to disagree
---
Experience, bethesda devs can try as they want, but because time stress they make accidental mistakes with every patch. Better find here, than have charracter without pip-boy for example. 
---
Anyway this patch could save name of FO76. And it seems that team working on it settlet up. There is so much changes, oh i am sooooo exited!
---
lolz the dumb fuckers forgot that nukashine was a thing and had to disable the punch bowl they created like a week ago.
---
The real kicker is when you see it in the vendor's inventory for the full 200. Almost like we're dealing with a pawn shop...
---
im suggesting re-rolls are going to award a lot of walking canes haha
---
*Too
---
This thread being down voted is fucking hilarious. This sub is pathetic.
---
There are benefits in both play styles. But Bethesha just decided that all the work PA people have put into their characters and builds arent good anymore. They decided that sorry those guys over there can have new cool additions to the game and those guys over there dont.
---
All of the Forest/Parts of the Savage Divide. And Cranberry Bog if you like red grass.
---
Ah nice
---
But if you're at max caps what's the difference?
---
I've been looking forward to this as an alternative to the bloodied build. Now if only I could find a decent Junkie legendary...
---
Does your mum still wipe your bum?
---
Yeah. So does the Gauss get energy perks and rifle perks or how does it work?
---
oh oh oh! Are you PS4??
---
UGH STILL NO HANDMADE ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME? YOU'RE FUCKING TELLING ME ITS THE BEST PATCH AND THERE'S NO FUCKING HANDMADE STILL? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ARE YOU KIDDING ME? ARE YOU ACTUALLY KIDDING ME? ARE YOU ACTUALLY FUCKING KIDDING ME? UGH FUCK. OMG I CANT EVEN WITH THIS DEV ANYMORE UGH FUCK. THERE ISN'T EVEN HANDMADE IN THIS FUCKING PATCH ITS A FUCKING DISGRACE OMG. OMG I CANT. OMG. I CANNOT EVEN OMG. ITS HONESTLY SICKENING. I MEAN IT'S 2019 AND THEY THINK THIS FUCKING SHIT IS FUCKING OK? ARE YOU SERIOUSLY FUCKING KIDDING ME WITH THIS RN? UGH OMG FUCK I CANT EVEN WITH THIS RN. I CANNOT EVEN HANDLE THIS. WHAT A CROCK OF SHIT. UPDATE MY FUCKING ASS. FUCK. IT HONESTLY FEELS LIKE BETHESDA IS LITERALLY RAPING ME WITH THIS UPDATE RN. IM LITERALLY PULLING OUT MY EYELASHES OVER HERE AND BETHESDA IS JUST RAPING ME. HOW IS THIS OK? HOW IS THIS SICKENING WHITE PATRIARCHAL RAPE CULTURE OK IN THIS GAME? OMG. SIGH. FUCK. FUCKING DESPICABLE.
---
You're both wrong: PRAISE ATOM.
---
It was. Why else is there a day 1 perk relating to CAMP damage?
---
Sorry, hold on, tamed animals in our camps? Did I miss something?
---
thank you
---
Yes. But it's just one plan I believe
---
Inventory yes, but the slots seem to be different. It says slots can be for individual items or stacks. 
---
Also my other reasoning is what would be the point of having 4 vending machines in a camp if they all have the same 30 items in them...
---
But as I said it could go either way and we will find out soon enough
---
Still got my butthole.puckered! I've probably spent 3 or 4 hours fixing it up for visitors last night :)
---
Like making the calibrated shocks mod available without 2348739 server hops?
---
What under armor affect strenght??
---
Here's my view on it. Who cares? My vending machine will cater to low levels and I'll continue to sell the real expensive stuff on forums like I have been.
---
This is why I watch Oxhorn as opposed to other Fallout content creators on Youtube. I know there was that controversy a while back, but to me he is the most objective Fallout Youtuber. He plays Fallout 76 the same way I do: To complete the quests, discover any new lore, and have fun along the way. He hasn't bought a single atom from the shop and runs with Excavator PA lol Also, he does complain about normal things in the game like server instability and random bugs. But he doesn't go ape shit everytime Bethesda nerfs a weapon or armor class which is refreshing lol
---
You ever accidentally sell one of your best guns, only to have to back out and pay 300% more for it? Feels bad.
---
It depends on what you're looking for.  It has been vastly improved since the beta.  They've added a lot of stuff, and server stability has been pretty solid (I've crashed once this week compared to the hourly crashes early on).  With all of that said, there are still flaws and you can run out of content if you barnstorm the quests.  I play daily with a squad of four, so we are able to basically make our own content and stay busy and engaged by keeping up with the trading community and just general role-playing.  I've built a brothel/gentlemen's club in the Mire close to where my friends have a trading Outpost and a bar.  We have a great time with it.
---
not sure that's a bug
---
\^\^\^\^\^THIS\^\^\^\^\^
---
I was gonna say it, but you beat me to it.
---
NO cap limit. None. 
---
I don't see how it would make a difference. No one will charge 1MM caps for something if you can only grind \~1400 per day. The per day vendor limit will still keep the economy in check.
---
Indeed, I always found it a touch odd that the Crossbow is considered a silent based weapon thats affected by "Stealth based" perk cards as well as "Rifleman" perk cards.. but god damn, the moment you fire off a single bolt.. Even that radroach in the bog heard that.
---
Yeah the solution may be to leave everything unlocked if this is the case.
---
Thanks for the info man. Any new hidden quests ?
---
You know, with the number of nukes we launch, He may have had a hand in this patch. 
---
PRAISE ATOM.
---
This. I’m so tired of spawning in the river at my CAMP....
---
I agree. Would be most impressive if they managed to release this patch exactly as noted on and no bugs. Praise would rain pretty heavy then.
---
Maybe once you admit why you were banned they might reconsider. As a GM, I'd never reinstate someone that keeps lying publicly about why they were banned.
---
Same, I spawn at the exact same spot every time. My camp is build on a cliff over the hill from the military training camp.
---
I always spawn in between the road and my camp, staring at the road. 
---
Maybe cuz my camp is so small/crowded/on uneven terrain that's the only safe spot to spawn me?
---
I'm just excited that it's a girl.
---
They’ve been in the game for a while now. However there is only certain animals you can tame
---
Bloodied of course
---
well, I'll be. Good news!
---
You might not be at camp? You can hit max caps in one transaction for certain items?
---
I am not a fan of no backpacks in power armor. I was really looking forward to them.
---
Its the fault of consoles, as if they make changes to one area, it usually requires a full redownload of the entire area
---
Thank you! Exactly my thoughts.
---
Actually I doubt that I will ever take workshops again. They fucked them up so bad in the previous patch, that I had plenty of time to adapt and find other ways to get needed resources. I suspect that I am not the only ones. 
---
I even started actively farming flux to make my own fusion cores, and turns out that the ones I make are actually better than the ones you get from the power plants.  If you have high intelligence, then the cores you make will have a charge that is well over 100 percent. 
---
So, turns out, workshops are, and always have been a terrible way to farm for resources.   IMO Bethesda made workshops obsolete by doing what they did previously and there is no going back.
---
Want the American flag bandana pretty bad. There is something about the bandanas in this game that just dont really look right to me. Like they are too small or something or are actually napkins.
---
I find that odd, I can't get rid of ammo fast enough.  It's starting to become a problem as my stash gets overly full.  I want to burn through that stuff because it's all just weight I don't need.  If I want something dead, I'm going to punch it, so the guns are really a diversion more than anything else.  
---
If people are like this, I guess I know what I'm going to be selling in my store.  
---
Also, totally jealous of you AA minigun.  I WANT to use heavy weapons, but they are so ineffectual, having AA would change that.
---
Makes me wish I had a Plasma Shotgun.
---
I'm FULLY aware of my cap count.
---
You understand that if you don't check everry few minutes you could lose a lot of items,right?
---
Say you're running a silo and forget to check until the end for instance?
---
Wow this isn’t actually to bad.
---
Didn’t you know? It’s was national base destroying day. Kinda like the movie the purge.
---
100% fucking this ^^^   Go get wrecked in survival. Some (lots) of us just want to explore, do quests, farm and hang out with friends without some OP player ( group of players) harassing you for nothing. And if you do want to do “ what the game was intended to do “ guess what there’s a whole mode just for you, enjoy...
---
I don't see anything in the notes about how to get a camera replacement if we lost it.
---
Open a beer.
---
The extra protection from sentinel now only triggers 75% of the time rather than being a flat buff.
---
Assassin, Sentinel and Cavalry only work on 75% of the hits you get. So basically every 4th hit, your armor legendary effect will be ignored.
---
Just sucks when you have stuff worth 20k and now you have to use reddit forums to sell in person instead so that you dont lose money for no reason. Also, clearly it was a joke post, are you not familiar with US history?
---
if they would just put random items on the bookshelves and tables i would be happy or go all out and give us something like the FO4 Mod  "do it yourshelf "
---
#
---
Okay, armor mod plans are sold again on vendors. How about the weapon mod plans? Because it friggin blows trying to find .38 auto receiver plans when youre flush with ivory grips.
---
Tbh I thought this was sarcasm when I first read it. They probably decided having beasts of burden in excavator armor running around wasn't the best idea.
---
Lol can I take this and post it on a Facebook page I follow?
---
Addictions won't disappear after death now! Junkie builds will be the new meta. Also, no data on Healing salve addictions? Guess I got to go do some research.
---
I have extreme ammo anxiety
---
Just rifle. And demolition in the case of explosive. But that charge up is great for sniping. I play the slowest build ever, crawling through everything, with short bursts of excitement. 
---
And then I have a 2h AP Power attack grognak toon, that just flies around smacking things. I like to play both so I don't get burnt out.
---
In the originally mined items here [https://imgur.com/a/QssaQnc](https://imgur.com/a/QssaQnc) was the seventh floor piece down ever in the shop?  (I've been waiting for it to show, thinking it would make wonderful alternating-level flooring for my place which uses the sixth down floor.)
---
When they push the button
---
I kinda thought it was an odd choice for power armor to get more of a boost, in addition to being able to gain +100 carry from calibrated shocks.  This makes more sense.
---
It would still be cool if the quest could provide *something* for PA users.  Kinda like the automatron DLC in 4, where you could add small pouches and bags to a created robot.  Maybe a fanny pack that adds +20 carry.  LOL.
---
Bone Excavator armor with a Mr. Fuzzy fanny pack.  That would be so precious looking.
---
Hope you don't lock your doors ;)
---
It would be heartwarming if you hadn't killed an innocent tamed creature. &gt;:( They can't help it if their owner is an asshole. That and they're literally never above level 30 so not much of a threat.
---
don't feel bad for me. I usually built there to prevent the turret buttmunches. just an arch, a bed, an instrument, stash, and crafting stations. Useful to everyone and no one else can build back there.
---
Eliminate the limit. Or only list one item at a time. 
---
Total fucking moron move to get NO CAPS for stuff you sell.........
---
Or you could be proactive and just remove the items from the machine or turn the power off before SBQ fights/dungeons etc...
---
I'm sorry tracking arrows?! How in tarnation would that work haha
---
Did you just say Legendary power armor?
---
Someday...someday... :c
---
&gt; Now, only the first Foundation will need to be built on the terrain and subsequent foundations snapped to that original piece will then ignore this rule. 
---
I see an exploit on the horizon, esp in survival.  Foundations are in fact indestructible.....just saying.
---
Shielded enclave operative underarmor is +3 STR, +2 PER 
---
Brotherhood of Steel underarmor is +2 STR, +3 END
---
There might be others. Those are the only two I know off the top of my head.
---
I want the Disciples gear. The strapped chest piece armor in particular
---
Let’s all carry just 6-10 bobby pins then as well... NO! I must always have at least 100!
---
What system are you playing on
---
Not yet, that'll be a later patch.
---
"Dude" , I'm a vendor.
---
Stop trolling,this is a legitimate concern for me as a player.
---
Depends on the gun, of course. I build up to around 1k for 10mm (prime and non) on my pistols &amp; grenade build, and I'm constantly crafting grenades every time I stop at my stash w/ whatever junk I have. 
---
I don't chase ammo too much on my Flamer / Cryolator / Heavy - I just put on the axe cards for most PVE, swapping to the heavies only when I feel like it or for big bosses (ie, I'll do the silo with an axe, but then heavy for SBQ). I just craft every ounce I can when I do.
---
For the rifle / energy weapon - I keep about 1k of 2mm. I should dump some of the extra fusion and plasma cells I have - I never use them - but I'm carrying Batteries Included so I kinda don't pay enough attention as the weight is so low for them.
---
Waaaait, fireproof protects you from the scorchbeast energy rings?  
---
Does it still trash your armor or can you just sit there soaking all day long?
---
Nah, locking doors is for scrubs. Only thing i lock is my acid collector in the basement of the bar.
---
Welcome andogg1!
---
Neat idea. Who’s up for this on PS4?
---
When they are ready?
---
Id rather them bring them back when everything is mostly stable, over them rushing it and the servers implode.
---
As a newer player I didn’t really start saving for those until a few days ago and even then I was at limit from ammo I have want to sell etc. So I have about 4 of the legendaries in total. But when I found out about player vending I went all in on roleplaying that and I’ve really struggled to juggle getting stock and still being able to keep items for general gameplay etc.
---
I was rocking 0 steel for a bit there.
---
The other thing they haven’t mentioned is if scrip weighs anything... it’ll be lighter than the items yes but I do hope it’s weightless like caps.
---
It would block your fusion core hole and twist-to-open valve.
---
u/srsly_dang  this comment 😂
---
Oh that's good to know. I placed my camp there ready for the evnding machines, so hopefully I get good business
---
Heavy does.
---
It’s been said there is legendary PA coming also. So when that comes PA users get the “better” benefits? We all know if you can us backpacks in PA now and they take it away later with legendary PA there will be much more crying because you lose the perks. PA also already gets mods just as good or maybe better than regular armor. Just have to know the plans or mods for them. You get extra carry weight, you get strength, auto stim, jetpack, less addictions, speed increase w/ reduced damage, the list goes on.
---
Now where can I find my 3* legendary power armor so I can buy a cool new skin for it?
---
Thks is definitely true. Habe you heard any speculation or confirmation as to how many items or how much weight we'll be able to sell at a time? Or because the PVM are tied to stash, is it as much as you want? I figured it may have an inventory like the fermenter where it's directly tied to inventory but has a cap of 10.
---
It sucks, but man, Black Ops 4 is the worst about this.
---
Every single update is 50+ Gb. It helped push me to deleting the game.
---
have you tried to buy plans.
---
im sure you dont have them all yet.
---
Well done sir...  well done....
---
Just one thing, and I don’t mean to rain on your parade, it’s just that I thought that even if your camp got Nuked down to the bare earth that you could still repair it...
---
&gt; because BGS didn’t have the foresight to allow caps to be stored in the machine.
---
Because ~~BGS~~ OP didn't have the foresight to keep a track on his account.
---
Im excited for the Mohawk the person wearing the plague doc is wearing and that stone floor
---
lol....yea...Excavator armor would carry excess of 600lbs
---
Does it make you hostile to the owner or just wanted in general?
---
it is the pinned post that is on the front page.
---
Glad I didn’t buy the sentinel armor for 85k jeez.
---
... so it’s another effect that’s supposed to be disease resist but is labeled (what we see in game) rad resist? Sounds a hell of a lot like what I said.
---
Or are you trying to say the antiseptic one isn’t implemented in game at all, and the sometimes-working sometimes-not rad resist is broken in some other way?
---
True but it's even more pointless now lol
---
only because i cant make sandwiches. 
---
i do usually bring soup to nukezones.
---
I’d always wanted to see specialized PA. Medics: reduces the weight of aide and health items. But reduces the PA overall stats to compensate. So on so forth. All being single chest mods that govern the whole suit. So no other mods can be used.
---
Wolf/dog, mole rats, and?
---
Removed the post smh
---
You are cancer.
---
We need more and bigger sinks. I was expecting 20% or 25%.
---
If i understand patch notes correctly, you have 40% reduced damage from players and when you are standing still, you have 75% chance to reduce 75% of every damage you get. But not 90% or how much it was when it was stacking.
---
This means, even with full set you gonna die in 2or more hits.
---
If you use the perks, you can carry a ton on your person. Useful for junk runs, with a little risk when you die.
---
Check your aid and misc. A lot of people do not realize how much that stack of 22 disease cures weighs, or how many ore they have accumulated. First time I made that realization and cleaned up I had thousands of caps more and 300lbs freed up in my cache.
---
I don't know, these are just the tables and I couldn't find anything relating to the use of these tables in the ESM. Maybe scripts use it.
---
Just scroll down
---
How the fuck do people get so much ammo?
---
Im level 51 and have never had more than 120 shotgun shells, and 200-300 ammo for most guns.  Im constantly running out of ammo in fights.  I recently completely "i am death" and ended with 1 broken gun with ammo and ran out of ammo on 3 other guns. Barely beat it finishing with melee weapons.   Ammo seems broken to me...
---
tie them to the faction for enclave and bos
---
I mean, not trying to be snippy, but there literally is a post on the front page detailing all the patch notes and stuff added today. Including backpacks.
---
Wendigo? Mothman? Wonder if they can't too.?
---
Lol Fart Dragons. I gotta remember that. Thats gold
---
They literally have a road map, and the update for today is on the front page.. I don't usually say this to people, but I would recommend searching first before asking.
---
Yeah if I can find myself a prime receiver I think I’m gonna do just that. got enough flux and ultracite in my stash for 1000+ rounds out of the gate. 
---
They also finally buffed the hunting rifle 50 cal receivers. For a while most people believed it was to balance out the high ammo yield. Which frankly isn’t even a big deal at all anyway on a weapon that fires that slow.
---
Cryo cells I never had a huge issue with but I welcome the change anyway. The flamer fuel yield was insulting. Even as a heavy build I’ve never used one simply because I couldn’t be bothered to make the ammo
---
Smoke some Nuka Weed and chill on FO4.
---
I've said this before:  I seriously doubt Bethesda intended  for people to be running around in full sets of Sent, Assassins.   They probably assumed that people would acquire maybe 3 pieces at most through grinding. You simply cannot have people taking zero damage in PVP.  Shut up about staggering.  Stagger perks have... what? 18 percent chance to proc?   So when people starting walking around in full sets, of course a nerf was inevitable.
---
Not RIGHT right now but yes
---
Carefully choose which videos to trust on perk card builds. There are heaps of bad info poorly chosen perk card builds on youtube.
---
Wait... was this [you](https://imgur.com/a/EH4M5aP)?
---
I've answer this a shit ton of the last week, so I'm just going to point you to the search bar.
---
Have a look at the patch notes for today they’ve just been posted to this reddit there should be a full thread around :) backpacks are in today but the legendary vendor isn’t in just yet
---
I don’t see how that’s a valid argument, the machine should be locked whenever the player has hit max caps, either that or don’t allow for items to be purchased which would put their caps over the limit.
---
I did read it:
---
C.A.M.P., CRAFTING, AND WORKSHOPS
---
 • C.A.M.P. Damage Protections: C.A.M.P. objects and Structures no longer take damage from other players as long as the defending player, and their C.A.M.P. defenses, are not hostile against their attackers.
---
If someone picks your lock, they become hostile towards you. What am I missing?
---
I actually only carry 3 at all time. What's life without a little unpredictability.
---
My gripe is why horde a collection of weapons you'll never use. For example, three guys in my group have the exact weapon I've been searching for. My grail. And even though none of them like the gun or have ever used it they refuse to come off it and let me buy it so I can actually use the fucker. What's the point? 
---
It's like this with most people I've come across with max characters and caps. Greed is a hell of a thing.
---
It usually takes up to 3-5 hours
---
Build your own opinion
---
I always had trouble trying to get the addictions to proc.
---
What does this mean?
---
Tasteless
---
Both of those things are being added today! Backpacks will add carry weight, but I’m not sure how much. You can mod the backpacks to have less carry weight but more things like damage resist and refrigeration to make food last longer.
---
Great new patch being added today, lots of new content. The game has come a long, long way since launch. If you're on pc, reply of message me and I'd be happy to get you started.
---
it removes the dmg benefit from it completely
---
Wait, PA O\_O
---
Came here to say this lol
---
At the time when they announced it, it sounded a little too good to be true, but I was excited none the less b/c my T-51b's carry weight is shit (compared to Excavator) but I like my T-51b better b/c of its damage threshold and aesthetic. I have to keep looking for calibrated shocks
---
Ohh...
---
I remember hearing about this happening with destiny 1 on PS a lot needing to re-download the entire game for patches
---
RIP sorry man
---
And on Xbox (and ps4 for destiny so I'm assuming its the same for 76) you have to restart your consoles for patches to show up next patch try restarting the system then starting the game to hardpush the update my prevent needing to re-download the whole game
---
Mine was like 5.6 gigs on x1
---
No. It’s offline atm bud. But you should definitely play it later 😄
---
L I T E R A L L Y
---
the antiseptic one should be in game but ive never seen one and a lot of people ive talked to havent either. the rad resist one is just buggy
---
How did he steal 4k caps and possibly your entire inventory?
---
Easiest way to translate that is that weapons are better to turn into scrips than armors. Who knows how the functionality is when it comes out.
---
I have a good majority of the CAMP plans and all of my weapons and armor are modded the way I need them to be.
---
Just a wall man, not the camp. Sure when you get to me all the stuff is stashed and a 100c bounty isn’t much when you’re stuck at max caps. I’m not salty I’m just wondering why in PvE do you lock doors and have no bench?
---
How do i even get Wasteland Whisperer? Is it for certain levels only? I'm level 38 with like 12 Charisma - haven't seen a single Whisperer card.
---
&gt; Is now a good time to start playing?
---
Now is not a good time. A major patch is being released so the servers are down.
---
Shortly tho, yeah it would be good to play the game, it gets better all the time. 
---
New stories, new quests, new stuff.
---
I keep about 3000 50cal and about the same .308 for MG's but the rest I keep between 500-1000. I have about 2500 shells I'm going to try &amp; sell in vending, but not sure how well it will work at 1c each. Probably cheaper and easier than farming, but who knows?
---
Apparently he’d rather have a skin than a decent game to play 🤷‍♀️
---
It’s good value for money, plenty of content to keep you entertained
---
I’d recommend a melee build if you don’t want to spend your level 20 and 30s spending most of your game time farming for ammo
---
someone had already datamined legendary PAs and their effects were pretty limited. the best one was like "almost unbreakable" or something. everything else as meh.
---
Honest question, I got this game at launch and played a bit.  Has it gotten better?
---
Yeah the fall trick doesn't actually work I don't think... My buddy logged out and I stayed inside his base. The moment I walked out it vanished... Don't know if that was a one off thing.
---
However it would be interesting to spectate! If you are on PS4 I'd be happy to test for fun!
---
maintenance
---
Servers are down but yeah, we have some threads about it already. It’s a great time to play.
---
It should still work on mole rats so take your hostilities out on them sir!
---
This and the insect armor pen perk card should probably be re-evaluated as I don't think there are enough creatures in those categories to actually need a perk card/legendary effect for .. plus now there's no special perk card or legendary for reptiles or whatever else categories they decide to add.
---
You're about to be down voted into oblivion by people that play an hour a week and get mad when people have caps.
---
Honestly, give er a go.
---
Does the deserve as much shit as it gets? No. Does the game have issues? Yes. Are the guys at bethesda austin working to make the game great? Yes.
---
You good sir, just renewed my faith in the Appalachia!
---
The mat exists for workshops....I have no idea why the hell it doesn't for camps.
---
You need to be in the boundary of the workshop for PVP to activate.
---
FINALLY
---
This has been the only game to give these types of issues.. 
---
Ihave skyrim FO3 FO4 they all work fine the usal glitches n stuff F076 does this kind stuff .
---
The game is down for an update at the moment.
---
Probably why I couldn't find any of the feral golfers.  Thanks for the post.
---
Not this question again. For the 100th time this week.
---
Yeah, I know.
---
Thanks for having the common sense to agree with me. Pretty much every comment I've made in this thread is getting dv'd to Oblivion by the toxic people.
---
No, the servers aren't up.
---
Jokes aside, the game had quite a rocky start but has improved substantially, with bug fixes, more content being added almost every week, and a lot more to come. If you have a friend to play with I recommend picking up, especially since you can get it so cheap (at least on PC,k I paid £9 for a key for a friend).
---
Probably the part where wanted players won't become inherently hostile to you or your camp defenses.
---
Legendary vendor is at a later date.
---
Grafton vendors are part of the responders faction so check their vendor wouod be my guess along with the BoS one.
---
Crazy cat owner probably
---
First off, you have my respect for performing a much needed public service and I'm actually glad you won't be needed there anymore. Other than that, it was a general sentiment for those who were just there not hurting anyone.  I built a base out on the course there when I first went to Whitesprings around level 30 or so and it was a good safe place to hang out for 10 or so levels.
---
I’m sorry 😩 I don’t browse here often
---
Well when you are launching orbital strike its hard to control it.
---
I never locked doors, just water purifiers, but I will probably just unlock them now since the cost of repairing everything in camp outweighs the cost of some stolen water.
---
Bethesda has already posted this, but cheers I guess.
---
Thanks.  But for whatever reason my damn work computer did not refresh to show new posts. My bad and shit happens. 🤯😱😔
---
Yes! I knew they were adding in stages, really digging that chia cat too ;).
---
Yeah give it a try, you stand to lose nothing really if you already have the game in a bundle, just play it and form your own opinion
---
&gt;**The Whitespring:** C.A.M.P.s can no longer be built or placed near the Whitespring Golf Club.  
---
&gt;**Dev Note:** We’ve seen many requests from the Fallout 76 community to remove the ability to build C.A.M.P.s near the Whitespring Golf Club, as they can tend to trivialize enemies in the area. We agree with this feedback, and have decided to place a no-build zone in this location.
---
I know you all really wanted this, but honestly I am now terrified my CAMP won't be placed/placeable when I get home...I'm near the Golf Club but not on that green, on the other side by the driving range....fingers crossed I guess. :(
---
I still don't quite understand why this was SUCH a big pain point for people...I am in favor of more placeable areas, not less. -\_-
---
Big brain plans over here.
---
I'm with this guy, let's drive those prices down boys.
---
Yeah, but this not a reality for the avarage player. The majority of players has hard time getting their 1400 caps from vendors everyday, imagine reach the caps limit.
---
Well I read it wrong then, sorry guys !
---
With that username, I think you might be.
---
As someone who spends most of their time in game trading with other players I probably keep track of my caps more than I do my hunger and thirst meters.
---
The 30 items you sell from CAMP vending are items that are in your stash only. 
---
Don’t sell more than the amount of caps you have on your character!!! If you do you don’t get any of the caps.
---
I too am hoping since it is in the utility section
---
Ahh good to know. Maybe that’s all we’ll get haha
---
Sounds like a buff to Postman Uniform Outfit. :D
---
Good post, combined with a time machine you would be golden. 
---
Sorry bud!
---
YESSS I'm so excited! Moving forward, this is the start of a beautiful friendship &lt;3
---
Thanks bud lol.
---
Yeah, the weight of a Bobby pins was 0.1 which meant if you had an inventory with say, 45 Bobby pins you suddenly have alot of extra weight. They reduced it to 0.01 if I'm not mistaken
---
You sound more salty because you don't have the gear than people complaining about it being nerfed.
---
&gt; my forest of wood legs will turn into god rolls in mere days
---
Umm...I'd hold off on that enthusiasm for now.  You're not going to be happy if that's the bar you're setting.
---
poor griefers.  No longer immortal or OP?  so sad.  You people should create a support group/circlejerk session.
---
That's funny as hell
---
What I dont understand is how you people have so many! I'm in a crisis right now with 75 shotgun shells!
---
OH HOW DARE THEY!!!
---
I'm rolling on the floor laughing at that comment.
---
I'll still take the kittens, as they need a better home then the one they are stuck in.
---
Yes but good luck farming flux again to repair your decontamination shower, as well as all the materials for the missiles turrets and everything else.
---
I still see the whole post?
---
The PS4 and Xbox only check for updates once per 24 hour cycle. Xbox for instance attempts to auto update around 2am EST. This is for a few reasons.
---
1. Lower online population depending on locale, and server you will be hitting to download from. Better bandwidth utilization. 
---
2. Majority of players tend to go to bed before that period of time. I sure as hell don't, but the majority rules.
---
So if an update releases in the middle of the day, it won't auto download because the console didn't prompt for it. A game simply would just be pushed the update and that's all.
---
More than you would imagine and the community has gotten so much stronger! Lot's of passionate people for this game! Welcome back in advance if you plan to come back!
---
I just want a trade only option.
---
Just checked and had to manually start mine too.
---
You can get a grown up kitten with waste land whisperer
---
Those were left over effects from 4, which likely wouldn't be reused.
---
I'm not sure why a camp turret would target a wanted player if a workshop one wouldn't.
---
I never took fireproof seriously, it seems like a waste.  I guess I'll have to reconsider.
---
That is absolutely brilliant
---
lol :D
---
or...   You could invest your caps with me and not worry about money management...   we could start a serum franchise and grow our caps that way...  keep investing in serums until we own the market...
---
I’ll be the first wasteland version of Ax Capital...   
---
(for those who don’t get the reference, it’s from the TV series Billions)
---
That's kinda odd though since the Responders aren't part of the BoS. But eh! I'll have a look around
---
I just hope the bethesda net launcher version lets you play with steam players when that version launches
---
Does the plasma damage patch apply to the Shishkebab as well??
---
I assumed OP means the ability to drop, say, an oil canister and position it wherever he wants in his Camp. Seems we shouldn’t get our hopes up for that just yet... the patch notes/announcements regarding Camp decorating  seem to indicate the ability to put items in display cases, not so much we can freely throw junk/scrap wherever we’d like. 
---
Someday with mods I’m sure this will happen just like with fallout
---
Just remember until the vendor arrives these numbers give us no context beyond what we get for a turnin.
---
Buying a One star legendary could cost a thousand scrip for all we know at this time.
---
We'll see. It's such a grey area in the code at this point. They are similar to turrets,but they are not; some of them have red health bar, but they're not aggressive. There was a time in which you'd get wanted for killing them,now not. I hope for them to be finally safe for good. They already randomly die in the camp generation, i 'm sick of going back to camp to protect the usual stroller that cannot see it's MY deathclaw. Killing this clueless people is not even rewarding.
---
Except getting those pieces are much harder then going to a vendor picking up a plan, farming the materials and crafting it.
---
Queue a million posts about people falling through the floor/world again.
---
You could live in an igloo made of salt blocks for all the butthurt exuded here....
---
Upvoting for visibility before the "update broke my game" flood.
---
Play all night, smoke a lot , drink a bit, scrap my good 3* because i will be stone
---
That seems about right, I hate waiting but it’s definitely worth it!
---
Just pick peoples locks - u get wanted and can destroy their camps 😁 ( i dont do pvp or such but )
---
IV never cared for pvp, I'm a big fallout fan and have always thought that an online would be fun, and it is, but the pvp part just sucks. The pvp aspect is what keeps bringing these nerfs, if it weren't for pvp we would all be easily slaughtering everything with outr Tse handmade and having a blast doing it.
---
What I haven't thought about is just moving the camp but that's a bit of a cost...
---
Since vending machines take out of your stash, does anyone know if there is a way to segregate items so you don’t sell all of them. Say I have 10 purified water but only want to sell 5, will there be a way to specify that or are all 10 fair game to buyers?
---
Oh and the crops is also quite messy to repair. Farming for fertilizer now. And farming for lots of screws. It was a massive base on max budget.
---
Time to return to hunting rifles!
---
TSE and sent ass/cab needed nerfs not their fault you can’t do damage or win pvp without cheese gear lmao
---
Become a pioneer scout!
---
Same I tend to loiter at bus stops and train stations usually intoxicated or passed out, but I keep the backs of my knees moist
---
They need to fix it. It sucks for those who don't have aquaboy/aquagirl
---
WTB: junk legendaries
---
There fixed it for you?
---
Never had that issue for destiny it was actually always updated  just shitty conection most of the time.
---
Thats not really my issue tho.
---
Its downloading now just had to uninstall a game download the patch and than renistall the game when its done.
---
I belive its not properlly reading the storage on my Ps4. Why idk.
---
Could we please have a skin for the .50cal and gatling !
---
Exactly. I now have people telling me my post has been edited or removed.
---
No mod mail though.
---
Yes. Yes you should.
---
I guess I thought it was the same thing since it was against you. Hopefully there is a distinction there, and I am wrong. I’m not afraid to admit if I’m wrong...
---
Also I’m not saying it’s possible to do this now, more that it won’t be possible for quite some time
---
She’s a bit skinny for my taste. Elbows too pointy. 4/10.
---
not with the latest update.....
---
probably.
---
Could be that too, I suppose. The timing was odd. 
---
What was likely the oddest, for anyone who happened to see it, was a 100+ level player in full PA running like hell from a pack of level 9 ghouls in golf skirts, because I didn't want to kill them and rob someone else of being able to check that quest off.
---
Same, I'm super hyped about the new content
---
someone data mined that info
---
*Laughs in Fireaxe*
---
I swear those gnomes are gsentient
---
That is great
---
I would be okay with it if they made calibrated shocks more easily accessible to PA users.     As it stand right now, the only way to boost carry weight in PA is through RNG or a shitload of caps for the plans. 
---
Or finding someone who can craft the shocks.
---
Oh you’re right. But the exchange machines are in today
---
Too be fair I don’t even bother getting the 1.4k a day from traders. I usually just make all my money through P2P trading which is a much more efficient way of making caps. 
---
I don’t agree with any of the stupid prices people put on items but for someone who for example just wants to sell ammo at their machine in large quantities simply cannot do so if they’re close to the cap limit.
---
Fallout 76 had the softest community by far
---
Done *aaaaaand* Done!
---
&gt; legendarified 
---
I *WILL* find a way to use this word daily for the rest of the week.
---
From this moment forward they are known as Radioactive Fart Dragons. 😂

You're definitely going to love my Vault ID cards for my two characters.

Bad bot 😠
---
Mailboxes? Hmmm. . . . . .
---
I think they were only the legacy effects from 4, they might (and probably will) be adding in additional legendary PA effects.
---
It's only temporarily disabled.
---
Yeah, same. But I've tried to get better about that and carry around smaller amounts of ammo and switch more towards being a melee build so I don't have to bog myself down with rounds.
---
tbh every non-unarmed medium swing speed weapon is garbage.
---
Yeah, I'm not thinking junk decorating will be that expansive. It'll be weapon and armor/clothing racks, displaying teddies and probably bobblehead and magazine racks. I'm guessing that's about it.
---
It’s that completionist mentality... seems a ton of fallout players got it bad lol
---
I'd rather we could make signs or notes, that way we can just leave a message at our camps saying "will trade ammo for ammo. W: .45 and slugs, H: fusion, .308, .38, fusion cores" etc. I've been stockpiling ammo to sell but like a lot of people I don't really need the caps, ammo is more important to me so a straight swap is preferable.
---
&gt; I probably keep track of my caps more than I do my hunger and thirst meters.
---
Then it will be a non-issue for you.
---
nah, like them with a bit of flesh on :D
---
Alright I added everyone on the post so if you see me online, feel free to jump in my FO76 party when I'm on 😊👍
---
😁😆😉  Yeah one of these days the time machine will work in my favor.
---
You weird man
---
 __whispers__ “Nukashine”
---
Id love to see a list of the negative effects of addictions. this seems key to determining if the build is viable. If addictions wreck your AP and regen no amout of damage is worth having to ads constantly and never run.
---
Aside from the “Not wanting to get grieved” and “easier to keep locked rather than unlocking it in PvE and locking it again in PvP” I would assume it’s just a choice of privacy and wanting only specific players such as friends or teammates be allowed the privilege. Not necessarily to punish players for not planning ahead or hoarding but just because they prefer the privacy.
---
We need more kittens! 
---
I’m glad Bethesda listened to players who want to do this without PvP! They created a whole server for them... guess they can’t hack it and mad at the world... they don’t deserve a free kitten! lol
---
u/valseek
---
Are you able to elaborate a little bit on what exactly the issue with the punch bowls was?
---
It usually takes an average of 4 hours per update. So a little after 2 p.m. Eastern standard Time. Hopefully.
---
Unyielding X-01.
---
And I thought I could only get SO hard.
---
Shadow censoring on Reddit... FUCKING AMAZING
---
&gt; **Weather:** Rain no longer falls through Camping Canopies. 
---
That's what I'm talking about!
---
People seem to want it based in this subs response. I dont like it but if it has to exist then it should be used to benefit the public, that's how taxes are supposed to work. Lol
---
Everyone gets their own legendary if they helped kill it
---
One that gave you the same marker as the targeting hud or recon scope would be cool, especially for those legendary cowards that seem to disappear into distance as soon as I start shooting at them!
---
I did think about it and I figured someone simple minded would say exactly what you said.
---
I'll check it out now thx I'll update you if I find it.
---
yet we still lose those extra caps.
---
I noticed the patch said you can place three vending machines. Is it 30 per vending machine I wonder?
---
Not sure when the legendary PA pieces will drop but I bet they'll drop with the vendor seeing that there's power armor pieces at the purveyors trading post near harpers ferry
---
Figures. 
---
1100 hours played and for gripping about a legitimate concern,I get censored....
---
Still shows up in its entirety for me , so if you hadn't told me I'd think it was still up.
---
HARUMPH! HARUMPH! 
---
HARUMPH!
---
Cool thanks!
---
I thought patch notes say you can’t bring Mirelurks in anymore or deathclaws...
---
Buying ammo is a decent cap sink for me, seeing as I don’t really have anything else to buy.
---
Haha. She better be worth it then.
---
Yeah so assasin have too 75% chance to be triggered.
---
Stable flux. And the stuff to craft it.
---
My CAMP is right on top of this spot. I make sure to punish the gnome every time I log in... and check if the sunbathing lady has a magazine for me.
---
Seriously. And the fact that it boosts strength anyway makes it like a backpack itself. That have diminishing returns with a high strength PA user, but why would they need more carry space anyway?
---
Don't know where I wrote that I'm annoyed with the nerfs or I destroy camps, but whatever bud.
---
I don’t understand this privacy the door locking people talk about? It’s not like your mom isn’t going to knock on your bedroom door and walk in on you. 
---
Also my post isn’t me crying that I’m carrying to much and need to store it. I generally have 120lbs extra carry weight because I only carry what I need. But when I want to throw in the 100 screws I just farmed, grab a radaway because I have 2hp it would be nice to walk up to the trash can stash you set up so I can throw them in. PvP is a different story.
---
are your caps maxed too?
---
Ammo, recipes and legendarys. I would buy
---
Its part of the game balance
---
Plans
---
Your math is wrong
---
Let me get this straight.....in your wildest fantasy, you co-own a hotel with Satan?
---
Looks like they are designed to be worn with power armor without a power armor helmet.
---
Except no one has more than 25k...
---
Wholy ****. If we get unyielding power armor i'd jizz so hard i'd blow a whole into my screen
---
That’s what makes no sense here. Tax is tangible, the money goes somewhere. These are just numbers that don’t exist really when we lose them. Pretty dumb stuff.
---
From what I can tell, power armor stands are just repurposed engine hoists.
---
That’s awesome news...generally my experience with”healing” chems/aid is that they aren’t addictive (see Skeeto-spit), but you are correct in that I didn’t attempt to get addicted to healing salves
---
Plans anything thats not common people will want so a ton of plans I dont think will work well, aid wise only diseases cure, radaway maybe, and stims mostly. Then legendaries 1* noone really will want unless a good perk such as instigating, bloodied etc
---
Well at this point anything is god roll compared to wood legs and exhausted mules
---
If that's true then I am unaware. Still, it was just a joke anyway.
---
The irony is by "Counteracting" the sales tax you're doing exactly what Bethesda wants. The higher your prices, the more caps are removed from the game entirely.
---
&gt; or maybe invincible CAMP destroying turrets at whitesprings?
---
Camps cannot be placed at Whitesprings any more. 
---
The tax that is being collected is to pay off the promised bribe to the Appalachian Wasteland Zoning Commission.
---
I'm sorry you missed the Wasteland Shackowners Association meeting where we voted to bribe the Appalachian Wasteland Zoning Commission to create a violation of building rundown and dilapidated shacks on the pristine Whitesprings grounds.
---
We already have plenty of carry weight
---
Youre banned thats why
---
It's been almost 6 hours are the servers still down?
---
30 types of items. So items that stack can be sold at up to 250 each (or whatever the stack limit is; it used to be 300 but they lowered it). But yeah, plans probably won't stack.
---
You can only max your character to 25k. So yes anything over goes into cyberspace
---
Well, there goes all my atoms on plants
---
I think it’s 30 max but I was a little confused on the wording as well. I think the additional machines may be to accommodate extra visitors.
---
I'm not your bud guy
---
When I find a locked camp, I simply just find furniture that I can interact with through a window or place my power armor frame inside the camp to get into it.
---
Just to be clear, I don't like the turret CAMPs....just hate to see the few bad apples (I've only seen 2 ffs) ruin things for the rest of us.
---
Would be great if you could update when you find it - fingers crossed for ya bud :)
---
But, that isn't the american way...YOU FILTHY COMMIE!
---
Close. It would be 1.112
---
You'd end up at 22,018
---
Nah. Their UI isn't set up for that. It's likely so people won't have to wait in line.
---
Literally knew these type of posts were coming lmao, crazy
---
You can have more than one machine. I plan on having dedicated machines for variations of plans/armor/weapons/ammo
---
It's a joke man.
---
**drink drink drink**
---
Well yes, but actualy no. I have two PS4 so i have infinite number of mules, that is not point of this post tho.
---
Is the download available now?  
---
For some reason, even though the settings are correct, my stupid ps4 does not auto download even when I access it remotely.  I was thinking about running home on lunch and starting the download so I don't have to wait for it after I get home from work.
---
U are a habitual linestepper my man
---
&gt;it's not that hard to just be glad that things are changing for the better
---
It's not hard to remember how bad they fucked this game up at launch.
---
yeah I agree the roads are a mess and the public parks haven't been serviced in years, everything overgrown as shit! Wheres our representationz!?
---
Although I think the money gained from taxes should be taken seirously and spent wisely on things like brothels or public bath houses.
---
What?
---
I know what I'm about, son.
---
Shhhhh free profit.
---
This does not put a smile on my face
---
Can you do that? 😂 that’s hilarious. Bad thing is I don’t carry power armor with me haha
---
I’m not even sure why people bothered with turret traps. I just get everything to chase me and blow up the cars behind me on the way.
---
nah   once you leave the area,that workshop goes,so you cant take more than 1.  so you have to stay there and not roaming around. should work.
---
but cant take the work shop by force.
---
Math us the proper math pokerplayr!
---
It hasn't even been three yet.
---
How?
---
With everyone else: Plans.
---
The ancient curse of FT-botching mudcrab has been lifted!
---
If this is true i'll take everything back i just said
---
Incorrect.
---
I built my camp there and have had no trouble triggering events. I built it there specifically for the purpose of getting traffic from the folks trying to farm the coat, and since building there I've seen / triggered the following events: responder vendor bot, responder (non vendor) bot, a horde of scorched, a horde of mr gutsy, a group of supermutants, a moth man of some variety, and a non hostile eyebot leading a long line of non hostile radrats down the street.
---
Are you willing to pay 1:1 caps per bullet? Because  it won't probably let us set lower price for ammo.
---
That's not how math works.
---
Say you want to sell your precious Sheepsquatch staff for 100 caps. With the cap reduction, you will only gain 90 caps if you price it at 100. But if you raise the price by 10% to 110 caps, you still only gain 99 caps from the sale.
---
The correct way to compensate for the "tax" comes from solving the equation .9x=100, indicating that you want to know the price, x, that, when reduced by 10% to 90% of the list price, still gives you 100 caps.  Solving this equation gives x=1000/9, or x≈111.111... (repeating).
---
In general, if you want to gain y caps from the sale of an item after the tax, the list price x is given by x=100y/9.
---
Power armor needs some love
---
Agreed on that point! I had to buy junk bulk a few times to make sure I didn’t go over... I was mainly saying that to people not having any caps...
---
Not for at least 1-3 more levels!
---
WOOOOOSH
---
Someone will still get it eventually, or people will be forced tk drive the prices down until competitive
---
It was for Xbox idk about ps4
---
Ok now I NEED to recreate the fyre festival in 76.
---
They've only been down for 2 and a half though?
---
They went down 9AM my time, its 11:43 rn for me.
---
Yeah I was thinking that it should all be put towards some community reward or something at the end of each month. Anything even related to the diassaperance of the caps would be nice.
---
The issue was a combination of duping getting patched, but more importantly putting 1400 caps per player everywhere on the map. Caps became worthless when anybody and their mother could grab 1,400 a day (across 5 acts) for a few serums or whatever they want to sell. There are also no cap “sinks” in the game. Used to spend caps on camp plans but have em all now pretty much. Influx in caps + reduction in supply of items = market chaos and massive inflation. At least there’s a new dupe glitch being released today ;)
---
No, it was pretty clear 😎
---
Legendary weapons and some armour, and stable flux.
---
As long as I, the seller, isn't losing caps, then I can care less what caps the buyer loses.
---
Yeah because only one can use it at the time probably.
---
Things you cannot easily buy from Vendors
---
What? No. 3 hours almost.
---
Think about all the secret updates though. That's what I'm looking for.
---
Makes sense
---
I will be selling ALL the possum bacon and mirelurk eggs I have at my vending machine.  Wait....I don't think you heard me correctly.....
---
When it’s done being offline (:
---
That’s why I’m not jumping in for a few days until I see people posting...lol
---
That's basically what i am saying. Legendary armor is better but some heavy weapons perks only work with power armor. For example 45% armor oenetration which is obviously a must have.
---
Handmades weigh 20 lbs.
---
Not just that but it felt like it expired so fast too
---
You get plans for excavator, but then have to build it. You get a full set of Ultracite power armor for free at the end of the Brotherhood questline.
---
Ugh, that scoreboard.  I get that leaderboards are an important component to some players, but honestly there isn't a point to them so they are useless. 
---
I did like the ranking by most player kills, because it was a great way to see where people were spawn camping. This adjustment puts a marker on anyone who has been playing successfully.
---
I like top player kills, but at this point, just get rid of it.
---
I'm actually shocked that your post is removed. Maybe refresh the page with your browser reload. The new site design using what I assume is Ajax doesn't load new content unless you manually reload.
---
hahahaha
---
I've 5 pieces of sentinal (no pvp just for pve) and I think it's good that it's nerfed it's just too OP. Like standing between 5 Supermutants which shoot me with Laser Guns and machine pistols and I just casual drink a fresh purified bottle of *water.* 
---
But I wish it would work even if you crouch. As a ninja I hate that I need to stand up to get the protection. 
---
"Wait guys I need to stand up to harden my skin so you can't penetrate me"
---
Ssshhhhh. Let them scratch their heads then conclude that the game is broken.
---
Also people want want to but cheap weapons to scrap
---
Well...I'm not unseeing that.
---
GG.
---
No not anymore, plus aside from a few douchy players, it is cool to have people come check out your people. Players love seeing what people have built .. so I welcome my fellow vaulties so I can show off my camp and share my resources ... I never lock anything, so they welcome to come and chill.
---
Unyielding would be so fucking OP, that they would just nerf it in the next patch
---
No decorate with junk yet? ;_;
---
Good suggest, thx. I will put some of them there.
---
whe need change the scope
---
I don't, but I can make a new one whenever.
---
Yeah but now it has more drawbacks than benefits.
---
Do you already have one or just seen tbe baselv numbers?
---
Still says servers are off for me
---
It's a poster like the others.
---
Maybe they did some adjustment.
---
Amen
---
Same as all the others so far
---
Poster. Free in the atom shop.
---
Isn't it basically the same interface as if you were on your PlayStation?
---
Highlight 76 and click the Optioms button and select Check for Updates
---
lol read the patch notes.
---
Good bot
---
haha yes! my influence needs to be spread! I start trends!
---
Your eyes must not work good.
---
Nope... PA already have increased carry weight... Why should they get to double dip. I don't use PA I've been dying for extra carry weight lol
---
Interact with a poster at a train station. Or get the poster from the atomic shop and place one at your camp.
---
Same as last two, posters at train stations or a free one from the atom shop
---
You’ve made me look a damn fool with your edit, curse you pokerplayr. But know this is not the end of this matter. I’ll edit you right back and we’ll both go down, mark my words
---
Poster at train station.
---
Do we know where though?
---
Whew glad im not the only one that "cheated" those. Lol
---
It's literally on the first line of the patch notes in the New Content section.
---
The phone calculator isn't wrong, the person operating it is (i.e. you). You were approximating, which is a legitimate method for estimating a sales price. The method I suggested, however, is more precise and mathematically correct.
---
Not trying to sound dense, but I can't seem to find where to do it from within the app?
---
Bethesda are the guys, develpoers, making, updating and fixing the game.
---
Zenimax, their owners, are the ones that decide when things are going to be released. 
---
Your anger is... misplaced.
---
ReAd ThE pOsTeR!
---
No mods I think I built it level 40 can't remember right now cuz I can't log in and look yet
---
Why we lose sloth? :C
---
I don’t use shotguns and I agree.
---
So far the quests are tied to posters at the rail stations so there might be a starting point
---
From what I read it doesn't use shotgun perks though. :\[
---
Ihave. Gonna clean browser and relog.
---
Probably "fight"
---
And while deleting them is kinda a mini movie
---
I laugthed more then I should
---
Cool I will be able to offload my now nerfed worthless sentinel assassin armour.
---
Eh, I can understand it. You hate to lose what you have, even if it's OP.
---
Bethesda obviously doesn't want PvPers to be unkillable.  Go figure.  They cobbled together a few pvp effects onto a game base that wasn't designed for it, and there were unforeseen issues.  Now they're adjusting.  It's going to hurt a few builds, and people that had the freedom to safely pvp/grief with little fear of consequences now get a healthy (if still small) dose of reality thrown at them.  
---
They'll complain, then they'll find the new meta, then they'll go quite.  It's what I'd expect.  It will all blow over soon enough.
---
Read, lol
---
You don't need Stabilized for anything other than the queen, which is in a nuked zone
---
You get the plans for it during the miners miracles quest in ash heap, you get ultracite power armor from the main quest
---
i feel like this should be mentioned or clarified in the patch notes
---
Why do ppl need 400 carryweight - seriously what are people hoarding. I use 2 guns , 73k ammo for one on me , 54k for the other. No ammo issues and still over 100 pounds free without PA
---
But I think you’re allowed to pick lock something 1 time without being wanted. My friend picklocked someone water purifier once and it just warned him he could become wanted
---
Server-hopping to find plans isn’t content.
---
False? Protection. Already boosted carry weight. Etc. This isn't such a big deal.
---
Oh. That sucks.
---
I did myself to deter thieves, but if that’s going to instigate PVP and allow people to destroy my CAMP, I’ll stop using it. Refresh speed is fast enough I won’t take a hit.
---
Here, scrap 5 legendary items, get XX tokens, spend it on 3 star roll, get \*exterminator/ 40% more power attack damage /  90% reduced weight \* drill
---
Long story short: You scrap multiple garbage legendary items, for a chance of 0.0000001% to get what you actually need.
---
That’s... not how that works
---
After you start BoS line, you can have only 1 technical data at the time. So you must go to stash every time you find one. Thats why some guys buy it from players, who are before this quest and have stacks of technical data.
---
No matter how good you are at maths, you still get fucked 10% tax. Raising the price to 111.11 might give you 100, it also gives the dev 11 caps vs 10.
---
The poster will be free in the store like the others.
---
Well that's what I mean.. I don't understand why you wouldn't gain those benefits aside from balancing
---
You realize that no matter what you do you will always lose 10%, right?
---
Eh haven't used them since tge demolition perk over nerf but i also heard there was a bug but its been fixed so hopefully my tse may be a bit better until i can get a bloodied explosive one
---
Trainstations
---
Kudos to you sir.
---
That's one way to save face!
---
This\^\^\^
---
You caught me I am the one who needs the safe space how did you figure it out it must of been those meddling kids and dog.
---
I have the app for iphone and they have one for android too.  I think you just sign in on the app and it connects.
---
Weight reducing armor kinda already makes non-pa builds better for carry capacity. With 5x pieces of WWR I have more effective carry capacity than my double shocks/ +2 STR/ Excavator armor.
---
Yes. Got ya.
---
Download the psn app on your phone. Be connected to wireless somewhere. Once you enter your login information you can connect to your PS4. It will start the download. Once started disconnect. It will still be downloading when you do.

---
Love it 
---
I haven’t had time to play yet-this is too entertaining!
---
Got ya.
---
what are they changing w shotguns? all I've seen in the new patch notes are changes to explosive shotguns
---
Then it's time to strip! :)
---
I love your name
---
you are giving me tombraider flashbacks :)
---
Yes, I use Mister Sandman as well as Covert Operative  with an Instigating Prime Crossbow &amp; as long as I sneak attack at night, it drops higher level enemies in 1-2 shots and usually always staggers my them because I also use Tank Killer. That makes up for the crappy fire rate.
---
Juice head?  Is that you?
---
And Tron Power Armor :p
---
What even what the point of this comment?
---
Uhm no i dont get near 400 carry weight. This is simply not true.
---
1 cap each?  Man do you know how amazing those are in survival?  Pump those numbers up my man
---
Weapons and armor plans that I don’t have.   Stable flux.  Ammo.
---
But I'll get my original asking price and at the same time help mitigate inflation even more by removing more caps from the cap economy
---
the reason that happens is the server is waiting for things in the server to calm down a bit so it can generate the contents of the "container" 
---
every single solitary item that exists on a fallout 76 server: the enemies, the random junk found in the world, the items in your and other players stashes and inventories all has to be kept track of simultaneously, hence why bethesda has only been increasing the stash limit by 200 every few months.
---
they have to make sure the servers can handle all the data without crashing.
---
Why would you pay? Just horde springs, screws and any other items and you can build dozens of power armour suits and for money it will be caps obviously
---
I would recommend still hiding it actually. There's stimm ways for people to wreck your camp ;)
---
He’s not your guy, friend
---
I just want them to be able to rest.
---
Rest mode never downloads the updates for me if it's the same day.
---
My crafting character uses a shielded vault 76 under armour.
---
So you like broken things to remain in the game. Got it!
---
Whilst I’ve got someone who seems to know what they are talking about, do you know if you can redo “one violent night” quest. I’d like to see if I can farm the reserve beer for my brewery ;)
---
1- PlayStation is a bitch when it comes to crossplay
---
2- PC hasn't got hackers (at least not in EU or i didn't see) but exploiters and modders are handful. 
---
3- at least it would be cool to trade with everyone, because only 10% of  traders play from PCs
---
I would be down for the camp refrigeration, otherwise if you’re worried about food spoiling, there’s always maxed Good with salt. 90% slower spoiling, aka it takes 10x longer to spoil. It’s a godsend if you regularly use crafted food or just are out there collecting spoilable materials for crafting stuff. And it works no matter what gear you do or don’t have equipped.
---
lol sh*t happens when you text and drive 😂
---
BECAUSE THEY’RE SHINY
---
Yes, I oppose all nerfs.
---
This. It's the same issue I have with people wanting to be able to swap out perk decks on the fly. 
---
There needs to be some trade offs or you limit difficult decisions. Games without difficult decisions are boring. 
---
I'm an ammo trader, but my build is a non PA DCG build. I trade off the additional carry bonuses and such to use my beloved DCG.  It means I can't bulk produce ammo as efficiently, but I had to make that trade off to work with the build I chose. 
---
I don't expect that my character should be able to be the best at everything. That's why Superman is boring AF.

Well I tried but no one offered.. sold some I already had actually.
---
I'd imagine the restriction is because they didn't want scrip sellable/tradeable to other people, and I don't think there's any overlap between characters on the same account other than the atom store recipes
---
I wont lie, you had me in the first half....
---
Great post, good info!
---
BGS has responded in another comment stating that it will be 30 slots PER MACHINE.  So four machines would be 120 slots.
---
Heavy weapons benefit from PA. And heavy weapons perk sre strength perks mostly. So... Thanks obama?
---
I leave my ps in rest mode all the time and my settings are set up for auto download, yet it never does it.. My storage isn't even close to full either..
---
Now THIS is the information we have all been waiting for
---
Yes they do. I get dupes frequently when crafting 45 cal
---
PS4 and my friends are getting dibs. I'll let you know after I finally get more paint jobs ;)
---
Android is limited to their Sony Xperia phones. Because well.. Sony is Sony.
---
I personally believe these cap limits are a jab at the dupers that have not been found out yet. This vending stuff will cause them to tip their hand. 🧐
---
I used to build there way back in the day because everyone was there, and i would just produce and sell water from the pond to people :p
---
Calibrated legs. Built to Max would be a good item and or upgraded parts.
---
Call it an advanced coloring system for desert combat. I dont use PA, It doesn’t affect me but give them a bone so we don’t have to hear about this for the next 6 months
---
Ahhh I'm on PS4 but all the best in your searching!
---
Yeah I agree. It seemed reasonable way back when I'd slay a group of lv68 mutants with one shot.
---
But on the other hand, with player vendors now, I'm sure finding people selling shells will be a breeze.
---
Lol ok. 
---
 They should just make all weapons one shot weapons, Then they don't need to nerf anything.
---
For my Heavy Weapons character, I aim for 2500 5mm for my Minigun (Tribarrel, so slower fire rate) and/or Gatling Gun, 5 Plasma Cores for my Ex Scatter Gatling Plasma (for crowd clearing during SBQ/Encryptid), and just recently, 0 power cells for my Furious Mr Handy Murder Blade (turns out, they're awesome with the electric mod and about 5 perk points spent right).
---
Normal gameplay, I'll got through 1000 5mm and 1 core in a few hours of gaming, depending on if I got gatling gun or just let loose with the minigun for fun.
---
No, on my rifle character, I know *exactly* what you're talking about. I make about 500 5.56 for my handmade, and 300 for my lever action, but it always feels like its not enough for a big event like SBQ. That's actually why I made the Heavy Weapons character, I got sick of making resource-costly ammo for modest damage.
---
No wonder I don’t have it then. I was told it was a mod only drop, and I haven’t been scrapping them. Thank you very much!
---
But one of the best parts about Grahm is the inevitable drawing and aiming your weapon at him only to realize it's your favorite neighborhood merchant coming to pay you a visit with his honest wares and tales about meat.
---
Are we talkin Venezuela poor?
---
**That sounds like socialism, son!**
---
I'd buy .308 for 1 cap each
---
Well at least now i have a reason to get rid of my nuka cola and ice machines
---
On mobile, go to the main page, hit the three dots on the top right and select “change user flair” :)
---
TRANQUILIZER TIP - GOODBYE TO ALL DEATHCLAWS
---
No fix for Lock and Load not working with Harpoon?
---
Well then i should just stop using all my heavy weapons? Ok
---
"Nuke Code Pieces: Removed the second item preview that appeared upon picking up a Nuke Code."
---
NUFF SAID
---
Who let the retards out of Allegheny Asylum
---
Dude murgle ftw
---
Works when cooking food too. Got two Deathclaw steaks from one meat last week. Yum!
---
We’ll probably set the quantity of item and the cost per item, just like with selling.  But that’s just my guess
---
only if he change big events. Some things are not changeable as a giant sun flare, asteriods, super vulcans. Or who said that he wasn't behind the end of the world the whole time?!
---
He's not your buddy pal
---
I WILL GLADLY PAY 1C FOR A DAMN SHOTGUN SHELL BOII. SHOTGUN SHELLS IS WHAT I NEED IN LIFE.
---
it might be possible but this entire game is an experiment for bethesda, a company which has up to this point only made single player offline games.
---
were all just guinea pigs running around for them to studie lol 🤣
---
we would all love for them to increase the stash caps and make the vendor's inventory bigger but its all a matter of seeing how far bethesda can push their engine before the world collapses into a black hole. 😁
---
Dope thanks man
---
Rip im on Xbox
---
Yep. Its a travesty other players have access to plans they would like. 
---
As far as I know treasure maps will still be the way to get power armor plans. But, ya know, worthless. Yeah.
---
You already have enough perks
---
Thank MelodicMutiny. Cheers!
---
Eff that noise.
---
Graham and Chally are free spirits! Roaming is in their hearts. 
---
Now getting Chally a cart to sit in while some other less awesome Brahmin tows her around? 
---
She'd be the queen pimp of pack animals.
---
Just promoting a fresh and nude wasteland.
---
It could be a locked shack that you cant enter because they are resting... they just need a home.
---
I just eat canned dog food and I never worry about spoiling. I thought refrigerator was a bit overhyped to begin with but to each their own
---
This is awesome, thanks a ton! I couldn't find this info and sort of liked seeing everyone with the missing textures in purple but figured it was time to update. Happy hunting!
---
Dang it.. I keep running into him too and never noticed
---
book 'em, Danno
---
Well wouldn’t it be pointless if they didn’t allow scrip to be traded but then allow the intended reward to be traded? I feel it’s linked to a degree.
---
Can't griefers shoot our turrets tho and initiate combat allowing them to then destroy our camp when the turrets start firing back?
---
First thing I will be buying, to complete my set.
---
I have so many sweet Plans laying around, hope to sell ‘em! Personally interested in plans, flux and dope weapons.
---
Like I said, if the user has max caps then people shouldn’t be able to use the machine. Simple as that, I don’t see why people are getting so mad.
---
Love it! Take my money, give the man a home.
---
Any news on fixing Bivs daily quest? Critical shots still do not register and it has been a long time since the quest line came out, unless I'm missing something?
---
What do you think subsidized housing is?
---
Eh, i sort of disagree about the flamer. You see the DPS on that thing? One of the only things holding it back from being OP is ammo, sort of like the LMG.
---
First time I saw BoE items was earlier World of Warcraft.  It’s been in the industry for ages.
---
My Current load out is simple; TSE Gatling Gun, Executioner and Explosive LMG, Weight Reduced Ski Sword and Guitar Sword for melee and a LAR. I also have a TSE tesla but it is only for nuke zone tagging
---
I have about 20,000 5mm , 8,000 .308 and 5, 000 .45 rounds. I'm building the .308 constantly and is all i'm building. Since i have bandoleer 5mm and a few others weigh nothing. All other ammo i drop for lower levels if i see them. I had close to 10,000 10mm from drops alone.
---
He's not your buddy friend!
---
oh REALLY well then that is something.
---
I leave mine unlocked free water to all travelers but yeah some people lock them
---
I've got shielded road leathers for the sneaks.
---
I did not notice that, wow!  The iphone app works flawlessly though and connects directly to the console.
---
I thought it meant altogether 30 divided by 4 which was a confusing number but holy hell that's a lot if its true
---
Get your math outta heeere /s
---
But all these are really easy to get
---
Play on Xbox but thanks!
---
Silly question... how did you get the faction next to your name I just now noticed it today... wth
---
Nah man, priest robes are my style
---
I've seen the legendary prestige stuff, but do you have a source on specializations? Sounds interesting!
---
Hmmm, weird. Mine usually does. . .when I remember to put it in rest mode lol.
---
He's not your pal chief
---
Give Ohio a chance...
---
When will the ps4 servers be up and going?
---
If they're smart, I'd say very little given it'll be attracting people to a wide variety of camps they never would've visited before. The better they can look and the more freedom people have to decorate/build them, the more 'wow' factor in the game.  
---
That said, it'll probably be 24% of build budget for each one, so your average 'shop' will consist of 4 vendors and a stash box,  heh
---
Gear Head lol
---
I changed 3 builds over 500 hours since the BETA. I played a lot with PA until i switched to bloodied/unyielding.
---
WOOO!!! 😄
---
I think an early form of The Pitt would be amazing.
---
Agreed, but if the plans are Grafton based that’s what it means.
---
Outside the nuka cole plant, just saw him stuck in a ditch it was quite funny
---
My last three deathclaws would like to talk to the manager then. I got them and died after the last patch. There was one i had 2 patches ago that yeah didn't turn red.
---
People were reportedly able to put in non-tradeable things like keys, that other people could then pick up.
---
All good points my friend. Still not sure what I'm gonna do. Got a bunch of different shit I wanna get rid of. But thanks for the help👍
---
Seems not having to wear a backpack would be a considerable benefit. They're aesthetically terrible.
---
You just want to double dip in weight increases.
---
Yeah that’s what I’ve seen on the wiki but I do want to farm that beer. I’ll have to look at my platinum guide but the thing is huge.
---
Any one seen anything from Beth about the time it will be back online?
---
Was outside of flatwood on the beta on my first day but didn't have much caps on me lol
---
Mostly this, but one run through the cavern usually yields enough for two repairs assuming you have appropriate perks, along with all the other scrap to find down there it's a good money run.
---
I wonder if this will include that junk node on the southwestern outskirts.  It was a great spot for an HQ between Ash Heap, Forest, and Whitespring.
---
Nah, because legendary items are already in 'the wild', but if scrip were tradeable, it would just be an alternate form of currency. THat's something Bathesda have been at great lengths to avoid.
---
Ffs
---
People would set up a base just at the edge of where the ghouls all spawn, and put up turret banks, which would then passively farm experience without the owner needing to lift a finger.  People that wanted to go there to farm would either be competing with the turrets for kills, or would find the place cleaned out before they even got there.
---
It's kind of like if I were to go into a specific farming area and say 'this space is mine, you can't farm here', then walking away and getting the experience for free.
---
Here we go lol
---
I’ll be selling them just outside of Whitesprings. 😊
---
Is this applicable to the entire whitesprings golf course? I have a friend who has a camp built near the edge of the golf course, by the yao guai cave. Is he screwed out of his location??
---
I feel it. Legendary version of the weapons that dont have legendaries. Like the sheepsqautch club.
---
Haha...I mean ..my condolences?
---
Behind Wade Airport, I almost shot him until I heard his dialogue was different from the usual mutants
---
True facts
---
I was worried about crossing the line and hurting peoples feelz
---
He was drunk.  I was drunk.  I don’t remember much beyond that.
---
Thank you :) . its really unclear.. I have repeatedly posted about pets on this sub, this subject stuggles to gain attention yet if fixed and improved upon would greatly increase gameplay for many of us Pet Tamers... Its sad to see this aspect get neglected because if it was fully functional ' dare i say it ' but Bethesda could also make a few bucks from pet related cosmetics.. Unique Skins or fancy Dog Kennels, Im one of those that would buy a Pink fluffy Cat collar for my pet Cat, lolz.
---
I forgot about that.
---
Thanks for the info, I had no clue we had a Maintenance status page on Bethesda.
---
That is pretty impressive my man. I spent ages server hopping back in December I think. 2 Jet Packs, 2 Shocks after too many times. Now I leasurely check once a session.
---
They do have the fair grounds in the forest area. Plus, Camden Park
---
I once found 3 gnomes with axes gathered around a skeleton somewhere in the savage divide.
---
Yeah that is frustrating - I hopped and got a snallygaster and not like 30 minutes later some jerk ran by and killed him :/ but I have another one now and he's doing fine! I just really wish we could find higher leveled pets at the random spawns - because my snally is only level 14 and my deathclaw the highest I got was 21 :/ so I think if their levels would go up some that would really help from randoms just poking them - or other wild spawns killing them. I always struggle because anglers like to spawn near my camp D:
---
But they change the explosive effect for every other weapon. They forgot/missed shotguns. it's just a small fix that had to happen.
---
Let all the vendors bots or otherwise have homes, lbr. WS isn’t unique enough.
---
But MooMoo deserves a pen with some hay already.
---
I use 45s and 5.56 and get twitchy if I get under 2k of either. It also helps me not fat finger dump the wrong ammo as I'm always dumping the ammo I pick up into overseers caches.
---
True but there’s also the point that all of those “snoody aristocrats” bit the dust there for Graham, wait all these caps should go for Graham to purchase Whitesprings. Who else would be better? We have a large room for his personal shop and a nice accommodation for Moo Moo
---
Yeah it's not that complicated
---
Right now!
---
Well, alcohol.
---
i was thinking that is kind of what the Chemed tip would do, making them sluggish slows them down and reduces damage (bigger creatures it wears off sooner, may not effect robots)
---
Annoying, mostly. I never camped there too, but I heard that people would build turret camps there and kill steal the ghouls, passively gaining XP and denying others the same.
---
So much acid tho
---
Stop
---
More to come if we do not have a timer or the time frame for the Maintenance status reflecting on the game.
---
No weight, it is a currency.
---
Wow, Reddit shadow censor
---
Only if you use Excavator with calbr socks, other PA sets don't give you that amount.
---
When it is. Could be any min.
---
Don't know why the downvotes, it's a reasonable and polite enough question.
---
In short, this game is vastly improved over launch. A lot of the bugs and problems have been fixed (like the laser/plasma weapon durability woes), there is a fair bit of content added, and this patch adds a but of much wanted stuff (legendary scrip, player vending, and blocking friggen whitesprings turret camps).
---
I really hope it makes a sound
---
Were folks getting blacked out due to Vintage Nukashine being in the bowls?
---
Oh, good. A couple of minutes passed since last same post. I was getting worried.
---
Hell just give PA users a little buggy/cart to stroll around with.
---
I kind of took that from the patch notes too.  It says Whitesprings Golf Club, Whitesprings Resort, so maybe some of the greens further from the clubhouse may still be available.  I'm fine with that.
---
Lets go
---
That’s going to be my vending machine lol.
---
Lol change your name to either Bob the Builder or some play on words
---
I dunno, they look kinda huge even on the power armor if you ask me.
---
Destroying a wall isn't been kind to others or helping others now is it?
---
I'am kind to others and help others out. Just the other day I spent about 2 hours sever hoping activating the Free Range event and then messaging people in the lobby to let them know it was up and going. 
---
I've come across many locked bases. I don't need to destroy walls to get into them in I want to get into them. I just keep walking to the nearest place that I know has a bench I can scrap at. OR I equip my PA and then fast travel
---
We can still build him a home, but Chally the Moo-Moo gets a little stir crazy without her daily walks. 
---
Maybe we get a current location of Graham annnd he has a Vending Machine at his place?
---
Hopefully people see this and don’t want to be “that guy” like you
---
I think it solves the vendor time left issue
---
Best idea I’ve seen on this sub. I would actually pull my wallet out for this idea. I’m already imagining the bad ass designs like a nuke cola themed one, maybe some teeth and eyes like on old bomber planes, or even just a classy pinup girl like those old planes as well.
---
even if you look at the ingame menu that gives you the error, in the top right it says they brought the game offline for maintenance.
---
Why are you defending them? We have been asking for this for literally months. They managed to do it with hardened mass after ONE patch. If you can take the time to make this post then you can take a couple secs to remember how long this bug has been in the game for no reason at all.
---
I just noticed it recently that they were no longer red because my deathclaw was murdered as well so I just got a new pet and his bar isn't red anymore. I hope they can be non-damageable with the camps now because that would make me really happy.
---
FIRST
---
You can't believe different people are confused by a cryptic message?
---
Thanks for telling me
---
That's mean, I just made my camp there so I could easily get to the Whitsprings Bunker and shopping center
---
I have ammosmith maxed but sounds like super duper is something i need.
---
I saw someone say in another thread that PS only checks for updates every 24 hours. No idea if it's true.
---
Agreed! The jukebox at Dane’s plays country, throw that in there too.
---
You get 250pounds Of carry weight at 15 strength no calibrated shocks, 350 with shocks, but you can easily get 280 carry weight with pocketed armor, not to mention the weapon weight and chem and junk reducing effects, PA needs love, like more defense mods? Or defense perks? Or guns you can only use in power armor like a oversized cannon or machine gun,
---
So? Even the trading perk only works when trading,that's why you're allowed to swap them. Same for the team perks.
---
You’re the best
---
Even better... a quick google search of ‘temperature in mines’ shows that they can reach ‘life threatening levels’ at the bottom of a mine shaft.
---
She's been on her feet forever. She could use a break every once in a while.
---
I may have to steal your spot!!! Very nice btw
---
Aesthetics...
---
Glad this is happening, TSE were op.
---
Yea that i the reason
---
no i cant believe people cant look at the top right of the screen where it says they brought the game offline for maintenance.
---
It would be funny if the devs referenced the wasteland sales tax the next time they introduce a new area or element to the game.
---
If you're dying in PVE in any sort of half decent armor, you're bad, REAL bad :p
---
Best comment 😂
---
Pretty sure the punch bowls were an early test for the party kegs too, it'll give them time to iron out the bugs
---
Evidence?
---
You can tame animals that spawn alone at random spawn points with Wasteland Whisperer (level 3) or Animal friend (level 3) depending on the animal (i don't have a list sorry) and they will go live at your camp.
---
If they released other vault suits for the other vaults in the game, or novelty throw back vault suits from other games in the atomic shop, would you still rock vault 76? Or which would you rather wear?
---
Pretty sure it is just 4 different cosmetics for the vending machine
---
Smart move. I've found more money in ammo than scrap though. With ammo smith and super duper, caps come easy.
---
That being said, I would buy every bit of your acid lol.
---
They are on now
---
Last
---
Could still be okay because of the wording in the patch notes, just have to see
---
The whole place is just covered in wasteland junk and MEAT.
---
Wtf? I USE heavy weapons. It's my build. What should i switch it to?
---
8008135
---
Grahm has that plan. Just got one from him a couple weeks back. ;)
---
there is a quest in the mire where you can get a unique legendary fat man with a 90% weight reduction.
---
Nope not kind but neither is locking every door in an apocalypse and being greedy is it?
---
We aren’t having a kindness war dude 😅 I make maxed out weapons and armor and leave them in the overseers camp along with food, water, building supplies and ammo. Spend 1700+ caps for imposter sheepsquatch and message everyone to come, invite them to team for fast travel, drop my known plans in the icebox at whitesprings station. Give away the legendaries I don’t want to lower levels so they can either use or sell them. 
---
So I don’t know why you’re trying to make me look like a bad guy. I’m just trying to understand the reason for this, and especially after this new patch why people will keep them locked.
---
Bear arms is the best. At one point I had 3 miniguns, 5 fat mans, and 3 missile launchers on me for roughly the same weight as a modded Handmade
---
Whos your target market? High or low level players?
---
As a &gt; L50 player, I need stable flux, certain plans, some materials.   
---
 Weapons and armor....depend on price and how the legendary vendor works.
---
As a lower level, I would think food, water, materials, armor, mid-level weapons
---
Yeah, apparently it's game breaking and unthinkable.
---
Grahms gonna have a mansion in no time
---
Regardless of what came before (I'm looking at you, trolls...), this shows a dedication to the game that many of us were worried about.  I'm heartened to see that everyone is sticking with it, listening to the community, and trying to make this game a good example of what Fallout can be.
---
Stable Cobalt flux, three of em, so I can have shielded suit yes
---
Also guns and armors
---
Also disease cures. All of them
---
Ok I’ll look into that. ;)
---
I guess the initial idea was to not let people use heavy gun outside PA. But variety won
---
Spruce knob is in game, and there's a cave called Hawke's Refuge or something like that?
---
Valseek confirmed in the thread that you can still tame Deathclaws but with Wasteland Whisperer - so that’s something at least
---
I think I'd rather see it at 50% of their values, but always on?
---
I was just thinking the other day how my 308 pipe rifle and 308 hunting rifle were nearly identical.  This ought to settle that!
---
Ya but buying them took more effort.
---
This is the game the dev’s advertised on release. It’s kind of annoying if they are backsliding on that.
---
You have to find a randomly spawned scout corpse....
---
Maybe it can be implemented in random quests. Brotherhood quest. Jump on vertibird do 10 or 15 min mission return
---
That sounds horrible.  The only reason to take a workshop is for resources.  If I have to stay in the workshop to get the resources I might as well go farm somewhere else.  The benefit of workshops is it is farming non-stop for you.
---
Probably a glitch.
---
So YOU were the one!  ;-)
---
My only question is.... does this effect taming creatures? I need to know before I wast another 2 hours searching just to find something I want and be unable to tame.
---
The changes do not apply to gatling plasma, I think, or so the patch notes claim. I've been pretty far removed from the game, so I could be interpreting it or your comment wrong.
---
You know you can start the download right when it goes down for maintenance....
---
Exactly. The minigun skin is nice, how about some love for other heavy guns.
---
hint: its towards the top right of the map.
---
So happy they actually did this.
---
That'll probably have to wait until the Legendary Player system comes out, and we get some new Perks.
---
Thanks!...... I, uh, guess.
---
Can't I upvote you sir over 9000 times?
---
Oh don't worry. I don't need to try making you look bad. You are doing all the work for me.
---
I saw mods but I don’t remember it saying plans
---
The only thing I’m learning by this post is to lock all my stuff up so others can’t use or take
---
Can you comment how much scrip you get per item?  Or per star?
---
Yea I kinda wish it wasn't happening but oh well. I might start phasing my shotgunner perks out to free up for some other perks more universal perks.
---
What server do you play on that you meet people with microphones? The only people I meet are either mute or they don't speak English.
---
where is the machine?
---
You my friend deserve more upvotes than I can give....damn near spit my drink out!
---
He's not your friend champ
---
Did they take drills and syringers out of the legendary loot pool?
---
train stations
---
I was the Mad undead Rogue Engineer who like to blow shit up. I terrorized Gorefiend server.
---
Yeah, this turned out to be a really good patch. The last update had patch notes that felt kind of lacking, and I was worried Bethesda's bug slaying spree might have been slowing down. Pleasantly glad to be wrong!
---
*Bethesda wants to know your CAMP location.*
---
Yes why do i get so much hate? I don't get it
---
They're not in a horrible place.  They do need some love, but with the right perks they're pretty decent.
---
Good lord, get over it.
---
Its only a skin
---
You're not going to be able to sell anything over than 25k realistically (well, plus 10%) for one, so remember that.
---
I suspect we'll start to see a baseline relation tied to scrip as well.
---
not once have i seen the power armor guy actually hit the other person
---
5 scrip each for my 1* items
---
I also have a gross amount of gears. Just gears though. Probably double my other junk.
---
Yeah lol
---
Thanks for the tip. I’m off to bed as it’s 3.20am I’ll  finish the brewery setup tomorrow :P 
---
cheers
---
Thanks. I hope I can get those BoS leg plans!
---
Fairly certain that's a skin, friend
---
Honest to god, I can't stand it's silly vids... Have him blocked
---
I didn't say nobody would buy it or want it, just that 1k is nowhere near a reasonable price, especially for a level 25 10mm pistol.
---
They’re both skins, it even says they are...
---
Oh wow. This is bad. Bastards have organized.
---
That's pretty much exactly what a skin is, and the bone raider is already a custom model so......
---
No its not those are skins bro
---
I server hopped Wavy Willards's about 20 times before finding it, and that was after fast traveling a few places trying to find it more "naturally". Pretty much you're just going to have to keep hopping until you find it. I recommend Willard's because you can see the body from where you load in as long as you can jump up and see the first car on the right.
---
.... alright kiddo, enjoy the new patch.
---
Train station posters when game is back online
---
They have stated there will be collection shelves/displayes/ect in the near future (originally they just said "decorate your camp with item in your inventory", which would be nice but unlikely given the current system).
---
Same here, an be built too!
---
Definitely breaks it. I took it out of my combat perk decks because it breaks most damage mutations (my unarmed guy who doesn’t even have adrenal reaction, but does have twisted muscles and talons, takes a pip-boy damage hit if I equip  SiN). 
---
It’s amazing for exploration though. Thank the modder for Perk Loadout Manager.
---
Of course not. Idk what you expected
---
Cool thanks downvote this post and I will too so it's not seen by a lot of people.
---
Xbox update is up
---
Lol glad you enjoyed it
---
I definitely agree with you on making them tougher. I personally think they should be destructible no matter what, but they definitely need to improve on the health.
---
I’d say that once a creature is pacified they drop nothing if killed within a camp. I’m hopping that they would be part of the camp update and protected.
---
Yao guai, gulper, angler. There's always a possibility for us to see more animals added in the future.
---
Pumpkins are a bit of an odd duck.  they can be grown, but you have to find a gourd to plant, not a pumpkin.
---
i think those are just skins, no need to worry
---
It literally says they’re skins.
---
Naive because i want my $60 game to work? Ok, asshole.
---
That seems fair, there should be some sort of cap.  Hopefully it isn't a super long timer.
---
I dont downvote it
---
I will, Thanks :D
---
So is cait outfit from fo4 in fo76 now?
---
Thx.
---
That gives me another option when I find him again.
---
Ouch. So that's the time limit.
---
"cries in console"
---
I have plans for the chest piece and have no idea where I even got them. Seemed like it was early game. I'm positive it didn't come from a vendor though.
---
I enjoy this game when it works, too. I just want it to work more often.
---
yup see yah!
---
the server maintenance is done so i'm off to build my store lol
---
see you in appalachia vault dweller!  😁
---
Interesting. Wonder if that is calculated per shot? Meaning if you get hit by an auto it would negate any armour due to the number of bullets. 
---
Also personally I find it a bit sad that people still perceive everyone with matching armour to be either a griefer or a duper. There are a lot of people who have spent a long time trading to get a matching set. They weren't always so expensive and so people who were involved from day one had a greater chance than you would now to trade/find a set from drops. If the market rate for armour is screwed up then it isn't really down to the players that's down to Bethesda and their drops. 
---
I've said it before and I'll say it again.. add stuff to the game to balance it don't just take things away. It will alienate some people no doubt. Especially with all the trashing that goes on about people having matching sets and others who haven't played as much not having one. 
---
All up for balancing though as long as it's fair. No one should be completely immune from all damage.
---
Also part of the issue is even if someone is wanted sometimes they will have to shoot you once before you can damage them fully. Tried and tested it. I'm guessing that's the real issue with griefers getting away with stuff. ✌
---
I hope so.. I might try to test it with a friend and see
---
As excited as we are, let’s pump the brakes. We have no idea how much a legendary may cost? Will it be 100 scripts or 1000 ? I don’t see bethesda making this less grindy to obtain legendary that we desire.   Also will the vendor carry all items or select few that’s released weekly kinda like Xur from destiny.
---
Thanks and for the tips as well.
---
Hope everyone enjoys the new content!
---
You are very lucky
---
They still have the option of placing camps near popular random encounter areas.
---
Camping beside Charleston Station prevents that special vender from spawning.
---
Lol 😂
---
yeah, i can't say it's not fair, it was premature of me to unload everything off my mule in preparation
---
&gt;Edit: This also opens a venue for buying ammo from vendors. Currently my guess is no one's EVER bought ammo from a vendor bot. Those prices are just stupid.
---
I have.  Early survival days it was a great way to dump excess caps so when I got killed they didn't get anything. 
---
Now I pay 4 caps per shell because caps I can find everywhere, plastic not so much.
---
My STASH box shall remain full it seems...
---
It's just skins available for it. If you go onto your build menu it's automatically unlocked.
---
It is skin....... Lol, read....
---
Yeah, there needs to be some kind of reason to not just use 2H or Unarmed.  Skyrim made it work by allowing you to equip a shield/spell/dual wield while using a 1h weapon.  Honestly, if they introduced shields into FO76 it would perhaps justify using a 1h weapon.  You'll never do as much damage as a 2H, but they could get creative with the shields to make it worth it.  Plus it would be badass to run into battle with a shishkebab in one hand and a roadsign/car door/garbage can lid in the other.
---
Its a skin
---
Your welcome! I also recommend looking for a corpse of a young woman in a tattered dress in Charleston. It’s starts a fascinating quest line, first one is called Into The Mystery, if I remember correctly.
---
Not hating just saying that with severs that can only hold 800 stash capacity I doubt they would be able to have a fast form of transport any time soon though I would be down
---
No, it has not
---
It's a *very rare* result from scrapping, so it may take a while. You can also find it sometimes as a world drop, but those tend to get picked up quick by other users who know where to look.
---
I’m lost now, any suggestions for a good house? I’m not a turret farmer I swear.
---
They're so believable it hurts.
---
Thank you for the full list. An amazing number of people just leave it at "update your list."
---
This ^^^, dont think people should panic, its just easier than to do it through a plan method. Free on atom shop is easy
---
While you're not at all wrong (and honestly, the second thing I thought about putting in a punch bowl was Nuka Shine, right after high radiation fluids...), but Bethesda has to take into account the new user experience.
---
I've had plenty of games that I've looked into, had a horrible first-time impression, and just walked away.  Any good game studio keeps things like that in mind.  If the punch bowls were being used to harass or grief new users, it's good that it's being looked at.
---
Worked thx👍
---
They weren't awarded XP but could loot the bodies if their turrets hit them.
---
Oh yes, but not in featured..?
---
Yeah they didn't need to nerf the assassin effect.   The problem came from these two effect combined on a full set, which was a terrible idea in my opinion, just like two shot explosive weapons. 
---
I mean, in Fallout 4, you NEVER saw two shot and explosive on the same weapon. And that was a SINGLE PLAYER  game for chrissake.    I will never understand what made them think that putting TWO over powered effects on the same weapon was a good idea in a PVP game. 
---
Same with legendary armor effects. Sentinel and assassins were two completely different effects, never on the same piece of armor- that's in Fallout 4.  
---
Combining them together in a game with PVP just seems like pure insanity.
---
Unless WS turret camps function differently than every other camp location they definitely get loot.
---
Unrelated but relevant, Canned Coffee is the best drink in the game.
---
Reposted to my sub r/FO76onXB1
---
F these shadow censoring bs'ers.
---
build it Quick. i doubt they can delete it once it’s in you’re camp
---
As I said.  There are ways of doing it.  This will just make it easier and cleaner.   Because it makes it easier, I think that well be seeing a lot more of them.
---
Those bounty hunters sound cool asf where do I sign up lol
---
That's the Hornwright Strike Breaker skin, not Nukashine. Details and backstory can be found in the Hornwright mansion.
---
How about an area map like the glow in the dark one but it has a dot or zone representing where grahm and moo moo are currently located. The make it when he’s at his shack, he has special items.
---
I am curious to see what the doubling effect fix was. It could be that the bigger nerf is that fix and not the 75% activation mech.
---
It's likely a holdover from Fallout 4's code. It's been in game since launch, but there isn't any Legendary PA in game.
---
I can. I do it all the time when I’m having fun playing instead of playing arm chair game developer.
---
the nuke zone counts as rad storms for challenges now  muchacho you read it wrong
---
Any info on when the temporary suspended players will be able to play again?
---
Where are the machines? At stations?
---
You could use the small letter plan to do this. That's what I'm planning on doing depending on how the ammo sales work after the patch.
---
Lunch box debacle 2.0 commencing in 3.. 2.. 1..
---
I said the same thing to people are so dumb but in less words
---
Huh. This actually looks like a good patch. Can't believe I'm actually considering re-installing this game...
---
My Ps4 has had downloading issues with Fo76 since the beginning. I have the space just wouldnt download till i freed up more?
---
Yes, completely different departments with completely different goals.
---
I could be wrong, but I am under the impression, and empirically I may dare to say, that it does. I often find more 2 and 3 star legendary gear when running almost dead (more luck stat) than when full luck.
---
So I'm guessing this will be a situation where you sell these for scrip and get a random roll at the category (out of the things you see above), so I scrap 30 knives spears and other assorted garbage, get one shot at a 3 star piece of armor, and then when it's shit break it down.
---
Oooh, if that's half as much fun as my instigating gauss rifle I bet it just makes heads pop left and right
---
I somehow ended up with two lead champagnes in my fermenter. Definitely only made one.
---
its even encouraged through perk cards... yet people still think any negative player interaction is greifing
---
Yeah I was amazed when I read the notes, they hit on 90% of the complaints I see on a daily basis.
---
TBH I did exactly this when my 3* TSE Handmade was nerfed from 600+ to 150 per shot.  Literally dropped the gun in a brown paper bag and quit for 2 mos for the Anthem Hype(all hype no glory there.)  Admitedly a major overreaction.  
---
Came back a few weeks ago.  Traded my old Bloodied/Unyeilding Gear for a 2* TSE Handmade to start a Sneak/Sniper Respec and that gun is amazing.  
---
To anyone asking I traded a full set of Unyeilding and a couple bloodied weapons for one gun, because I wanted to *start over* without actually starting over.
---
Within a week the 10% tax will make enough money to buy him whitesprings.
---
Which and where?
---
Yeah they sell them at every Lowes and Home Depot. Not joking.
---
Where lol
---
?
---
I like the special items at his shack a lot.
---
Fuck... I mean I get it, but that means I still have over a month worth of daily exchanging to do.
---
BOS armor plans too?
---
Phew. Thank goodness it isn’t like the histrionic complaining then, huh?
---
First to the Front.
---
Thats what I did :D
---
Same here. Have been to 3 stations and no machines. Whitesprings, Watoga, And R&amp;G Stations.
---
Wait there’s tax in the game?
---
There is a 150 script limit no idea if it resets daily or weekly
---
Mathing is hard.
---
This make easy.
---
Pretty disappointed about Backpacks not working inside PA, because that really kills all interest I had in the Pioneer Scouts quests.
---
But other than that this looks like it'll be a great patch 👍
---
I used to have a Camp next to the stream that crosses the greens area, behind the houses and the club. It was a nice area to settle and not botter anyone and go out of your way to farm the resort. 
---
Good riddance to those turret farmers. You won't be missed. Glad for this change
---
Is combat armor dense torso plan one of them?
---
Considering there's been a flux of aimbotting on PC due to bethesda lack of being able to detect it, and people even posting videos of them doing it with no backlash, nah I'm goof.
---
There is literally this same exact post once every hour of every day.
---
I wonder what they broke this time, maybe the friends list lol
---
That would 've been so awesome
---
I wonder if they added anything new to turning in technical data!
---
There are a lot of these posts every day, scroll down a bit. Too may opinions to go through
---
This really makes me regret selling the junkie's explosive pipe bolt action I picked up last night :(
---
Disconnected twice in 5 minutes, not that much of an improvement.
---
Wait,  ALL of white springs?  I thought they just set a no build near the actual buildings.
---
Sorry to hear that, things have been so smooth for me so far
---
Not the best thing I nut to...........
---
Where
---
Was afraid of this.
---
Today they implanted a 10% tax in player vending. If you sell something for 1000 caps then the buyer will pay 1000, you will get 900, and 100 will just straight up be deleted.
---
Try Berkley springs
---
Not at Pleasant Valley, for me, but heading to WS
---
It would seem you read my post wrong. I could care less about an Atom store challenge. :P
---
Tiananmen Square exposed the people of China to the tyranny of the state! 
---
Liberty Prime is online. All systems nominal. Weapons hot. Mission: the destruction of any and all Chinese communists.
---
It's there
---
No just the club
---
There is one at Whitesprings, on the railroad side
---
You're right in that regard, i wasn't in the right mindset to be reading these threads at the time that i replied and i took it all wrong, sorry.
---
Or a place to shoot up and take a free shit.
---
But only while he’s there! Since you can find him on the map, we want to keep his special items to random encounters with him at his shack. But it shouldn’t let you know when he’s there.
---
Sure why not.
---
Perhaps this serenade one the world’s smallest violin will bring you comfort.
---
Yikes. Not gonna touch any of touch if i can't inspect
---
yeah, i unloaded my 1*s first because it seemed to be more efficient at removing weight to hit the daily max. 3*s are dense in terms of scrip per weight
---
7200 caps richer you will be...
---
Revolt of the 7.
---
I appreciate awesome new skins, I really do. But is it really necessary to get three fire axe skins? Two additional pickaxe skins on top of the existing one? Three additional pump action skins, two of which look almost identical? Super popular weapons like the handmade, .50 cal, gauss rifle, gatling gun, and combat shotgun don't have any skins yet. I get it's responder themed, but surely the fire axe is not used often enough to merit that many skins
---
Checking WS for these now
---
Sorry for the rude comment, it's just we see 5+ of these every single day, it's like either play it or don't. lol.
---
For me it's gotten a lot better. I'm on satellite internet, and I almost never get a server drop anymore. I used to get one anytime I tried to even look at a SBQ, now I can do 3 back to back and loot everything. I think in the beginning the longest I could be on a server without a drop was like an hour. Now I regularly can be on the same server for 9+ on a day off when I'm not server hopping to find something specific. 
---
Population wise, the servers are always full. I don't know how many players there are, (wish I did) but since it's just however many per server, it doesn't really matter if there's like 100K playing. The market subreddits are pretty full, so that means to me the game is pretty full. 
---
Plus with today's update, we're getting all kinds of neat stuff, like player vending kiosks for our CAMPs, which I'm pretty excited about. 
---
What platform would you be playing on?
---
Reddit is now overwhelmed with armor exclusive users that got their OP sent gear nerfed, and they are pissed.
---
tbh yeah because ive seen it, and also personal experience when i dont realize how much it built up. also because not everyone wants to waste perk points on weight reduction unless really necessary. and if youre blowing through 1400 caps in a day consistently, then scrap the weapons or do something else or just straight up drop stuff you dont need if you dont need the caps.
---
It's still basiclu the same game lmao
---
The problem was people who were putting camps literally on the grass 30 feet outside the back door of the golf course "clubhouse" (the main building). Ghouls spawn near that door and can be lured out by the turrets - and if you manage to have that camp there during a nuke event, they're all glowing ones, with many legendaries included. People were getting insane amounts of loot by having their camp turrets stacking bodies up like cordwood at the back door, then they could come in and grab all the loot for themselves.
---
Any idea where the BOS Combat plans are? Checked both the BOS and Watoga vendors and they don't have them.
---
My carry weight goes down from 370 to 350 when I climb into PA because I lose the strength boost from my unyielding armor.
---
ESAD
---
Or those stories of people leaving bags of pooh on beds.  I don't need that!  I sleep there!
---
There have been SO many of these lately. Was fo76 mentioned recently in some popular game sphere? I wonder what brought all these people here all at once. Or maybe all these posters were also finishing up their school year?
---
Gotta get every last dime out of those artists
---
Be nice to know for sure, but I expect it’s 4 stations in the same manner as MODUS. Simply to allow multiple buyers support.
---
I typically run around with cooked scorchbeast products on me all the time, and they seem to last forever(aka a few RL days for me), but I guess it depends how much real time you spend in game.
---
The camp refrigeration would be awesome because whether good with salt, backpack refrigeration potential PA refrigeration mod, etc., you have to have items on you, as soon as you stash them, they’re good as gone. :(
---
I’d give so much just to be able to safely store stuff. Plus, maybe they would play nice with player vending and we could actually sell spoilable products in our stores without worrying they’d all spoil before anyone bought it.
---
Also, I don’t know if you got the recipe from the fasnacht event, but the fasnacht donuts never spoil, and have an awesome food/weight ratio. Only problem is tracking down cooking oil can be a pain, especially since “scrap all junk” is very much your enemy.
---
But they’re great if you just want extra backup food to not starve, in case you run out of your normal diet of whatever.
---
Glad I piled those legendary knives, tambos, and knuckes deep then.
---
Same and same hahah well I had a well round set up but im gonna have to change it up maybe..again 😂
---
True and it's something I rarely see.
---
Username checks out.
---
7.5 items per machine. Cut the item in two.
---
I actaully dont like the tse shotguns.
---
It makes me really curious as to what the problem was. XD
---

---
Here's hoping it's the good terminal model and not the current one (I'm cool with a swappable one too)
---
Pc good sir
---
That sucks, sounds like a PS4 issue?
---
Yeah, I know how it is. I used to clear West Tek so quick one shotting every Super Mutant with my TSE Lever and TSE 10mm. When the nerf came and I saw how little damage I was doing, I left that character for a couple of months and focused on leveling another. After a while I came back and now I'm one shotting muties again, but with another build.
---
That’s pretty unesscary. Bethesda is petty reasonable when a next patch comes around. They will prob remove it.
---
People who realize the game is better/previously fed into the youtube hype. Either way it boils down to being too lazy to read anything themselves
---
No one found actual Legendary PA, they just found reference to it in the files for the vendor :) wasn’t very clear there haha
---
I love and hate this. Glad my sniper will get a damage boost, but sad at 3000 rounds of .308 ammo I've crafted and collected is going to be worthless. Then glad again that .50 is cheap to make.
---
LOL wow they killed the one fun thing PVP related then...
---
Not really with pacifist mode on. Once vending machines are placed, the player is invincible unless you initiate combat with the other player who tries to attack.
---
No didn’t have them for me either, gonna jump a few times
---
Yeah, now I am wondering what he upper limit on scrip is per character. I'd be surprised if it was unlimited, but hopefully it's not just a couple thousand. I've been saving legendary items since before they even announced the purveyor, in hopes this stuff would eventually have a use.
---
Which shouldn't be neccessary if they bothered releasing a stable, tested game. But I guess that's asking for too much.
---
That makes more sense. Ok, im still sad as a shotguner but it happens. Still love the game.
---
 Hallelujah!
---
To be fair, neither would a Fat Man, but I somehow manage to hide one of those 😆.
---
Still more patch notes than anthem.
---
They may be skins for the fridge and station as well, since they have multiple entries.
---
Yeah I figured it didn’t complete for that reason. But yeah, the challenges won’t pop and I’m missing out on like 100 something atoms lol
---
This is intended. They are saying that it "promotes a healthy game economy". A lot of players seem to support it. I don't though.
---
Not really easy to have insane amount of caps if your vending machine doesn't have the stuff people look for.
---
People ask for 50k because there are people who played hard enough and are smart enough to have saved that much. 
---
In order to please the casual players who play two hours a week and complain about the caps price of top tier items, you limit everyone's ability to earn and store caps, that's socialism and communism approach and it always kill the economy.
---
However, the "Extra Large Magazine" mod now partially blocks the sight ring when aiming. 
---
Honestly, I thing it was easier to aim with the incorrectly aligned sight than this now partially blocked one since I could at least see what I was trying to aim at.
---
Don't forget the Barbed Mod 👍 aka a spade bit 🤣
---
Definitely will be running this event more often.
---
Have they fixed the 'firing one shot then.. stopping' bug too?
---
I feel like my money's going for those nice backpacks even though I really want that travel sticker pipboy.
---
The real best part of the update
---
Seriously?? Can they do anything right?
---
I noticed this, honestly think it's fair though, gives a reason to keep the standard mag.
---
Graft on used to be the place to find them. The trading post was Responders but BoS were in the Toxic Valley first, during their period of recruitment.
---
A little less Sanjay in my ear is always a good thing. Hello Responders!
---
The building of my camp was blocked by a 76 update.
---
I moved the camp to the other side of the flowing water, and I actually could.
---
What a sweet silent addition.
---
This is one of those perplexing bugs that lingers around.  They fixed it with vendors, but it continues to happen for player trades and now player vending.
---
I never craft more than 1k / ammo type... it's enough to last me weeks
---
We totally need this.
---
I've been waiting for that ever since I got that gold mesh somethingnucleic power armor chest in fallout 4. So many years later, it's finally happening
---
do you hate fun
---
I didn't say it was a bad game, I said it was a joke. And the joke is getting very old now.
---
I didn't think this would trigger anybody but damn, good things do not have "annoying flaws" dude.
---
ign garlandtd hit me up in game at 800 hours its kinda what I do now for fun, the queen is boring and tedious for me and I dont really care to just go kill things like a farmbot, I dont mind the pvp at workshops. usually they ganke me the first time. then i come back and try for round two. after that I avoid them if I can or server hop. I build close to or withing shop budget so it ddoesnt break my junk stash. unless im heavy then ill get extravagant with the base to burn up junk.
---
Just region lock China at this point.  /s
---
Thank you! That's always my goal!
---
The Grafton vendor had them before before they were removed from the inventory lists. Check there for them.
---
But it's still OP. Like some players literally didn't receive any dmg. How the **** did they think this isn't gonna get nerfed
---
Heads count as limbs though, and I would assume it is a whole body stat that each piece can proc, like autostim does regardless of the part that gets hit.
---
Ill test this when I can
---
Moo Moo needs a nice pen covered from the sun with a good old pile of hay.
---
I can't tell if you don't get my Starbucks joke or if you are hilarious.
---
I should have played on PC just to have a hotkey for canned coffee. Wouldn't ever need powered armor, move at full speed over all the mountains. And it gives as much water as purified and weighs less. Truly underrated and needs to be talked about more lol
---
i wish we could craft mods for weapons and armor to sell, id become a pa dealer
---
I support this!
---
I love it already
---
Provided you do not have the two on hit mutations or the plague aura mutation they can punch you all day and never force you to pvp.  I believe it still wrecks your armor though, which is expensive too.  And that's all little Billy wants is to know he upset you or made your day worse.  I would have paid double for the game if I didnt have to ever see another Billy again.
---
I'm ready to start kiting enemies to bases :D
---
Short answer: No. You will not be able to use that account ever again.
---
whoot ty for that info.
---
For those of us at work, what’s new with fast travel?
---
You can still PVP.
---
But now, twatgoblin assholes can't grief by starting to take it then teleport to the owner and kill them over and over.  Or by sending friends to the owners location, starting to take it, and they kill the owner.
---
The PVP is still there.  You just have to do it in an arena.
---
They just got rid of the griefing...which is what I suppose you are going to miss, right?
---
It looks like a chia pet.
---
That’s exactly where my camp is! I love the cute pond and the building but I’m pretty annoyed with the Bloodrage mirelurks that keep attacking my Brahmin 
---
I’m glad to hear it will still be there when I log in
---
I'm with you, but the reality is there's going to be 10 people there doing lord knows what, which is going to utterly mess with your formula. 
---
I wish more people would group with randoms, though. My main group person was my brother, but he doesn't play as much anymore, so I'm normally just playing by myself. #sadface
---
True. I’ve seen videos of people on PC using wall hacks to get easy kills in survival. Obviously, not all PC players are cheaters, but it is easier to cheat on PC than on console.
---
Is it actually happening though? I feel like this would be too good
---
Am I the on ly one sick of all the Excavator PA paints? There  are suits besides that and X01....
---
Support from The Order is always appreciated.
---
Defintiely a bummer! but I understand the choice coming from both it being an online game with other players vs the normal fallout experience where you're basically god by the end, and of course the issues with duping and these weapons becoming so commonplace.
---
I bought my TSE lever action a week before the nerf and I still look back on those beautiful few days with that boom stick of death with nostalgia lol
---
Still no sturdy/heavy metal armor plans available for purchase, it seems.
---
I was getting 9 per one star w hard bargain
---
Have you ever shot a mini nuke at your own feet and walked out of the explosion just to look badass? It's pretty wild. 
---
Fireproof also makes supermutants a lot easier, since they like to spam molotovs and frags. 
---
Fireproof also makes it easier to grief other players, because missile turrets can't hurt you. (I do not endorse this, however)
---
I can't wait to hear the response: "wait I'm in adventure mode and I have passive set your cheating"
---
Why, though?  I mean, that's an entirely plausible answer, but why would they opt to do that rather than just simply adding it as a new item?
---
The only answer I can think of is they want to make it free *for a time*.
---
I saw sturdy!
---
Ctrl+Tab opens your friends tab. You can join another server from there if you have friends online.
---
Grafton Train Station vendor has them. Thanks!
---
Don't forget the water trough.  She needs her water after all.
---
I think there were things that could be added that shouldn't have been and things that should've but couldn't. Plus, party fouls abound with people drinking the whole bowl.
---
I wish they would let us put anything in there, like dirty water, toxic goo, inert flux, bring back poisoned wine from 4, etc. Up the realism a dose.
---
You can have Combat Armor plans, Light, Sturdy and Heavy and apply the BoS mod to these for BoS Combat Armor.
---
 The BoS mods work on all Combat Armor and come in Torso and Limbs, I believe. I know them but it was long ago I learned them and although I think its Limbs it may be Arms and Legs.
---
it worked after i rage posted lol. but it for sure wouldnt let me inspect at first
---
Whitesprings
---
Going to stock up and sell in my vending machine :)
---
I, too, am on PC! I'm Sertith there, too. Add me if you decide to give it a shot. :)
---
No, not sure how to feel about that choice
---
Dude they aren’t real. They don’t require rest.
---
I have black screen only , fuck bugtesda
---
Fast Travel: A 15-second timer will now appear when attempting to Fast Travel while enemies are nearby. The player will now automatically Fast Travel to the selected location when the timer expires, as long as they are not hit by an enemy during the countdown.
---
Can confirm.  Just bought them there
---
your CHR is 3. the negative (-) indicates it is diminished by something (negative mutation effects, disease, etc).
---
Agreed.  This solved about 99% of the issues I had with the game.
---
Click right stick, you can!
---
I did it because of the same ammo anxiety someone else posted about. Plus, with bandolier, carrying tons of ammo is way cheaper than the raw materials. So I used it to help use up all the gunpowder and steel I collect in abundance.
---
Is that the ANTagonizer helmet I see?!?
---
About the hunting rifle, .50 made my gun 108 damage, but refined .50 gave me 107? Am I missed something?
---
I'm level 78 and I've never seen Grahm.
---
That sucks i still need legs too.
---
I'm just making fun of the incessant use of Z's on the end of a gamertag when someone really wants a certain name that is already taken. 
---
I s'pose if you have to explain a joke then it wasn't funny in the first place :'(
---
Same, just wanted to make sure you knew :)
---
And blocks half the screen...
---
If someone worked that hard to grief me I think I might be flattered.
---
How dare you!
---
In what ways did they nerf the assassin effect?
---
As a coffee lover, I'll need to be able to destroy the place. ;)
---
I've been playing since launch and I can say that the developers pull alot from this sub when it comes to implementing changes needed. Ppl complain about something and that complaint gets handled in coming patches.
---
It may seem to some ppl that Beth isn't listening to "us" because certain requests take a while to be addressed but I'd imagine that the devs see multiple requests every day  and it takes time to fix issues. Great patch!!
---
Your cursor is where my camp is. Problem being, I will probably have more issues finding an open server.
---
The shotguns isnt that unfair compared to some aae hand / lever guns, also heavey guns are a force. The b+ss+s DGC is super op with the right unyeilding and cards. I was never that big on tse. They are fun playing around guns for sure.
---
I'm north, under the bridge by NAR. I suspect to have lots of neighbors and more "camp can't be placed"
---
Ah, so you're actually being a dick, just want to feel less guilty about it. Gotcha. Carry on.
---
I knew they were rushed at first.
---
I don't have this issue, it all is as it should be. I'm on PS4
---
Lvl 220, encountered him maybe 8 times.
---
One of the reps checked and taming still works the same way.
---
People still play this game?
---
Well, nevermind then. Just wanted to be friendly.
---
I just want a stealthboy nerf.  Cancel the effect when you attack. Still a great tool tonstart a fight or for avoidance/escape but not the huge pvp crutch that they currently are.
---
Ass/sent nerf everyone should have seen coming. I'm still going to finish my set because, well why not, hey maybe I can get it cheaper now lol... but what other rolls are good in pvp? More reason to use 1x auto-stim, 1x life-saving, and 1x chameleon if you didn't already. But what else? Weightless/sentinel? That's just a stationary stealthboy. Vanguard or bolstering do very little in pvp with armor values making barely any difference. Sooo what? Unyielding/sentinel bloodied builds for all I suppose?
---
People are loving this nerf and talking all kinds of smack, but really when you look at legendary rolls it's not the pvp player's fault that Bethesda made these rolls obviously the best choice with little other options to choose from.
---
They are back
---
How much are calibrated shocks? I just need 1 more
---
I had 48 missiles I dumped yesterday but I regret It cause I could have sold them
---
Can't believe they still haven't released the ones that were datamined before 🤦 been keeping some Atoms set aside for so long
---
You can rejoin a server on solo on XB1 by using the find someone  option under the home button menu.   Simply find a username currently  on your server, type their name into find someone, and hit join game.  Then, enjoy your respawn on the server you are on.
---
Didn’t you see the /s?
---
Maybe now I can kill those unruly golfer ghouls
---
Legendary perks .... like 40% extra swing speed etc ...
---
Never spend a lot of caps on something right before a big update.
---
It literally tells you in the patch update notes
---
Turn the TV on bro
---
Except it doesn’t- its one of those common false beliefs like the tooth fairy or supply side economics. That’s a fantastic place for lower to mid tier characters (large flat area with water, near a station and great spot with enemies nearby).
---
And it does not prevent rare spawns. I know because I’ve had that vendor spawn there 3-4 times right in front of my camp.  I’ve since moved on to the bog, but I still hear this inaccurate refrain ;)
---
Definitely not a bug. It’s a downside (or upside) to the mutation.
---
60% of the time it works all of the time
---
Damm you are funny
---
That makes sense then, thanks.
---
I couldn't see the wood for the trees there. Phew.
---
But I swear that when I logged in for the first time they were properly messed up.
---
Reason I know is because the very first thing I do upon login is share the perks, this is now muscle memory, and I got the error that I could not share it due to not enough CHR.
---
It would seem that removing all clothing and perks fixed the glitch and then I just, as I said, I could not see the wood for the trees.
---
Either way thank you again. I can exhale now.
---
Now laugh.
---
Did the ever add the combat armor BoS paint? Think that and the legs were the only thing I was missing.
---
Bite me
---
havent played this game for two months.. can someone tell me if game breaking bug is still present? or did they fixed it?
---
Be careful - they stated the scrip cannot be trades. Be sure to trade it back to whoever you want to buy legendaries with.
---
I do not have proof of this other than I let one hit me last week for about 10 minutes while I said bizarre things to them (little social experiment) about 15 minutes afterward I had to fix every piece of PA but my right leg.
---
Unless its vital I dont log for an event or something, I literally just immediately log out and log back in now when I even get the slightest inkling of being griefed.  Just not worth it and Bethesda doesnt give a frick what they do so long as Billy's Daddy's credit cards are still good.
---
these are the values for selling items to the vendor machine.
---
Same for me, smooth runnings so far. Keeping my fingers crossed!
---
Yeah, and a lot of patches didn't quite seem to touch on things which seem like basic fixes (gatling sight, for example). It was frustrating that these things have been broken for almost half a year when they seem like easy fixes.
---
I'm happy they're fixed though. This patch cleaned up a lot of longstanding issues and they went through feedback really well.
---
Not even RIP, maybe they be tortured forever in digital hell
---
I'm no Shaman.
---
vamp drill sounds legit
---
I did, but generally when people are sarcastic that means they don't really give a fuck about whatever the offer was.
---
Source on this?
---
I feel ya. At 5-9 scrip for just 1* items, the limit of 150 scrip isn’t gonna make a dent in my stash
---
yisssssssssss
---
I have had the hardest time with Pet Taming because of how unclear some things about it are... even though I have read everything I can about it on Reddit it's not enough. I have yet to even be able to tame a single thing over level 21. WHY?
---
My friend just tried to use one of those machine, it gave an error saying "Cannot assign item: the workshop's budget has been exceeded"!  
---

---
Which vendor?
---
Do they get new voicelines or is it still SERVE AND PROTECT for eternity
---
For sure. The backpacks alone allow me to retool my character so I don’t have to waste a many slots on weight perks and good with salt. And my stash has been packed full with legendaries for months, so now I can finally clear that out and start stocking up on crafting materials again. 
---
The buffs and nerfs all sound good too, and I love the rule changes. Have a teammate contest a workshop and then surprise killing the owner on the other side of the map was one of the few scummy PVP moves left, but even that wasn’t as bad as the SBQ CAMP-baiting griefers, which also would appear to be fixed with this update. 
---
The rest is the content is almost just a bonus for me. Sounds like a really great update!
---
Why is stuff like that so unclear?!
---
Reading sucks
---
Can you travel for a fee? Or do you have to find a nearby discovered location to travel to and then hoof it from there?
---
Clearly the math pencils out for some, but I don't really see an obvious value proposition like there was with the Civil War Top Hats.  If you go around and kill a few Super Mutants in Harper's Ferry and take their Charging Laser Sniper Rifles, that's 32 Caps of pure profit a whack.
---
Yeah. The Momma Dolce's can expiration was a big one, too. It may not have a huge impact long term, but it makes a difference, and now makes the event viable and worth doing. Canned Meat Stew beats hoarding dog food. 
---
I'll actually do that event now.
---
I'm in the same situation. Wtf? Had to be a bug, how would we know what counts as what?
---
This is a cool spot and would certainly consider moving my CAMP there (currently in a solid spot near overseers camp though).  I am really excited for this update and I hate to be a downer but after building a beautiful shop putting what amounts to a collection of garbage up on my sales floor is being to really kill the aesthetic.  Still better than standing around literally all day waiting for people to show up and shop though.
---
Done forget, if we all waited around to show off our Camps, nobody would every see each other’s camp!
---
Find your own damn spot, you traders you.
---
They give the plans in the terminal though...
---
I guess this is good to sell to other players?
---
Or I can finally use that .50 receiver to actually deal good damage without having use my suppressed Gauss rifle! That thing is HEAVY!!
---
That's such a ridiculous loop hole. I really hope it's not the case.
---
Calibrated Shocks for all the legs!!
---
Yeah, this is a big bummer. I have been stockpiling in hopes to free up stash but all it takes is about 6, 3 star legendaries to max...
---
Turns on proximity mic: [FORTUNATE SON IN DISTANCE]
---
They didn't remove it. I know of three people getting it since patch 8.5
---
I believe it's specifically the BoS combat armor plans which have been MIA in game since they changed vendors to sell specific item lists.
---
In case any members of the team read this, I'm proud and thankful. I think the community at large is too.
---
Oh my God...I literally just swapped my torso for t60 and bought the jetpack plans...fuuuuuudge....
---
Would be cool if you could build a landing pad, then fly it to Train stations or other camps with a landing pad...
---
I was making the assumption it would be pre-rolled items that you can pick from, which randomize daily. 
---
That’s the dream anyways.
---
He means mods i think
---
Doing Atoms' work. Pass this wanderer a nuka cola.
---
Wow..limited to 150 script per day
---
I'm starting to wonder/worry if they're just gonna stock the Purveyor with pre-made legendaries like the Survival Rewards
---
Jet pack plans too!?
---
Relax it was just a joke bc of how much of a noob I am.
---
I'm feeling the same way!  I just told my husband that I should have Tuesday's off as Patch Day!!
---
It appears as a green icon on the map, you get to travel directly to their camp!
---
Oh yes!!!
---
I converted the sound files for the game and have them all on my phone, I can listen to Country Roads anytime I want, and lemme tell ya that's a lot. lol 
---
As for in game, I hear it pretty often. I occasionally do a CAMP video for Youtube, and normally wait for it to start before I do the video, as I want that song on all my videos.
---
I wonder if the BOS vendor has ultracite mod plans now. That would be sick.
---
Dude.  Please, please pleeeeeeeeeease search reddit.  These posts are a plague unfortunately.
---
Yes please
---
Yay!! 🙏
---
They want you.
---
OOf, didn't think about that.  Thanks for the heads up.
---
Fresh out of the vault in the beta, I ran into him between overseer's camp and flatwoods. Didn't have a cap to my name. Didn't see him again until I was over lvl 50 when he came trotting through my base in the Savage Divide.
---
His name is Creepo and he doesnt take his pants off for just any reason.
---
*hundreds
---
&gt; **Legendary Armor Effects:** Sentinel, Cavalier, and Assassin legendary effects now have a 75% chance to apply during combat.
---
no message,s just a reminer what dailies are ready and the newest update ingame
---
No idea
---
Read the patch notes or every other post asking this same question. Hint: scouts
---
I think player vending is going to alter the market a little, both the convenience of selling as well as buying are being improved with this add on.
---
Well your service has been appreciated. Doing things for the greater good even at a cost. I salute you.
---
This happened to me and idk why, rented the game around launch and they worked
---
Idk if it was changed or if it actually is just another bug to add to the massive list
---
No, you keep doing you. The rest of us morons will get by somehow without your magical help.
---
I've collected way more 44 than I use - just to drop some weight, I've been giving it away in 200 rd lots lately.
---
I was worried here ! Two minutes passed since someone asked the same question !
---
You do that one thing...ya know...with the thing?
---
I gave up and flail at everything with my Blade of Bastet.
---
Sorry, but i could not find them on him sadly.
---
Noooooo
---
What's the deal with the mailboxes as a utility?
---
Wow. 
---
I’m bad. Holy shit I’m bad.
---
Being serious. My apologies.
---
Lmfao that type of aimbotting at least has an Ap limit and a massive chance to miss/bug out
---
im talking about Headbox aimbotting.
---
Huge in shooters, made its way over to 76
---
Thousands
---
Stingwing i mean
---
The flamer and long bow bar don’t add damage? That weapon is actually quite formidable when fully repaired.
---
Yours is a fringe case that carries virtually no priority
---
Nice.
---
You can't.
---
I really liked building there, the greenery, the nice structures.  I built on the driving range and connected my building to the building already there, but its for the best to remove those turretters.
---
As another work-dweller thank you for posting. Got the wife updating the game and I'm itching to see all the new stuff.
---
Read the other 100 posts made in past week about the same subject
---
I have no issues at all so far.
---
Okay nvm all new Mr. Handys sound like that
---
If I wanted to greif people I would become an active member of the FO76 sub like you!
---
10s of thousands
---
They're on the move because cause they're eating new greens. He doesn't want to be in one place.
---
yea... I'm disappointed becasue the red look better and I'm sure they knew that when they released the original... This way they get to cash in twice...
---
Maybe coffee can make you faster and more focused.
---
They did not, they said only 30 different stacks can be assigned per Vending Machine. No references to bulking items together, just a limit on how many different items you can have on sale
---
Nor does pointing out the flaws require the hyperbole and self-righteousness so often witnessed. This is a forum nominally for people who are fans, not the Fallout 76 Launch a Day Memorial Society. 
---
Although I hear they’re collecting funds for a tasteful monument to be built in Shady Sands,NCR within view of the Vault Dweller statue.
---
I see you managed to form paragraphs since my reply, so maybe I'll give it a shot.
---
Does anyone know if you can load a holotape game in to a personal terminal or regular terminal, leaving it there without risk of a player ejecting it? I kind of want to build an arcade but dont want to lose the games Ive found.
---
What glitch?
---
Very nice guys.
---
*puts coffee in a vault for security purposes*
---
Plans for mods. You get the plans for the armor itself from the terminal, but they made the plans for the mods all available to purchase. So you don't have to server hop to get jetpack and calibrated shocks anymore. You just have to pay a lot more caps.
---
Everyone don't forget to upvote! 
---
I think it would be a great boon for the FO76 community if this got a bit more publicity. There's too much toxicity surrounding the game that we should push back on.
---
Calibrated Shocks hooooooo!
---
There are new scout challenges in the challenge tables (open your map and look top right corner)
---
I've been hot seapping betwen a Somerset and Hardened Hunting Rifle. Usually takes 10~ shots to kill most 18 lvl enemies.
---
The other day I soloed 2 SB at the same time.  Used 1 or 2 stimpacks.
---
Grafton Train
---
is your building budget full?
---
Your workshop budget has been exceeded. Take out some other item so you have room to put it in, since it still uses your Stash space &gt;_&gt;
---
Well I guess it's time to stock up, we got a week before we know what it will buy us
---
You can between players, so why not in the machines? Seems safe to assume yes
---
Does the datamine not mention 5 stars yet?
---
Lol love your last sentence
---
I figured it was from the repeat quests but still says 0/3 after doing the clean up mission
---
This!!
---
4x in charleston....
---
Once in front of the power plant (before I knew who he was)
---
once on the bridge, again before I knew who he was, 
---
twice in front of the mysteries quest house - this time I knew, and bought some stuff....
---
Once in the forest...wherever the farmer handys are looking for fertilizer.
---
Havent seen him in about a month now....
---
The bad news is that you still have to pay a fee to get there (normal fast travel costs).
---
does the extra mod not add a star anymore? thank god. had way to many people try to sell one off as "SUPER RARE" because its 4 stars.
---
A good deed is it's own reward.
---
Just use an x-01 torso or a different armor set.
---
You can! Yay this is badass
---
Good businessman.
---
Getting a Build A Bear vibe 🤣
---
Well sufferin succotash, I forgot about psychotats.
---
For all you youngins, it's a Sylvester and tweety bird reference.
---
If they only focused on game-breaking bugs... give me a break.
---
No its gone. I had all of em except for vamp...now i just got in with the update and theyre all 3 star. Lol nothing more than a cosmetic star..but they were my cosmetic stars..
---
So much new stuff its insane!!!!
---
I'm so curious about the tax. Will it maybe round down and items under like 5 caps will be tax free? Or are we just fucked on low value items lol
---
Grabbed the last I need for BOS (legs) at Grafton station. They had torso and arms too.
---
Eh that's okay. I'm glad they have x01 plans at least. Thanks for checking btw!
---
I’d be more worried about someone trying to destroy it
---
It's at all train stations I believe
---
That the only one?
---
Skooma is a potion produced from moon sugar. It is a highly addictive narcotic, and its users pass through bouts of euphoria followed by protracted lethargy. It is smoked in a special pipe; the crystals are placed in a small dish and heated. The gas produced is bubbled through water in the pipe to cool it as it is inhaled.
---
Now that we have player vending, we need some kind of stock market. Obviously it would be hard to price legendaries and different combinations, but things like outerwear and their clean versions generally arent worth what you sell to a robot vendor.
---
Cool will check there now
---
All I’ve ever really wanted was a retexture/skin for the revolutionary sword to make it like an intricate duelers rapier or a nasty lookin pirates cutlass.. :(
---
Yeah, I haven't played in a couple months now, but the new patch notes made me want to log back in.
---
You can make signs 👍 get the Signs and Letters plan for neon writing, and Small Letters plan for little non-neon writing
---
It’s at all train stations.
---
And lol you're calling me pissy about this on a post where you literally tell me to get over the fact that the dev's haven't listened to us about this, which was the point of your post, them listening to us, cool. Sure thing.
---
That may mean "true" 4-5 star items are coming...
---
No kidding. I've been hoarding unwanted god rolls since the roadmap, and now I'm just staring blankly at a stash full of AAs and Unyieldings with *no fucking clue* what to price these things at. D'oh.
---
Rare outfits, serums, rare plans, flux, etc. Stuff you can't find at the existing vendorbots and is hard to find on your own. Then, after that, stuff you can get from vendorbots but at cheaper prices. For example, stims for 10c. And then things that aren't rare but aren't common and can't be crafted like nuka cola.
---
Same here, I mysteriously have them available so I built some. I figured I must have bought them and forgotten, but apparently not.
---
My body is ready
---
Yep. There's a post already.
---
ONE MILLION POSTS
---
Somerset....So I'd guess you are a relatively new player?
---
Do you happen to know if grape mentats impacts this further? I assume it would if hard bargain does but you never know.
---
Ain't no shame in it. There's been some awesome stuff lately, and from the looks of it, a lot more to come.
---
Great, I thought I had a hundred billion years to take a picture of a deathclaw and now suddenly I have to do it in a week?!
---
All kinda of great stuff, love the minigun. Sadly no 50 cal skin
---
Lol nice
---
Ive got a 3* furious faster fire rate vats cost ive been loving so this just makes it better.
---
Go to challenges...then world...
---
I didnt see that post. More posting is always better. Posts tend to get buried anyway.
---
I haven’t logged in yet. Where do you find/acquire the plans?
---
I think they mean only a few select Ammos get that price on the Subreddit markets. They *often* go for considerably less, but sure, there are always people paying more than others. Their point is still valid when it comes to stuff like 10mm, and is especially concerning with how the tax will be implemented on low value items. Like, will be lose that entire Cap to the tax because it rounds up?
---
Hi I'm new to fallout 76 (only LV 6) could you explain the turret farmer bit ? As I put turrets up on my base to defend against pve enemies I don't want to annoy anyone
---
Nice.  Been waiting to build mine for the camp immunity patch. Will implement idea and call my own
---
Im sad. Why did you have to say this
---
Yeah, survival mode, I have a small shop I built for vending when it came out. But I’m certain it will immediately get destroyed in survival mode
---
Your list was pretty concise, I didn't feel I needed to simply copy paste it a second time. Also, a number of items of your list were either things already noted by CMs, or things I have already previously listed. It's OK if you don't agree, just explaining my reasoning.
---
Its an awful rendition anyways.  John Denver is rolling over in his grave.
---
Mine is setup on the stairs into the base.
---
Auto decontamination upon entering.
---
Hit 150 and still have a ton of junk legendaries to exchange. So what do we do with the scrip now?
---
• Cold Case: Fixed an issue that could prevent the player from crafting the KidSecure ID despite having the required materials.
---
Thank God. It took them basically since launch to (hopefully) fix it.
---
A lot of bugs in this list probably needed to be hotfixed in rather than wait two weeks to be fixed. Which is something that Bethesda really really seems to hate doing. But stuff like the Pro Snap teleportation, MODS NOT ATTACHING TO WEAPONS/ARMOUR/PA, and others, should be put in once a fix is found. If Bethesda finds the issue Day X after the patch, why should they hold that onto their next patch cycle. It just causes player annoyance.
---
Have this game but have been waiting to jump in until some patches were released. Is it time???
---
I assume it makes you wanted and that makes it possible for others to attack you. They (the lock owner and others)  cannot be attacked until they go after the bounty.
---
Under a new camp build tab called "vending". Automatically unlocked, with an alternate skin available in atom store.
---
Not really, played at the Beta til it got a lvl 50 cha. Put the game down for a few months, they re started my playthrough. New in terms of character lvl (17 last I checked) but I know most of the game.
---
Who tf was considering or actually using hunter weapons or armor anyway..? People always love to make a non-issue an issue. Move along
---
Never commented anything about them listening.  Just for you to stop complaining.
---
grahm is a gypsy, let him wander and be free
---
Don't worry. It won't be an issue any more. Especially at your level, you can't make the powerful turrets yet. Just play normally and enjoy yourself.
---
Ouch!
---
A small silver lining, I *sold* all the BOS plans I had for 15k last week.
---
Proof positive that the more loudly you wine, eventually, someone will give in. The entitlement is strong
---
Not that this affected me in the slightest. It just made me laugh
---
Wait I’m confused. What are u talking about? People can destroy your vending machines in adventure mode and take ur caps and stuff??
---
It’s a great option in my opinion, my camp can only be attacked from 1 direction, which means only defending in one direction. Frees up plenty of space turrets would have used.
---
Ok. That makes sense. Sorry for the confusion.
---
its 75% per armor piece. so its kinda broken now
---
You know, I started thinking about this...after I got over my initial annoyance about purchasing atoms...I realized on the past games, NV in particular, I purchased every DLC add on available (and not in the bulk season pass) so when you think about now, we seem to be getting "free" dlc's, purchasing atoms doesn't seem so bad after all. You either do it or don't, it's that simple.
---
No idea if they can, but your cap is lit up on the server map like a Christmas tree!
---
Thank you very much!
---
Good,  my CAMP is at the southern edge of the course,  it wasn’t bothering anyone but the occasional scorchbeast.
---
Yeah it's rough, even with ammosmith you're only getting 24/per. I have a pretty decent executioners LMG but since it's      308 it's costly to use.
---
Switching to .50cal for this reason.
---
I can confirm that "wanted" issue as well. It's almost like you have to smack the pistol whip the murderer before you can shoot them between the eyes and that just means they know you're there, stand still and wait for initial slap and then VAT you in one shot anyway. I had this happen against a player in Chameleon (presumably sentinel ) armor with a bounty over 700...found him by pointing my gun everywhere, took aim and shot (barely any damage registered, slap damage) they return fire, 1 shot 1 kill. Sad day.
---
Is 150 the max you can have??
---
Yea, f#cking idiotic. What next? Give out all the legendary gear for 100 caps, because apparently it is players right to get everything so easy.
---
I'd understand that they had sh#t tons of content and dungeons to do, but they don't. BoS plans gave point to treasure maps, now there is no point in treasure maps.
---
My man :) thanks, I upvoted
---
1 star 5, 2 star 15, 3 star 40.
---
Make sense to me man lol, also don’t think a trade should go through if caps will be sent to the void. Just doesn’t make sense.
---
I’ve done it plenty of times, mostly for p/a skins lol.
---
Grahm kicks it with me at my house.
---
Is the game live? How much budget does each take?
---
Yeah, mine too
---
Honestly i wouldn't be surprised if they made money after todays patch lol
---
Screw that I want a jet pack for excavator
---
Good one 😀
---
point taken.  I just dont see too many players using the 44.
---
whats your platform?
---
ONE BILLION POSTS AND INCREASING RAPIDLY
---
Hahaha! I mean... I’m 100% down.
---
Yup that's exactly how it happens and the griefers know this. Fix the game before you nerf everyone  else because of a few people.
---
Ahhh halejush ahh haluehlah
---
How much does it cost to buy something and is it random?
---
Yes, servers are back up(at least on XBOX). Only take a couple percent of budget
---
Nice! Thanks :)
---
I guess some of my excess caps are about to be spent :D
---
Yeah I know of those, do they take up a sizable portion of camp budget when used en masse though? I was thinking more of one item we can place that we could leave a message on that wouldn't eat into a sizable portion of our budget.
---
Come again?
---
Oh really!? I am a new player(been playing a week) and I was worried about crafting a vendor and showing where my house is. I am worried that someone would try to destroy it. Players can’t destroy it anymore? Loving the game by the way!
---
Just go to the FO76.ini once the game has updated and copy the lines from there. It's a foolproof method and you don't have to worry about searching the subreddit or Nexus for the info.
---

We will probably have to buy 1* starting at 500 script a piece from the purveyor. 
---
Jk but does anyone actually know how much things will cost yet? I’ve been active on the sub today and haven’t seen anything yet usually the data miners release stuff like that on patch days
---
&gt; Hornwright Bunker Card Alpha/Beta don't get removed from your inventory
---
I don't bother looting the robots, or even killing them before hitting the switches outside.  The ones in your inventory still work to complete the quest.  At least you stop acquiring more that way.
---
Isn’t there power armor in the legendary vendors shop?
---
As a PC Gamer i would welcome our console brothers and sisters with open arms
---
That's because you can get the info from the updated FO76.ini file.
---
These comments make more sense realizing you are not the OP of the post.  I went from a computer to my phone and didn't realize you were just a random commenter. "The Devs listened. " is literally the first sentence of the post, so I was a little perturbed.
---
Regardless, if I want to complain about an ongoing bug that's a super anoying QoL issue when dealing with a maxed out stash,  that happens to be gong on months in-game without being addressed by the devs, I'm going to.  If you want to be the person to point out people complaining, be my guest, subreddit police.
---
There isn't anything you can buy until next week i believe
---
I just checked and no nerf to my gun.  It's a TSE Double Barrel
---
:D
---
Why didnt they increase cap limit if you can put up 120 items? It'd be really easy to go over with 120 items for sale
---
the best change: **Fast Travel:** A 15-second timer will now appear when attempting to Fast Travel while enemies are nearby. The player will now automatically Fast Travel to the selected location when the timer expires, as long as they are not hit by an enemy during the countdown.
---
We should get 10% of any caps spent fast traveling to our CAMPS/Shops.
---
We won't know until the legendary vendor comes out
---
Made a new toon a few weeks ago and the same thing happened. Thought maybe that's how it was supposed to be since it was back in beta when I made my first one. All picking up the cards did for me this time was give me enough XP to level up. Then picked a perk card and only had that one.
---
there is no vending yet. Thats a future release.
---
...vanguard power armor.. with healing factor...
---
Shut the front door!
---
That's kind of funny.  I was thinking the other day about why we didn't have more garden-type options for our CAMPs, and now there's a Deathclaw topiary.
---
nice, so it's a good thing I stocked up on 3 stars
---
Then why go to the post and make a comment
---
I’m actually convinced my head might pop off from the amount I’ve done this the last two weeks.
---
looks pretty cool!
---
are you sure you're exporting all areas of  "[00] SeventySix.esm (940094B3) \ Worldspace \ 0025DA15 &lt;Appalachia&gt;" on xEdit? 
---
I was using xedit 4.0.1 but I see its been updated to 4.1.2 so I'm not sure if any data changes would break the script. I've updated xedit and tested the script and it seems to be outputting stuff fine

Cool friendly idea, but (and call me stupid if you want) but I’m not a fan of Decontamination Archs because I run mutations without Starched Genes. I don’t have all of the mutations I want yet and it’s nice to pick them up and keep those two points free for other cards in my Luck slots. 
---
There’s plenty of radaway out there and plenty of means to de-rad. I use the photosynthesis card or whichever card removes my dad’s during the day. 1 card point takes care of my rads in regular play. 
---
An unwelcome Decon Arch will screw me over!
---
Nice! Furious seems to be a sought out role for plasma rifles!
---
Probably to not unbalance the economy, though i cant say for certain.
---
Hey so I'm bad at math so can you just tell me what I'd set the price to on something I'd want 50 caps from
---
Yep. Don’t use the vendor thing if you don’t want people to find your camp in PvP mode
---
I  agree 100%. It's beyond expectations for me.
---
But... we still have to play a bit more to be sure ;)
---
Same here.  Auto download is set but it never updates.  I leave my PS4 on and once it's patched I power it off through remote play.
---
oh... weird. So people are going to just turn things in and hope for the best?
---
I think though. I only put nukashine inside, only the best for my guests ♥️
---
to up the thread so others might see it and give an answer.
---
Fantastic idea with two important caveats:
---
1) Grahms and Chally the Moo Moo should only be there on weekends (like similar others of similar genre games) with their special wares. So that their free spirits remain untamed but still can get the R&amp;R they deserve! 
---
Mayhe give them even MORE RARE and unique stock then.
---
2) It has to be in Whitesprings. They get a main building room- NO WAIT TWO! And one is Grahms and is in super mutant(ish) decor with the other being a completely repurposed room to pen for our sweet Moo Moo Chally. 
---
I love the (joke kinda) idea.
---
It was this one time at band camp
---
I have my camp along their route along the road near a trader. I like to think it's a caravan outpost for them to stop and camp and restock at... Along with any other players of course that need a specific workbench or water/food.
---
I dont see any challenges that have the word "scout" in em
---
I already do that. Thanks for the suggestion though.
---
Grafton station sold me the plans.
---
Put it out for what you think is fair, if no one buys it consider dropping the price a little. 
---
It all depends on if you want your items to move fast or if you want to wait for that special buyer who will pay anything.
---
It really does sum up the 76 experience perfectly.
---
Taken out of circulation
---
Oooohh it affect the assassins effect too. In my opinion That’s pushing it a bit too far. I was ok with them nerfing sentinel cause it is clearly OP as I own a set of sent assassins myself, but nerfing assassin effect is a little crazy due to it not really being that powerful of an effect in the first place
---
It's probably like the vendors with the caps, 20 hours.
---
Deleted some stuff in my camp. Weird that it effects it
---
Yeah it’s all bs.
---
As someone who runs a store in game and has this happen all the time, I couldn’t agree more. Everyone needs to experience the cooperative joy of helping others get what they want and meanwhile checking out your build. It’s so fun, that’s basically all I’ve done since Fasnacht. Can’t wait to get on later and check out everyone else’s camps
---
Read a reply on another thread from valseek (I think) that said it's 4 X 30 for a total of 120 items.
---
The reward is currency, currency in which you buy legendary items in the future.
---
Quick maths for ya 💥
---
No, that means they didnt want to confuse their legendary scrapping system and aware extra scrip for mods applied by the user. One doesnt necessarily have anything to do with the other.
---
I sold a guy 400 5mm rounds for 400 caps the other day. It was his offer, I was pretty surprised because I felt he was way overpaying...
---
Its over there.....
---
If it's randomized crap, pass.  My hopes is it's mods you can apply to existing hardware, but that seems doubtful.
---
I've heard if you rub the box, good things happen...
---
Same here, truely pissed off
---
A handmade rifle that someone gave you is a very decent gun. One of the best firearms in the game, even non-legendary variant. It  was my primary weapon (simple non-legendary, vanilla handmade) from level 18 to level 40 when I finally was able to start using Tesla. You just have to have it modded properly.
---
In order to conserve ammo and maximize your damage per shot, you'll need a hardened receiver.
---
Putting a suppressor on your handmade will activate sneak attack bonus damage modifier if you attack from sneak.
---
There are scopes for sniping (short/medium/long) and a reflex sight for VATS / close quarters combat.
---
What level is yoir handmade ? If 25, I could modify it for you, free of charge.
---
If it is level 15, I could craft you a new level 25 handmade rifle and put mods of your choice on it. Free of charge as well. I think I have all the necessary materials, I may only be short on screws.
---
well... yeah. What else are you supposed to do with a 3-star pipe wrench?
---
In adventure mode yes
---
Your math is a little flawed. But I respect the boycott. Appalachia Radio is on always for me in game. Literally never turned it off since beta.  It plays once every hour and a half I would say. Maybe more often even.
---
That's okay - the harder they make it to grief in AM, the more griefers move to Survival or quit.
---
they are (in patch note).
---
We still have to see how they resist to nukes.
---
Survival mode? What exactly is PvP mode?
---
Much obliged everyone.
---
Didn't check yet. Was just going through and saw them only.
---
But with the 10% cap sink doesnt that mean more caps can be pulled out of the economy? By capping us at 25k, means we are slowing the pace of transactions.
---
If I am not mistaken the globe is a desk lamp.
---
Nope. That would destroy some game mechanics. Not to talk about the ridiculous draw distance, suddenly spawning of enemies. Game engine can't take it.
---
Multiply 50 by 10/9 and round up to the nearest whole number.
---
(This comes out to 500/9 ≈ 56.)
---
Dude. You can already do this. Just build it.  We have the tools.
---
I think it just hit a trillion.
---
Yeah ok just nerf punch bowls like that
---
Just a follow up to my "ridiculous system"
---
Workshop PVP: The following Adjustments have been made to the rules of Workshop PVP:
---
Workshop owners must now enter the bounds of the Workshop before they are placed in PVP with the contesting players.
---
Workshop Turrets no longer attack a Wanted player unless that player is contesting the owner’s Workshop.
---
Players that are not actively contesting an owned Workshop cannot damage the objects built there.
---
God bless Bethesda foe listening
---
I turn all my lead, steal, and gunpowder into ammo as soon as possible basically. Usually once or twice a session (like halfway through, or at the end) I'll craft everything I can to free up space in my stash and replenish my ammo stockpiles. My numbers never really run low though because I do way too much crafting, to the point I have to sell off my excesses once in a while, or craft Ammos I don't need specifically for selling later.
---
**For Lead:** take your Excavator Armor to Lucky Hole Mine. 10-15 mins of mining and you'll have a huge stack of Ore. It's a very efficient smelting recipe, but you will need some Acid. My recommendation, don't smelt the Ore until you need the actual Lead, because it weighs less as Ore.
---
**For Steel:** find enemies with guns (scorched, super mutants, mole miners) and grab as much of their gear as you can. You'll also get all the ammo they're holding, so that's a nice bonus lol. Then be sure to equip the Scrapper Perk when you scrap all the gear you looted, and you'll get like 10-20 Steel per weapon (less for pipe guns &amp; melees, more for stuff like missile launchers &amp; assault rifles). Adds up quick if you just keep Scrapper on 90% of the time as you explore.
---
**For Gunpowder:** grab Hemlock Holes Maintenance to stockpile some Acid, and maybe move your Camp to an Acid spot for an Extractor. Also be sure to grab all the Abraxo you find. Then just grab all the pre-war money, cigarettes, teddy bears, etc. that you need for Cloth. Cigarette Packs/Cartons are also a good source of Plastic for Shotgun Shells!
---
I built a bathroom in my camp that has the decon arch in it
---
You know this isn’t new right? It was part of fallout 4 vanilla. See the video in my link.
---
Level 55.
---
what have they done with BOS plans?
---
No brainer eh, I was thinking it was going to show up like quests
---
Is that astroturf? If so, I have it
---
Hello, If you check challanges in the tab and hoover over to world challanges. :)
---
The gatling gun sight ALMOST works! (It lines up perfectly, but seems to miss all enemies unless you start firing before zooming)
---
Also, I just got the survival challenge gatling gun in adventure mode. I am pretending it's a feature until someone shatters my illusion from the outside.
---
How do you exchange Legendaries?  I stopped by a train station, but didn't see how it worked.
---
yeah probably like caps vendor.
---
the workaround:
---
step 1: sell your legendary for 150 tokens.
---
step 2: sleep 20 hours
---
step 3: go to step 1
---
I am too ashamed to show my camp on the map in their current state.  Seeing what people have pulled off here, my camps get a rating of suck!  Each day this week I’ll be working up my character’s camps to make them presentable.
---
Just checked my explosive shotgun and no nerf.  I have the same damage as I did when I logged off yesterday.  Can't test it now to see if the damage was just wrong in my Pip-Boy, but has anybody noticed a difference or not?
---
So am I.  Whats your PSN?
---
If you can fast travel (I'm overloaded), I'll give you a batch of both 44 and 308.  I think last time I logged out, I was at R &amp; G in the Divide.
---
I should be on after 6p or so tonight.  Depends on how long the patch takes to do its thing.
---
I like several skins for PA but because they made PA weaker than leather, I won't waste the atoms to decorate them. 
---
If you read the 'tips' on loading screen it almost sounds like a joke when they say PA was a common sight in US military and the best marine armor is almost as good as PA. Instead they should have said America lost the war because foreign troops were wearing unkillable legendary wood and leather armors.
---
I think console people use mics more than PC, but I don't know. On PC I have rarely met a person who spoke.
---
Maybe not a home since he still wanders... 
---
He needs a trailer with all of the fixings, and a cooler for his meat.
---
\*deep sigh\*... tadpole, you know the first rank we have on the whole scout thing. Under world challenges.
---
If it's 5 caps purchase price the seller will most likely get 4.
---
Small Letters is pretty budget conscious, Neon slightly less so but not terrible
---
I like your idea though, like a chalkboard or whiteboard or whatever, it is clever.
---
#housethecow!
---
It seems like a math book where you understand it immediately, get lost, then rethink it too much lol. Great post though cause you know people gonna be doing this then raging on the forums about the tax being broken
---
"Corrected a Weekly Challenge timer that would have outlasted the inevitable heat death of our universe."
---
Why can't challenges exist for that long? Didn't Todd say this game would last forever?
---
I think we're all guilty.
---
Ahhhh has to scroll a bit, they should be in a new category honestly
---
Yep. In preparation for the original player vending release date, I totally rebuilt my camp from the ground up from a base for myself, to a sprawling community center with a full workshop, instruments, beds, stashes, ambience, water pump, free purified water, decon arch, even a bench just to watch nukes launch from alpha silo.
---
I may even open up my junk collector for everyone soon. ;)
---
If you’re on XB1, make sure to stop by TOP STOP right across the street from the Top of the World train station.
---
So while you’re fast traveling across the map, why don’t you take a little break in the middle and stop at TOP STOP.
---
TOP STOP, all your needs away from home at the top of the world!
---
Just read the released patch notes. Backpacks won't function with power armor. Figures.
---
F4 is only single player. F76 with vehicles would be a mayhem, in general, and would require also a big work of balancing and mechanics rework.
---
Well, we did because they stated it would.  And it was a statement that it would, not us misinterpreting anything they wrote, but they just reported it totally ass backward wrong to us initially.  That's on them for telling us something completely wrong and then having to correct themselves and disappoint a lot of people.
---
My base was kind of close to Whitesprings club (i think?) but i had not intended it for farming. I didn't even know people did that, farming with my deathclaw gauntlet sneak is much better..
---
Anyways, I logged in to see it wasn't there anymore, and my base isn't saved ala blueprints. I've been playing since my birthday November 15th and saved up a LOT of stuff, and bought a crap ton of expensive items. I'm gonna ask them what the hell happened and if they just say "tough shit", I'm leaving this game lol 
---
Strike 1 was the nerf to explosive weapons and 2 shot. I legit looted them and wasn't aware of this scam-dupe-whatever thing until i read the patch. I had all my perks lined up to compliment explosives and rifles. Strike 2 was the white knight and other repair nerfs. This is gonna be strike 3.  
---
But other than what happened to ME personally, I do like this update. Though i'll still leave because too much crap has built up in my experiences
---
Well I know now
---
Did they ever fix the power armor mods that don’t actually do anything when equipped? I’ve been wearing decked out power armor since the beginning and found out a while ago a lot of the mods don’t actually do what they say?
---
That and we're getting Legendary PA pieces it seems.
---
Only reason I ever did it was to keep Mobs out. When I’m set up where they aren’t a problem I don’t bother with it.
---
They have 5 star slots for a reason. It wasn't just because some sleepy programmer inserted a "5" instead of a "3", and never changed it.
---
Buy 1:1 x100 to give the seller the ten caps, I like your thinking
---
That Miner's Outfit is so unflattering.
---
Just got them at grafton also
---
Cool photo!
---
Okay ya at some point there'd be a tipping point, be it at 4, 5, or 6 depending on how they round it. I just can't wait to figure out where that line is, or if it's always like a minimum of 1 cap (making small item sales less feasible)
---
They're definitely making them cheap on purpose as a troll!
---
We'll be able to buy legacy weapons for 95 caps too after then next patch.
---
Yeah but knowing if it takes 1k scrib, 10k scrib or 100k scrib helps you decide which weapons to vend.
---
&gt;And the joke is getting very old now.
---
Then go play some other game.
---
bash someone over the head with it
---
Mate are u on ps4 I’m with a faction and we’re trying to get other members
---
Good, I'm glad you didn't have to move your base after all!
---
Just confirmed this myself in game. Each machine will let you have up to 30 items/stacks of items. Each takes 3 power and little to no camp space.
---
It seemed to depend heavily on whether or not your corn was giving them a dirty look. I put my corn on the other side of my building and the ghouls seemed to no longer care.
---
Can be unkillable in bloodied mode too :P
---
Anyone been able to see if Raider Armor Plans are sold anywhere now?
---
I have a switch near my decontamination arch, so people can turn it on/off if they need the rads :)
---
can't inspect 3 star on player vending either.
---
guy has a few up and can't see the effects
---
It is good thinking though, sell the mats instead, because they can just craft whatever they need most. Makes sense.
---
Like 7k each
---
Yes Survival mode
---
\*deeper sigh\*  probably something bugged then as i did parts of the quests and am now stuck on these world challenges. dont see anything related to it in my challenges tab
---
You can’t shop from the map screen.
---
Now if only I can get mods for leather! Lol
---
Not on atm (will be in 90-110 minutes tho) I'd be super thankful to trade ammo with you.
---
 ShepardN7201 for the PSN
---
You can't see it but others can.
---
I thought this was r/tf2 and was about to shit myself
---
I've noticed on NPCs so far. Looks pretty significant, went from 1 hitting Uranium Fever molemen to not doing that. 
---
Going into PVP, it sucks now :V. You can always tell a PVP noob when they come in with power armor, since most weapons can cut through it. I just tried it against a power armor guy for scratch damage &gt;_&gt;
---
Why not let us spike the punch
---
Can't get on right now but is it still random or are all available
---
Hi , what is the purpose of the faction ? Sorry to ask this silly question . I'm like half BOS 😂😂
---
Hell I'm willing to donate additional caps to this fund  (can this be a tax write off?)
---
your base is in the CAMP under stored
---
Where are the scrip stored as couldn't see them in inventory?
---
Not really tbh. Except sometimes I still die in a hit, but stimpacks and drugs offset the nerf.
---
Why would you need to scrap and rebuild your bed if they just left a bag on it??
---
Awww. I had a cat named mama kitty too.
---
Gottem
---
This is exactly what I plan to do.  I'm just going to put a sign in small letters next the the vending machine that says "Add to team for ammo trades" and then since they'll be at my camp I can just travel back for free and do a fair trade or sale.
---
All, my friend. 
---
ALL!!
---
Rejoice!
---
Same for me.. Haven't been disconnected in weeks
---
Was wondering what was happening!!!
---
It's so random, there were about 10 vendors on my server, about 4 of them let me inspect the other 6 no luck.
---
&gt; BoS plans
---
Thanks a lot! So basically you cried long enough till they gave up, and made BoS free, because you wanted it free, instead of doing treasure map. Excellent, what next? Cry till they give you free legendary items. This community makes me sick.
---
It'd be cool but I really hate server hopping to place my camp =x
---
Hallelujah
---
No way, like the same way the brotherhood vendor does? I didn’t see that in the patch notes, makes you wonder what else they snuck in.
---
/u/Valseek We can't inspect items in player vending machines. Sometimes it works but 90% of the time hitting inspect does nothing.
---
I'm wondering if that's the case we'll see.
---
Im at the hole and sand trap at the north end.    Hopefully my camp is still there.
---
Woah
---
Prime it. It's better damage and WAY better ammo economy. Getting a ton of fluorescent Flux isn't hard either since that's basically 90% of the plants at the Whitesprings.
---
I meant it's not there all. Blueprints or stored, I searched the first few tabs just in case but I have nothing left. I hope it's a bug
---
Glad I didn't buy the chest plans for the 5k+ they were going for pre-patch! Now if find the BOS plan for helmets that would be great.
---
Thanks that's kind of the trend of thought.
---
And here come the downvotes.
---
Fuck they’re just nerfing everything
---
Mine shows yellow and black...like the tent symbol w black around it.
---
I put a lot of plan dupes in my vender machine for free.
---
I was unaware there was a nerve to sitting on Saxon. Do you know the details?
---
" I make sure to punish the gnome every time "
---
We don't kneed to gnome that...ever
---
Just going to add on: it really is different. While the old design was easy to move around in, this design makes it feel like a true final Responder stand against the Scorched.
---
Especially since they made them now spawn at high level so that high level players can get them too.
---
Same situation here, I just use it since it's a nice spot plus the fast travel location is nice there
---
Man i want that possum hat for my wasteland entrepreneur character lol XD
---
Especially considering that a 2 star scraps for 40. It's ridiculous how low of a limit it is
---
Is it possible to see your scrip total within the pipboy menu? I can’t find it anywhere...only when I’m at a machine.
---
Why am I not surprised
---
Ok thank you. Does it give you a visual proc like serendipity or super duper does when it initiates or is it more hidden?
---
3 star scraps for 40, sorry
---
Damn Monthman...always trying to sell me calendars
---
The patch notes for today's update.
---
I was all excited to finally unload my 1-2 star stuff, reclaim my stash and actually fast travel.  Not today apparently. Cool down is probably same as vendor bots.
---
noted.  I'm aj ninetyeight, or similar.  Was told earlier today I coulndt be found, but might have been because I wasn't online at the time.
---
Didnt try those but they couldn't hurt.
---
Awesome! Thx for verifying. Can’t wait to get home from work and complete my BOS character. Thx Bethesda!!!
---
Oh OK. Must have added it to after I read it last week. Probably quite overdue to be honest.
---
I kinda get where the devs are coming from..drop stuff in gradual..the script allocation may increase like stash size did..testing the water to see how things go, God know what would happen if we all dumped all our tons of three stars in at once..it's frustrating but this 150 limit has to be daily and maybe with a monthly purveyor visit? Who knows...
---
Although this scenario would not surprise me!
---
I buy them all the time, it’s a game I enjoy and want to support
---
Yup. Although I capped Scrip daily cap instantly on my main so... ;|
---
Yeah just wanted to let people know just in case they were having a problem
---
Being able to spike the punch was great. No need to change it.
---
Crap, I was worried about that.  This makes vending super dicey.
---
It looks like this includes in Survival Mode :P
---
I will say this...Bethesda have done us proud and have listened to the feedback. Hugely impressed here.
---
Ha. I actually saved up x01 mods for player vending. Oh well.
---
Get out of here, you troll.
---
OFC, this might also be pretty good bait.
---
Ha, glad i sold a full set of BOS plans for 15k last week and a single BOS plan i got from a radtoad for 5k two days ago
---
Called it
---
Vendors have them.
---
Exactly what I'm thinking. But that leaves the question of the tipping point for rounding. Will it always round down, so only sales of over 9 caps have tax? Always rounding up would be the minimum 1. Or will it round to the closest around halfway point, so somewhere between 4-6 is where the tax starts?
---
Did You Power it? It requires power.
---
I wouldn’t be surprised if the amount was bugged up when the vendor is released.
---
That's something that has been happening to my Friends that fast travel to my camps for ages.
---
I also could be mistaken on this detail, we will know soon enough :)
---
They use crystal right? There’s a mine west of Fort Defiance that gives tons of lead and crystal ore. Lucky Hole or something. That could help out in the future.
---
no, you're right. Plasma guns are different from Plasma gats, as they are a heavy plasma weapon, they get a different set of stats.   
---
good news though, supposedly Plasma gats are pretty high up there for DPS heavy weapons
---
lol of course.
---
Just multiply desired price by 1.1111...
---
r/suicidebywords
---
Is there just one machine?  If more do they share a supply?
---
There's a free poster in the atom shop. It's also in the world at train stations.
---
Now you can have a camp that provides stuff!
---
Hallelujah!
---
It's probably due to the servers coming off a fresh reboot and being way less laggy.
---
Some people always go the easy route if possible, so it's still likely they'll sell
---
Which I do - but when my stash is full from saving legendaries the last several weeks for this patch and I'm throwing ammo away I can't use it's irritating to have to constantly check to make sure I don't have bulk all the time. It's just frustrating. This game has literally gone from (xbox) all my friends quitting from bugs leaving only me and if I played for 6 hours straight my game would crash no less than 10 times, to: I got my wife and a friend to start playing again by hyping up the improvements and maybe one or two crashes a week and they're enjoying it. I just would like this ONE aspect to be fixed. It seems like a lot of people have concerns that pertain to them, I could care less about the pvp or the energy weapons, as I don't do that or use them, but they fixed/updated/whatever'd them anyways because *other* people wanted to see that done - I didn't shit all over them for wanting changes. I want this changed and \*fart noise\*. Good times. I know you're not doing that but it's gotten to the point where I feel like I have to write a novel to have a legitimate opinion on this game that I've put hundreds of hours into  and have played since the B.E.T.A. le sigh. Sorry, venting.
---
Well ya but you shouldn't really be surprised if someone destroys your house in survival mode tho
---
There's a new enclave vendor? The one in the bunker; where we usually get x-01 mods has no such plans...
---
I’m only mad that backpacks don’t work with Power Armor
---
It’s way too low
---
I've been mastering this art with ghouls and whitespring bases. With a good set of PA and a Tesla coil mod you can kite huge waves of critters
---
Would that effect damage? The weapon is still hitting for the same as I last played. Nothing major changed sans the new bow I just bought even then I can’t equip it for another 6 levels
---
Amen, brother! Praise Mothman!
---
All that excitement is turning into displeasure again fast lmao
---
So do 2* I just scrapped 3 40ish each
---
after patch I crashed 4 times from eating and drinking
---
I'm guesding you meabt nerf on sentinel? Yes that and assassin etc..check patch 9 notes
---
I never imagined it would be different.  Not much point in having any travel fees if there are camps dotted around the map you can travel to for free.
---
At that rate there really wasnt any reason to hoard. I'll probably sell most of my hoard just to free up room. This does mean you will most likely see good items for sale at player camps though.
---
&gt; **Chems:** The “Detect Life” effect applied by Berry Mentats is now only applied to the player who consumes them.
---
Question: Does this make me Visible but not others? i dont understand.
---
Yes it is powered. I think this is done so that I can find my camp out of all the other vendors that are going to show up. If mine was green like the rest of them I probably wouldn't be able to find my way home.
---
Cool, yeah I dig that gun. In order to Mod it though do I have to scrap others or do I buy the plan? I don't think I have seen plans for my handmade anywhere and certainly haven't found any non handmade versions on enemy's yet though I probably haven't run into any yet.
---
Are you on PC cuz yeah, I would def take you up on your offer!
---
Five for one star.   Fifteen for two star.  40 for three star.   I have 3 charisma and didn’t use any perks/chems for bargain.
---
Not the hero we deserve, but the hero we need.  It took me hours to figure this out and in the end I found out be accident.
---
Go to the world challenges they are there.
---
How much a 1 star for?  And does having CHR, LCK, or hard bargain boost the amount?
---
5.56 goes for 1cap per easily. This will be what I expect to make the most money off of
---
I’m surprised it took them this long.
---
Yeah but only cause I'm getting Technical Data down stairs. 
---
Now I see they sell them as plans. Soooo I'm glad that hunt is over!
---
Bulk sell to vendors
---
You can sell bulked resources to any vendor.
---
Bloody disaster of an oversight. Like REALLY.
---
Am pissed off over this one.
---
WHere are they??
---
The odd thing is I haven't seen these camps in months. And I usually go on at least one whitesprings run per session.
---
This will be useful like In fallout 4 if u are overcumbred u can fly the veritbird and it will bring u places
---
I supported this game when I dropped $65 dollars for it as I do with any other "full" game. The ATOM store is a complete menace, keeping the game behind FO4 as far as available content for building as originally promised. "Free DLC" sounded like it would fix the issue, until it turned out to have almost nothing to do with building assets.
---
Trying, not working.
---
ive started taking the bulk of other items in exchange for 556 and 5mm. Wont share my ratio, because that's a trade secret, but lets say its in acid and gears and call it a day.
---
Some people are bugged
---
Just leave off one of the update sets in the ini :p
---
I had forgotten the 03update set until I saw somebody with custom paint lookin neon fresh
---
I just realized the same. And not to mention how easy challenge for such good weapon compared to garbage "quick fix" knife that took me 3 days of painful wood collecting
---
That's awesome, where did you spy this?
---
production terminal.
---
I have the same problem with the shop for a solid two weeks now. Accepting the purchase opens a new window for PayPal but it almost immediately tells me the purchase has failed.
---
Ive stayed clear of Whitesprings but it seems that's a good place to farm. I will have to try that out, thanx for the advice.
---
Um hello is right!
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blsib1/datamined_legendary_sell_curve_tables/
---
I buy ammo for 1 cap. Can't be bothered with fractions.
---
"Spiking the punch" was just them injecting humor into the situation like they did when they pushed vending back.
---
There is absolutely no reason that people putting nukashine in the bowl had any effect on the temporary disabling of the bowl.
---
Hmm... removed?
---
I upvoted lol
---
What these guys said. That's where I get most of my caps from.  They buy anything bulked -- and other stuff like silver and gold scrap, circuits, etc
---
Sure I can, only if you help me with the dolly sods daily, doing it on a low level is a nightmare
---
It is a joke, not literally because people put nukashine in it.
---
Guess i mean frustrated cuz I stink lol
---
I use the hunters legendary effect on a revolver which also had explosive and quicker fire rate.
---
I used it on deathclaws and mirelurks, both now have no effect on 
---
That is why I brought this up, it might not have been an issue for you but some people actually use this effect
---
I thought we did, the welcome mats?
---
I will miss them it brought joy smashing those camps to pieces.  RIP you will be missed
---
Rumor has it that it was a duping exploit.
---
The only way I found  to see the count is at the vendor machine...
---
You may need to find a tourist and get their camera, I think that is the ingredient needed for the camera.
---
All those Plan are back with the new patch! Just got my Combat Rifle Auto 38 at Watoga station.
---
My group play russian roulette with it honestly
---
Every game should be crossplay imo.
---
I agree with you, kindness could be leaving your water purifiers unlocked or something. I don’t want to interact that much with others lmao
---
 [u/valseek](https://www.reddit.com/u/valseek)  can you please tell the team about this i can't continue the new quest
---
For sure this.  Also I wonder if the legendaries you buy get locked to that character?
---
Wow my voice type just completely slaughtered that. Excellent work deciphering the message bro!
---
Does a bear shit in the woods?
---
Also you it caps at 150 Scrip per day, so will take a few days to empty out the inventory.
---
I'm at work atm. But I've rad on Reddit that the vendor has PLANS for the mods for sale!!!!!!!
---
Is this true?
---
So you expected the value to be based upon what the playerbase perceives as the better effect combinations?
---
My two main friends quit in December. I only have one that comes on sometimes and another one got banned in February. I literally never play any other games and will even play when I am not at my PC through Nvidia Geforce Now. Lots of people say that the game is bad and that we need NPC's but I kinda like Fallout 76 the way it is. I find that the bugs do get annoying but that doesn't stop me from playing. I enjoy the feeling when you find a legendary 3 star enemy and you get a god tier weapon, or when you find some nice people in the world and do quests together. I find that this game is one of the greatest games to find friendly people. I am too addicted and wanna just go home and play 76 for hours(But I really can't).
---
I believe when you fast travel to someone else’s camp you appear where they originally placed the camp device. I usually build around that as the spawn point and my friend appears at the bottom of the from steps.
---
What platform?
---
Very disappointing. It's a game of hit or miss I guess. This sucks because I have messed with the legendary machines for scrip and they're very underwhelming so far.
---
Oh yea Xbox
---
Wth vends in survival?
---
Did they say Nukashine was the problem ?
---
Only if it tracked sales, not listings.  Any yahoo can list 5.56 ammo at 25 caps per, but the data is only meaningful of people are actually paying that.
---
Just a listing of what people are asking isn't totally useless, but it's not very helpful either.  Check ebay listings vs ebay sold listings, you'll see the difference.
---
Me too.
---
Darn, I'm on pc.
---
Yup. Someone just got jammed in my foundations. Had to store some bits so he could get free!
---
Really?
---
u/Valseek any idea when the Early Warnings quest will be fixed? My characters are still stuck on 0/5 motors crafted and have been since the game released.
---
Someone locking their doors isnt a bug...
---
OMG it really has.  I've been watching the clock all day.  Even decided what's the fastest thing I could eat when I got home so I could get right to playing.
---
Shhhhhhhh... ;)
---
Awesome, I was afraid I was going to get a competitive edge on someone if I bought one.
---
No that's not what I mean at all it may have came across that way. I'm just saying kind of sucks it's a base price for all 3* I mean I get the concept though
---
Its just you.
---
So like candy at the watago high school
---
Ps4 here, same problem. I will kill myself for you with love in hearth.
---
Uh.....well you could still get the plans for free versus buying them? And free loot to sell. So treasure maps can still be useful.
---
Not sure where to go either. Not seeing anything on the map
---
That's amazing! I won't look mismatched anymore!
---
Just tried it, totally works just like adventure.
---
Erm..... that’s really odd and weirdly a cool look.
---
Are you on Xbox? I need someone to do that one with.
---
hopefully the refrigerators and scavenging shop atom items are just skins for those?
---
That's fine and before everyone thanks I'm just shitting on the game that is not the case at all. Just stating my opinion for those who haven't experienced it yet
---
NM, I got it - way off to the side of the building
---
Can you see all 120 items on each machine?
---
That is the reason I will be setting up my Decon Arch now.
---
I’m on Xbox =\
---
The salt
---
Seems to only happen with the Raider chest armor
---
Invited you!
---
I see posts like this and still wonder about how many other huge issues are in the game, keeping people away from playing it.
---
i swear to god if its an UA like the football outfit
---
why?
---
It is the daily, yes!
---
Open your game menu in your map, punch challenges, select world, scroll down until you see a bunch of stuff that have 'Tadpole Badge'
---
There's finally a good pip-boy skin
---
I've only read it on here as well, but the screenshot didn't appear to be fake by any means. 
---
Long overdue and relieving...except all that time wasted hopping :p
---
Haven't tested the perks or special points. My one stars sold for 9 scrip and I have an 8 luck build
---
Hopefully they decided to scrap the lazy silver and gold skins and make some real skins for it.
---
Stops them being traded I suppose
---
Seriously, delete the thread before there's a hotfix. If you were lucky enough to see it, you get to tell your friends privately. lol
---
Add me dj-mike-h I need it too :+)
---
Yeah I get that like I said this is not me shitting on the game at all I enjoy this game so much. And I guess the hype around the update is would killed my outlook now. I'm happy for the new features. But I've also read you can't look at legendary effects in player vending machines. So for 3* you will have no idea what your buying. Of course this can all be fixed with updates
---
Hmm not sure then, I honestly didn't know you could give away your camera.  When I accidentally tried to drop it I just got the destroy message.
---
I think the downvotes are because it's just a politer way but still the same old circlejerk of "is the game any good yet"
---
Lmao...  really?  To him?
---
upvote OP! thanks for the good news!
---
I was thinking this same thing when people were saying that they'd just add 10% to their sale price.  Thank you for making it easy for people (one would hope)!
---
Just read this and just started the patch install from my desk at work!  Fantastic.  No more waiting for an hour+ for the files to "copy".  Cannot believe I never thought of this before.  Props!
---
How do you know.
---
Agreed.
---
where's the machine located?
---
Convert caps to ATOMs.
---
Yeah just sucks for people who don't have a ton of time to play everyday it's like jumping on to run errands then by the time you know it not much time to play
---
It was in the patch notes and definitely needed 😂
---
Boohoo you can’t be invincible anymore.
---
What was the price for shocks?
---
Compared to what?  You don't know how much items are going to cost even.
---
Be patient. 
---
This may be a surprise to some but most fallout players aren't on reddit hence they'll be plenty of good 3* out there to buy.  I've gotten some of my best items from people vending them.  People don't know that their FFS  handmade is worth 25k.
---
\^this
---
Lol 'Silent'
---
Like 90 caps each
---
How is it a silent nerf if its literally in the patch notes lmao?
---
As someone who uses mutations and doesn't run starched genes this scares me. This strips my marsupial I'mma find a way to break that arch.
---
I might do some of the camera ones, but I accidentally scrapped my camera the same day I got it and can't make another one. I haven't read today's patch notes yet but I hope that's fixed.
---
I say use the caps to refit some of Vault 76 into a shopping hub for Grahm and Moo Moo
---
and the 2 stingwing there doesnt have barb
---
Can't find them?
---
Can you explain why considering no one knows the values of the Purveyors items.
---
About 92 caps. (For me at least)
---
5880 for me.
---
My unyielding armor gives me lots of charisma though, so probably 6k.
---
Oh boy don't look at Assassin or Cavalier if you are worried about these "silent nerfs."
---
GT: Lurne
---
I'm on right now, I think you're offline or appearing offline.
---
Bethesda this is a huge deal! Please fix it :-)
---
I had a ton of 3\* to sell today. They sold! But only because I priced them with this bug in mind.
---
I’ll come to you,  do you have a mic?
---
Do the still have to be a random spawn?
---
taking over the commonwealth was dope
---
not read them my bad
---
Your Psn? I need too
---
I’m not sure but isn’t the requirement a broken deluxe pro snap camera?
---
Like the ones you can find laying around?
---
A similar thing happened to me except I got trapped under the foundations. It happened to 2 other customers too lol.
---
Haha, no. I sold 2 arms and a leg to separate people.
---
I won't be the one to say that I, *cough* *saw the planned update* *cough*, unloaded them before the new update.
---
Good one:)
---
Gently nerfed and laid out in writing in the patch notes.
---
Good catch
---
Place as many as you want before it gets hotfixed lul
---
But these items has always been junk items, which one ought to consider on the patch release day. 
---
Additionally they aren't that hard to come by, so doubt it will be difficult to obtain again.
---
It's still probably the most useful secondary effect you can get on armor.
---
I think some griefers are getting tired of PvP because a friend and i faced off with one recently who kept fast traveling around the map killing everyone. Cleary they had PvP armor on and a TSE gun and basically at level 60 something were completely unkillable. What bugs me is even in pacifist we can get one shotted by these guys.
---
New vendor update.
---
You sell weapons in a vending machine at your base.
---
Game takes 10% for taxes.
---
Don't know what it goes to.
---
Still the top armor, except most prefer sentinel over cav since sentinel is way easier
---
I have passed it so many times and paid no attention... why drink from a fountain when you have purified water and everything is supposed to be "contaminated"?
---
On a secondary note can you collect said water and have it keep its special properties or does it just go into inventory as regular dirty water?
---
2 things
---
1. Why you gotta screw the punchbowl like that bethesda
---
2. As far as player vending goes, I'm just gonna be putting plans, mods, flux, and outfits in mine. If you want my weapons come see me
---
Great. The spawns had been killed so I server hopped and now I have no daily.
---
Yes, I am on PC but it is late already and  I will be playing  tomorrow, like 7 hours from now.
---
To mod the handmade on your own, you'll have to scrap quite a lot of handmades that you find (they are very rate) or craft. To craft them you need plans, you can buy it at Whitesprings Resort on Free States or Watoga vendors. But for now you don't need any of that, tomorrow I can mod (or craft) your handmade. My IGN is SNTWHWNZ.
---
Rad Ant Lager is a decent option if you can limit yourself to no more than 50 over max carry.
---

---
here is someone else who had the quest pop early so yu see what i mean
---
That is not bad at all
---
&gt; (repeating)  
---
Of course
---
lol that possum hat
---
I cant even get a bloat fly gland, ive killed several and picked up several, but its not registering
---
I scraped like 6 weapons and 10 armor and still have little to do. Mostly one star, but thats what you get when farming. It is ok for me.
---
That's a keyword FeatureItem being leftover from fallout4, where it was also unnecessary.
---
Hi, I am Ravothian and I have regularly sold and bought ammo in the player market for 1 cap each, or 1:1 even trades. Quit ripping other people and yourself off offering less.
---
This must be coming from someone with 10 characters of pure legendaries....
---
Indeed that could be reason for this issue
---
Whitesprings also now has separate counters for each of the Faction vendors with their Faction on the front.
---
Yea this is BS. I was expecting to get rid of a lot of weight today. Bethesda always seem to screw something up somehow. Oh well.
---
Nope, you gotta find the mods that don't specify which set it's for, then look under materials and see if it uses pressure, if not it's an Excavator or Raider mod
---
Thanks for the reports on this, we will investigate!
---
Well...this is gonna get expensive. Fuck.
---
the thing is theres a daily cap, so some people are trying to get a head start, waiting to see could cost you scrip.
---
I'm sorry. I really hate backing out of stuff like that. If you have the plan for any other handmade receivers I might buy that off of ya
---
No, I wouldn't.  Servers are full of people having fun, and it'd take too long to figure everything out.  Maybe take up hiking instead?
---
Well I don’t. Your evidence is anecdotal.
---
Some would take this as a lesson not to support this practice. Not you though. Persistent as ever.
---
Oh I am, don't get me wrong. I'm very happy to bounce around buying plans this week :)
---
I am just saying that the legendary market might be going through a weird week is all :)
---
50 cal receivers now do more damage on hunting rifles :)
---
Can you invite me too?
---
Gt us fellowtankmain1
---
Did a little experiment. For me hard bargain and special boosts did not change the value. For 1,2, and 3 stars weapons scrapped for 5, 15 and 40 and armor went for 3, 9 and 24 respectively
---
Oh lol, no another maintenance now, please! :D
---
I believe the mod plans for Ultracite are earned from Scorchbeast Queen, but don't quote me on that.
---
My girlfriend uses a female model and username in-game and camps in a fairly high traffic location because she likes the brightness of the area in contrast to the starkness of the rest of the map.
---
At least once a day someone waddles in and tries to chat her up, harasses her about being such a low level, or is too poor to afford a mic and just follows her around and teabags her.
---
The locks on the door at least buy her a little privacy if she’s re-arranging her camp or afk with the game logged in.
---
That makes sense
---
I want to speak to the manager
---
Grains for moomoo
---
This, this, this, this.  
---
Oh yeah, and this.
---
Love the jukebox at Biv's.
---
Not your fault!
---
It's also doable in Adventure thanks to a Bethesda "Oopsie". Not complaining about this one though.
---
It seems insignificant to the amount that people already have though. Thanks for explaining!
---
Damn. All of my hoarded x-01 mods are worthless...
---
Sorry. I’m gonna be honest....I’m kinda retarded
---
Any idea where/how to get these?
---
Same here
---
People openly cheating, hackers, dupers, players losing items, almost everything that gets downvoted on this sub.
---
Was vegetable starch for adhesive nerfed? I just made my usual batch and scrapped it and got 6, when usually that number is higher up closer to 14-18.  I can't re-check it currently till my crops re-grow.
---
I wondered, being a W.V. resident, why in hell there was no coonskin hat in the game!?!? But it seems we get a 3-headed two-tailed opossum instead. :)
---
Nah, you're screwed mang.
---
Your sacrifice will be remembered briefly.
---
Yeah kinda makes sense
---
Can't charm a vending machine!
---
Yes😂
---
No one knows.  There's some data mined information out there, but as yet it isn't enough to know with any certainly what things are going to work like once the vendor is released.
---
I have one at my camp in the front doorway, but you have to activate the switch inside next to the door to use it.  I think I'll move the switch outside so that people that don't want to use it can turn it off (if left on by others) before entering my camp. I hadn't thought of people not using Starched Genes and want my place to be people friendly!  Though I am located in a remote area, I'm hoping people will visit.  I have a great view from my back patio (which is why I stay where I am).
---
Oh, no, that's another loop hole.  They get more caps for killing you on Adventure than on Survival. They never nerfed ot on adventure.  Which means to some players it is more lucrative to farm players who dont want to PvP at all for higher cap rewards and your junk.  Once again, pretty sure the dev's have never played a video game before, pvp rewards should have been stripped from adventure the moment survival went live.  Vanilla WoW taught us all that.  Let us still pvp if we vet the itch but make it so there is no reward for it on adventure outside the 3 pvp activities.
---
You literally don’t even know what they’re gonna be used for or how much you can get for one script.....
---
No, only increment of 1
---
Apart from the punch bowl :(
---
Oh shit. Someone made a post about this exact thing the other day.
---
Meh. If someone comes along and wants it? Sure. But I'm not going outta my way, I'm not that hardcore. 
---
I'll happily trade it to someone for something fun... love me some plans I don't already have, or energy ammo... but it's gotta happen "organically" in game.
---
I imagine my camp on that guy will have to be moved. I will walk the grounds and look to see where the first aid station needs to go next.
---
Dang
---
Pretty lame but I guess server stability is important too.
---
A lot of that doesn't happen, doesn't happen much, or is inevitable.
---
It's at the pioneer scout camp near Jaggy. GL though.... I won't spoil the surprise.
---
Maybe if you’re a hoarder with 3 full mules. That’s extreme play most players don’t engage in. It’s fine for the “average user”.
---
This is the one game that aimbotting does not matter.  VATS crit builds are the highest builds in the game atm and no manually aimed weapon does even 1/4 the damage they do.  With the right perks AP isn't even something to bother looking at.
---
No reason to aim bot in a mostly PVE game.  PVP is garbage, anyway and already 1-shot land with auto hits thanks to vats.  I still have yet to see a player survive more than one hit from good builds.
---
when you start your route at the  train station, I can't imagine there isn't somebody already in the club house...this is always what i see
---
This is a great idea
---
Whats the challenge about?
---
Interesting, is it a bug or a feature? Obviously, the answer is yes...
---
Also they have done a lot to address dupers, hackers. Players losing items STILL has no proof behind it.
---
When the game first came out, PA was the best. But that's really good to hear, I'm glad it's not PA. Thanks! :)
---
9?  People are saying 5...
---
Yeah, like how they've totally raised the dumb cap limit.
---
Just accept that the game is built with casual play in mind. Expect to be punished for playing more than 8 hours a week.
---
Lol. It's on a switch. Got tired of the constant sound so it's semi-auto now lol.
---
I haven't investigated the player vending yet, but curious why there is a 'tax' for player sold items?
---
Why can't there be a vending system where you indicate you want 'X' caps for an item, another player spends 'X' caps and you get 'X' caps?
---
No it's just regular people going to work in the morning
---
I had to delete camp stuff to put in weapons and armor, then I could put the camp stuff back
---
Yes it should be a ramdom encounter so you never know exactly where they. I'd donate 10k caps directly to a dev if they add this.
---
I'm not sure if that's a big. Seems to be intended
---
I paid only 10€ for the game because everyone said it's garbage. After patched it became much better than Fallout 4 and I figured I can go and spend real money up to that 60€ original price because I feel the game is now worth it.
---
PA is just the games version of a car. Cool but never gonna be as cool as the non PA users. You get far more benefits from legendary gear over the one effect per piece of PA
---
Ugh GOOD JOB BETHESDA UGH. How the fuck were we supposed to play the game without this information. UGH Jesus how useless UGH. Fucking UGH. Guess you better give us 10,000 free atoms for screwing up in such a cosmic capacity. Ugh this is so despicable. UGH. I can't even do this anymore. UGH.
---
These should've been obvious from the start, but it's nice to see they got around to it half a year later.
---
Tried searching you and don’t see your GT, mine is Xwolfpackleader
---
I’ve been feeling the same way all day.  I almost considered calling in sick lol.
---
Yeah, it's because PA is useful at lower levels, but once you start getting legendaries at higher levels you don't really need it anymore except for nukezones and Queen Fights.
---
Then what about the posts on this sub with various bugs people are experience and cause people to continually give up on the game?
---
Weapons and armor scrap for different amounts. I put another post further down with the breakdown on what I got for each
---
Like 4c honestly most ppl sell regular for like 10c
---
I am guessing the same as other vendors. 20 hours from the first sell/purchase.
---
I have the same issue.
---
I have saved a few things over the past few days, but not much.  Now I'm glad I didn't.  At least they released this a week before the Vendor comes out...gives people a week to get as much scrip as they can, though 1050 scrip over the course of 7 days doesn't seem like a lot.
---
Maybe PvP will be even remotely enjoyable now.
---
you are welcome
---
I can help u with revive an ally what platform are u on?
---
Ugh that sucks! Thanks for the info, might have to recruit my second account to hunt for one
---
Go to your "Challenges" tab to and go to the "World" tab in that. Scroll down the list and you'll find the scout challenges.
---
Oh sh*t sorry I forgot the spaces lol
---
Is that with an auto build? I'm looking at these numbers other people carry around, and it makes me xtremely glad I'm about to free up tons of stash/inventory space. I usually walk out with about 350 for m main auto handmade and 350 for my backup auto combat rifle. When I get to about half with my main, I know it's time to wrap things up and head back for a restock.
---
But now, I'll have so much more space. Walking out with 1k+ rounds will be such a luxury. I'll be limited only by my weapon condition.
---
I can help too. GT is Lost Dome.
---
Its been posted someone datamined it
---
I had to awkwardly ask some guy if I could "Murder him for a quest"
---
Are you saying that you wish you could buy atoms with rl money?
---
Them, you are correct.
---
whats your question?
---
In beta we did have them, but if you jumped to a tall camp building you could fall to the ground and die before it loaded in... they removed the mat to fix this issue and thats the last we heard...
---
Pipboy &gt; Stat &gt; Collection (is new)
---
Treasures contain now trash only. The power armor plans aren't worth anything and vanilla weapons not even worth the time.
---
I just deleted a extra wall I don't need and still the same message. Then I accidently deleted my power armor station and that made enough budget to list multiple items.
---
Embarrassing. They have to be aware of the issue, it should have been taken care of a long time ago.
---
I think I’d feel that way if I couldn’t reliably earn atoms. I always have enough to get stuff I like
---
Or you could not give a rats ass. That is my plan.
---
So there's a 150 scrip / day limit?
---
All the way down to: 
---
&gt; Pip-Boy: In the Pipboy's Component View, all components are now shown in the list, not just components that are in the player’s inventory. This should allow for easier tracking of hard-to-find crafting ingredients.
---
So many awesome changes in this patch.
---
Ah - that is a thing I forgot about. Are they still necessary or vastly stronger for areas with constant RADS? Ideally I'd just like to never have to use PA, but that might not be the case
---
I barely have any caps with a stash full of pretty good 3*'s.
---
 I would guess a large portion of players don't use reddit marketplace type pages including myself.
---
 I will also guess the prices won't be anywhere near what you see and those market pages.
---
 I will be listing a few at a time.
---
Wow thanks for sharing and sorry you got a big hit by being one of the first. Hope it was not Sentinel / Unyielding / Cavalier stuff?
---
Alright. I'm going to add you and join.
---
Sorry if I didn’t make it clear for people in how I stated it, but yes I definitely meant only count and track prices for sales and not listings.
---
No cares if someone listed a fusion core for 20,000c, but they do care if 200 people actually bought them for 100c each.
---
They have to use different
---
my camp is in the free states i feel that it should allow me to go tax free. :P
---
I love the game but everyone has to admit it was an awful release, a buggy mess, and unplayable.  And not just the game itself, the bags, the drinks, the disappointment they created.  It is a good game now and I enjoy it.
---
That's kinda meh in my opinion but I guess it's like that for its own reasons
---
Thanks btw
---
I play console and have never, ever met someone with a mic.
---
Suggest first run through there non-nuke.  There may be reisdual radiation from a recent drop.  Likely few legendaries outside, and slightly easier enemies.  Also good time to check out the vendors.
---
Be aware of the WS bots.  you do not want to hit one with a stray bullet.  
---
It will not end well for you.
---
To that end, I did my first WS run at L27 with either a fire axe or machete, I forget which.
---
So I can erase the sharpie dot in the middle of my monitor now?
---
Picking a lock in an owned workshop?
---
"Committing *Sudoku*"
---
It's like redbox?
---
Maybe not to you. But games dont revolve around a singular person. People can still use them for benefit. It's not that bad. 👍
---
Yeah I thinks it’s important that everybody takes a second to be patient before throwing in more speculation and expectations or else we will have another r*pair k*t type crisis in the sub again
---
I must have missed that info. How exactly did they nerf it? Sorry if that has been answered a dozens times already, wasn’t online for a couple of days.
---
24! Holy cow that’s ludicrous
---
This is how they should be. I have no interest in the spawnkill fest that is Survival.
---
Or picking a lock at a camp I assume
---
Admittedly... i got to 63,000 then bailed. That was over 2 and half years ago now. Just could not do it. I will go back to ps4 1 day
---
Well guess I need to go check it out next time I pillage the sschool for plastic.
---
Submitted a bug ticket thanks
---
Earning the challenge badges.
---
*hugs my instigating prime HR while looking over my shoulder at your Instigating Prime HR*
---
Go to challenges, world, scroll down and there will be new tadpole,ones added
---
I believe soon that folks will compile a list of the "fair market value" of various items and share it to all fellow Redditor's.  It can obviously be updated to adjust values as the market for those items change (+/-).  Something like a Google doc's spreadsheet that will evolve over time.
---
Patch notes say otherwise.
---
Yes. I fast traveled to one camp and got stuck, and no way am I walking overland to shop. This is still America!
---
I also popped right into an ongoing attack on the camp at at least half the camps I visited this morning. I feel like I should get a discount for helping defend the camp.
---
Steal someone's supply crate!
---
Wait... Wait.... PLAGUE DOCTOR MASK? guess i'll contract diseases for a plague walker build.
---
The only significant difference is no more attacking players camps who aren't hostile, but you can still become wanted through normal means... i.e. attacking other players, picklocking camp stuff, etc
---
Do you know where to look though? I’m sorry for being a pest, but I’d prefer a spawn and sever hopping to endless scrapping.
---
Yeah, per character.
---
Tis the Lucky Hole!
---
I mean it’s still the beast armor effect in the game
---
I doubt it . All games try to limit you so you have to keep coming back . I’ve been telling people this will be the case for the last week
---
My 76 Discord group was just venting about that his past week. Heh. We had a new player join, and we were trying to stock him up with XP bonuses, and there were endless rants about why it's perfectly fine for a can of dog food to sit out in the sun for 20 years and be totally fine... but a freshly canned batch of stew goes bad overnight.
---
Ha!
---
Speak to the robot, he will send you on quests, a quest starts, I assume we get badges once we complete the quest
---
This is what they said in  a  previous patch, but IMO, this is not correct. They were not randomized to begin with.  They were simply never there.  And honestly,  I did not even know that you could buy BOS plans from a vendor.  
---
I have had the plans for the BOS chest piece for a while now, and they did not come from a vendor, and I'm honestly not sure where they did come from. 
---
I honestly did not know that you could buy them from a vendor because I had never once seen them at a vendor. I don't call that random. I call that non-existent.
---
any idea how much it would be worth?
---
Can’t have scouts camp without bunks,...
---
This is the argument that makes the most sense and gets the least respect. The ATOM store and Bethesda's refusal to provide building assets as part of a game that inherently involves building is despicable. FO4 STILL has more building assets in the BASE GAME than they put into FO76 to this point. And the "free DLC" turned out to have nothing to do with building so far (except for the odd trinket). False advertising, bait &amp; switch, lies - call it whatever, but it's just wrong.
---
Absolutely spot on. I'm sick of seeing people charging stupid prices for stuff. I refuse to go near any of it. I grind til I find good items. I sell to vendors at train stations and anything else I don't want that I won't get much for I drop at V76 for newbies to take. I would sooner not deal with players bar PVP or quest help. I refuse to trade or sell until people cop on. 
---
And once I can sell at my own vending machines I won't sell for any more than double/triple the value on the weapon. Id like to make caps but I'm not fucking greedy.
---
Damnit no respect for ultracite :(
---
Same here man no idea what's going on, my thoughts, Bethesda messed up AGAIN
---
Oh. Okay why aren't they in the quest?
---
Are you ignorant? The player count has risen and stayed there. We aren't losing players anymore. Most bugs reported now are minor.
---
I hope you're right, I really do.
---
I was just joking about Sarbucks. My apologies.
---
I'll try to get in contact with you later but be on the look out.
---
What can you do with them? Like make your own stories and store them?
---
Do you know where to look though? I’m sorry for being a pest, but I’d prefer a spawn and server hopping to endless scrapping.
---
Don’t do it, you have so much to live for! Stay strong! ;)
---
The 10% tax should be distributed at the end of the month, giving everyone who plays the game a portion of the money.
---
Under challenges go to world, go to the bottem. Those are the badges you need.
---
Maybe build a vertibird landing pad at our camps and then use grenades supplied from a crate next to it (like the mortar) to call it in
---
They're the ones who decided to hoard legendaries since the roadmap was announced, thats their own problem not bethesda's
---
Can you provide a source for player count rising?
---
The radius for spawns is pretty small - it's not based on the area, it's like 30-100 feet at very most. I'll often see bodies of ghouls laying there, and as I get within like 50 feet the bodies instantly vanish and new ghouls spawn. They might get some kills in the club house, but that's only 1/3 or so of the total ghouls on the run. There are some spots that you have to run right up next to in order to spawn them. 
---
The rare time when someone is really purposefully taking all of my spawns, I just leave and farm something else for 20-30 minutes while they stand in the club house. They always leave.
---
Yeah it took me a while to find that out, bethesda fix your game
---
You forgot to begin it "Dear Bethesda,"
---
I'm really enjoying the update so far, so I'm not mad.
---
Just curious honestly.
---
Well that’s odd that you state specifically that is wasn’t in the notes 🤔
---
T h a n k y o u.
---
More than three hours, apparently.
---
Doesn't work like that. Scrip is only for the legendary vendor. Can't be exchanged, sold, or used anywhere else
---
Nah it was not, was still pretty strong armor though. I just hope they fix this soon.
---
It must be a buggy oversight.  I assumed I'd have to capture 20 bases, build 100 turrets, etc.
---
But nope, just one.
---
We non-pa players have been to polite to say.... some of you have been in there so long you’re beginning to develop a bit of a funk.... soap is lying about you know...
---
I need to lock my doors. I'm fine with my cooking and crafting rooms being used by the public but I don't want mud getting tracked into my home!
---
It’s so you check out the other items in the atom shop while you are there?
---
In the news section it has an outfit featured that's not in the atomic shop, and it's featured for this update, is it not supposed to be available yet?
---
Since its just cav and assassin, and only lvl 35, id say between 3-7k depending on the right buyer. Currently the 25k+ armor pieces are sentinel unyielding. However, the +1 strength is a nice third, so id lean towards the higher end of 5-7k. Its also raider so not as strong as combat armor
---
Can you jump off high enough a point there to die?
---
At launch there were so many nukes dropping and no survival mode so it was pretty mandatory . The only thing that let you not use pa was God’s gift that let you bug out pocketed armor for unlimited carry limit with no over encumbering
---
Giant fucking lies. Fall in a hole, Todd.
---
I'm saving my nuka colas for my cola nut perk. As long as they arent as expensive as the vendor sold ones I'd happily buy them
---
Yep. Macroeconomics 101. Regrettable in the short term, necessary in the long term.
---
Also to be honest half of what I'm going to be vending will be stuff I'd be lugging around waiting to give to someone anyway. I'm not really looking to turn a huge profit, or any profit in some cases.
---
Why? It gives an alternative to PA with calibrated shocks. The whole point of balancing is to make more then one or 2 builds viable for any particular situation. I think it was a great move by Bethesda balance wise.
---
Check steam, and player count aggregate websites. Not to mention console sales.
---
I'm running a bloodied build, so yes.
---
That's what I thought would happen. They listened and always make things easier and easier. In a week we'll see a hundred 'I just bought my quad bloodied two-shot from the purveyor' threads ✌️
---
A little bit more readable:
---
Armor -&gt; 3, 9, 24
---
Weapons -&gt; 5, 15, 40
---
I built a trader hub castle by overseers...easy for people to get to..but with the ability to ft to places..you know im moving to the mountains somewhere lol
---
I'm happy to report that [there is a Fallout 4 mod](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4/mods/18315/?tab=images) that adds this
---
That's kind of dumb but thank you.
---
bro i think i also have a unyielding sent 3* robot chest level 50 💀
---
They didn't mess up. You did. Check bottom of world challenges.
---
Ahhhhhh
---
Follow up, do you know where these 'Exams' are?
---
My camp is at the end point for the mistress of mhysteries quest line. Nice little overlook
---
It is big because nobody will buy weapons or armor without knowing the other 1-2 legendary stats . This is also true with the trade window
---
I find that the 200 round standard magazine is more than enough considering how "fast" it fires.
---
What system are you using?
---
P.S. DRINK SOMETHING
---
Great shot!
---
That doesn't make you wanted?
---
Well us with Bird Bones I've survived multiple camera teleportation drops!
---
Haha, its robot so its the worst armor piece, but those two effects would still make it a good piece, prob in the 15-20k range, pre patch atleast
---
Hmm still the best armor in the game so why complain?
---
I prefer the fraction form for this reason. :)
---
It’s gonna be a real headache getting them!
---
That i do not haha im finishing up all the other challenges then gonna look into that
---
Just heard about it today also too. So pretty much the sentinel/cavalier/assassins effects on armor have a 75% chance to actually reduce incoming damage per hit. So that means theoretically 1 in every 4 shots will not be reduced by the sentinel/cavalier/assassins effect meaning you will have to tank that shot with no reduction of damage and only your base ballistic damage your armor provides.
---
thanks
---
Gt MatanzaCueto, will return the favor 😊
---
Same thing on Xbox. Wishing for welcome mats for CAMP!
---
I would like to see a steel frame mod for the crossbow, like an actual tactical crossbow that would make it fully automatic and longer range (but not too fast to make it op)
---
Maybe it’s just me but all the content of the post is gone and all I see is [removed].
---
Bethesda would rather wait until you complain, good luck
---
You can craft it instantly after login
---
Been away from the game for awhile. What's this about turret camps?
---
I appreciate it !
---
So I'm not the only one! What the hell is with the AI's hatred of fiber? I had my CAMP in the same spot for weeks without issue, but the moment I planted a few razorgrain I was aggroing Scorched from so far away VATS wouldn't lock on. No amount of replanting would fix it, either. I wound up having to set up an awkward concrete wall in front just so they'd stop shooting my crops.
---
sweet. Come to me and we'll just let each other get downed by the ghouls at Whitespring or something
---
Its amazing. And i would assume people who dont use reddit are selling alot of stuff theyve held on to...got a qe double barrel for 300 caps lol.
---
Oh man I hope mine is good it’s at the golf course
---
Yeah I expected it too, I doudt they will up it to any crazy amount. I think we will see 200 to 250 tops
---
Saw one last night. Level 128 dude. Some poor 35 tok the 35 wanted hit for killing turrets and got hunted/griefed over it.
---
You really think that to someone who has already done SBQ feels rewarded for doing a Treasure Map and get vanilla combat rifle. That person must be one hell of a dumb person with low standards.
---
I misread your post. you got them from people's vendors. i thought you meant they turned in for scrip and you get it that way
---
They're on a terminal in one of the cabins at the Pioneer Scout campground.
---
Explosive weapons %)
---
I got a hunters legendary from him, always assumed that was deliberate!
---
Thats what Im starting to expect, but I really hope its something better
---
*cranberries
---
But those pesky saxons may be involved for all I know!
---
You placed to many thing that’s pretty much it :)
---
Do you pick locks? That is the question.
---
In a cabin next to the first scout leader mr handy. There is a sign outside the cabin leading to a terminal to take the exams
---
You can always switch the cards out whenever you want. You’ll be using lockpick on a lot of safes which can contain good loot and plans sometimes. 
---
Safes also have a chance to drop technical data as well.
---
I'd actually go as far as to say you shouldn't be selling your legendaries yet. It's pretty obvious bethesda released this scrip feature before having a use for them to judge the exchange rate... The more people sell, the more scrip legendaries will end up costing.
---
Quad Crossbows shred in PvP... Just throwing that out there
---
Is fast traveling to another player's CAMP, that has a vendor on it, free? Or does it cost caps, like fast traveling to any other location on the map? I can't get online myself to answer this...
---
I'm just waiting for the extremely inflated legendary vendor market that pisses everyone off.  
---
*1,000 scrips for a 2* rolling pin?? Wtf Beth!?!*
---
I need to take one I can't remember where it stated haha
---
Spoiler Alert: \*You Can't\*
---
It is in the patch notes that it was doing more than it listed I believe. So the nerf may not have changed the paperdoll numbers
---
Ok, now my brain herts
---
Maybe we should push to get them legendary effects then. Bloodied drill here I come.
---
People would build their camps with turrets that would aggro and kill the spawns. Since it's a popular farming spot, they were basically denying mobs from the active players by doing so.
---
I'm also not OP, he was just saying that he got some good deals on good guns. Whereas I'm just tryna spread knowledge lol
---
Why are they for sale in the atomic shop?
---
How does it round for bulk items that cost 1.
---
If you buy a small amount does it round up or down, if I buy one does it go tax free, or does the owner get no caps, 
---
does it "remember" partial tax.
---
Can I screw someone out of their caps by buying one cost items 1 by 1 to ensure bethesda receives a 100% tax rate, or would doing such give all caps to the owner.
---
I had made a five star resort that now has no real place
---
Mine is busted, it fails to look up things. And its called "Black Deathclaw Egg" lol.
---
They said workshop turrets no longer attack wanted players. Not sure I recall seeing them say that about Camp turrets.
---
You may be right though. Bethesda may have actually thought this through.
---
Cool!
---
I'm going to assume it's not free, haven't tested myself. Simply because otherwise you'll be able to get almost anywhere on a full server for free/under 3 caps.
---
Same for me. Playing on xbox.
---
My hopes of having a pet Megasloth are crushed.
---
Seppuku bro, Sudoku is something else :)
---
If it makes you feel any better, one of my characters has a house with no door...or visible entrance.  Have fun.  And if you find your way in, feel free to take as much water as you need/want.
---
The only camps I have with locked doors either have a farm I don't want ransacked by every random person that comes across it or is so far out of the way, that you'd have to be purposefully walking past workbenches just to get to it(and even then only the front/ground level door is locked).
---
You can claim workshops from anywhere at the workshop. That has been in for a while.
---
Instructions unclear, power fist-sized hole in monitor.  Further clarification needed.
---
That seems pretty obvious... Why would you travel to a player camp in survival?
---
Like they will come with you to a silent night, let you play the instrument, run as hell and kill the 3* wendigo and the kill you with some freaking superweapon because you put one bullet in them and frowned...
---
My main is 218, I have seen a 742 on Xbox recently, and saw a level 330+ in early December.
---
I'm currently around 1200 hours, so it goes without saying that anyone over around 350 got there by taking advantage of some sort of XP Bonus/Glitch, which I actually avoided with my main character.
---
I did once, early in the game, create a new character and quickly level it up by testing some exploits (Not Duping), which resulted in a level 68 character with only 3.5 hours of playtime, I subsequently deleted the account, as I always considered the journey more fun than the end.
---
I still farm workshops just for the plans. I’ve gotten them all, but like to sell duplicates for cheap
---
Wouldn't let me pick you up? Got a spare stimpak only have diluted
---
Shadowed is also back (Responders faction)! Still can't find Dense, though.
---
That's really a matter of programming, not mathematics. Have some purchase 11 items that cost 1 cap and see whether you receive 9 caps or 10.
---
Welll
---
Somebody up there didnt
---
Which is where???
---
Is this in survival?
---
 “All the content we ever put out for Fallout 76–all the DLC, all the post-launch stuff–is going to be free. That’s important. And to say, the Atomic shop is cosmetic stuff. To make sure folks understand–look there’s a line. There are people who have crossed it, but we’re going to stay on the right side of it in terms of the things you can spend money on and how this stuff works and what you’re getting for your $60. That you know, when they put out new content or features or whatever, I’m getting that stuff for free. That feels right.”
---
just did be right there
---
I know :P
---
It's but a bit of humor.
---
I usually hover around 10k caps...I have most of the camp item plans (except a couple of harder to a find ones), I always get my 1400 caps a day, even if that's all I log on for (it usually takes me about 30 minutes just to do that).  The only things I really use caps for are fast traveling, helping my teammates out when they need caps for things, or occasionally coming across a weapon/armor plan/mod that I want.  I think I give more away than I keep!
---
Finally we get an worthy update.
---
Darn it so much for the Animal Friend perk for Scorchbeasts, Deathclaws.
---
It came in handy.
---
It's all good
---
YES. I'm going to buy the jetpack after I get the caps. 
---
Have they updated the armory vending machine too?
---
Also free states vendor now inside the Spa. A
---
Ffs, it's like they're allergic to QoL.
---
Again. Doesn't revolve around 1 person. You're confusing your opinion with facts. Some people just like to do them. It's a zero cost activity. It's still free plans/ammo/junk. So while YOU might not value them. It doesn't mean someone else won't. Which would've been my previous point. 😂
---
How are their camps protected? They are hostile to you.
---
Thank you! I was scratching my head there for a good hour.
---
Go to map. Go to challenges. Scroll down to world challenges. Go into that list and scroll way down it. It will have challenges called “Tadpole: Archer” and such.
---
Exactly what I was thinking, and the reasoning behind my question. I'm assuming it'll use the same calculation from your current location, as it does now for any 'normal' map marker. If anyone tests this, please let me know. :\*
---
Oh man I love this game!!!!
---
Weird i can inspect woth no problem
---
Wish we could. Just need Bethesda's help to make it happen all the way.
---
Dude, it was a bug. They fixed a bug. Grow up and deal with it.
---
I still think the BoS vendor bot should put the occasional beat down on the raider vendor bot.
---
Alrighty. If you can't get into the world, just join a random one and I'll go to you.
---
It costs caps
---
*Bug* Can’t seem to move two of my foundation blocks that have nothing attached to them. They were placed pre patch and had no problem then. I was just rearranging my house last night. It states that certain structures cannot be accessed if I remove it. However it’s just 2 block foundations together, that’s it. I am using it for a platform, for my vending machine.
---
True, it's a pain in the ass to do though.  By the way what is technical data used for? I'm not all that far.
---
I think we can apply simple logic. It's obvious to scrap any legendary with zero value. If it has a greater-than-zero value to you or another player, it makes sense to wait and see.
---
That sounds awesome.
---
I've just bought these from free states vendor in ws...now located opposite artisans corner
---
Loser
---
Have an option for CAMP visitors to leave comments. Though that one might go badly, it could be interesting.
---
Worth less now that they put a lot of plans back on vendors. Plans are really the only reason to do them.
---
Oh I totally agree with you. If everything works out right the prices for items should really come down
---
You can get items from digging them up.  Sometimes rare items or plans.
---
That's brutal. But they definitely seemed less frequent than before.
---
How is this game holding up nowadays ? 
---
I remember being so hyped for this games release but when the reviews dropped and people were saying how bad it was I decided to wait until it got sorted out.
---
What system? I'm on ps4, it says press r3 to inspect but nothing happens.
---
Thanks friend!
---
Phew glad it wasn't just me
---
&gt; General: Corrected typos in number of Challenges
---
Oh boy, that's promising...
---
I have my camp in that location so i get a free cat :)
---
Thanks very much, location?
---
Just be warned the calibrated shocks for the X-01 cost 5 violet flux each
---
Halloween candy is an inventory item, I still have 40 of them in there for whatever reason.
---
They'll lead you to a mound of dirt that has some supplies in it. Most of them give plans as well.
---
I was gonna say, I was looking real hard for something to be upset about, but this looks like a really solid patch. I'm very happy, and hope Bethesda keeps this trajectory going. Really feels they're finding their groove
---
WHAT
---
You set up your camp. Build an area with tables and signs and sell food and drink items.  A counter.  Clever name and theme.  Advertise on here or on Market. 
---
Dude. You can do it.  Hell I might do it.
---
Because people don't like the idea that other people have differing opinions.  If this isn't obvious from how arguments start here, on this subreddit, then look at how people react to differing opinions on even a semi-political level, let alone a full scale political level.
---
Anyway, I don't down vote people, even those I disagree with, I also don't up vote people I do agree with.
---
I mean, what good is a mailbox, much less multiple variants, without mail?
---
Just saying I wish there was a feature where you could toggle on and off the backpacks that come with outfits
---
Similar, I got a ghouls slayers golf club. IN YOUR FACE GOLF CLUB GHOULS!!!!
---
Is that a joke... You have to do it all?
---
I’m doing it on a new character, haven’t gotten the camera yet to do so
---
They’ve nerfed assassin, cavalier and sentinel effects as well. After nerfing the reward for being in PVP servers by about 75% with the caps and aid that is dropped. Now turrets are invulnerable while you’re left with a “chance” for your armor to do what it’s supposed to. Why even have a PVP part of the game if they’re going to keep chipping away at it? I’ve spent MONTHS collecting that armor for exactly what it did. Luckily they waited until this game was practically dead (for me) to nerf these effects
---
How? I haven't taken one in a while but last i checked i had to interact with the workbench to claim.
---
That is how it is supposed to work in survival, it was in the previous notes.
---
my quest is completly broken i'm so sad right now see my link for explanation
---
Oof, that makes me want to wait until the vendor is actually here before turning in items for scrip at all.
---
u/CarterG4
---
It works sometimes. About 90% of the time it doesn't work but I have had it work once or twice today.
---
Yes, there's a 150 Scrip limit.
---
There was a sign for the shooting range at camp venture.. Might be it.
---
I might spend money for atoms just for that nuka cola backpack
---
what kind of plans i mean? BOS combat armor plans?
---
I agree that this is awesome but ffs EVERYTHING should be in the patch notes!!
---
bump
---
Seems that from people's reports, those match the number of scrips people are getting for turning in their items, including one person who checked all 3 weapon returns, which matched exactly what you're got posted.
---
I meant the cola machine
---
Raider vendor bot would kick his circuit board out
---
I dunno, i don't think they are gonna change the exchange rate in the next week and a half. I think they are just adjusting textures of the store and probability tables.
---
👐
---
Who cares an super mutant's life?
---
Your camp budget is to full. I delt with it too
---
This patch makes me want to come back
---
Yes. BoS plans that were taken out a couple patches ago.
---
The workshop budget not my budget. But what's the workshop budget anyway?
---
I’ll buy them if you are on ps4
---
Those are different paint skins.
---
The code appears to only take into account 1-3 star items when doing the scrip exchange, so it seems to have been done on purpose.
---
Now I wish they would give the Ultracite laser a little bit of love, it lacks behind the regular laser rifle.
---
Why can’t you do damage to their camps? Bug from that now being in adventure?
---
80% less effective.
---
Can I just make the following comment, which I considered quite a bit before I posted....
---
....HHAAHAAAAAHHHAHAAHHA
---
There, now both of us feel better.
---
Pretty sure they are fully vulnerable in survival
---
I've always hated white springs to be honest. Never built there, never understood why others would.
---
How much did you make so far?
---
But is it worth defending?
---
It's a weird glitchy thing. If you get rid of stuff in your camp it should let you sell
---
How do I assign a point over taking a perk card, current character level is 12 if that helps
---
FOR TREASURE, MATEY!
---
(They weigh nothing in inventory.  More of a very slim chance for anything worth keeping, but I use them mostly for scrapping mods)
---
Or indeed even play the "mode"?
---
Awesome! Thank you for sharing!
---
Oh hell no. I claim, then bounce to the next one
---
OK here's a scenario for you, since you just never fucking quit with your futile arguments.  Two players, player A has sent assassin gear.  Player B doesnt.  Player b gets the jump, fires the first two shots, which do what... 30% of player As hp.  Player A then turns and 1shots player B.  During the time that fight took place, was player A "effectively invulnerable" or not?  Do you think this is a fair match up?
---
Thank you, nothing marked on map for me so I'll wait... restart game etc
---
Its still way stronger than everything else, no one had a chance of catching up or even killing you without a cheesy build to counter it. They caps up a little, and can tune it more in the future. They do need to fix camps though.
---
Fallout 76 isn't on Steam...
---
Well, time to launch some nukes :)
---
Bye 👋
---
Anyone know what you need to do for the growth section?
---
Is that haircut available?
---
This is clearly sarcasm.  Over the top sarcasm but it’s sarcasm.
---
Sarcasm.
---
From what I heard, the damage said before the patch was correct and that you had to do a glitch to be able to do 100% explosive damage. So if you had 888 damage, it was correct unless you did a glitch.
---
Awesome! Thanks for the info! Can’t wait to check it out after work!
---
Perhaps lag from everyone dumping otems in all at once IDK? Never works for me.
---
I'd just like to be able to turn it into raw materials. I don't need all this .45, I need .44!
---
I don’t think you can even place them in a workshop only in your camp I’m pretty sure.
---
May i join? Still need this badge
---
Are we sure it's daily? Could it be weekly??
---
I'm aware that they catered to the whining. Pretty confident the drawbacks will swiftly reveal themselves :)
---
If you’re gonna server hop for him the power station near harpers ferry has 2 spots he can spawn in pretty close by.  Got him there on my third hop hunting him, and have seen him in several of the spots mentioned in this thread.
---
It's awesome. 
---
It's 2:30am here and I have to force myself to go to bed. 
---
This is going to be so fun.
---
It's the ugly tall one right? I was hoping for one I could place at my desk :(
---
Idk where I'm gonna shove this one.
---
I can help
---
what they CAN do it set it so when you store or try to move it, it deletes itself. Happened to me, once the BETA bugs were ironed out.
---
I defend them, it's easy and you get more plans
---
I haven’t bothered to pick a lock in 50+ levels because I don’t wanna change out cards
---
Oh man. I didn’t know about the turret farming cheese and when some buff guy came by and destroyed all my turrets I was like wth??!! I didn’t do anything to anyone and he didn’t destroy anything else. Lol now I know.
---
I rebuild my camp right after patch and all was ok
---
I would always destroy those camps and use a soothing voice while I did it
---
PvE it’s fine. I use a standard PvP explosive  shotgun build and I could see it still working alright. If you’re using bloodied you’ll still be putting up insane numbers. Vats crit bloodied Rifle builds are probably still gonna wreck us tho
---
Vittumaisia kysymyksiä 😤
---
Some dude wanted to trade with me so I offered him some random bloodied melee weapons for ridiculously low prices, he didn't bite
---
I imagine it's very contextual - like, only someone trying to level up a melee character would be interested in a lvl 25 bloodied baseball bat. But wouldn't it be awesome if you could get one right when you needed it???
---
PVP players are the minority. Bethesda would rather cater to the other 80% of the playerbase so they buy more shit in the atomic shop.
---
Because I have 5000 scripts worth of junk to offload and I want to do it all now.
---
(I only have a few hundred in reality)
---
I suppose we will see :)
---
Just like in fallout 4 if you’ve played that then you should know what Carter is talking about.
---
The dirt mound does appear, you just can't dig it with out the map.
---
And you are literally being ridiculously naive that you think there won't be a grind in this.
---
Do you think you can get 40 scrips for a 3*, then immediately trade it in for a new 3* egg?
---
It won't work like that. This is a legendary sink. Players knew this and have been collecting for weeks.
---
I don't necessarily agree with the limit, but why do you assume this is OK?
---
Finally- BGS are listening
---
It absolutely does.  5 cap bounty.  Shooting down an escorted cargobot and looting that does not.  Picking someone else's supply drop will.
---
I have one.  I'll have to check it out
---
You have to go to challenges, find the ones that award badges and complete all the subchallenges.
---
&gt; Depending on *how much* higher the damage is, I may go back to mine as my go-to weapon.
---
My Prime boi went from 160 damage to 180 (or from 800 to 900 after sneak + Instigating). Holy Mothman.
---
Okay, but it does. I came across a crate yesterday and it said "steal" or something like that, and not realizing it was a thing, became wanted after I picked the lock. But whatever, I must be wrong and it never happened...
---
What is it?
---
Below level 50, when you level up you get to assign a point and also get to pick a card (which doesn’t have to be for the same trait as the one you just added a point to).   It’s only after you run out of points to assign (you get 50) that you have the option of moving a point.
---
I like it. It's like a kiosk.
---
True. I usually put down a bunch of turrets then go to the next one. I find that when I’m pretty far away from a workshop I should defend, like across the map, the mission ends in success and I get plans anyway. Not sure if it’s from the turrets or enemies despawning
---
Vim cooler backpack PogChamp
---
Drop them off at the overseers camp in batches. Make a noobs day.
---
You got it backwards
---
Okay thank you so much man
---
Cool thanks man
---
Get out.
---
I meant the community could do it through self-reported surveys and spreadsheets type deals shared through the subreddit, but obviously you’re limited by the accuracy of self-reporting and the small sample size of people who want to participate, that remember to participate as often as possible. In the end you have a small sample of potentially somewhat accurate data, but still something.
---
(Also, I’m an XB1 player, so mod-driven solutions to any problem or issue, not this just this one, are outside of what’s practical for myself and other console players)
---
That’s why ultimately it would be best for Bethesda to develop the tools, or adapt what they have already if they have something, because they have all they data available to them and it’s some simple math for the calculations, the hard work would be the public interface, whether in-game via personal terminals or the like, or a public website.
---
I just killed a wanted player so yes
---
Ouch - it looks totally unusable now.  I have a sight on my gatling plasma and its pretty much unusable too aiming cause it shakes like no tomorrow while firing.
---
Go play on survival instead of being a professional fuckstain.
---
Thanks, yeah. In my 40s, full time job, raising a teen - it's not an everyday thing, you know? I plowed hundreds of hours into FO4 over time, but FO76 was specifically manufactured to undermine my wander/build playstyle (or force me to subsidize everyone else's).
---
There's a base VATS cost listed in the weapon stats too. I haven't checked if it's actually used.
---
Then sucks to suck
---
never.
---
No, they’re in the Vending tab in the V menu
---
No problem, anytime! And thanks for the recipes!
---
Thanks!! Man they look long
---
I'm new to the game, just started this morning. What's a turret farmer?
---
Indubitably.
---
Haven't played in a while, can someone fill me in on why people building at Whitesprings was bad?
---
Yes you can.
---
todays' update should fix that problem, as long as your base foundation touches the ground, everything else should be negotiable.
---
No, that's incorrect. The Explosive nerf was simply not applied to shotguns for some reason; now it is.
---
Perhaps they noticed a way to dupe via the Punch Bowl, and decided to "fix" it, before it became wide spread.
---
Great idea, now I gotta do that too haha
---
But you get the jetpack plans for the T series easily from the queen I thought?
---
I wish.
---
If you remove the sight does it still hold the gun like that?
---
Some of the 50’s receivers are from scrapping some are from plans
---
Okay so i think i figured it out guys.
---
So it keeps working for me in the beginning.
---
BUT then it will suddenly stop.
---
I switch severs and it repeats.
---
It seems it only works for a severely short time after joining a server.
---
Then just stops.
---
Oh, yeah
---
You're at level 30...you have no excuse for having a weapon break on you.
---
Before, and after patch - was taken in&amp;out of power armor. but the same is the same in or out of PA....
---
you know how much trouble it was getting a buzz blade to 500 damage?  
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/CsqTWen](https://imgur.com/a/CsqTWen)
---
Ah I see, guess I got the wrong information. Thanks for clearing it up :)
---
At the "marina" building around the lake from the fast travel spot you need to activate a speaker.. FYI you need a swimsuit to complete it.
---
No problem!
---
Can help during Silos a bit. And some level 3 lock containers will have rare rewards.   
---
I personally wait until I get my build finish they start picking up those utility cards. Got lucky on my bloodied melee build, I got all 3 lock pick and 2/3 hacking via card packs.
---
I have a coupon
---
I cant figure out any of these exam questions lolll
---
You need a swimming suit to do it I just tried
---
Good thing I sold off that Cavalier piece
---
they don't need flux or materials though so still good
---
Great! Thanks!
---
This is such good news for us X-01 users!  Oddly though, I am a bit upset because all the time and effort it took for me to get my calibrated shocks can't be lorded over those who were still looking for them anymore.  Not really,  I wouldn't wish that on anyone
---
Did they make camps invincible yet as well?
---
Some of them are stupid answers I think!
---
Happy to see the legendary scrips came out this patch. Was starting to run out of stash space.
---
Np
---
Its mostly annoying when you go into PVP, where everyone has absurd armor values and the nerf hits hard :V
---
1-2 hits is what I've been noticing. Which is...double to triple when you used to 1 hit kill everything.
---
Yes, the new black one
---
Fix what? you not being aware of what you’re trading?
---
it was sarcasm, my dude. Settle down...
---
That's more of a programming question than a math question.
---
Find out the answer by having someone purchase one item that costs one cap; I'd wager that you'd get one cap for the sale. If so, have them buy eleven at once. If you get eleven caps, then Bethesda probably always rounds cap amounts up to at least one cap and taxes each item rather than the total purchase. If you only get nine caps, then you get one cap per item, but the tax is applied to the purchase as a whole and rounded up. If you get ten caps, the tax is rounded down.
---
Not a bug - you can't sell, trade, or drop Atom shop items. The skins have to be removed first or they will be destroyed on drop.
---
I agree completely. Bethesda as incompetant as they are, also lack quality control.
---
This is undervoted.
---
It's all about the hours of enjoyment per dollar.
---
And video games, and Beth games historically offer a ridiculous deal in this regard.
---
Having said that, please let's not go too much further down the repair kit road.....I am not sure that's the way to run with this.
---
Not sure what marina building as there isn’t an actual location for it &amp; I’ve ran around the lake 3 times but thank you I’ll look again for said speaker. Also I have a swimsuit currently on as my outfit so that’s good!
---
The amount of trash 2 and 3 star stuff I have is ridiculous
---
Ya i keep getting 2 or 3 of them wrong lol and the questions change so it's frustrating. I'll get it eventually i guess haha
---
Just got rid of my 1 extra calibrated shock a couple of days ago.
---
Interesting. Good if it's now daily
---
Best update
---
You're right, I was careless and didn't maintain my gear properly.
---

---
Update: Solved the problem with braking down the blueprint and get the parts so... Happy Ending. :D
---
True, but...I've sold 2 jetpacks for 2k each. Prolly only worth like 500 now. Idk. Will have to see what the market settles at.
---
hopefully they actually create light when in PA with no helmet
---
That’s a skin. Same with the backpack.
---
I still miss the days before DLC where we had true expansions and sequels :C 
---
But it is nice to support a game post production as long as the money goes into that dev team and the game (Sadly I don't think most of it honestly does)
---
From where you spawn in run left around the lake. There is a building and a peer. Speaker is on the peer.
---
That....is a really good idea...I need to test this.
---
I can make it happen just need an object that allows for items to be sold without spoiling
---
Always carry a backup and repair frequently. I also ground some daily challenges to get 50 atoms yo carry a repair kit in case I forgot the rules.
---
I have a Two shot one that I love to use. Finding plans for mods has been a prob because I never find regular ones. do base plans exist in the wild for a regular ultracite laser gun?
---
I gave up on the mods so I hadn’t been back since the vendor update really. Will be going now 😬
---
Or uh... in this one.
---
This is a god tier patch
---
just did it. first and only survival challenge done on adventure. lol
---
gun sucks tho
---
Yes!
---
Already done 2 but it takes a lot of work. Had to use google for the exams because some of the questions were rough
---
9 mules on 2 accounts absolutely maxed to the last with 3* stuff here. The limit is frustrating. And I know I'll lose.
---
Have you confirmed it can't be placed yet?
---
let me know
---
Is the game worth checking out again. I’ve been gone for quite a while. When I left it was frustration at constant crashes when trying to kill the queen and that being the only real endgame.
---
I love my heavy weapons build. I never struggled with aiming the gat, found if you stick your target between the magazine and the sight ring it was very accurate. This looks horrendous now 😂
---
Depends on where at the golf course.
---
It works some times, so it's not intended or if they did intend it they did a bad job of it, lol.
---
Don't underestimate the power of lazyness or stingyness.
---
Some people dont want to rng scap for plans or dont want to spend cap or have lack thereof. Swoop in and take advantag
---
 of that market.
---
I plan on selling plans that are not difficult to find for like 20-50 caps, rare plans at half the price of vendorbot prices.
---
weird question but what are the pioneer scout values one? i have 2 out 4
---
Double checking when home from work, hoping i can move it a meter or two
---
You also need to listen to this song (link below) about a 1,000 times until your ears bleed to truly know the Faschnacht experience:

---
Go to your challenges (from your map), under world challenges there are new one that reward those badges.
---
The custom names not appearing when selling to the legendary exchange machine.
---
Wait till you have to fight 2 Sheepsquatches at the end of Open Range..alone. Not fun, I can tell you.
---
Nope a while ago they died out, now they are back.
---
Quick Question b/c i'm an idiot.
---
Why do ppl hate Atoms? The only thing they inlock are cosmetics and repair kits. You can't exchange Atom for a weapon, it isn't P2W
---
You can purchase the plan for the rifle from the brotherhood vendor.  Then build and break down the rifle to learn the mods.  Just it costs more to build the ultracite rifles
---
I put my dupes for sale for 0 caps. If they don't sell I'll drop them somewhere.
---
remove imperfect 21:9. thats what caused it for me
---
removing all mods might be best.
---
Thank you so MUCH
---
Agreed; I just ended up inv the middle of someone's house. They looked at me and instantly logged out. Lol.
---
I dis the archer test 3 times didnt see the same question at all and got 4/5 each time....
---
If you’re looking for any other masks or plans, I’m on PS4 and I’m selling a whole bunch of them. I won’t be on again until like 10-ish EST, but my PSN is UmbranOverlord if you wanna add me or keep an eye out for my store. Just look for me to the south, right next to Big Bend Tunnel (Ash heap entrance)
---
It's annoying but it's actually a good thing, or it should be anyway.
---
Games that patch that way are typically doing to better optimize existing assets in accordance with whatever new assets are being delivered. Easiest way to think about it it is the difference between downloading a mod in say Skyrimand hoping it doesn't clash with everything around it, vs the content of that mod also including optimization of anything that interacts with it and so on up the relationship chain.
---
So the vending machines are in this update? Someone said they were coming in a few weeks
---
I haven't finished it. But the Challenges section only has Tadpole badges for now.
---
Okay I’ll look for it now, got off because it was really frustrating me, thanks again for the help.
---
Cool, thanks
---
I'm curious. Can someone fast travel to a workshop you have claimed, while you are in a defend event, and engage you in PvP?
---
Well not mine. I call my armor items [LL] for left leg and [RL] for right leg, to keep it simple. I sold items with their full original names and now they the custom ones are gone.
---
I have a ton (50+) of good legendaries I want to sell. I am at the cap limit on all my characters.
---
I will not be selling anything.
---
If they wanted player vending to be successful, they should have raised the cap limit.
---
had a few on my vending machine.. sold out quick
---
The only time that mutation has caused PvP for me is when I'm NOT in pacifist. It doesn't seem right if that's happening. I've electrified and radiated at people and nothing ever happens.
---
In that case; then the extractors should automatically deposit into your stash.
---
In the same boat myself
---
Yeah these are.... rough
---
It's been a random event for a while now, and the post is a joke on my own stupidity of not maintaining my weapons.
---
Confirmed, if you remove the sight it goes back to the old behavior...nice catch.
---
Yes they added a ton of new unannounced things today. The new patch notes are worth the read if you haven't already.
---
I’m 100% in pacifist mode because I checked after I died. Luckily the guy who owned the shop stood on top of my junk until I respawned but I was in pacifist mode.
---
i do X - (Name Here)  
---
it was at the bottom as i wanted em showing that name.
---
shame you got a bad bug
---
 **Wasteland Whisperer:** Mega Sloths, Snallygasters, and Wendigos can no longer be pacified by Wasteland Whisperer.   
---
why tho... I want a megasloth at my camps :(
---
aw fuck... i can’t tame deathclaws anymore. 
---
i’m gonna get my ass beat
---
Where tf am I supposed to find a person to revive lol
---
Addictions: No longer cured by death.
---
That’s a helluva tragic sentence!
---
Everyone that fts to my camp gets stuck in the same foundation tile... I think I'll have to remove it until we get a fix
---
Agreed. People are selling things for way too much. The high end weapons are usually handmade rifles that are bloodied and TSE+ weapons. For me, I dont think that bloodied makes the cut
---
Same I don’t know why they couldn’t give normal quests to do
---
Thanks! I didn't see anything in the patch notes. Completely forgot to go directly to Bethesda's 76 page. My bad.
---
but my pets, my megasloth pet!
---
I have some at my camp on xbox,  if anyone's interested.  Gt Deathknell1972
---
I did last week as I say but there are always last minute things and indeed undocumented tweaks to discover (both fortunate and unfortunate).
---
awesome!!!
---
No problem! Was a bit confused too
---
I never got them. 😟
---
The Sears Tower needs to fall halfway onto the buildings next to it.
---
Yeah, I agree. It's a katana that's fucking on fire. It should be badass.
---
Guess I'm tossing my sight, but glad I'm not stuck getting my view obstructed.
---
Yeah, as excited as I am for player vending, the fast travel feature just brings a glaring issue to light that's going to annoy everyone very quickly.
---
Lmfao
---
I don't have that mutation.
---
I saw that.  Just wondering if anyone has been able to notice a big difference.  Pre bug fix I should have been doing around 760 damage if my explosive legendary effect was doing double damage but in reality I was doing around 400 which is where it should be.  I'll test it when I get home.
---
Jump off lookout towers.
---
Acid, steel, junk, aluminum, etc. There are still good reasons to claim workshops, especially if you are gonna be on a server for a while. It may not be much but it's a decent amount of materials for a small cap investment
---
Too many roofies in this wasteland.. I dont take drugs!!

Are you using mods? This usually happens if you have mods installed and haven't updated your .ini file appropriately. 
---
That's being said, I'm having the same trouble and I'm sure I've updated my custom.ini. I'm gonna check again and reboot.
---
Before the TSE nerf, I swapped my explosive assasins double barrel shotgun, two shot gatling and 1000 caps for a TSE DB shotgun.
---
Now people are offering 4.5k for it. I dont want to sell it cause it's my only TSE
---
There is an archery range in pioneer camp (same place you find crossbow plans), and there is a button (like every other test) that starts it.
---
The backpacks are in the Opposum vending machine.
---
No i will Be out of the country!
---
Surely explosive only worked against scrubs? Everyone who knew what they're doing would have had Dense + Fireproof.
---
r/Whoosh
---
I’d personally like to see LA, California or maybe something like Texas.. everything is bigger in Texas &amp; I think Bethesda could really come up with awesome places &amp; animals inside a Texas environment
---
This is the seventh time I've seen this posted today...yeesh.
---
They do not need to add mats, just lock the fast travel point to the camp thing, but mats would be a much more pleasant fix
---
sshhhh delete this before they see it!
---
Kinda like how they sell it in a store that sells ammo irl.
---
a Box of 20 rounds: [https://i.imgur.com/f1RLaSl.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/f1RLaSl.jpg)
---
Join a team, let one dude die from enemies, then revive
---
I loved it 😃
---
Mayhaps a "Leave something out of appreciation" box for when you find someone else's CAMP?
---
Logically, it would be at an archery range,...I've only found one archery range in the game so far...at the camp near where you do swarm of suitors...
---
Should be included, it sucks to spawn into a camp to check out the vending machine to fall off a cliff :(
---
Or inside a generator :((
---
I love the little details they add in the environment lol we found a bunch of teddy bears filming a cooking show one time
---
The damn thing only did 342 damage per shot for me!
---
Will the brotherhood scribe uniform count as a backpack now? I’ve been using that thing since day 1 and wonder if it will clip with other backpacks. Or how that will interact.
---
Just a fair warning... You technically can't transfer the camera. The game considers it an Atomic Store type item. BUT if you place a handful of legendary items into a world container rapidly and while the client side tries to catch up with all that information exchange, you can sneak the camera into the container. It took me a few weeks to get the camera off my alt onto my main when my mains camera was accidently transferred into an enemy corpse. I found this "solution" accidently when moving legendaries to my alt.
---
Never said it was
---
&lt;somber tone&gt; My base has now killed three more people. I have lost control of its AI. I have tried to warn the others off, but my base continues to send out Fasnacht ribbons to entice them in. Once it finds the Nutrashine all hope will be lost.
---
LOLOLOL
---
I'd settle for anything, I just know the mats were there at one point and they never even mentioned removing them or why
---
Anybody else on PC having server disconnects immediately (less than 30sec) after placing a vending machine in your camp?
---
Where are the extra sheepsqautch missions??

I must have that Tin Foil hat.

Is it currently in the shop and does anyone have pictures of every clothing in the game?
---
Well I never saw this, so thanks for the heads up 👍🏾
---
The deathclaw eggs, now the bushes?! These deathclaw are gonna come out of nowhere and our camps are going to be wrecked XD
---
Trying to figure this out myself.
---
Moira Brown is in 76 now.
---
Omg this would be Kinda fun in survival because then it would be Kinda tense like you were just flying with your group and you get shot Down and then you either run or escape from the attacking players that shot you Down would be Nice Way to fast travel in survival but not really fast travelling though but still faster than on you feet
---
I wasn’t a fan either,  but I’m 573 hours in and they deserve a little financial top up from me.. I’ve has my initial money’s worth!
---
so the idea here is that it help prevent inflation and over pricing.
---
No worries bud, I'm pretending to work anyways ;)
---
They can, each holds 30 items or stacks of items.  Stocking them takes a while though.
---
This thread is listed as a bug though?
---
Any know where the tesla charging shotgun barrel plan is? I can't find it anywhere. Ive tried to buy it from other players, looked in all the train stations, scrap fifty billion teslas
---
The bug is you spawning in a locked room. Read first
---
Would like to see Seattle. Big city but then grandiose scenery all around. Could use far harbor elements for the harbor areas. Utilize the camp system from 76 instead of the settlement one from 4 to be able to build anywhere. Enhance it for “vertical” building in forest areas like building a tree house in the trees. Bring in lore from invasion of Canada. Show NPCs from there too to show differences in how countries are taking the wasteland. DLC could be areas of Canada or maybe an excursion to Alaska.
---
Thank goodness. I might actually start taking workshops now.
---
Explosive is still the best weapon mod. Everyone has both explosive and fireproof. Now it is just going to be explosive handmades
---
Roger that.
---
Really? That’s great! Bethesda exceeding expectations here
---
Lol, so I'm not alone. And it happened to me as well; I went to a base that had missle launchers, and they shredded me for no reason.
---
Oh weird, I gave mine away through the trade menu? Does this not work anymore?
---
I need it too. PSN username is the same as here.
---
Some people have suggested giving him his own radio station and you have to guess where he’s at given the context of what he’s saying during his show lol I love that idea
---
How do I join your world?
---
Didn’t work for me.
---
As someone with a good grasp of the English language I fucking hate these exams. I'm not sure who thought this would be a fun way to kick off a bunch of lengthy challenges but they should be fired.
---
I'd love another California, haven't been here since the first two...but I fear that fact will keep them at bay for awhile potentially. Actually live north of Redding heh
---
It'd be neat to see some of Canada/Alaska. Or they could do a huge curve ball and show us whats happening in Europe or else where.

\-You forgot to mention that the Gatling Plasma issue (same as Gat Laser that was mentioned) has also been fixed. Or, at least, it was ***stated*** a few days back that it, too, had been... so I'd assume nothing changed.
---
\-**Do you happen to know if the changes to the Pacification will also address the issue I've been having where I encounter a tamable animal/creature but am only given these aiming choices?**: *\[R\] Pacify* and *\[SPACE\] Pacify* *^((both choices are displayed at the same time))*   
---
Due to that, I've been unable to tame any creature since it's option has always been to Pacify (which is functionally what happens). I actually had not tried to tame anything until recently, so all my experience has been in patch 8.5, and my character at earlier had been lvl 119 with Rank 3 for both Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer (generally both were equipped since I didn't know what I'd end up encountering). My first presumably-tamable encounter was a lvl 62 Albino Alpha Deathclaw (non-Legendary) just south of Whitespring, and despite being 5 levels shy, both aforementioned "Pacify" options displayed, so I assumed it was *supposed* to show Tame instead but something was glitched.  
---
Was this because of the improper categorization of some beasts, which meant both Perks were showing a Pacify option but in the end I still wouldn't have been able to Tame? If so, then in the time since, I've never encountered anything I could tame, which is quite a hit to my morale as I'm now level 137 and seen plenty double-pacify which are well-within the twice-their-level range :\\
---
\-**By chance, has the carry capacity bug relating to the Excavator Power Armor fixed?**   
---
As we know, if wearing all 6 Excavator pieces, we get +100 Carry Weight matching-set bonus. If we added Calibrated Shocks (+50 Carry Weight) to *both* of our legs we *should* get another +100, for a grand total of **+200**.   
---
***However***, it never stacks, always displaying only the +100 (doesn't say if it's the set bonus or mod bonus). That is, UNLESS you had been wearing your Excavator PA when you've logged-out *(disconnect in any way)*, as then the next time you join the world *(even if immediately)* it will be correctly applied! For me, I then get the +200 (and it displays in Pip-Boy) but *only for as long as I* *remain in the PA!* If I ever exit my Excavator, and re-enter, it's forever only +100.   
---
*(For SOME people I've seen it mentioned that theirs actually results in a -100 penalty when exiting their Excavator PA, which I assume is because they lack the Calibrated Shocks mods, but they may also simply be erroneously reporting the problem.)*
---
Those are the relevant 3 to the update today that I've been plagued with
---
What if there isn't turrets on the outside? Do you still fart in our direction?  
---
Cause I only built there for some goddamn flat land within walking distance to Whitespring.
---
Any idea how much percent they take up? My base is pretty full and wondering how much I'd have to restructure.
---
I would be ok with it, if those questions didn't change every time atleast. I can't find out which one i am answering bad.
---
I think it might be because the placement of the shop. This is when you wish those welcome mats worked like fo4 or they make the front of the shop the spawn in point.
---
I’m monitoring at my camp so I can potentially make things a little more accessible for people if I’m not at my camp.
---
The last thing I expected this last bit of update 9 is to be 10 hours of googling answers.. while staring at a computer screen.. on a computer screen.  
---
You can't even search for some of them. Followed, of course, by the most tedious and random tasks in the entire game that are just... built around specifically wasting as much of our time as possible.  
---
Just for some... mediocre looking ware. I don't even know if I have the willpower to move past 'tadpole' after spending a good hour and a half finishing 3 tests.
---
Lol fixed Cold Case the week after I just said fuck it and completed it.
---
protip:  People here read the patch notes...
---
I support this cause!  It's literally already in Fallout 4 cant be that hard to port to this online game.
---
I think they should half the caps for the distance
---
Thats a steal!!
---
They should add it back in, but make it snap to the OUTSIDE of the camp circle, on the ground, this way you can pick where you want to come into your camp, but you can’t setup traps since it’s outside the build zone.
---
Theoretically player vending should bring the price of everything down, since it introduces a large amount of new supply that wasn't on the market before. 
---
Current prices are kinda inflated since the "merchant class" is the only one deep into trading, and they're all loaded by now.
---
Only 500 wtf
---
Stop building in a fucking cave!  j/k.
---
I believe part of the fix was that damage numbers were broken too, so I’m not sure what it was before, but it says around 350 now and I feel considerably weaker. This is with a TSE Combat Shotgun
---
Oooh, so do I!
---
While I appreciate the updates I still feel content is lacking. Especially if you have been with it from the launch. End game content is basically non existent unless you count gearing up. Getting gear is one of the hardest ventures. Between 3 star legendaries not dropping loot or dropping 1 star level 35 and 40 items, its almost impossible to gear yourself the way you want. Beth knows this and therefor refuses to make the return on investment worthwhile because of the lack of content.. I mean gear doesn't really matter after a certain point anyway as everything in the game can be solo's with 1 star items.
---
claiming a power plant (getting it running, or claiming it after it is running), will generate 100% fusion cores.
---
I did a lot of that early on if someone had abandoned a running plant.
---
Wot
---
Crossbows needed a buff. I’ve seen some good drops but it was a crossbow. They were among the least desirable weapons.
---
Yes this is pretty damn cool.
---
Self-respecting large-scale crafters of diluted stims obviously have both Chemist (+100% item) and Super Duper 3 (+100% item on 30% chance), so the price would've been around 20%-25% of a stim.
---
MOD plans? Are you for real?
---
Take this down lmao
---
Would be interesting due to the naval bases there including Bangor where the nukes are. Maybe the BOS took it over and are trying to use them for they’re own goals.
---
They literally said daily challenges in the inside the vault
---
U have the same problem, it started early for u?
---
At lower levels, the workshop defense events are a good source of XP and free camp plans. You rarely get attacked, possibly because claiming the workshop costs more caps than they get from killing you.
---
I wouldn't bother at high levels. I don't need fusion cores and it's too risky.
---
Check the patch notes to see what's been added
---
I’m still rebuilding....
---
You probably aren't in pacifist mode.  Check again.
---
Having the same issue. Incredibly frustrating. Hope hotfix goes out soon.
---
Fusion cores may end up being an issue....
---
If u wanna try a no PA shotty build I'm aiming for this

---
Seems to be
---
That really sucks, don't really know any good range weapons now. Literally have to run a melee build to reach 1k+ damage. Just hope my Bloodied Explosive Pump is still viable.
---
Because your complaining about something that doesn’t even exist yet. You can sell out the vendor with basically 3 weapons.
---
Quit complaining and put the game down if that’s too much of a grind
---
They knew what they were doing.  I don't think there will be posts, they'll just find some other way to be dicks.
---
I’m selling my stuff for the price it says
---
There is no way to change that. It spawns you where it spawns you. It's up to the player who owns the camp to unlock the doors
---
I know right! I saw bloodied handmade in the machine and thought it would be 1* for the price. Had a closer look and instantly bought it when I saw the 3*
---
Pacifist mode: On
---
Players generally spawn close to where you originally placed your camp
---
Well shit. I started a Survival only character and get ammo anxiety with 300 45 rounds
---
a plan so we can build them over lvl 20 and legendary mod slots added would also be nice.
---
so i crafted the frog jar thing and it didnt complete the challenge? should it?
---
Most people haven’t ever touched the first two as they’re older, different company &amp; only available on PC. But yes I could see them not doing California because of it. I’d love a giant rad moose😂 I would love a foreign fallout, China or Europe! Not sure if they’d do it but I think it’d really bring back that uniqueness of fallout.
---
Because they have vending machines up so they show. I didn't do it one of my dumbass friends did lol
---
All the knowledge exams are done on terminals next to the first mr handy you talk to
---
Delete this post. Shhhhh.
---
Sure, why not. jump on in.
---
Can confirm they're not. Seems to be a bug with the new camp protection system.
---
1. Buy X-01 Plans
---
2. Mod PA parts
---
3. Put PA parts on player vendor
---
4. PROFIT
---
A Bloodied Explosive Pump? That really does suck then. Did you have Adrenal Reaction with like all the perks to improve damage? Like Nerd Rage, Expert Shotgunner, etc?
---
Apparently Bethesda realized this was one of THE MOST wanted bans in FO76 history. Good riddance. Thanks BSG for listening to this one.
---
5 months worth of major patches. 
---
Basically, new quests, new camp items, new plans, new vendor stuff, new a whole lots stuff just go read patch notes at Bethesda this game is getting better every month.
---
add me: TiberFrost, i also need to revive someone but doesnt have to be in water
---
DELETE THIS!
---
I found that out. Id figure since any legedairies you put into the machine will be destroyed upon leaving the machine interface it would have taken them. But I guess ill remove all my paints before disposing of the legendaries.
---
That's fair, I've also loaded up at face value, though I don't have much worth selling other than plans.
---
They're required for the challenges along with other stuff
---
I've never been so fucking excited for BACKPACKS
---
I did a lot of 3\* stuff for &lt;1000 caps and most of it sold. I had the same thought, but honestly, I wanted that stuff gone for the stash space and I wasn't OK with it going to vendors.
---
If you can,  google the questions as the appear and for most of them you can find the right answer. There isnt a time limit so dont panic if you cant find the answer straight away
---
Where in the pioneer camp is it??
---
Not bloodied, my bad. Just TSE
---
May I ask, where does one start these challenges?
---
Yep! I've been wanting the bomber jacket for a long time, and the first CAMP I visited had one. Also picked up the BOS fatigues.
---
Start on the west side of the bridge
---
Haven’t Played the update yet but plan is to put things for sale tonight
---
If it's mod plans, this is huge. HUGE I say.
---
Yeah what the hell is that?
---
lmao just use code player.additem 00106d99 150 nigga
---
Easy fix to that. Don't buy them. 
---
I have spent more money on "season passes", "DLC", and endless cosmetic items for Beth's games. Stuff like "repair kits" has never been purchased by me. 
---
However, lots of folks do buy them. If it turns out that they generate a substantial amount of revenue... you will definitely see more of that sort of thing, and with good reason.
---
Gamers, for all their hot air and bluster... prove, time and again, that they can't resist the urge to gain a slight upper hand, the tiniest bit of convenience... every time something like this drops, the internet explodes with rage... only to quietly support it with their dollars when nobody is looking. 
---
I don't want it either... but I can't fault them.
---
To be fair...your load-in may be what's triggering the attacks haha.
---
I think it might be an atom shop skin, I saw a few diff skins in the datamined stuff
---
Yeah not everyone plays to "efficiently farm"...
---
In fact most people who go to whitesprings nuked will just be "oh cool this might be fun". Saying you don't want them getting in your way is a poopy head attitude.
---
Oh okay, you almost gave me a heart attack. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Looks natural actually
---
If anyone else on Xbox has any plans or masks, I'll be happy to take them off your hands 😉
---
I keep 800 5mm rounds for mini gun, 300 shotgun shells, 600 5.56 for my handmade and 150 .45s for Soul Survivor. 
---
My camps right near the SBQ so if I run out after one SBQ I FT to base and add more ammo to carry with me. Ammo can get heavy after a while.
---
I got a Lvl 50 Vampire combat shotgun.
---
That was me and my wife’s 1st camp. Nice little peaceful grassy location facing a golf course. Robots to protect you. Then one day a giant herd of ghouls shows up. The next day a scorchbeast shows up, then a couple days after that and people are nuking our camp left and right. It was a sad turn of events really. Haven’t camped out there in a long time obviously though.
---
We are the minority because it has always been this way. Everyone would rather scavenge and hunt legendaries than interact with each other. 
---
The nerfs are there to favor the PVE players. To make their life easier, not ours. Sentinel was never a problem for me. I ran a vats critical build. But all these PVE only players who choose to dabble from time to time in PVP know nothing of staggering, radiation damage, or critical hits. 
---
Instead of challenging players to adapt to the game, they change the game to adapt to the players.
---
already maxed that out. lol with pretty much 1 stars
---
The road map will give you a good idea content wise. There's also a pvp mode now and a lot of balance/QoL changes since December. The stability of the game and bug fixes will probably make it feel completely different from what you remember.
---
What's the weapon? I googled but couldn't find the info.
---
Don't answer until after you Google the question. Don't back out. Just sit on the question and stare at it until you find the answer on Google.
---
I don’t think it was a “buff” tbh. But something is up. I’ve never fully one hit any off the ghouls with just my crossbow alone. Always had to use a throwing knife or my other backup weapons.
---
cool, sent!
---
Nice. Gotta love a good vampire weapon.
---
My man! Struggled for minutes until I realised I have the internet!!
---
Sure. Ign artelman
---
Quite happy here.
---
That blue overcoat.
---
Sanitäter? Is that you?
---
On the west side, I only see the cow spots creamery and orwell orchards, but no course ?
---
cant do nothing with it for a week yet at least.. im not bothered by this...
---
google crossbow plan location
---
When is PA gonna get some love? Non OA has the best armor and now they get backpacks with refrigerators! At least give us a mod that does the same thing.
---
Also need someone to do this. ( ign SamHex )
---
It worked before :(
---
I looked through the other bug posts and it looks like there is an issue where two camp objects become dependents to one another. Probably has to do with how they implemented the foundation fix, causing other objects to also be dependent on the foundation maybe. Very annoying, can’t build my ammo depot!!
---
My mannn
---
Crazy that when the game came out they let cheaters write an essay to get unbanned. Now its impossible, whether you’re innocent or not
---
Well you can start by charging something higher than what you get from vendors.
---
With all shotgun damage perks? Because if that is, shotguns might be dead after all...
---
It’s automatically unlocked under a new tab called vending.
---
Yes!! They're using scrips! It's WV, why wouldn't ppl use scrips as currency?
---
The daily limit plays into my fears that the cost of goods at the legendary vendor is going to be on the extremely-high end of scrip.
---
Where is the veding machine located?
---
This is GREAT!  Jumped on an immediately spent 2K on serums which were reasonably priced.  Transaction took like 30 seconds and that guy nearlly got wiped out of procuct.   I need marsupial now.. Can't find a vendor, but I'll keep looking.  The only crap part is you have to spend caps to fast travel to the various CAMPS good thing I have travel agent!  I guess I'll check trade forums for store listings who have serums for sale.
---
Visit the railway elevator in Watoga, normally 5-8bags at the top
---
Feral Ghoul Horde event?
---
Plz tell me he used your own cooking stove to do this ?
---
In a building in the pioneer scout camp
---
Start from the west side of the bridge my friend said
---
Nukes will still destroy them I believe
---
It's actually all of Caesar's slaves marching to the west coast and Nevada.
---
I can't stop loling at this.   there might be, like, 8 other people mad about this. When you play ANY game to an extreme like this, you cant be mad when changes dont adhere to your specific extremist behavior. Absolutely hilarious.
---
I mean...the challenge isn't hard at all..even in survival mode.  
---
take a workshop, put up a turret, and kill a human-like creature?  
---
Grow some balls and do it on survival...
---

I’ve been running a bloody/Explosive Shotgun build 100% PA build.  You didn’t discuss explosives so I wasn’t sure.  power patcher is a waste as is power user.  I’ve never run patcher and I’ve repaired my PA once in roughly 150 hours of game play.  Core drain is never an issue either, as long as you don’t use vats.  If you use vats I don’t think Power User works.  The core drain on vats has something to do with the Ap drain, power user doesn’t work on AP draining core abilities, sprinting, jumping and vatting.
---
I think that was the Legendary vendor, the player vending is up and live.
---
Go to your world challenges and scroll down until you see the tadpole challenges
---
Did you use a guide to complete all the tests?
---
Yeah, that's my thought as well but then I'm back to my original problem, by how much? 100? 500?
---
Ahh found it, it's on the bridge structure itself, thanks !
---
Nothing for them to fix, it's a one time challenge. 
---
I'm currently working through the "Kill 76 Scorched with Crossbow/Energy Weapon/Heavy Weapon" ect challenges.
---
Awesome I appreciate it.  I skimmed through some of the patch notes but it does seem like overall a looott has been modified in the last few months and I’m having a tough time figuring out if it’s a lot of minor adjustments or if there are a few major gameplay changes.  Thank you for the input!
---
No, just answered the questions
---
&gt;they didn't make it the way that would benefit me and only me the most. Horribly implemented!
---
Same. It’s actually doing MORE damage than before. Thank you for your assistance! Feel free to stop by my camp on Xbox and browse my wide assortment of rare plans, all at rock bottom prices. Gamertag is the same as my username.
---
And bigger backpacks soon in the Atom shop.
---
I support
---
Dammit. Please excuse the player vending spiel. Copy paste issues.
---
I definitely intend to max out bloody mess! I already have rank 3 master gladiator for when I drop heavy weapons as a whole.
---
I might be misguided but I don't see this as the type of game that needs strong end game. Fo76 feels closer to Rust than WoW (that's a bad example but you get it) to me. Sure, I guess it would be nice, but I don't think "end game" was ever supposed to be a core aspect of the gameplay.
---
I’m gonna laugh when the purveyor only sells shit legendaries for scrip. That scrip probably won’t be worth all the effort you’re talking about putting in. Player vending though, sell some of those legendaries. You can sell as many as you want each day. Spend your caps on plans or mods. X-01 mods are out now, that’s a good cap sink if you’re at max caps too.
---
Same :(
---
Figured out what the glitch it, check my edit
---
Where did you take the picture for wavy waves? Been trying to get it for the past 10 minutes and it won’t show up
---
Just like group sex
---
The problem with this is you dont list how being able to empty your pockets of unwanted legendary items would in anyway be game breaking. Considering what we know of the Porveyor is that she will provide rerolls and not hard enchants, i dont see how having more right now is a problem.
---
Its actually the opposite lol, if there was no limit then the prices would be insane
---
Really, happy to see it isn’t just me. Xbox btw
---
1
---
I keep seeing post like these and am even more confused now. I’m shit at math. What exactly would I plug in to my calculator to skirt this 10% were I so inclined
---
For leveling, follow the main quest up till you become a firebreather.  After that. the Ash is a good place to farm if you can easily deal with the mole miners; if you can't yet, doing events throughout the Forest, is a good way of leveling.
---
Once the mole miners are reasonably easy to deal with, you can go north to the Toxic Valley and do dailies, while making loops of the farms west of Grafton &gt; through Grafton &gt; north-east to Garinger Farm &gt; north-west to Wavy Willard's Water park &gt; then south south-west past Hemlock Holes until you get to a cliff &gt; fast travel to the northern most of the farms west of Grafton and repeat.
---
If you are good with scaling down that cliff(or have a suit of PA) you can do the loop in reverse and save on the fast travel caps.  Main enemies will be Super Mutants, Anglers, Mirelurks, Radscorpions, Ghouls and Scorched.  At a few points there will be Snallygasters, and a guaranteed Grafton Monster spawn(between the cliff and Hemlock Holes).  Also, be advised that there is a common, random Deathclaw spawn between the western farms and Grafton.  Also, the houses between Willard Corporate Housing and the Black Bear Lodge, can have a random encounter where 3 different groups of enemies show up and fight each other; the enemies can be anything that shows up in the Toxic Valley(most hectic encounter I've had was 2 Deathclaw, 4 Yao Gui and 12 Mirelurks, on top of the 5 or so Radscorpions that were already there, reminded me of the ultimate showdown).
---
Once you get to a point where you feel like the experience isn't that great, head to Whitespring or, as of recently the Burrows(over in Harper's Ferry).
---
A lot of people will grind to 50 before continuing the story or doing much in the way of certain quest lines, so that they can get the max level for the unique weapon/armor rewards; however, if you get tired of grinding levels, feel free to continue the main questline sooner.
---
What is the knowledge exam?
---
But if people can now fast travel to your camp directly, you could set the mat in a trap and just wait for victims
---
That's just cold.
---
probably bugged because of the update to the foundation placements. I'd go ahead and rebuild it, you won't see any fixes for existing camps. Luckily when you scrap the blueprint it will refund all of your stuff so aside from a bit of a time sink into building you'll be ok
---
Almost perfect, but one of the mission requirements for the order of the tadpole is to revive an ally, and, well- thats what wrenches the gears of us solo players, wheres the lone wolf pioneer scout?!
---
Just put the price at what you think is fair. If you sell stuff like junk really quickly, then you the price. if it doesn't sell, then lower it. For rarer items I would check the reddit for what that item has sold for recently and set it at a price that you think is fair.
---
But no one can tell you how to run your store, set the price as you like and if they dont like it then they can try somewhere else
---
California has been done. Texas? Can't see how it would vary too much from Nevada. DC, Boston... Chicago has a cool little history that would work well. 
---
Maybe Manhattan... just the island itself. Make it crazy detailed, go all "Escape from NY' with it. Take some hints from the "DMZ" graphic novels.  Go less "expansive" and way more "full".
---
And here I am with a minimalist 2x2 box with just enough room for a bed, stash, and all crafting benches, and a huge field of razorgrain and a few other plants lol. Oh, and 10 Industrial water purifiers.
---
Most of archer is okay, but getting a sufficiently damaged crossbow seems like a slow task, even with gunsmith unequipped. The one I crafted has a full double-bar of durability. Is there a way to deliberately damage a weapon?
---
The only things over 21 i have seen are Scorched versions and around CAMP they are aggressive and noisy, i had a Scorched Wolf who growled at my Corn plants constantly, normal Mirelurk Kings are level 30 though.
---
Again, this is all opinion based so none of us will know why they took that decision but I would back my theory anyday
---
I forsee people spawning in the water at mine.
---
I hope they can provide a fix for this, this is my main character with 1000 hours and for it to be bugged now I would just cry
---
The problem I see with player vending. Is now.i have to move my camp to vend. In all my.hours there been 4 times my base could not load. I don't want more people to know about it.
---
Well for small things double it.
---
For things that you know are valuable I'd do a reverse auction - set a high price for it and lower it until somebody buys it. But if you're looking to clear out inventory and just make a little caps in the process you should price low.
---
But it's per character right? so you could theoretically xfer items and max out each character.
---
Thanks :)
---
Except that we know the Purveyor will be based on enchant rerolls, not hard enchant gives, at least according to bethesda, so i dont see how it breaks the game to just give us our scrip all at once rather than over time, Nor do i see the value in them doing so.
---
Good to hear.  I was thinking this bug didn't affect everyone, but I kept reading it did.  Sadly I'm on PS4 otherwise I would hit you up for those plans.
---
Hey- we were supposed to have a Mall.   
---
Why go house to house???
---
Yeah I give humanity maybe 10 generations on this planet anyway, it remains to be seen if we make it that far.   (If you think I'm being pessimistic try to remember we're all playing a game about the end of humanity as we know it)
---
Just sell some of of your stuff through player vending and buy the recipes. The serum recipes were rare before anyway, but I doubt they’ll add them back to the loot pool
---
I only checked a couple of items before logging off but I'm sure I inspected the handmade I bought. I either clicked to inspect or the effects were shown as I scrolled through the inventory. I'll check this properly once I'm back online.
---
I just completed this and it didn’t register a World Challenge Badge.
---
wow..i have farmed the queen over 150 times and not once got a recipe
---
Thank you for giving me a sales pitch on this for my wife.
---
I listened to a guy who nuked b4. I went for the burrows under harpers ferry. Big mistake. Shoulda went whitesprings. No hardened masses, fluid, etc for flux. Sigh...
---
You added nothing to the convo. Can you please have an actual argument next time?
---
As a non-U.S. gamer... I am all for games NOT set in the U.S... shit's done to death. 
---
I could see a FO game set in Canada, fur sure. Though I fear it would simply be a non-stop parade of stereotypes and silliness.
---
It was not needed.  The effects could be countered—stagger, VATS crits.
---
50 to 60% seems like it would be better to me.
---
They introduced new sheepsquatch quests?
---
But you’re still not aware of what your trading, that does need to be fixed but if you took just 2 minutes or seconds, you could of avoided it
---
Nah. I'm good.
---
It didn't disappear for me but I can't progress thru one of the quests..... apparently it has something to do with the fact that this quest accidentally made it's way in to the game with one of the previous patches and it's now bugged for some people
---
Except that there is 0 way that im the only person who did this, and youre adding nothing to the convo by scoffing. Please add something to the discussion next time.
---
Kiddie corner you need to collect toxic mass, which will be on the compass.
---
For dolly sods you need to collect insect parts. Check the maps for the areas in which you can find those insects.
---
I moved my base from the golf course recently, which seems to have been a good choice
---
The price you need to sell at (x) in order to get the price you want to receive (y) is x=10y/9.
---
But it’s “(canned meat) stew” you make it from meat out of a can, and the picture for it shows stew in a bowl
---
Just use common sense and easy
---
I'm just about to enter the game but if you found a daily Scrip limit, you can do a PSA about it.
---
That's a pretty good point.
---
Is it finally ingame for patch 9 on consoles? and what system are you on?
---
Worst part is gonna be when all hoarders expect god rolls from the vendor
---
The curve tables have only x=1,2,3; nothing else.
---
I'd use the 3 points in Sneak for something else. Shotguns and power armor font really lend themselves to a sneaky build. Maybe move them to the perk that makes fusion cores last longer or lucky break to keep your gun from breaking every 20 minutes.
---
Agreed :)
---
I didnt found it
---
That's kind of gay
---
Wait they got names? Wow now I'll feel bad when I destroy the raider vendor on my way out of the building. I'll still do it, but I'll feel bad.
---
I only close the door when I'm xfering between my 2 accounts, but the door is always locked. Sometimes people close the door without realizing it's locked (you can close someone's door and accidentally lock yourself in, which is hilarious).
---
Meh. I don't have it at all on one of my characters. Doesn't make sense "lore wise" for him, locked stuff is just... something he misses out on.
---
Awesome thank you!  PvP was one of the things I was really curious about.  Definitely stoked to take a fresh approach to the game and re-explore Appalachia.  In my previous file I was getting bored and feeling repetitive in the late game, but from what I’ve read It sounds like a lot has changed, just having trouble figuring out if a lot of it falls under minor improvements or if there are some major changes to gameplay.
---
&gt; hoarding until you can’t play anymore
---
But previous games let me hoard to my hearts consent! Bad bethesda!
---
is the general attitude which makes me lol. Inventory management is a part of online survival type games, adapt or die.
---
Frog habitat? :O Does this mean pet frogs??
---
Listed behind the scenes or on the weapon card? I’m pretty sure there’s nothing like that on the card
---
Not all shotgun perks, 6 of the 9. But it is still doing a lot less damage
---
Nice! Sounds like I need to do some shopping tonight.
---
I guess if there's a 150 cap it can't be 100k haha. Showed their hand a bit.
---
Yeah thats fine
---
Wait for the checkpoints to appear after he talks
---
I have somewhere in the ballpark of 3 to 4 thousand pounds of gear across 3 mules, and im disappointed that there is a daily limit and I can't just dump it all at once, it really not that big of a deal and I understand why there are doing it.
---
You’d fit right in with all the YouTubers
---
Its not even that i expect god rolls, but if i go to a casino with 200 dollars of money with which i want to play, i would be very unhappy if the casino says you can only spend 5 dollars a day on slot machines and then youre locked out.
---
There are daily quests at both locations you need to complete
---
Just a blind guess. The camp northeast of Grafton dam. Haven't login yet do feel free to downvote me if I am incorrect.
---
Found the BoS
---
I've got Dense and Fireproof and got pop rocked a bunch of times.
---
I could walk through a hail of missles and exploding cars but for some reason it was always "crackle crackle respawn" with explosive weapons.
---
Such a great idea, I’d be happy to join in. I have a small food business up and going myself. I also have a small community of roleplayers, we are currently taking members. If anyone is interested in PC you can DM me and I’ll send you a link or information. 😄
---
Two more hours for me :C  (About to leave the office but my commute is an hour and 15)
---
Idk i just read the armor peace
---
Ive not gotten either? The robots just give random facts
---
Same here. I’ve demo 3-4 values and don’t know what else to do.
---
maybe it's even as RNG based as the rest of the game as in you "purchase" a weapon or armor, get a random piece of it and then can reroll it if you're not pleased with it
---
Start from the pioneer scout lookout tower, go down to where the cabins are and its a little before where you take the knowledge exams. By a half underwater building with BO2 written on it.  It is there.
---
Instead the push pvp on us, every chance they get they want people fighting each other, hence the survival xp bonus.
---
Rip
---
I disagree, there are quite a few of the exams that the average gamer would not have expertise in. I am a athlete and a archery enthusiast and still struggled with some of the exams
---
Agreed ,.fuck that pack lol
---
Make a mule character...
---
Thank christ now I can sell my ammo that I don't need for an unrealistic amount of caps
---
Yeah I'm pretty excited to actually use workshops again without having to server hop after I'm done.
---
Take my upvote and if I see you, take my Caps!
---
If anyone else needs help, I need to do the quest as well. But won’t be on for about 2 hours. GT Tops Bloobie. Add me and I can help anyone
---
That sounds pretty insane, I never craft stims as I usually just buy in bulk or find them so I wasn’t really aware of those perks to begin with
---
Kind of doesn't help the damage since you're not running bloodied since that's the meta. But we might as well look for a better weapon now, shotguns aren't as viable as they're used too.
---
So could you even do the kiddies corner cabins or the clear dolly sods part? I couldn't didn't give me any markers
---
Cool story! There seem to be loads of people there with those same intentions. And that's OK in a way, just find someone who's in to that and leave us alone. They got survival mode now.
---
You'll find a speaker box at the start of the courses. Hit it and let him give instructions then you should be good to go.
---
Check the data tab again. If it isn't there try reloading the game
---
Same here. Can't do anything with it.
---
None of what was said here adds to the conversation though. If you have an actual argument make it please.
---
Each recipe is like 20k from the Enclave, and they rarely ever show up on the trade boards, I have been watching. So it is very very expensive to obtain all the recipes. and before you tell me caps are easy to get, I do not like to farm, and I already max out the vendors every time I play. And I am not going to run multiple toons to try and maximize my cap gain. (I am not saying that you would make that comment, but it seems to be a common theme among comments about how things are expensive)
---
They definitely aren't as viable
---
cap is OK, but current cap is way to low. If you can't buy good weapon (like 40k or even 150k prices on bis) with all your caps, it's clear that something wrong with this.
---
I think it might be because i had the quest start about 2 weeks ago in an incomplete form
---
My CAMP's still fine, but its all they way by the whitespring bunker. Next to the snake on the map.
---
Those three places are like in triangle area. It is in right part if you are looking on enterance, huge poool.
---
So you’re defense of how it was is the same as the tse defenders wanting their damage back
---
Same here no luck going to rush an alt over at least and see the start of fhe quest
---
How do you start exams
---
If you’re 100% sure that this amount of caps corresponds to what’s shown on the upper left corner of your screen, then it’s unacceptable! We need to make sure BGS fix this ASAP.
---
Shhh this is the Enclaves secret. If we catch this again we might have to expirement on you :)
---
Part of the main quest, the kiddie corner is bugged for me
---
On PC in house next to robot you get first quest from in pioneer camp.
---
Yeah I did that with my alt and you get some unlockables and an outfit that I guess we won't get
---
Self-reporting seems to be the only viable (if you can call it that) way to do that, though I'm sure you'll have people who are against it.
---
I hadn't even really thought about the fact that there are 3 different economies going on here.  I wonder if there is much of a difference between them as far as pricing goes.  That would be an interesting study.
---
Come to think of it, there's a lot of data I'd like to compare between the 3 ecosystems that would make for some interesting insights...
---
My GT is LordGeneral4k
---
Just fastvtraveled to a camp and was locked inside a room with level 3 doors. They definitely need to fix this.
---
Yeah , refering to all the hype . Imo this whole dlc was overhyped af. I would rather have paid for dlc than a few new quests only
---
Plans or auto unlock?
---
A person crying that he can't kill people or destroy their crap in a co-op mod calling others crybabies? Alanis Morrisette should write a song...
---
My friend, there are more of them than there are us. Bethesda wants money. Why please 20% of the population at the expense of the other 80%? Fuck the 20% and make the majority happy so they give us more of their money.
---
Youre still adding nothing to the conversation. Youre not even defining how its a balance mechanic. Bethesda has said the Purveyor will reroll legendary items, so how is having all of my scrip available to me instantly a bad thing? To quote myself below, its like if i went to a casino with 200 dollars to play with, and they only let you use 5 dollars of it a day.
---
easter eggs should be found
---
Start visiting those player vendors haha.
---
Mat**
---
You can pop one around the little stream not sure how close it can be to the golf club tho. I logged in after the patch and there was a camp there but not sure if that was due to been placed before the patch or if its as close as new camps can be.
---
Yeah they are quite difficult.
---
You hit the same button you would at the workbench itself while in the border of the workshop.
---
With the current global political climate and the actual fucking climate itself, I'd be surprised if we go five generations.
---
¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
---
thats where all my caps went XD
---
On the challenges menu, you earn growrth badges by doing those challenges which true to Fallout 76 are grinding tacks where you have to take a test then do actives such as collecting killing and crafting
---
It's a gatling gun with 3 stars. Not by the computer but i remember it having a 10% increase damage when sighting. Can't remember the other 2 might find the bethesda post talking about them.
---
Yup go to my recent posts I have the same bug go upvote it
---
Was it? I don't recall ever reading it.
---
Can confirm they are there, in bunker as we speak
---
Yeah, I was there back in November on the Southeast green up against the fence and high rock cliff. It was nice and except for a few molerats, very peaceful.  That was before nuking the place became popular, put on around 10 levels and continued my migration East and finally settled in the mountains overlooking Watoga.  Ahhh memories. I will enjoy them.
---
No, you need to be meta and use xo1/Excavator.... /s
---
Seriously all the armors needs basic colors already.
---
Does perk loadout manager still work just without saving capability or is it completely broken?
---
I was just surprised it worked.
---
We can sell ammo now!?
---
Yup same here
---
I have been server hopping on and off for *months* looking for a jet pack. This is big news!
---
I can finally get that other Calibrated Shocks mod now. I mean, it's okay walking around with a good leg and a bad leg, but I'd rather not play favorites any longer.
---
They're probably not in the game yet due to being potentially very easy to exploit.
---
lmao, okay super chieftain, whatever you say.
---
Glad I traded my 2 pieces for a legacy weapon before the nerf
---
Man this sucks...I paid 1000 caps for the jet pack the other day.
---
I like what I'm reading in the patch, true, but....
---
Too bad they didn't listen about the P2W function of the repair kits.  Just waiting for that to get worse.
---
Good, I'm hoping that player vending drops the bottom out of the ridiculous economy in the game.
---
Some of us prefer more immersive fast travel
---
It's Survival mode, not pvp mode.  Survival is a mode for those seeking more challenge. 
---
Pvp is one element of Survival, to make player interactions interesting and possibly dangerous. (which was the original goal of slap damage, that while a good try ultimately didn't work because every online game underestimates the lengths people will go to just to grief.). However, with the pop rock shooters and bunny hop invincibility a lot of the strategy and fun was limited.
---
I'm sure it was hilariously fun for the 2 people on the roof at Whitesprings in full Sentinel Assassins Whatever TSE shooting every poor bastard who tried to go to the shops, but you know who it wasn't fun for?  Everybody else on the server.
---
I would gladly pay for it
---
Which vending machines in particular?
---
yep completed it in adventure mode also lol
---
Still doesn't work :(
---
All the scumbags buying Atoms... No wonder the gaming industry is going to shit.
---
Put a doorway on top of the foundation.  Then try deleting the foundation. Might work
---
Ty!
---
Indeed! 😁
---
Yes yes yes yes a thousand times yes
---
No, this is better.  A percentage reduction would have made a full set always useless.
---
move your camp, store the camp items from the blueprint. Now you are clear to resume building.
---
I'll give it a shot
---
Its not the same at all though. With the Vendors, we know 100% what we are getting when we go to buy it. With the Scrip system and the new Purveyor, Bethesda has stated that there will only be legendary item rerolls, in which nothing is guaranteed and its all based on chance. I dont see how those are the same thing.
---
Agreed about Power User. Holding a core-producing workshop for a few hours gives me all I need for a week or two of regular play. I'm in PA about 2/3 of the time with heavy AP usage.
---
theres a new quest????  is this the one for the backpack?
---
Yeah I just need to get the recipe
---
Did anyone actually expect it to?
---
Id still like energy weapons armor penetration to work properly but all these changes are still great
---
I am sorry you are lack the skills necessary to defeat those armor types.
---
Hello there, old chum!
---
Absolutely.  This screenshot was pulled from a video. I saw my caps before (as I was at someone else's vending machine) and saw the caps after.
---
I paid about 1k for a 3* piece of sentinel. Some sucker had sold it to a vendor :)
---
If they nerfed it too much yes... as it is now you can luck out and still be near immortal for literally standing still
---
You can even complete it in adventure mode :O
---
Griefer mode is still beta. Provide feedback on the issues.
---
OMG thank you! I would never of checked there :)
---
What is this for?
---
Oh dear
---
oooooooooof
---
About 17,500 caps if you can boost your charisma some more and rank 3 hard bargain. Still expensive, but not like you have much choice. I'd say focus on the most popular one, buy it, sell crafted serums via the player vending. Eventually it will get easier to get caps and you can buy another and so on. Will definitely take some time, but totally doable without having to farm. Just need patience.
---
I never saw the benefit of the larger magazine.  It adds weight to the gun and with the standard magazine you already have plenty of ammo and a fairly fast reload.
---
Yes. I had to restart the game to get it to come back.
---
To prevent people like me from obtaining 500000 scrip on day 1 and flooding the economy with new stuff (assuming the items you purchase can be traded)
---
Expensive though, jet pack and shocks cost over 5000 caps
---
Waooooaoooaooea
---
Stagger or VATS crits defeats Sentinel and Cavaliers.
---
If this is true, thank you sm
---
Hang on a sec, are they selling the glitched strike breaker skin, instead if just fixing the gun?
---
I agree with you man, they are shipping the "free DLC" which should be granted in the launch.  
---
The Free DLC excuse is good for a lot of people but they all know the game was shit at the beginning because it was rushed, it shouldn't be live in 2018 this game should have shipped in May 2019 or even June or July, the free content should have been a feature in the vanilla game and I am pretty sure Beth Austin thought about this and as the development times where struggling they decided to rush the opening promising the game fixing.  
---
Don't get me wrong I love the game, I truly do but I am not stupid this game is just an incomplete mess and the fixing promises is just an excuse to delay the content and ship new microtransactions. It is a business model people should be aware of this.
---
Damn it bungie
---
Feels as useless as energy weapons.
---
Yikes are we really 6 months in and most weapons still blow.
---
Which isn’t something readily available to all players. You can have counters but needing a counter to fight something at all is too far.
---
i noticed the fast travel mats work in a workshop but not our camp..when i put down a fast travel mat in a workshop i spawn right on top of it....doesnt seem to work for camps tho
---
inb4 everyone builds a room with no exit and then puts their fast travel mat in there
---
You can actually inspect in the vending machines O_o. At least on PS4
---
That's MASTER SERGEANT GUTSY, pipsqueak! Sounds like somebody needs to go back to Patriotism Training!
---
It isn't that fast, fast would be a game like fortnut
---
I wouldn't be scared of survival if I knew how PvP worked AT ALL OR IN ANY WAY.
---
over 500 hours and still don't understand how scaling works or how PvP always ends in me dead.
---
One question, where are possum ones?
---
With the purchasing weapons one you've listed it's only occasionally buggy I've found. Sometimes I can view the stars other times I can't.
---
I've experienced all the things said. I got locked inside someone's house. Under someone's house. Very increased spawn of enemies.  Makes me hesitant to leave for too long. Also, the menu while loading the machine is super laggy. And I was in my stash while someone was shopping and nearly froze my menu. But....I have seen many awesome camps!
---
I’m new to fallout 76 enjoying it so far, now these are purely cosmetics?
---
Not as great this time I think. The raider PA is just a recolour of a previous one, and if I can be honest, I think faction based skins should have been rewards in game, not purchased. So few skins in the game you don't need to pay for, they really should add at least a few.
---
How can we even do this
---
Did you have pacifist turned on? 
---
I play survival sometimes and with that on I can't hurt people unless they hit me first hah :)
---
Half the time I end up spawning underwater, so I REALLY want this
---
No idea, I was gonna do that badge but since I can't craft I just dropped it
---
No space?  Now that's what I'm talking about!
---
i have no idea, these challenges are beyond tedious.....
---
do these reward badge points?
---
Same here go to my recent post and upvote the post I made about this
---
Can the fight be "turn on/off" by playing on the boundaries?
---
They definitely got hit quite hard
---
Same. Just visited 6 vendors, only on one didint work. So it's not all the time but most.
---
They're coming back. That's why there's now  15 second time on fast traveling near enemies.
---
Ur telling me... I'm slowly working my way thru dem all but damn... Not even Google helps at times.. M. Not as simple as other dude suggests
---
Enclave internet brigade we are here to clean this comment section to cover our dirty secrets
---
Also captured a frog, presumably for the habitat! Still haven’t found out how to craft the habitat itself though :(
---
This is a fantastic surprise!!
---
I search market76 for similar weapons and armor that were sold so i can judge the prices i set for items in my vending thing. We need a vending price standards list for items straight away.
---
I'm glad they put shotguns on par with the rest of the weapons.
---
I am loving seeing these gorgeous camps. 
---
However I just went to one that was attacked by 5 or 6 wolves who destroyed half the vendors building. I felt awful.
---
I’m gonna try non explosive legendary shotguns.
---
Staggering and VATs crits are based on perk and weapon choices and thus are available to all.
---
I am assuming... I saw that the exams were part of the scout World challenges and I assume its how u bump up to pioneer. So want to get exams out the way
---
In Blackwater Mine there are about 3 or more bags of cement in the same room as Uranium Fever
---
I just picked them up a a vending machine right before work for 100 caps each. Lucky me. They guy selling them also had a ton of other plans I hadn't learned yet for 0 caps.
---
Would have rather seen the nerf just be 10% per piece.  Now it’s a 75% chance of 75%.....  just seems clunky.
---
On par ?
---
Thanks for letting us know.
---
My camp is built on a cliff:)
---
Yeah i give up
---
Mine's Shielded, best freaking underarmor I think in the game.
---
Ive ridden the Nukashine express before.
---
Just like every other Explosive weapon. It's just that people got used to deal insane amounts of damage. But they will adapt again.
---
Its pretty remarkable to me that you didn’t think there would be a cap on how much scrip you can get a day. The legendary vendor doesn’t come out for another week or possibly two, you will have plenty of time to get your scrip don’t worry. 
---
Sometimes I feel people just like to complain to complain.
---
You haven't seen tedious till you try and get merit badges IRL
---
You get the ones for the normal (mutated) animals from the Pioneer Scout Dailies.
---
Absolutely zero way I'm going to move my entire Camp after rebuild everything just because one Foundation block isn't wanting to delete. It's clearly a bug with the latest patch so hopefully they'll notice it and fix it
---
Didn't work
---
What is legendary script?
---
will check it out thks
---
Yeah adapt to use equally strong weapons. This nerf was unnecessary.
---
What happens if you sell one item for one cap? Do you get the whole cap?
---
All Explosive weapons deal 20% damage, but shotguns were dealing 100%... until now.
---
I'm still a tadpole but I think it's the same place.
---
Grounded: +100 energy resist, -50% energy damage  
---
Chameleon: invisible when not moving and no armor.
---
O I know. We are working on ways now ;)
---
I've got a cryo on all mu chars now purely for that event as I found my support char who uses one anyway could own that event but my commando, who's normally a murder machine, kept getting fails. Explosive cryos are fun, I got one of those and an explosive flamer the day before they got patched out of the loot rolls.
---
I just use my extractor at my base basically unlimited lead
---
Yeah, looted one aswell
---
Can we get a " so what? Don't buy em then! " Emote..😘
---
If they want to PVP, yes.
---
That’s why we need to convince Bethesda to implement a lore friendly way to introduce the price tracking into Fo76. :D
---
I was even thinking they could introduce it via a mini-questline like someone discovered the old stock exchange in like Charleston or Watoga, go investigate! And ultimately you end up booting up the trading computers there and then activating an antenna on the roof so you can “connect” your personal terminal to the network. Along the way, maybe you could even pick up new variant plans for personal terminals and player vending machines.
---
I mean, the goal of Vault 76ers isn’t to just kinda exist in the wastelands, but to rebuild civilization within in. Complex market analysis was part of civilization before the bombs fell, so really it’s our duty to rebuild that too.
---
I'm a mathematics professor, not a Bethesda game developer.
---
It's a pain cause the questions change every attempt haha.
---
Ok I’m done responding now lmao
---
Ima just go even harder on workshops then sell the junk I take for diet cheap lmao, there’s such a carebear community in this game
---
I mean, it would be nice if faction content was a quest reward over a payed for item. One thing a lot of players want is some kind of faction system in game, or to at least feel like they can represent their favourite. I mean the enclave has its plasma rifle, brotherhood has its armour skins. Responders and fire breathers don't really have anything to customise with.
---
I love that my CAMP is set up near his path. Nothing beats looking out the window, seeing them stroll by and running out to catch them. It's like being a kid and hearing the ice cream truck in the summer.
---
Where do you do the exams???
---
Is it bad I met 2 hackers before on Xbox? And my friend is a goddamn beacon for hackers?
---
Yeah the camps pop up green and you can fast travel but it still costs
---
I'll add you now mate!
---
They aren't invincible ;)
---
My shotgun used to deal a lil bit of damage but now I'm guessing I'm going to be dealing 1 dmg to the creatures now. Rip
---
We need this. I've been stuck on the Athlete exam and the questions are randomized for each attempt.
---
Yup that's what I'm doing -- just to make sure.
---
Oh look, the miserable people are out..
---
Well hot damn.
---
Thanks &lt;3 that’s fair I suppose
---
Did the player buy all of them or was that just the "title" of the item?
---
Wouldn’t be against this .. lol
---
Yeah, my camp is pretty basic as well. I may have to spruce it up a bit if I am to receive visitors.
---
Repair kits are such a non-issue lol.
---
There may be a lot of inconsistencies about what exactly is happening, but i can personally confirm from repeated tests i did during patch 6 that, at least for my testing, if pacifist was on, attackers wouldn’t be damaged by the mutation (thus initiating PVP) UNLESS THE ATTACKER WAS WANTED. That loophole existed prior to patch 6 and may well exist now.  So watch your ass if they’re wanted and attacking you. 
---
That being said, it’s really hard to get wanted these days. Everything is undamagable
---
I’ll help
---
I agree, let people charge what they want, they either going to sell them or not else move on .. no need to badger the seller.
---
Not sure how they guy you bought them off had X-01 plans before the patch since they wasn’t even available from the dev room I’m pretty sure but if he sold you then for 100 caps each then that’s lucky. I’ve spent over 25k so far haha.
---
Has there been talks of allowing mods recently? I feel like we're nearing towards that since the complaints are getting ironed out
---
And the patch gets BETTER
---
Glad to see Bethesda listened to the complaints about how annoying it was to find
---
There were 2k or so of them in there. He bought the amount shown in the corner.
---
Sweet baby Jeeeebusss! I'm super pumped about that :D
---
Fair enough.  But everyone who PVPs was using some variant of the perks so knowing how to defeat them is expected.
---
The player ones, but n/m it seems to be working for me now.
---
Ahh, thanks! I about crapped a purple twinkie.
---
yw
---
how did you capture a frog?
---
*wakes up in Dudgeon with Skeleton chimes everywhere*
---
All looks pretty good! Curious if next patch you guys could look at how the laser trip wire works, doesn't seem to work properly with the terminal I've spent a long time testing it. And I was curious about the targeting HUD. It says it doesn't target nearby players. What about in survival mode or in pvp does it apply then?
---
Yes it was definately an oversite.  I think they intended you to do the three items multiple times.
---
Get it before it's hotfixed.
---
The player that attacked me wasn’t wanted either. I’d test this if I played with anyone but I mostly run solo so if you would be able to test at some point that’d be great
---
i’ve been spawning in walls and unable to move most the time.
---
I first went to WS at level 28, Damn quest sent me into a hell hole full of level 68 enemies, and the only good thing that came out of it was accidentally finding the Sulphur Fountain. I was actually trying to hide when I realized I was suffering from dehydration, likely brought on by the GTDs (Ghoul transmitted Diseases) that you catch when they Butt Rape your low level A$$, I was out of water, but still had plenty of Rad Away, so I decided to drink from the fountain, and much to my surprise it was great, not only did it not irradiate me, but it quenches thirst better than Purified Water, and cures my GTDs, I have been drinking from this magical fountain eve4ry since, even when I don't have any GTDs.
---
PS: GTDs has been copyrighted, so you must donate Flux to me if you use it.
---
Buy them on the trading boards while you still can.  They run between 4k and 7k.
---
This is the real reason I want it
---
Try roleplaying as a raider... if you were actually creative about it, there would be far more people willing to play along.
---
That gives me the idea of doing a maze. Or make them drink nukashine to get out when they activate punch bowls again
---
PSN is Hownny. I'm on right now if u want to knock it out.
---
Wait, are my grains why I keep getting random visitors every time I fast travel?
---
Oh so we have to rank up? For bag? Thats crazy.
---
you get 30 per kiosk so 120 slots total. just put stuff at 1 cap and i'm sure it will go quickly enough.
---
Thirst? Hunger?
---
And  2 hours from now, I will watch Sandman’s video about you guys smashing ppl in adventure mode lol
---
Auto unlock :(
---
As it was stated, these values have no known context. We don't know if they are a multiplier, a divisor, a direct conversion into Scrip.
---
Furthermore, we have no clue if it's what WE are selling, and the value, or what the VENDOR will eventually be selling and the "cost" to us. Which just because the info is datamined from -this- patch, the files being there doesn't mean much. The "Horsemen" Power Armor has been in the game files *since beta!* heh We're only *now* getting access to them via Atomic Shop.   
---
^(Bethesda is kinda-sorta doing patches in a nice way, through splitting up data and including what's finalized even if the plan isn't for it to become available for some time. Makes for us not getting 20GB patches (that one 14GB was a doozie for me, though, with 24GB/mo bandwidth limit).)
---
Not trying to be a dick, just trying to temper expectations a little, as this has the potential to be calculated in ways we may not expect.   
---
Here's just an example... It could be an item's "Cap Worth / Table Value = Scrip Earned". So a Tier-3 Legendary Weapon that's worth 700 Caps would be: 700 ÷ 40 = 17.5 Scrip.  
---
Given that's a decimal, it seems unlikely, sure. Could also be "Tier Level \* Table Value = Scrip Required to Buy" from the Purveyor when she arrives. So a Tier 3 piece of Armor would cost us 72 Scrip to buy it. 
---
**TL;DR -** We have no context for these values, so while it's interesting and we can certainly speculate what it could be... unfortunately, there's no basis to claim "not to bad" yet considering all that we don't know. :( Not trying to be a jerk, just being real with ya.
---
Wait, are the train tracks by the Train Station now a "No build zone" too? Because that's where I set up my little trading Post and I finally got it looking nice.
---
Fuuuuuuck. . I literally just uninstalled the game 10 min ago.  Now I have to redownload
---
If I get 4/5 one more time shits gonna get real lol
---
I think a vault boy facepalm or something could work well, like slapping his forehead or something
---
Just run up to it and press A (or your Xbox A equivalent). Guaranteed spawn at the Whitesprings Golf Club Pool!
---
Any issues at 2 caps? Might just price my ammo up till that's sorted out.
---
Okay. Just checking.
---
Eh, I wouldn't go THAT low, but I think my prices would be much more reasonable than the BS pricing people are pulling.
---
As a shopkeeper since the Fasnacht Parade, it depends. If you really have something you don’t want to sell for cheap, stick to your price. If it’s rare enough, someone will buy it. For example, my “white whale” has been the electrified sheepsquatch staff plans. Finally got one, then I got a duplicate. I’m not letting that thing go for less than 5k caps due to the rarity. I’ll make modded staffs to sell all day for about 500-1k caps, but not the plans. Alternatively, I’ve been sitting on duplicate building plans for a long time that I’m gonna put up for around 10-25c each just to get rid of them.
---
I've found a couple prior to the patch and I thought it odd, but still they were broken.
---
I was at 100 Budget before the update, I could place all four vendors and fill them without issues and without deleting anything. 
---
Sounds like a big, I'd restart your FO76...
---
No no, not "NAMES" names..just a sign on the front of their counter showing you which faction they're with. 
---
Destroy guilt free.
---
I noticed that all the vendors sell a lot more weapon and armor mods.
---
Not untill you either start pvp or bait an enemy into beating the shit out of their base. If you have a bug then dont be an ass, just report it to wherever and play the game the way its intended to be.
---
Just go back to Pioneers Camp and it will appear.
---
They aren’t listening to the people who enjoy PvP
---
100%
---
I saw someone charge 10 caps a bullet and 92 caps a still pack
---
strong dragonzord vibes with green escavator!!
---
Casual players only, fam. Get out.
---
did the course.. where do you take the exam?
---
By themselves, and if that were the end all be all of them, I'd agree.  But now it looks like some more game features are going to be Atom shop only, meaning they're going down that road.  Data mining shows some troubling information about fridges.
---
I didn't get a chance to see what they were had to leave for work if you run it with your alt let me know
---
How sad
---
2 extra shots would be ok if it was a handmade. 3 to 4 is crazy for a shotgun.
---
***Oh yes***
---
Where on map?
---
Sickness maybe? Do a disease cure, that's usually what I need to do when things aren't acting correctly.
---
What garbage... Plans and Recipes were the main reason I was so stoked for vending machines.  I have like 150 lbs worth spread across my alts. 
---
Oh well... At least we can sell ammo now.
---
Will do
---
Dolly sods.
---
Such as? 
---
It was totally necessary. Explosive weapons were nerfed to deal only 20% more damage - shotguns should be no different.
---
Does the exp bonus stack with other foods like cranberry juice/ chopper ?
---
Oh buddy, don't get so offended! I'm happy for you. Have fun in the wastes.
---
I can think of SOOO many times I'd use that emote...that would definitely have my vote.
---
LOL!   She's completely nekkid.
---
Actually it'd be cool to see a "stock" ticker on the map screen of what last sold and what price on that server. It'd be interesting to see what's selling and what prices are at.
---
I have like 20 captured frogs in my stash... I think I may have a problem
---
Dear old friends remember Navarro...
---
1 Cap
---
200 IQ counter-argument. Congratulations.
---
This post should be stickied
---
Preach it
---
I’ve been worried about this. I’m down by the south west entrance not bothering anyone. I just wanted a nice, well manicured lawn and little land to farm. 
---
I don’t want to move!
---
I didn't do that but I did spend 1400 of my atoms that I earned on the new power armour paint because I could finally buy calibrated shocks for my xo1. Which means I can now use it!
---
I think 10 caps each.
---
Despite this, Handmade rifles are arguably still the best weapons in the game several months later
---
It is a bit easier to type on a calculator I guess.
---
Paparapapa papara-paaa papa-ra-pap-ra papapapapap papaprapapap paaaa parapapapa papapapaaa papapapaaa parapa-papa
---
I’ve passed two exams but nothing is happening. Something supposed to happen? I’m so lost.
---
The additional method drafted isn't a bug either. You are correct about the baiting technique too.
---
Though with your attitude, you can wait for it.
---
So don't log out in WS before you do it.  I spawned in a couple weeks ago to do the challenge for Action Hero, and never saw a soul.  I logged out at my base in the boonies (base optional) with a bunch of mats and crap weapons to break down, and was in and out in 20 minutes.  I think there were 3 people on the server total.
---
Shotguns already do underwhelming damage as it is, the extra damage just helped to bring it to acceptable damage
---
Just move the CAMP item so they always spawn over the ledge and fall to their deaths/behind the locked barred doors...err I mean in front of your nice shop &gt;.&gt;
---
Bethesda PLEASE do this, I'd love for players to stumble upon other players adventures and stories by visiting thier camps
---
I only run one too, but I don’t mind farming. It’s more about what you farm, if you have some rare loot it’ll sell for a decent price. I’ve never traded 3* legendaries, I stick to stuff I know people don’t want to farm themselves. Like I’ve got all the new sheepsquatch weapon mods. Crafting those is super easy and I can sell them for 500-1000c. With player vending, I’ll be buying all my materials, crafting, then flipping the staffs. Guaranteed I can make enough for a serum every day (or every other day).
---
tell that to the guy i just now saw with basically a fortified mansion there
---
Atom shines on all
---
I was having that as well.. FT to the vault and then to your camp seems to fix it.
---
Have you seen the quests for it it's all just busy work
---
Give me a second I’ll see if maybe you have to capture the a frog and have a jar to complete?
---
Start high with prices, if they don't sell, reduce.
---
I agree with you, but I’m also just trying to look at the bright side that we’re getting SOME faction themed shit, finally. Yea, it sucks that we have to pay for it but idk. Until they actually implement a faction system (which I agree, they REALLY need to do) I’ll take what I can get, I suppose. Not condoning the idea of all faction content being paid, just like... not being pissy about it, I guess.
---
Faction vendors aren't missing. They even have their own counter now.
---
Lead is easy once you have the excavator PA but before that you can go to the railway elavator near watoga, lots of weights there along with a bunch of cement bags. another good spot is the ski resort right next to the top of the world station. Only 2-3 weights here in the stairs in a box with some cannonballs but there is 6 tin can chimes that also spawn here that are almost never touched.
---
You probably already know about the motel and firestation but those spots are almost always dry.
---
Give it time. I'm all for constant, small changes in games like this to bring balance.
---
Shotguns are among the highest damage weapons. 
---
80% is a lot of extra damage, don't you think? Especially when every other weapon of the same type is only dealing 20%.
---
You will adapt, I'm sure of it.
---
Yes. Time sink.
---
Be nice if I had some friends 😕
---
Ive gotten 4/5 on archery twice 😔
---
They should snap to the OUTSIDE of the camp circle, on the ground, this what you can set where you come into the camp, but you cannot setup traps.
---
Dance animations really should be in the game
---
Odd I must been lagging and didn't see em
---
Bought 1k to buy the nuka shine armor :)
---
*shakes in unyielding/bloodied*
---
hehe... I'm in danger
---
I like it better than FO4 too. I'm glad I'm not alone.
---
I am so pleased with this patch!!!
---
Forgive me, but I don't quite understand your reference of "on" or "off". They're not permanently queued. Hell, even paper bags and loot corpses have loading times to them. They have to be interacted with \*like\* a Stash to view the items.
---
Built my first base in the White springs during the BETA. It was between the footpath and fence. Thought I'd have a bunch of neighbors one day. Only a small walk to farm the club. Then the masses learned that they could farm there, and nuking it was beneficial. Moved to Harpers Ferry and I've been there since. Sad to know that the Whitesprings will never be the player hub town I thought it could be the day I found it.
---
I've never really been a pvp player much so it doesn't matter to me. I've just come across my fair share of people who like to use the games bugs and glitches to their advantage against people like me who arent that good at the game in general.
---
No problem :)
---
I’d say around 5-7.  
---
With hard bargain and grape mentats they’re cheap at vendors, and pretty abundant in-game.
---
I live on dog food, pretty much. I’m never nearly out because I’m always finding it.
---
Uhm no. I've had 4 crashes wiyhin one hour, whitespring enemies are face down in the dirt while moving that's me which looks weird. UI menus are add glitcy as always. Trades still crash when someone exits the serves.
---
Don't trust datamining. Fridges will be an ingame customization, trust me.
---
Clearly a mod conflict as you have mods installed.
---
I am the biggest fan of this game and I believe in people having a good time and the idea of the survival mode and adventure being separate is great but this whole “haha fuck you PVPers, daddy Bethesda is coming down hard on YOu! Go back to fortnite!” Is so cringe.
---
I hope they balance PvP soon so It can come back to being a necessary evil that people can avoid and or engage in in both modes but actually let ppl have a fighting chance even if they don’t have the gear for it
---
For all of those people out there who were single player only like me who had those these moments with PVP and actually ended up having fun with it, though it needs to be reworked, I know you know what I mean here.
---
I was still able to drink a whiskey out of one guys punch bowl, but I wasn't able to add anymore to mine.
---
Not offended, just sad that you feel the need to be negative about this, even though it doesn’t affect your life in any way..
---
This.  
---
Hunter/hunted is what they want, or a dedicated arena map/event.  As a survival player, I like that there's a roughly 50/50 chance someone will attack me.  When survival started with massive aid and cap drops it was a 99% chance.
---
I’m having a hard time understanding this. Can you dumb it down for me?
---
People would build their camp, with a bunch of turrets, right behind the Golf Club building, because of the high level legendary ghouls that spawn in there. That way they could farm the ghouls without having to lift a finger. Can't do that anymore, as of this patch.
---
All 2 of them. Majority comes first.
---
No luck, I have the jar and a frog but no luck :/ maybe something we’re missing
---
Just posted a bug thread for this. I hate it.
---
It ticks off in your challenges
---
I honestly hope not.
---
They watch our reactions to bugs &amp; glitches to see what we'll put up with.  They see everything.
---
3 times now
---
What are tge world challenges
---
This has happened to me for a long time. I pick some other spot, just to get the option to pop up, then close the map, then go back into the map and try my CAMP again. It works after I do that one or two times.
---
Will we ever be able to change backpacks to not being visible whatsoever? I understand it probably wont be a priority, but I prefer my current aesthetic of my outfit and dont want a huge backpack to change it.
---
1. Been happening since they moved the vendors to whitesprings. Usually server lag. Wait or hop servers.
---
My disappointment is immeasurable.
---
You're fine. It's just behind the Golf Club building. My camp is on the flat area near the snake on the map, right next to the road that goes East/West though Whitespring, and I'm fine.
---
I put a “You have been insulted!” note in my camp for 25k just for the reactions. Lol.
---
I play on PC. Run a couple mods so not sure if that could be the culprit.
---
:( yeah. shame they didn’t increase budget to compensate
---
Cool. I love the vending feature, but this effect makes me feel griefy.
---
Thx for reporting it.
---
That guy obviously never played Dead Money...
---
Just got a Scorched beast.....
---
Open sign is from the plan Signs and Letters....goes for about 9k at the Raider and BoS Watoga Vendor
---
Arrows not sure
---
Yeah, I was super excited, but no, the silly issue from Fallout 4 still remains.
---
While I didn't get an amazing deal on the initial game (I pre-ordered the digital version), I do the same as far as buying atoms goes.  I feel its not only a good value for my enjoyment, but I'd rather toss some money to be able to choose things I want in return instead of pay a subscription.  Having played games like WoW in the past, I feel its rather nice to actually get something and chose to only pay when I am actually playing.
---
Beautiful thanks
---
You can now fast travel even if something is nearby but stuck underground. As long as it doesn't hit you.
---
Yea, might be bugged after all
---
But at least for stimpacks that’s cheaper than vendor prices
---
I have Instigating pump and combat shotguns max lvl non- exploding. Wonder how they now compare to my Furious explosive combat shorty.  Will have to try them out
---
The open sign comes with neon letters, not sure about the arrows
---
Interesting. What platform? I'm on PS4.
---
The MODUS production terminal sells the X-01 Military paint plan but I have found the plan for the other models. I checked the BoS vendor in Watoga but no luck.
---
Yea, finally finished the athlete exam. They're randomized for each attempt so I had to keep a tab open with my research and answers.
---
That’s how it’s always been though. That’s no different then spawning at your own base every so often. Something usually spawns. Bethesda has been overly generous about turret cost on budget. Maybe people should consider putting turrets up to protect their customers. It would be the kind thing to do since players are coming to spend caps.
---
Yeahh I wasn't sure what to do with those last three honestly
---
I've been trapped in so many venders houses today because of this. Wish it spawned you away from camp or they didn't remove camp damage.
---
Did you add the newly added files to your customs-file for the mods?
---
decent weapons with decent prices. I don't want a 1* lvl 35 10mm pistol for 5,000 caps. You're nuts.
---
Unneeded legendaries (or you could sell them for the new currency), good armor pieces, and good weapon/armor mod plans
---
Automatic handmades still do insane amount higher dps than combat shotguns. Shotguns shouldn’t have been patched.
---
Pvp was semi balanced besides assassin sent armor
---
Yes, the "achievement"/trophy is on the consol end- had no problem with that  
---
but what the post is specifically addressing is the atom challenges  
---
I made a second character to get some of these after the new year and ran that character up to Grafton Dam and it did  not give me credit. Additionally, i recently didn't get credit for killing a Legendary Deathclaw which i know for a fact I didn't kill any during the beta (call me chicken) -which is also the case for many locations that i discovered, they were after the beta  
---
and i notice that you respond to us frequently on here, thank you for that and your hard work
---
Also need to add fast traveling is borked. Tried to go to a camp, twice it took caps and woulsnt fast travel me. Said "fast traveling is pending" or some odd message flashed up
---
Yes it is mate. Gonna take a while to finish....
---
Yeah its driving me crazy, a ton of Super Mutants started spawning and destroying my base as people spawned in...
---
Unlock the refined .50 receiver.
---
My guess is that the reason we have so much data (files) on our side is because the game is effectively running on both systems, with some hash-checks made to make sure everything is legitimate and no hacking going on. 
---
Otherwise, the server would be having to do a LOT of number crunching and we're have a lot more network activity than what we do with 76 (seriously, the game is pretty light on usage, with my 6hr game sessions only using a combined UP/DOWN usage of 550MB, which voice chat is always transmitted and only muted client-side).
---
All a guess on my end though... But don't given people ideas! lol   
---
Reality Check: For anyone out of the loop, modding game files can end up getting you banned. Changing textures? Maybe not. Tweaking scripts that dictate how the game operates? Highly likely. *(Making major changes to the INI files seems safe, as mine is highly tweaked for better graphics/performance and has been since December.)*
---
What a tease. She stripped everything. Even the good stuff.
---
The Enclave now also sell all the mod plans for X-01 as well as the headlamp plans. I also agree I like the pre-war military look myself as well.
---
I passed 2 exams and that "Growth" objective is still at 0/3. How do you actually DO that objective?
---
I did it at the Tyler County Dirt Track since it's swarmed with low level ghouls... I also did it in Adventure mode. So huh.
---
I'm looking for plans at a low price
---
If that's true, that's just dumb.
---
I could actually agree. As well as a lottery just to get on the nerves of the people.
---
At best it’s buggy :)
---
so far I been selling tmaps, explosive weapons, power armor plans and narcotics very well. I would assume ammo too but that shits dear to me and you can't have it! nobody can!!
---
Xbox. Also add two more crashes to my previous statement
---
It's just a skin.
---
Ok i see they're diff questions.. i suppose so you can't give eachother answers rip
---
not sure about the stats, but the backpack in the Atom store is a *skin*, you still have to unlock the real backpack in-game.
---
Yep.
---
Select another location but cancel it and close map.
---
Reopen map and you should be able to travel.
---
DPS. That's the key word right there. With a shotgun, you are supposed to deal high damage, *up close* (come on, it's a shotgun) in a single burst. Handmades have a lot more bullets for sustained DPS.
---
And no, PvP is nowhere near balanced, not even now. But the other day I had someone snipe me with an Explosive double barrel from one extreme of the WS Station to another, so at least we've got rid of that nonsense.
---
Like I said, shotguns = CQC. People were using them as snipers. Now that's over.
---
Just because loading a CAMP always triggers a hostile check doesn't mean it should trigger one if my customers fast travel in while I am not there.
---
As it stands you can just fast travel in and out repeatedly to level a camp.
---
First time I am learning about this, so grateful to OP.
---
These are pissing me off.
---
Google has.
---
I have sold a bunch of plans and a bunch of ammo so far.
---
Lmk what happens I’m curious
---
What we'd like to put in the diaries:
---
I ran out of .50 cal ammo halfway through the fight, had to dodge and run until I happened upon a shack that held a pump action. Upon grabbing it I was ambushed...
---
What will really be in the diaries:
---
Your penis is small scumbag. Go lose to a 12 year old No0b
---
That's a nice camp you got there, it'd be a shame....
---
Because it is now, because they changed it.
---
The refined .50 actually does less damage than the normal .50 now for some reason
---
And hilarious.
---
Thanks, didn't know that.
---
Yeah everyone’s using that would be the problem. It’s so strong with zero skill or effort and makes everything else basically useless
---
Did he give you a thumbs up when he finished dining on Besty?
---
HA!  You're not fooling me,  Doug McMillon.
---
I have a shitload of chems, books, bobbleheads, and other stuff that I think is gonna sell quickly
---
Do you think it looked the best on T60 or T51? IMO it’s t60. I also wonder if they will expand the military paints to other PA’s but that I wouldn’t think would make sense.
---
They were among the highest dps, not anymore highest dps goes to heavy weapons now shotguns aren't even on the same playing field
---
I have 4 heavy laser turrets and 3 missile turrets and it still isn't enough.
---
But it says ".50 Caliber Receiver MODS", shouldn't that refer to every .50 receiver?
---
Look in world in the challenges menu
---
I found it!!!! It’s under Floor decor! Between the rugs if you have everything needed you can build it!
---
All I know is I will be listing my perfectly preserved pie for 25,000 caps.
---
Sadly it isn't a bug. This has always driven me crazy
---
elaborate please.
---
Flux. 
---
556 ammo
---
45 ammo
---
Legendary weapons
---
Acid
---
Lead
---
These are my prime items I'll be browsing for. But I know people will buy plans. Treasure maps. Armor. Stimpacks. Adhesive. Springs. Aluminum.
---
Their stash box is filled with feather dusters, slave collars, straight jackets and cooking oil ;)
---
OK, fair enough.. How about challenging repeatable content that awards the player with incentive to repeat the content?
---
They are. You just need to get close to your target, as the damage is done per each pellet. No more sniping with shotguns.
---
Try a 1* legendary price if Armor, these are work 3 normally, Weapons are 5 ☺️
---
Just set mine up, had loads of visits, nothing sold yet. Did buy one plan from another vendors machine.
---
i would be willing to say they made a decent boatload today if what me and my friends have done is any indicator of the gaming community inside 76
---
Its more for me. I think you are comparing two different types of receivers.  
---
The hardened adds damage and the critical .50 adds damage + crit damage.
---
Theres a .50 receiver that does more damage then the hardened
---
Glowing mass,fluxes,serums
---
No, but she did put up a good fight. At least 5-6 hits from a power fist. Not bad for a level 3 Brahmin.
---
I'm annoyed at the backpack change to no longer work in power armor. I'm in my power armor 95% of the time.
---
Oh thank god. I just had a mini panic attack. I spent so much time getting it ready for visitors.
---
I've never had any problems with the stability since I started playing a few months back.
---
Text is so resource cheap I don't understand why we couldn't have this
---
I call bullshit on that
---
oh yeah... Whitesprings is the best for that.
---
I don't think they should let us have our own, 24 Vertibirds on a server would make it feel so much less special. Imo what they should do is allow the Vertibots you get for claiming some workshops to be used for transport as well
---
Its necessary. Since caps are awarded for everyone, the worth goes down. If everyone has 20k caps, the caps become worthless, which is like real life where printing too much money makes it useless. It's would also make the prices even more absurd, there are people who want more than 25k caps (the max one character can have) for an item.
---
It’s was only 1 damage lower before, so it has to be better than hardened .308 now if they buffed .50.
---
I seem to remember repairing an armor piece up to 200% earlier. Are you 100% certain you had the right perk card on?
---
From what I've read, It's super nerfed though. They say you only get like 30% of the caps when anything listed for 1c is sold. Huge cap sink
---
for flux Harpers ferry is great esp for violet but for the mats needed to stabilize.. Whitesprings.
---
POSSUM HAT
---
getting annoyed and it's only one of a million
---
Yeah, the first time I ever bought plans was for the simple modern bed, but I thought it was called vault tec bed 2 cuz of the blanket
---
I had High Radiation Fluid in mine - thought that would go first, but nope - still sitting there.
---
Hmm. Well, I was trying to list items FROM my Stash, but I was at 799/800. Maybe... if you’re close to the limit, it bugs out? If for anything, you’ve given me some new hope when I get home later. Thank you :)
---
Much more than that. People could try to claim the workshop and that would make you hostile towards them regardless of your position on the map. They don't need to claim the workshop all the way, they just need to attempt it so sometimes you would not even notice. Then they travel to you and kill you by surprise.
---
The deathclaw topiaries and cat one are in game.
---
So far I've sold 3 fusion cores
---
30 Stimpaks
---
15 Radaways
---
And an upgraded vault 76 jumpsuit.
---
What's the highest you've tamed then?
---
If we are in the Control group, can you imagine what blatant nonsense the other Vaults are experiencing?  It must be downright horrendous.
---
Yeah I assume that could be true in other cases. I guess I just assumed the base drop rate was kind of similar for most. That's my fault
---
You got me really curious, is there anything from the atom shop that need to be kept strictly private?
---
Same here, plunked them down in my camp while I still am able.
---
Tested myself and verified this is correct. This is just a visual glitch.
---
They mentioned in a comment or interview like a week or two ago that the extra resistance/damage was a bug would be removed.
---
You can over repair but it will no longer provide extra resistance or damage
---
Ohhh is this for the new patch quests for the scouts?
---
That's fine. You are entitled to your opinion, even if it's wrong.
---
Sucks for people like me who use every bit of budget to decorate. I never remember seeing anything saying the items would take budget to sell...
---
Just bought 1k myself. Very happy.
---
My Sloth is still at my camp post patch.
---
Before, you couldn't fast travel at all when enemies were nearby, which made it annoying if you couldn't find the enemies or if they are too tough to kill and you just want out.
---
no they removed it. You can over repair to 200% still but it will no longer provide extra damage or resistance. They mentioned last week that it was a bug.
---
Hey man add me on brokeback killer. I'm down for that!
---
Don't worry about it. It's bugged (no surprise there). If you want it for shits and giggles, craft a jar at chemistry bench then find a frog (Whitesprings pool) and you're done.
---
Alright, tweaked it a bit!
---

---
I got Nuka Cola plan for 100 caps, and Xo1 Nuka quatum for 100 caps too.... pretty happy
---
I’ve just set mine up and only started listing and someone bought my stuff straight away. I’m guessing I’m selling too cheap. How can I find out what I should price items at? Just sold 2 shot radium/pistol and mini gun for 250 each. I thought 1 star meant they was rubbish.
---
You unlock the ability to craft the frog jar and frog habitat when you become a tadpoles.
---
Haven’t had any crashes or stutters also on Xbox
---
Before the last patch they could only be found on dead tourists, and only once, so if you lost yours you were SOL.
---
I've done the bucket list quest, I don't know if people who haven't done it can find them.
---
Crafted through Workshop mode. 
---
Still challenge step isn’t checked. Getting flustered.
---
This has been a loot drop since the last patch. I had five of them until I accidentally scrapped two. As far as I know though you still need the Bucket List quest to get the zoom lens.
---
T-60 definitely looks the best imo. Btw there are military paints for T-45, 51 and 60 in the game but they haven’t been available yet. They maybe drops from BoS events as of today but I’m not sure just a guess.
---
Now do the 120 items count against stash space?
---
While I do wish they would add more assets for the CAMP to the actual game (things like the new wall mounts for example), I don't really feel like they have added too much through the Atomic Shop overall.  If anything, I'd say its much worse with PA/weapons/armor skins and outfits (since there are very few skins in the game itself overall and many outfits are locked behind random event rewards).  I am hoping to see more things added directly to the game as they exand things though (hopefully each faction eventually gets unique assets unlocked in the game as they exand such content so we can identify ourselves as such through our CAMPs and gear).
---
Typical Bethesda
---
I feel you’re pain. I used to be a tse rifle build with 3 tse rifles. After the nerf I just gave them away. It was not worth the trouble of dying from the explosions if I couldn’t one shot everything
---
I say that we get them a vertibird so that they can fly the wasteland turning everything they see into meat
---
How about a proper aiming reticle?
---
It's not a bug though.
---
There will always be ways to destroy camps. What you should be posting is a suggestion thread, as this is an intended feature
---
Sorry you have poor comprehension skills
---
I had a 'turret farm' there, but I had a switch so it didn't steal kills when other people were there. I only turned them on when I was by myself. :(
---
I'll help I need it too
---
You can see what's in all of your own machines but when others look they only see the contents of each machine. I plan to add letters above each to highlight what's in them E.g. Plans, Ammo etc.
---
Another tip is you can stack so 100 Nukashine only take 1 vending slot but obviously still uses stash space for 100
---
Where do you get a frog and frog jar though
---
Looking for cheap plans I don’t have and ammo.
---
As far as I can tell the vending machines don’t take up camp budget.
---
You could go stealth all the way. High VATS high criticals.
---
I noticed this but only between camp vending and inventory
---
You know there’s one on top of west tek, right?
---
First thing I sold was the canned dog food!
---
I heard Phoenix sells them. But they’re rare.
---
Good to know, I farm these plans daily
---
I'll sell you 10 at 5k a piece
---
I crafted 4 of them (2 at my camp and 2 at a friends) and it never completed it. Also FYI every other world challenge has a bugged challenge in it so it's almost impossible to complete the quest right now.
---
Actually, pretty much every “griefer” that has destroyed someone’s camp is doing it for this exact reason. THERE IS NO ENDGAME CONTENT. After you complete their newest quest, it’s back to one of two things in this game, PvP or collecting the 3 incredibly rare plans you don’t have yet. Sentinel, assassins and cavaliers didn’t need a nerf it needed a counter, because while they pleased a lot of people they made a lot more mad and many more they lost. If they made another effect instead of being lazy they could’ve made a counter that makes it possible to counter but instead they had to take the easy way out and nerf it. They also removed any reason to play survival with the nerfs to aid dropping and caps. The only reason you don’t hear this side of the story is because none of these people have a voice, if they say anything they’re “TSE Pricks” that don’t know what’s best for the game. The game looked like it was going in the right direction with PvP only to make a direct U-turn back to being a low risk low reward.
---
I heard r/outside has the lastest info.
---
Interesting entry though about "Kill ZAX".
---
Brokeback-killer *
---
I'm going to go to my secret location that isn't a pie claw machine and stock up.
---
I mentioned last week about having a fire breathers PA and it's come to life! Awesome! all these items look great! take my money Beth! lol :)
---
Don't worry about them. Every single one has a bugged challenge or you can't do them right now.
---
Ah I did check him but I only checked once and they wasn’t there. I’m going to have to server farm him now haha.
---
What’s your PSN again? Not sure if you missed out an underscore or anything
---
Experiences
---
Wrong. Level 45 trapper armor does require Ballistic fiber to repair.
---
Works fine for loading, SFE is just used for saving capability.
---
Have the stealth bugs been fixed? I do like sniper builds in FO
---
Gotcha. Cool.
---
The worst that can happen if you set your price too high is that it won't sell. Just adjust off of that. Or do a little browsing on the trade subs and get a baseline.  I trade a decent amount and stuff is really all over the board.  One week sentinel stuff is 3-5k a piece and the next week its 8k.  You just have to check around a bit.
---
Yes.
---
Even better lol, should I bother with it yet or see how long it takes them to patch it?
---
That’s why you see so many people without power armor.
---
Raiders in 76 can never be lore; they exist in lore because banding together and raiding improved survivability.  Since no one can perma-die there is no survivability, and therefore no organic factions and no raiders in the lore sense.  It's just a-holes wrecking camps and pretending that's the same thing.
---
If Beth put in actual faction allegience with shared territory, pseudo-permanent building, a pool of shared experience/caps/aid/weapons/camps/etc and real costs to abandon a faction or stray into opposing territory, then there might be a reason to align as a true raider.  You wouldn't be griefing at that point, you'd be collecting resources as a member of the faction.
---
I don't necessarily think this idea fits the game well.  My point is that "raiders" are really just griefers that want to hide behind a label.
---
Tbh I'd rather fast travel into a player-made trap occasionally vs the gamble of unintended broken spots/foundations you're just stuck in 😂
---
Console/console OK,
---
Console/PC?  Not really.
---
Did it benefit them at all?
---
Can't wait to get home and appreciate my collection of three star rolling pins.
---
You take off all your gear in power armour. 
---
So your under armour and legendary effects aren't active while you're inside it
---
You can taste the difference.
---
Dude jet pack plans are still expensive even at vendors
---
That's one way to stop the pay2win discussion with the repair kits...
---
this is really stupid man
---
It takes a while to load in apparently
---
I got the supermutant version.  Still in my stash for the giggles.
---
I would love to donate supplies and see his home/store build over time.
---
Adhesive and other basic materials in bulk. Also any of the nuke zone stuff. Some people like myself hate going into them but need that flux for serums and stuff. 
---
What I’m planning on selling is all the new sheepsquatch weapons, mods, and plans. Some are way harder to get than others, but I got all of the plans as of yesterday.
---
I believe so, I have zero issues using it.
---
As a top tier PvP whose 30+ pieces of armor just got noticably less reliable I am happy with this change and I think its a very good step to make the gear still good but not the default wish for the majority. I wonder what will happen to market prices now.
---
You should read up on F1 and F2 lore. Might not be as horrendous as you think. ;)
---
WHY MAKE A POST, JUST COMMENT IN THE PATCH THREAD
---
Some idiot lobbed a nuke at my camp last night. Bounced to another server and had more than enough junk to make all repairs. But as I was signing off I noticed the guy had a 500 cap bounty. So, yeah....
---
Yeah so we could have our own vertibirds, but only available when you claim a workshop with a vertibird pad or somewhere with a vertibird pad
---
Well don’t take my word 100% of the time. That’s what I only *heard* but yeah I like the idea they might be TC drops. It would only make sense.
---
Brokeback-killer. Sorry missed the dash!
---
I think it’s actually saying your camp budget is full.  I tried to add a weapon to my vending machine and got this message.  I scapped a few camp items and then it let me list the weapon for sale.  Not sure how or why the vending machine items count towards camp budget though.
---
Would be nice to see the world change over time
---
This is something I’d buy and not feel bad for. They need monetary support to keep pushing out these great updates.
---
They will likely be free, just like the terminal that was released today or the punch bowl
---
It’s in your world challenges.
---
Yes it is.
---
Please leave
---
Wow. That's awesome
---
I've scrapped probably over a hundred .50's, I thought I would've had it by now... all of mine do less than the hardened, so I don't know which it would be
---
I’m in the same boat. Trying to recruit more people to join.
---
Go to challenges, go to world scroll down untill you see tadpole
---
go to challenges and world, somewhere at the bottom of the list there. had to look through the sub to find out myself, wasnt too well explained
---
Fallout is not about pvp.
---
Frogs you find about. There’s always some at the white springs pool next to the clubhouse. 
---
The jar is crafted via the Chemistry station.
---
Where the challenges are to get more atoms...under the world category.. look for the ones that offer badges instead of atoms
---
I e been to 8 worlds and have only seen 7 camps selling... I thought there would be more...
---
Good point, one specific item per week kinda thing. But even that is better than wooden legs and rolling pins.
---
Since Player Vending came with it's own set of skins in the atomic shop I want to believe that this is the same case, but I guess we will wait and see.
---
If I can't 1 tap a level 22 super mutant with a AAE Combat Shotgun with 40% bonus damage with shotguns and while running tank killer with 42% bonus damage from adrenaline something is wrong
---
If you have the mats ill do it for ya.
---
I’ve been doing that for a long time (been a shopkeeper since Fasnacht). Always feels good to see others checking it out even when I’m not there.
---
not a liked way...
---
TBH it was the only thing keeping me alive
---
I could over repair my hardened bolstering Raider chest piece from 90, to 106
---
it was the only thing keeping me alive with my bloodied build.
---
My 3 star leather arm piece with great effects was only good over repaired because it would go to 33 damage resistance.
---
You can do the picture and killing ones but I know that Athlete is bugged, nobody has the smores recipe yet, Nobody has found a stimpak diffuser yet, Swimmer (the spruce knob challenge) pretty sure is bugged. So imo I'd wait or do what you can but you're probably not gonna finish.
---
Thank you everyone my dumbass self was looking in the daily and weekly 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
If my deathclaw gauntlet dips below 2k I’m gonna be sad :(
---
Why didn't you just tell me it was Bob
---
This is honestly the only thing I've wanted since the B.E.T.A. lol
---
Glad they did this! Saves a lot of time and caps!
---
Craft jar catch frog after you craft the jar
---
Where do you take the exams?
---
I’ve been putting things in there and have the most luck with loot, ammo and rare plans. I’ve also had a few armor pieces go. It’s all about pricing just right.
---
At 0 point during development was this hard limit mentioned. It was just told to us that we would scrap for a certain value and then thats it. Its not childish to be upset when youre told something will be delivered, and then it has strings attached.
---
Excellent news indeed, I'm still missing a calibrated shock for my left leg so they'll be the first plans purchased.
---
I agree anyone over 400 exploited something or has more free time than anyone I know
---
Gonna have to call BS on that.
---
Dude I'm the same way lol. I have a dead right leg
---
true :P
---
I’m going to have nightmares about this
---
That's my impression as well, but who knows, could be like the weekly legendary in survival mode too.
---
All I said was "Thanks for letting us know." You may be reading into it a bit much. I wasn't being overtly negative.
---
I just thought it was some weird lag... guess not.
---
Random drop off a SB.  Got the plan for sale if you’re interested.
---
Put them in your camp before the next patch and you won’t have to.
---
I guess to give you information like who's ready to visit for dailies.
---
Berserker junkie.
---
What's bugged abour the Athlete one?
---
0ppppp
---
Pppp p p
---
That's good news
---
Its bugged
---
That could be helpful, do you know how to get it?
---
I've always ranked the items by Tier, because when my friend and I first started playing and noted that a ""Legendary"" item had a 1 out of 5 rank, I just called it a "Tier 1". After learning it was a Legendary it simply became "Tier 1 Legendary". Also helped to differentiate between loot and spawned legendary beasts.
---
I guess it's like zombies in The Walking Dead lol "Walkers", "Biters", one group even call them something odd like "Geeks" I think :P
---
+50 carry capacity per leg is worth a few hours of server hopping. Only to then find out you actually need two mods for the two legs might seem very logical, but looking back at it, it wasn't as much at the time. ;)
---
At least now we have a better chance. I'm pretty happy with this patch.
---
RiP haha
---
I’d honestly use shotgun turrets if you are protecting close proximity. Rockets have been junk since day one. Aside from crippling damage, they don’t really do much for damage. If you’re doing ranged, make sure they are heavy laser turrets. Just my opinion. It also depends where on the map you are. If you’re in a low area like the Forrest, those should be good enough. Savage divide, mire and cranberry bog will need good defenses in most cases.
---
This is a fantastic awesome great idea
---
Tldr
---
I did. You can join on the exam terminals and it will pick back up where you left off.
---
The devs seem to think otherwise.
---
It shows your stash to you, so you can pick what you want to sell from it.  
---
Also, IIRC, someone said it took camp budget to sell. So clear some unneeded items from your camp if you want to sell more. See if that works.
---
You can still loot stuff killed by your turrets I believe, but no XP unless you damage the mob before it dies.
---
Wait, is that a Chia pet cat? 
---
WHEN THE FUCK DID WE GET CHIA PETS IN THE GAME AND HOW DID I MISS THAT?!??!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?
---
Nvm found the course starter
---
Sometimes it's easier to overpay just to get stuff fast.  So listing ammo for 1c each might actually work if it's more convenient for someone.
---
Except that every time I go to my STAT tab, my game now crashes. :/
---
finally got the athlete one done.. now need 2 more.
---
To the right of the entrance should see a large pool with no water
---
If you've already done the agility course at Camp mcclintock, you can't retake it. Did everything I could think of to make it work again and it won't.
---
You think i screwed up? That's not even possible. You can only sell ammo for numbers like, 0,1,2 caps etc. But i didn't sell it for 0 caps and i modt certainly did not sell it for 2 caps each. But i now have 1500 . 45 rounds less but only 700 caps more
---
Dammit Bethesda!  I really wanted to put a punch bowl out with NukaShine for folks to drink.  You know, for shites und giggles.
---
When will its functionality be restored?
---
YES PLEASE! I swear my mat won’t be in the middle of flamers.
---
They are earned from new challenges (open your map and go to top right corner) under world section
---
Every time I go to my STAT tab, my game now crashes. :/ 
---
Possibly a mod issue, but given the very long load times, this is going to be a pain to troubleshoot
---
I’ve just fast travelled to a camp and was locked in a locked area so had to fast travel out.
---
Why is it taking people half a year to figure this out and stop bitching. It has always been advertised as all free additional content. And people have been spe updating and raging ever since... 
---
I'm glad you came around!
---
Easy or not, they don't just drop everything to fix something that isn't a major concern- misaligned sights don't cause server crashes, blue screens, getting booted etc., plus you generally are not going to change the schedule for fixes which are already underway, it is a good way to undermine the morale of your workforce.  
---
what we see here is the many of the teams have "caught up" and we will probably see more updates like this in the future
---
Don't provide the mod plans, as it takes away a reason to do end-game stuff like SBQ, to get new Ultracite PA mod plans!
---
However, DO make more paint jobs and stuff for the PA. I agree with Nymith that the BoS paint jobs should also be for the Ultracite! 
---
That's just my 2 caps worth...
---
How do you get wanted through attacking other players? That only happened if you managed to kill them with slap damage. That’s been gone for a while now.
---
Same here.  Graham's how I got my conduits, would like to visit him more often.
---
I'm selling a lot of decent legendaries. 
---
I'm doing 278 for 1 stars with good prefixes, 556 for 2 stars with good prefixes or 3 stars with bad prefixes, and a few good 3 stars for varying prices. I'm also selling full fusion cores and nuclear key cards for 111 a piece and some plans. I know the numbers are weird but after you factor in the fact you only get 90% of the sale they make a little more sense.
---
I've only had one visitor so far who was around level 136 but he didn't buy anything. Perhaps they're too overpriced?
---
Now i feel stupid. Already shot at the terminals.
---
I think the extra damage was always a bug. This is more like a fix.
---
I think you’re right, yeah. I’m not a PvP person and never attack other players so I think I missed that one.
---
What do you mean by our think it’s a Sword?
---
I am glad he posted.  Because I read the patch thread and missed the discussion on this topic.
---
I just completed it and finished the Tadpole: Athlete challenge 6/6. Venture was the last one I did.
---
Damn
---
Marquee Arrows. I’ve seen them for sale at Harper’s Ferry. You might be able to find it with one of the Whitesprings Faction Vendorbots.
---
Oh, I know. Every team is doing their part, and I'd rather have server stability and lag reduction be prioritized. Sometimes the basic bugs feel far more problematic because you're more likely to run into them on a daily basis. I'm not entirely complaining though. They did a good job with this patch overall.
---
You only need to buy the skins from the atom shop if you want to have different skins for your vending machine.
---
Yeah 1% isn't worth all the extra math.
---
You asked about it, I think it’s a sword
---
Lucky. I'm still experiencing stuttering; PS4.
---
No... I mean I purposefully have 20... 25 frogs now.
---
I need more froggies... 
---
30...
---
They ribbit when put in the box.... 
---
50..
---
I can’t stop collecting my new friends....
---
I noticed the same. That really sucks.
---
That's kinda dumb, I power up all the nuke plants and workshops to get quick and easy fusion cores.
---
Trying to do the PvP challenge yesterday with a teammate. We turned off pacifist. I shot him for 0 damage. He returned fire for minimal damage and he got wanted with a bounty. Not sure why that happened since it was a mutual exchange but who knows.
---
Just because they set their standards low and improved to a reasonable performance doesnt mean they should get praise for it. 
---
This is now pretty much where the game should of been at which idk if you remembering paying for but I did.
---
I seem to find the 2 and 3\* ghouls everywhere but the clubhouse. They can camp that area if they want I just hit up the other areas.
---
now if we can add an 'lol' emote and a 'my bad' emote too that would be even better :-)
---
You know, I could have been down with your overall message: it's not fair to give PvP players a sub par game mode and then nerf them in the superior game mode. But then you keep talking and you just sound like you want free reign to wreck people's day, and now I don't care that you're disappointed.
---
I’ve seen I think 7 just on one server. But I haven’t had any visitors yet. 🤷‍♀️ Womp womp.
---
Changing that mechanic is going to be pretty complex. The thought is easy enough in a persons head but with how the game actually works, you’d have to somehow figure out how to make camps exclusive from the rest of the world. The only way I could think that would work but would make it horribly boring, just like any other mmorpg is create a player housing section of the map and just not have anything spawn there.
---
The game doesn’t have exclusive non-combat areas because the server only loads what is within the field of view of 24 players. The rest of the world is a world of nothingness until someone shows up. I like the idea but I would see it more damaging to put player housing zones. One of the things I like about this game vs. all the others is that I can put my base almost anywhere I want.
---
I'm after knifes. Lots of knifes. Quick knifes. Vampire knifes. Furious knifes. Serrated Combat knifes. Knifes with swing speed.
---
Two shot is pretty sought after. Just because something is one star doesn't mean it's trash just like not all three stars are valuable.
---
Just like one would sell food to Vendor Bots, I assume it will spoil at the same rate? And since they're going to be inside your inventory maybe perks help it from getting spoiled quicker? I don't know? I guess we can always do a trial and error test to find out? Haha
---
I feel your pain
---
this is great advice.... \*thumbs up\*
---
Just on melee or every weapon type? Can you pick up a rifle and try it and see if any difference?
---
Best to be careful around jittery deathclaws. 😄
---
Is this sarcasm I’m not picking up here?
---
I think it's the same fermenter bug or it's just something screwing up the server and it not game related.
---
Either way, what can I say, other than, F.
---
Heavy Lasers are so not powerful enough. Did this patch fix that?
---
Faught a scorched beast with Graham on 62 once... the good old days
---
To confirm I got the mod off modus weeks ago and am still not able to attach it to my xo1 helmet.  I get the same error.  I get the attaching sound but no mats used and mod still is not attached.
---
I suspect it may have to do with a glitch that it is requiring perks but just not listing them as a requirement.  I will be testing out a few things to find out for sure.
---
This past patch notes they specifically said players are exploiting legendary armor builds to become UNKILLABLE. It literally says in the patch notes this was an unintended exploit. Not only that explosive shotguns were the only weapon in the game that still did DOUBLE damage - that's without any perks. Guys you do realize there is a difference between being good and exploiting mechanics. Saying "oh well power armor isn't for pvp" is a piss poor excuse. Based on all of the patches and updates today clearly players were not meant to go on a PVE world, waste workshops without a bounty in one hit with explosive shotguns and then turn around and be unkillable because they exploited a game mechanic. That isn't skill its exploitation. Which is arguably it's own skill - but don't you dare tell me that being unkillable in a PVE world picking on people who don't even want to fight and couldnt fight back if they wanted to is in the realm of "good sportsmanship."
---
Can you sell the treasure maps in there? Still at work so I can't check.
---
There is a new tab next to your floor decor called Vending. First one is free, the others require skins from Atomic shop, just use first one. I hate how ugly these machines are and how big they are
---
Only had two crash to desktop within a hour of playing while it didn't happen lat patch.
---
How do you even know it’s because of vending? You’re just assuming because you sold something right before your connection was lost, but perhaps it has nothing to do with vending. I don’t know, I’ve sold items and never crashed so far.
---
It's free for you because YOU personally don't have to spend anything else to play the game, so yes the DLC is free.
---
It does take up camp budget which totally sucks.  I may need to tear my house down just to sell shit.
---
You just make it dude
---
Don't have fermenter in my camp. It's a pvper base so it's very small and mobile with just the bare necessities that had a vender slapped on the side.
---
For the next patch, i’d really like a feature where the first person to roll up to a camp with a fusion generator, should be able to loot that thing for themselves, once every 24 hours, and you cant take your own fusion core, if this happens maybe it’ll be like a 2 nuclear material ‘repair’ cost, since it WAS generating power to the camp...? It’d be one of those ‘small things’ i keep seeing you all talk about.
---
I don’t know. I have the topiary and no idea where they came from. The only thing I bought today was the globe lamp.
---
Guess I’ll find out if they really are invulnerable now...
---
So You automatically know it?
---
Its free in the atom shop
---
Wait, is this game good now?
---
The terminal is free in the atom shop.
---
Come to my shop I just listed the extra 500 .45 rounds I had for 1c a piece earlier coincidentally lol.
---
For sure. I hoarded because i didn't know what to expect, but id rather not have a broken economy for some quick gains. I was really hoping for some kind of reroll system though, and being able to pull the lever a bunch of times right off the bat.
---
I meant it's the same bug that happened with the fermenter.
---
I’ve noticed that sometimes I can and sometimes I can’t. Also noticed stash is super laggy. Maybe related to everyone diffing through their stash at the same time?
---
I do like your idea of a bow though.  It's quieter than a crossbow, one of those weapons where the ammo may be the important part of it.
---
Maybe explosive tipped arrows like in Rambo 2?
---
You just need fire flies ? There is a spot up north that has them ..
---
Ahhhh.  I was thinking I needed to complete the campfire story three times.  Thanks!
---
FYI: a whole pile of lvl 50-250 players failed it.  I only saw it pop up that one time, and had no idea what went wrong.
---
What system do you play on? Also any sb will have a chance?
---
The buffed everything last patch but we didn't get accurate details on what was buffed. Some turrets had +100% damage and others were like 20%
---
Buddy who I was playing with was able to log in just fine. Maybe its a coincidence but seems off that as soon as the items/cap started flowing the server dc'ed and I alone am locked out
---
medic was pretty easy.
---
but 3rd one gonna be hell
---
Yeah you can craft it as floor decor but it doesn’t count still. It’s bugged of course. *sigh*
---
Disable the crowd boosting for the machine and put a cool down for each person on each individual machine
---
Heavy guns should have higher dps...they pay for it by eating ammo and being less accurate... A shotgun is a close quarters weapon and should be used as such (i.e. indoors...unless your duck hunting).
---
Was there a work around for that, or do I just have to wait this out?
---
Not sure why this isn't a main subject at the moment and people praising it all.. Happened to me to.
---
The machines themselves take a small amount, and each item in the vending machines also counts toward your camp budget.
---
gimme my radio station back then
---
Indeed, we're pretty much in agreement. And faction specific CAMP assets would be great. It's not that there's too much CAMP stuff in the ATOM store, but that it's where the majority of new additions are placed. Building, despite being a new core addition to the franchise, is getting the shortest end of the stick by being so aggressively monetized while PVE/PVP gets a "no transactions" guarantee. I honestly thought the "no pay to win" promise would apply to base building, too, since building assets are part of the core gameplay in a way that outfits, emojis, and icons are not.
---
This reminds me of working retail and having to explain multiplicative discounts to customers. 
---
"No talking 50% off of an item that is already 50% off does not make it free ma'am."
---
Ah yes the all knowing dev's that certainly have never made a mistake before /s
---
Yeah I made the habitat and it didn’t count.
---
How strange is it that I never noticed they were diamonds and not stars.....
---
I know this spot!

---
I completely missed the gnome though, that sneaky little perv.
---
I thought something was different. I was like, "This isn't normal," but I couldn't place my finger on it.
---
there's more for a challenge than the exam
---
Looks nice! I've been on the fence about demolition expert myself - might need to start using it now that patch 9 fixed explosive shotgun damage.
---
I live in the bog so it is pretty rough. I like the combo of laser/rockets because it seems like the rockets stun/cripple enemies buying the lasers time to work.
---
Most of the spawns at my place are distance fights for some reason.
---
I got to where I just wore the clown suit all the time and even, hoarded a pile of clown suits and hats thinking that everyone is gonna want this Damn outfit just to try and make that quest go away.
---
Or if it was like eBay and you could search past sales of items... that would be very good for the economy!
---
Ok but the MOTHMAN MASCOT HEADS
---
I don’t know how I’ve made it to level 100 as I never bothered farming for legendary items until recently. So my 3 star weapons might be useless then. Where can I find out? I just use the weapon and if I don’t like it then I just sell it to a vendor. What amour is good as I have so much?
---
Yes, I also got stuck twice today going around checking people's shops.
---
Really bad question, but which bot in WS is from the enclave? Assuming there is one there
---
Sure, I remember. I also remember how many levels people got, how many legendaries they got and had an advantage over players today. I still praise them because this game was nearing extinction and they were able to turn that around. Keep in mind that people only paid for the game itself and they are continuing to push out free content, when they could charge for it. There’s always something and someone to complain about. But sometimes it’s time to put your big boy pants on and say good job to the team that has been trying to filter through the mind numbing negativity to find actual issues.
---
They get beat up enough over idiotic things and they get beaten up for things they deserve to be beaten up for. But at the same time, those players should praise them when they do something right. Some of us prefer not living in a world of negativity and some of us don’t follow the complaints of youtubers. No one needs someone to tell them how to feel about the game. If it’s that bad, then don’t play it. Move on to something that fits your enjoyment. After all, isn’t that why people play video games?
---
ah well, more stash space once you clear it
---
I noticed that the first time you log into a sever and go to a player camp you get to inspect one weapon. Then after that it doesn't work.  
---
They need to fix this quick as I missed out buying some weapons and armor cause I could see the effects. 
---
People need to upvote this thread so they see it.
---
Yup, this tells me exactly what I thought.
---
Player vending is going to really screw with the artificially inflated online economy. Players that aren’t interested in Min/Max builds are going to be selling golden legendaries for pennies. And once the word gets out you can grab a bloodied, two shot, etc for a bargain with a little patience and player vendor hoping no one is going to be buying them for 3 accounts worth of caps anymore.
---
There isn't a bot fron enclave in the WS.
---
Not solely but PVP has been part of Fallout since Fallout tactics was released in the 90s.
---
RIP to my C.A.M.P. on that road.
---
Oh god could you imagine postapocalyptic IRS?
---
Where are the vendor bots at Whitesprings? I went there this past weekend and didn't see them, just the few in shops on the main floor
---
only for typewriters
---
They don't need to be all knowing to be the ones making the decisions.
---
I am asking because I was one of the dummies that lost mine

---
Deathclaw and cat topiary items are in game... no clue how I got them though.
---
Go to the market on reddit and see what people are buying and selling.
---
That's sad
---
Yeah I did it too, won’t work if you already did it for me. Ridiculous. Can’t do that or the herpetologist. (Which I only have the habitat to build, and have built)
---
True, but not the ones u submit to the machine
---
I crafted one and it’s still not complete.
---
Waiting worked for me after an hour but other people were locked out for longer. I suggest you DM a community manager.
---
Each exam has its own section with different challenges within that section.
---
They’ve been fine for me. As long as it’s not like a scorch beast or mirelurk queen, they have done fine for me. Their accuracy sucks though.
---
It's the pool with no water. I took  the picture from somewhere above it
---
I had to take something out of my stash into my inventory to put something else in that i wanted to sell
---
Ty for the heads up
---
Armor is a lot less...  3 v 5, etc
---
Don't suppose the created and released wood armor plans?
---
Kamen raider: What are you?
---
Mothman: i'm you but stronger
---
I guess I will have to test this with some spoiled food.
---
&gt;The following Adjustments have been made to the rules of Workshop PVP: Workshop owners must now enter the bounds of the Workshop before they are placed in PVP with the contesting players. 
---
But if you aren't present, you can't be hunted down and killed elsewhere on the map. I imagine you just lose the workshop to the player that contested it. At least how I read the new update. Just curious if you are present but in a defend event can it be contested?
---
Did you put all the ammo in the vending machine at once, or in chunks?
---
I’d imagine this is related to everybody digging through their stash at the same time. Hopefully it will pass once things are set up and it’s not so crazy.
---
We get it rambo
---
I understand, but I think you should not pretend it’s a bug unless you have strong evidences. Perhaps it’s linked, but for now I don’t think we can blame player vending.
---
How about the other way around? Do you still lose damage resistance when your armor is under 100%? 
---
If so...F!
---
Thank god because I was thinking of making a trading post in the golfing green area so as long as I can still do that I’m happy
---
Please let me know if it happens to you too, I'm still messing around with it hoping they will show back up.
---
Yeah, sadly I read that too.  I do hope they reenable the functionality.  
---
It's fun to mess with fellow players (not grief).  Good natured ribbing and such.
---
I’m trying to figure that out myself. I’ve done some of the exams and the archery test and nada.
---
Np :)
---
Sorry for your loss, but this is a great PSA for the community. Guaranteed you won’t be the last to do this.
---
You need to complete 3 of the World quests for with the scouts
---
Some nice camp set ups out there!
---
Next to the Skooma shop
---
I dunno, do they have separate item counts
---
RUN AWAY!! RUN AWAY!!!
---
Honestly I have been a supporter but was miffed abt lack of community - I think the vending machines is the single greatest mechanic they’ve introduced to the game. Looking forward to playing tonight
---
So i need to build 4 vending machines???
---
That's ridiculous
---
WHY make a post asking me WHY I MADE A POST!
---
Example: If you need 1000 caps for an item, multiply it by 1.111.  This will give you 1,111 caps you want to charge for your item. When the machine takes it's 10%, you will get 999.9 caps for the item.  The game should round it up to 1,000 because it does not deal in percentages of a cap. So multiply whatever price you want by 1.111 and use that number.
---
You mean the 200% thing? That was way too cool to be intentional. 
---
What's funny is that we were all convinced Grognak's axe was broken.
---
What world quests? Are they different from the three given?
---
PC as well
---
I was going to go rent how risky that is, with how expensive they are to repair...
---
But camps are now resistant to player damage, so nevermind. 
---
Be sure you've got your starched genes equipped though.
---
Grafton vendors
---
Look in the challenges section under the World category
---
Ok I don't know the problem with the caps but I can inspect everything without issues now. I'm on ps4 btw.
---
They are mixed in within some shops. It's the faction vendors that they previously added; they just have their own counters now.
---
I had a couple of crashed. Also, crazy lag when interacting with stash and vendors. PS4.
---
Thanks, yeah really sucks. Id put some stuff in there that I wasn't even sure if I wanted to sell, but I wanted to have cool stuff in my store.
---
Guess we need a portal to Elswyr
---
I recommend it
---
Can you put the badges on your clothing?
---
Nope, had to delete stuff for the machine and terminal
---
Well i can't
---
It;'s an old problem, not with this update necessary .. I have a few stairways that refuse to be deleted on two separate camps, two separate characters. I moved one characters camp because it annoyed me so much, only way to get rid of it until it is identified and fixed.
---
i love it but..my shits all gone from my stash now
---
Yep! Bethesda Tax, better known as repair kits! Because your weapons are sure to break faster!
---
He should be stationary as is...he no longer carries anything rare so why tf we gotta search for him
---
Interesting. The patch notes today said they weren’t supposed to. I’m not a PA person so I wasn’t planning on testing it.
---
Anyone got pics of the backpacks that made the cut. Cannot find anything online yet.
---
Check challenges in menu, world section.
---
But dont do it, it is fucking nightmare. I hope dev who did this have some crazy nightmares when sleeping, because i will have from this!
---
Player vending is broken btw with caps not being distributing properly, and destroying bases has never been easier with monsters spawning after fast travel.
---
Feel free it ignore this though.
---
Its easier to put items for free In the atom shop to get it to players. There is no other way
---
I'm hopeful that this building will be a focus for the Wastelanders portion of the future map, and that they are currently working on testing ways to expand things without breaking them by doing the small increases to our CAMP size and adding things like the the punch bowl (that use a new system).  Some of the datamined images from the new patch had mailboxes in them, so it does seem like they are expanding things but not wanting to all out at once due to the amount that might break things.  Hopefully by the end of the year this game will have started to give you the proper flexibility you need to fully enjoy your playstyle (and get your money's worth =).
---
Easy caps. 
---
Make alts. 
---
Farm stuff on main, everything has value, but don't scrap 
---
Pass everything to alts and sell to vendors
---
Easy caps.
---
One trip through west tek and looting everything is enough to hit cap limit
---
When I read the title I thought "ah I think I know what this would be", but now the numbers confuse me. 
---
So here is a theory (as I am a software engineer so contend with these issues) ...
---
Theory: if you sold something for 10 caps and there is a 10% fee then no problem you get 9 of the 10 caps. However of you sell something for less than that then there is a rounding issue because there is no subdivision of a cap. If you took the total sale of 1500 and 10% of that it is 150 caps,, easy to do. BUT if you were totally crazy and tried to take 10% of EACH ITEM and cope with the rounding up then you could end up with a massive over charge. Possible?
---
Uhhhhh I am dumb
---
Okay thank you so much
---
I don't know man. Maybe just for once an update that isn't inherently flawed
---
I agree with the idea that since there are multiple, they might just be skins. But, of course, they may just be fridges with different functions. Which would be...interesting, to put it nicely.
---
Whut? I moved whole camp and nothing disapeared. Arent those items in your stash?
---
Stupid question, have they changed the caps stash limit?
---
you can still build on the outskirts near the snake
---
Although the vocal minority, there are many who want pvp in this game.  Get yourself a bounty and people will come to collect it.
---
If someone else buys me a Big Mac it wasn't free for me. They were just kind enough to give me a gift, which wasn't free.
---
Needing to do this myself, don't have any friends online lol, I'd imagine finding water that doesn't make you swim.
---
I was definitely in survival, I looked at the map and saw the leaderboard. Odd that the survival challenge activated in adventure. I've tried to complete a survival challenge non adventure mode and it didn't do anything. Maybe that's changed, or a nice new bug? 🤷‍♂️
---
At most thirty people on a server. Fail to see the problem here. Just have a button to turn it on and off
---
Not ﻿Not yet, hopefully they will soon
---
I make my daily caps (if I have space for caps) vendoring the garbage legendary gear from 2 or 3 runs through whitesprings.
---
I shot a sheepsquatch point blank in the face with my tse combat shotgun. The damage hardly registered on the meter. RIP.
---
They only list not taking damage from players, critters i'm guessing can still damage items, and not to hard to lure creatures over and let they destroy stuff..
---
Just have to relist them. They are in your stash
---
Server Stability comes first, but i understand your pain.
---
I need someone to do this with, guy I was trying with had to go off
---
I don't know man i gotta try again and see what happens
---
I never once actually saw this purported buff when repairing to 200%
---
Yep, me too. I've had real swimmers before (they were moving like they were walking, but perpendicular to the floor), but these moving sleepers are very unnerving too!
---
IGN is Ryanc229
---
*cough* stash limit too *cough*
---
No, because I haven't been on yet. But thanks for stopping by....
---
Nice one
---
But if this was EA...uff. Idk man lol
---
It's hard to believe they didn't iron out stuff like this in the extended QA period.
---
I have tons of those.  If you're on PC and want some of this mountain of garbage 1 stars, hit me up.
---
Can't inspect items though so no idea what 3 stars have on them.
---
im pretty sure you dont though, ive been dissapoint by no items in stuff my turrets gank
---
You're kind of a prick, dude.
---
Yeah I never even put the large mag in the gatling gun. Heavier, worse durability, for what? The gun already takes like 3 minutes to empty a magazine. I don’t need to fire 6 minutes continually.
---
GOLDEN MINIGUN!!!
---
Aaahhh crap I better take some things out then lol. Thanks for info!
---
I think this is a great feature and the limits are fine. Just going to think twice before fast travelling to each vendor as some are just very disappointing; asking thousands of caps for shitty legendaries or fairly common pieces of armor.
---
There is still value in them. BoS outfit plans have fetched me an easy 5k caps. It's a great source of power armor plans. I've found about 30 excivator motion assist servos. Worth doing. There are a few sites that list all the locations. Focus on savage divide, mire and bog.
---
I'm also looking for it and I've tried to see if medical vendors have it. But haven't found it yet
---
Yes. Forget where I saw that but yeah, it should just be in your build screen in the camp.
---
My camp issues consist of everything either intersecting with something or floating, when it clearly isn't, ie roof/wall pieces.
---
I kinda did that, I did a store all junk then wondered where certain things had gone. Took me a few minutes to realise what had happened. Very glad I didn't scrap though.
---
I heard if you sell more than your allowed caps amount, you will lose caps?
---
I got a TSE pump action shotgun with 90% weight reduction for like 500 caps.
---
claim as many workshops as humanly possible and just bounce back and forth on the defending quests for each.
---
Definitely not buying that 3* when 2*s are total unknowns. Already passed on some possibly great gear.
---
I think, they random spawn but new gad, in the dry river bed below the workshop, it may take some server hops
---
On ps4 it's R3 or the same button you inspect your items with :)
---
go to the spruce knob campgrounds and equip a swimsuit. then swim to all the buoys and swim back to the intercom. the intercom is at the edge of a broken pier
---
Go to the Welch train station.
---
When you load in you'll be facing the station.
---
Take the stairs up the hill to the right of the station. There's always a cat by the building up the stairs.
---
There is a buildboard along the road near 98 NAR Regional, that has a bunch.
---
Adhesive, Aluminum, Plastic, Lead, Screws, Steel, ammo .45 and PA plans
---
Yes i know how to inspect a weapon but it doesn't work
---
That’s exactly why it is outside the camp border and on the ground, since you can’t build there you can’t have something there to get stuck on.
---
Go to your "World" challenges in your map screen and scroll down to the bottom to find the merit badge challenges. You have to finish three.
---
I’ve seen a few really cool ones!! They put me to shame tbh. 😅
---
Other people are spawning different place than us..
---
There's one near Lewisburg in the ash heap, at a trailer going up the mountain.
---
I wondered what would happen with ammo and selling things for one cap. 
---
Don't know why they didn't introduce bulk ammo.
---
Sweet! That’s where my shop it
---
I've always loved the game.
---
Something about this patch just makes the game feel more full, more complete let's say
---
Probably player vending really opening up interaction with other players and new methods of trading. You no longer *have* to go on Market 76 or FO76 Bazaar to find what you want. Just hop between CAMPs and see what people are selling. If you don't find it, go on a sub, find it, go to their CAMP and buy. 
---
LSS, double yes.
---
Yep it’s seemingly bugged for everyone :/
---
I'd still like a "Relinquish ownership" prompt for maybe when you click on its map marker
---
Even junk legendary stuff might sell once we know exactly how the purveyor works.
---
I would drop the fusion cores to 75 caps and the keycards to 50.
---
Bethesda game. Not inherently flawed.
---
Pick one.
---
I know i already did them. So basically im stuck.
---
Murgle, the orange cat, is usually down by Welch Station - there’s an empty shack, and he’s usually prowling there somewhere
---
We'll see.
---
A way to get caps from players without having to kill them first? I'm scared of the future.
---
Agreed by far, they hit those high hopes I had myself for fixes and additions to the game. 
---
One thing i look forward to next is the ‘force start a new character’ thing for survival mode, everybody on an equal level from eachother, for the time when it would be implemented that is.
---
No this is more like someone else bought themselves a meal at mc donalds and that tally up to the customers in that store (including the one who bought a meal) getting free chicken nuggets
---
be careful, majority of the time the skull radscorpion finds and kills me first.
---
That sounds promising. Maybe my OCD can finally rest in peace
---
You can collect a frog from the pool at Whitespring Golf Club. But the challenge is bugged.
---
Add me pacifichero45 logged off a little bit ago, down to do this relatively soon
---
The player will spawn close to were they move there camp. Other players will spawn close to where the camp was originally placed
---
That's a new thing, I think. There's a fifteen seconds countdown if you fast travel near enemies- you just need to wait.
---
Yeah or if could just like sell 1000 rounds and then set the price not for each round but for all of it
---
Gnomes vs vault dwellers confirmed!
---
This would be great if they did it in future. The perfect way to implement a visitor's book or something! Especially now that, with player vending, we'll see many more players visit our homes.
---
Seeing other posts about this. Seems to be a visual glitch only. You are getting the correct amount of caps, it just isn't showing the correct amount of items sold
---
Two easy ones so far: Athlete and Archer. For the archer repair, dont make your own crossbow. Go to the Windinf Palace and take that one. Its already damaged. 1 repair. Dont have any perks that repair higher than 100%. Shoot a couple enemies. Rinse repeat for the three repairs. Rest is self explanitory.   I just want to know wtf a frog habitat is in The Herpetologist one.
---
Ok, have a good day!
---
I think if we wanted a home he would have one already, and maybe a community of like minded super mutants to call a family. I imagine he likes his nomadic life style of excitement and adventure. Plus, randomly encountering him is always a plesent surprise.
---
Woo :)
---
how fast it is?
---
Great find! I'll be on the hunt for more sales tonight.
---
I was giving the frog habitat for a quest reward but have no idea how to use it.
---
From all the hate this post got because of “they want privacy” I don’t think they will be doing anything about it
---
I really enjoyed looking around some. Love some of the camps. Some folks have gone all “building for realz” and some are more “scavenger chic”
---
Or just make the new event at the camp fire. Lots of bugs, tics etc there. If you do it before starting the daily, all you have to do is wait for the gutsy to finish his lines, interact again and you're done. 
---
Don't forget to equip butcher's bounty for more tic blood.
---
They were deactivated, but if you had something in the bowl prior to update it is still available, but you will not be able to put anything back in the bowl. I found this out ad I had wine in mine today when server updated it was still there a traveler who passed by picked it up and I wasn't able to add anything back.
---
Praise be
---
This had been my number 1 requested fix since I made my first character. So glad they finally got round to doing it!
---
That's what i thought just now. Because it said to me all of my ammo is gone but there's actually some left. Well that's better but it's still a bug and i don't know what the guys of Bethesda quality control are doing.
---
I'm on PS4. Thanks though.
---
Yea it happened to me too except the quest is just gone from my data page altogether and I can’t restart it. Straight Bs
---
I was hopeful when I saw Heart of the Enemy addressed in today's patch that they addressed Mire dailies...nope.
---
So I got a snores recipe from the scary stories event, I forget what it's called. I did that before I even started the scout quest. I'm not surprised that some of these challenges are bugged, but it seems that new event may be connected to finishing the challenges in certain ways.

WHERES THE LAMB SAUCE
---
Just don't encourage them buy spend any of it on repair kits.
---
I believe there are two different versions of the camera. There is a "broken pro snap camera" and there is a "broken pro-snap deluxe camera" the deluxe being the one we can actually use. I noticed this once the camera was released and found other scrappable ones
---
10 x the price you want ÷ 9 =
---
Example.
---
You want 100 caps for an item.
---
100 x 10 ÷9 = 111.111
---
You will need to set the sale price as 111 caps (as the in-game system doesn't deal with decimals and rounds up).
---
I wonder why they removed it. Guess it was too much for the servers, somehow?
---
Yeah i think its the jar thing that you make hnder science projects in the chem station. I made two of them and captured three frogs. Dont know or doesnt say how to combine them.
---
Where to done the final examinations?
---
I'm on ps4.
---
Grafton prison has a lootable weight yard
---
TIL "topiary"
---
Not me. I wanna stay sharp. xD I mean -- we're all probably gonna get ate by something regardless, so I guess everyone should have fun while they can? Marinate yourself in alcohol. Be tasty.
---
Haven't had a chance to look at all the changes yet. Did they address the stuttering some people are still getting?
---
Well they allegedly fixed the wendigo / clown costume today.  They also addressed Heart of the Enemy not starting.  But I just checked in on the Mire dailies..nothing.
---
Even the Vikings succumbed to free market trading.  Ikea is everywhere.
---
Dammit I sold a bunch of legendaries yesterday not realizing the legendary scrapping was coming today
---
Man, salt city in here.
---
You have to log out and log back in and if that Dosent work then go back to the computer and re-register and  you’ll keep your progress. Easy fix just dumb to need to do.
---
Were you able to get the crocodile mountain one to register? I've tried every angle I can think of and it still won't count for me.
---
Yea it is a pretty good pic
---
You have to craft a jar with glass and bloodleaf, then capture a frog (try the whitesprings golf course pool) and place it down in a camp
---
That's another thing I do. If I see plastic in the real world i flinch to grab it then laugh my ass off.
---
Yeah, just going to avoid CAMP building until it’s fixed out of mercy for my blood pressure 😂
---
I have a suit.  I have clipboards.  I have my new RP.
---
"Hello Vault Dweller, our records indicate that you have not filed your taxes for..." *checking notes* "25 years."
---
Thats bad :( i hope bethesda will fix it.
---
Jesus, what a way to fuck up an explanation of an otherwise simple concept.
---
10 x the price you want ÷ 9 = sale price.
---
I just want a useful ironsight/ scope. Literally anything better than the box, which doesn't even use the attached existing foresight to aim with.
---
You scrapped them before turning in the quest, didn't you?
---
triggered
---
They wont, most of the toxic ragers quit after the TSE nerf. There wont be any backlash
---
Yeah I've experienced that one. This one is a bit different what it was is that I have a cave base so I have a block that blocks the entrance to the cave. I now no longer can remove the block but up until the servers went down today for the update I could
---
Yeah I just scraped half my quest items not thinking
---
Ah, thank you. This is much simpler for my simian brain
---
Nothing is coming through
---
Honestly I'm more excited about the deep pocketed raider ones
---
I noticed that it's not possible to fill it again but it seems that you still can drink from it - tested it on a vendor camp and got whiskey.
---
Glad i filled mine before the update lol
---
I tryed hopping Server, i will try it tomorrow thank you :)
---
Thanks so much I found him!
---
Thanks. They also mentioned, a while back, getting to use junk as decor in CAMP. That would be a massive boost to the style. Here's hoping!
---
Yes to both of these. xD Everyone has a story about how one time the case saved their lives... "Lost 17 tapes or so, not the important ones, but that Radscorp stinger never touched me!"
---
Thanks i found him!
---
I doubt theyd ban for it, its not an exploit; it was just available by default.
---
Hmm, never did the event (on purpose), I'll have to check that again some time.
---
Spider-Man! Spider-Man!  
---
Does whatever a spider can!  
---
Everything's - going dark!  
---
"I don't feel good, Mr. Stark..."  
---
OH NO! There went a Spider-Man....
---
That's the solution, not the explanation.

---
Yeah I feel you. I am wanting to leave work tonight and check out the update. It sucks being an adult lol
---
Hmm ok for me it works. Sorry mate
---
I was going to say, it's going to be infinitely more convenient to just buy at a camp that you're visiting. I would pay extra for convenience if it meant not having to worry about using an external site, then friending, joining their world, etc etc etc. 
---
Also, is there going to be a charge to fast travel to vending camps? Otherwise travel agent just got nullified.
---
Here's the stuff I found
---
Yup I got that too idk what the new update did but I couldn’t place my blueprint either
---
Yeah  building in fallout 76 is kind of "special" I have had a similar issue before and had to move my camp
---
Devs love 100% repro crashes. Send an email to them with your account, char id, and platform
---
Every patch I look for the words "Increased spawn rate of Flatwoods monster" and every patch I sigh because they dont and I will never see that ugly bastard
---
Thanks anyway
---
If it keeps the wheels greased over at BGS, I'm more than happy to give them some more money.  
---
I looked at my challenges yesterday and saw that I crested the 900 hour mark.  900 hours of entertainment for a $60 pre-order is a fucking steal, not to mention getting Fallout 1, 2 and Tactics just for sticking around when the road was really bumpy.
---
I have made my mind up I am going to get on fo4 I've hear a ton of good stuff about. So that's a good suggestion
---
I mean it's kinda late now but for anyone else who's reading, you can find BOS fatigues(the grey military fatigues) inside of one of the tents by Thunder mountain.
---
I think it was added for everyone.
---
Fixed by teleporting outside of my camp and restarting the game. Gave me a scare though.
---
Is your red dot indicating where one shot has hit, or where an average out of \~100 shots have landed?  
---
What's the distance to that which you're shooting at?  
---
What's the crosshair (non-aimed) show for a size?
---
I ask these things because:   
---
The guns aren't going to put every round down range and hit the exact same spot; particularly on automatics (even slow ones like this civil war gatling gun).  
---
The area of impact (bullet grouping) is going to expand greatly based on distance to target. Closer = more accurate, far off = wider spread. (even while aiming)  
---
That will give us a baseline for the above, as we can gauge how far off it is.
---
But I won't be surprised if it's still off, given just how bad it *had* been. How it was ever that bad in the first place is a bit baffling lol They need to rotate the gun and also off-set it to the right of the screen. The primary issue seems to be they're not taking into account the huge drum magazine, which takes up a LOT of your view. So for that matter, pushing the gun out further will also help by making the drum appear smaller.
---
*\*prepares himself for mass amounts of salty downvotes\**  
---
Complaining about aiming while jumping is dumb. lol Of *course* it's going to render you unable to aim (easily), and potentially block your vision... This happens with the Lever-action Rifle, which I use the Tactical Sight for, so no real zooming like with a scope. The gun also blocks my vision. Granted, only while aiming down sights, but even still, it's not a "heavy weapon" either.  
---
This is why crouching actually **improves** your aim! Jumping while trying to shoot a gun is completely counter-intuitive. \*shrug\*
---
Pretty fast man. What specific type of I formation are you looking for? There is no fool proof way to just zap to 50. If you have 10 mules you should have a better grasp of the game and where to get exp fast come on. This is a bullshit question to be honest.
---
I probably farmed her half that many times and i got all of them. Either im lucky or your extremely unlucky.
---
Excellent. I can live with that till he has a chance to update.
---
Mine is always a Weapon, Cooking, Stash, Bed, and one of the two Water. The rest is for protection at the time. I'll be moving DeconStation outside with protection of camps. Junk an Farm is locked for me to build things I need.
---
Same, I built a cool CAMP right along that little creek on the golf course
---
Whenever I see enemies attacking a camp I'm visiting (and that is not new, it just migth be more noticeable now) I deal with them and repair what I can,if anything is broken. Today however I found a camp where a mutant hound had spawned inside a locked building, so there was nothing I could do :(
---
Am I missing it somewhere in here,  how come the excavator PA Carry weight bug still hasn't been fixed?
---
Second floor of fort Defiance I think.
---
I've had more conversations with players today then I've had since release, seeing all the camps is super fun! I'll be outta caps in no time and have reason to farm them and legendaries!
---
Maybe people wouldn't like to spend 5 weeks farming atoms just to buy 1 power armor paint
---
Not all of White Springs, Just near the golf course they said
---
That’s huge, I’ll check that
---
She won't get banned. Most likely the devs will remove it from the build menu (if it's not intended) at some point. So if I were you, I would build one as well so you can have it already without spending Atoms ;)
---
Pick a perk build and aim for it, save yourself some respeccing later on
---
Dumpers duping 3 stars to roll new - previously unduped combinations I'm guessing.
---
It seems to work, sometimes... like 50%, and it seems to either work completely at a station or not at all (on pc btw)
---
It's at the water fountain near the dome shaped gazebo halfway between whitesprings and the golf club. That particular structure I think is called the old spring house at Greenbrier
---
literally anywhere but next to the golf course lol
---
Buy something and find out Bwahahaha
---
Oh I sure did!
---
That’s why my actual house is in the sewers. Blocked off by a foundation
---
Yeah. Just found and planted that topiary before work! There’s also a cat one
---
That's bad game design... How do they get away with it? Oh... Look... People willing to waste money on it...
---
Dosen’t change the discussion because it’s still an in field advantage to people who have to go back to camp to repair. Plus the ones they sell don’t over repair to my knowledge.
---
Same, friend. Glad I’m not the only one. (But sorry for your trouble!)
---
Probably 20 hours, the same as regular vendors.
---
I made most of my stuff below the value in an attempt to get people to buy things.
---
I’m wondering if it’s something to do with power armour? Like the upgrades that give you a stimpak when health is low? Hmm but typing it out now that maybe seems silly 🤣
---
Got it already - look into Atomic Shop it's for free!
---
You can easily sell 556 and 45's at 1:1 and I will gladly buy shotgun shells at 2:1
---
I’d imagine same as caps for vendors, 20 hours. Guess we will confirm this soon!
---
You know game companies actually needs money to do shit
---
Too often, in between shots I'd imagine you'll be spotted and all nearby mutants will be alerted. Nobody can always hit the follow up shot.
---
That damage sounds great tho
---
Hmm, I definitely could be wrong.  I usually kill most things attacking my camp when I visit it so it's entirely possible that I may just be remembering looting stuff I actually killed instead of my turrets.  To be honest,  I haven't paid a whole lot of attention when it happens.
---
Is the state of the game worth coming back to? Haven't played for like 4 months. Debating redownloading it
---
Imposter sheepsquatch. I got the trophy for reviving 20 people there, and I play 100% solo. You just have to actually bother to pick people up.
---
Did you already play after update? There's a limit on scrip at the blender. You can't even change 4 3* Weapons
---
Sony is bad lol
---
Frog jar and frog habit
---
Excellent, I can still poison my customers :)
---
At least until I run out lol
---
Love it.
---
Two things.
---
1. I tested the turrets of a friends place. I shot them and he's pacifist. NO DAMAGE and no aggro! Yay! NO griefers!
---
2. My pet seems to be immune to being punched so another hooray. Let me know if anyone has a diff experience though.
---
Ahhh that's what it must be, yes. I did notice some of the booze in my stash still had the keg symbol. I suppose then visitors to my own camp migth end up on a little Nukashine trip of their own...
---
They are a set of questions from a pool for each one, having correct answers still helps narrow down what's wrong.
---
What?? You can't sell legendaries in the vending machines??
---
There’s a BOS vendor at Whitesprings too
---
What common perk builds are there. I’m not really sure what I’m getting into to be honest
---
Legendary!
---
Loving the patch as well buuuut we still don’t have camp refrigerators, sinks or counters and cabinets so I’m still gonna cry a little bit haha. Also...15% camp budget increase? Please?
---
I disagree the exams are a little slow but the badge earning is pretty much more than I expected. Adds robots to the map and mini events with repeatables.
---
Hoo rah
---
I've had a helluva day too. On the bus on the way home. Can't wait....
---
&gt;Don't get me wrong I love the game, I truly do but I am not stupid this game is just an incomplete mess and the fixing promises is just an excuse to delay the content and ship new microtransactions. 
---
That's really all I am getting at.  I've enjoyed the game, but for many of us who have been playing since beta, this is often been a painful experience.  Less painful now, yes,  but there's no reason it couldn't have been like this on day one.  And day one should have probably been sometime in 2019, as you said.
---
One of my issues with this game was never seeing other players camps. This had fixed it and i love it
---
Platform?
---
Oh that really sucks...  Here's to hoping today's update fixes it
---
Where can you buy the treasure maps?
---
Have them both, how you do combine it or place it?
---
Yeah, that's more accurate. But still points out that the nuggets aren't free, everyone else just overpaid &gt;.&lt;
---
Sigh
---
Ah should've stated, PC.
---
I definitely noticed this happening a lot today.
---
I believe the little foldout CAMP tool dictates where we spawn in, but I really have no idea how it works.  My friends will spawn into my camp at a completely different spot than I do.  I put my doorway where it is specifically because that's where I always spawn in, but they get stuck in my floor 90% of the time.
---
Can we buy mods from them yet?
---
The patch is also bugged: water and food use is now much higher than before, and the bloatflys which spawn in Stings and Things don't have any bloatfly glands.
---
No, not exactly. The amount paid by the left over profit from that day might only spare the free chicken nuggets
---
Go to floor decor and there should be an option to craft a frog habitat with a captured frog and a frog jar
---
Possibly to prevent folks like myself that have hoarded a few hundred legendary items on a mule character in hopes we could quickly offload them all into scrip ASAP... looks like it's gonna take a few days instead now.
---
Yep -.-
---
Only camp problem i ever had was my garage door stoped working.  Still doesnt, its been months :(
---
Hmm, with the last minute change to backpacks not working under PA, I wonder if I should try and change my build to not rely on PA anymore. But then I’d have to find good armor pieces and swap so many perks
---
Please! I need those calibrated servos and I’ve killed that queen so many times she now greets me by name
---
I spend countless stimpaks, wolf ribs, and 2mm shells to clear a compound out...dude, move in. Because in 20 hrs I just have to do it again!
---
Other players. I find a lot as well. The wendigo that shows up in the lower level locker room area of whitesprings golf club will often drop one. I think any boss with a crown has the chance to drop them.
---
I will know after I get home from work and update.  Currently have some friends online searching for the mod to test for me also.
---
I’m glad I decided not to hoard legendaries
---
Anyone getting a bug where two dotted lines appear in the top left hand corner of the screen?
---
I never scrap all junk.
---
Stopped when I was collecting the robot models (for display when it arrives).
---
I would stash the models, then go to a bench and scrap all junk assuming it meant all carried junk.
---
Found out the game scraps all junk on you and in your stash.
---
Since then, I junk each item individually.
---
Good thought. I'll try that.
---
the game should've been absolutely perfect and flawless at the start, what are you talking about?
---
It requires STASH space, not camp space as the item you selling are placed in your stash, not in the vending machine
---
Awesome. Thanks a lot.
---
I checked that, it had no bos combat armour mod plans.
---
Yeah I’m out on the snake on that stream and lake. Allows me to build hella crops and water for those in need. Also I have all the benches and shotgun turrets for a safe place for people to run to. Now that my base can’t be destroyed I can open up my decontamination shower for all to use.
---
YES please, where do we do those.
---
Ghoul shark.
---
No problemo
---
Another tip..wire them to a switch..you can turn them off when you get to max caps, also makes your camp disappear from the map..
---
Ah thanks. I didnt see any enemies that's why it didnt make sense. Ok so not a bug lol.
---
I got a mounted radroach from the dolly sods daily
---
I haven't noticed any difference in F&amp;W?
---
You can sneak up to them, if you're foolish or brave
---
That's a very good tip. Appreciate it 👍
---
Lol, I'm not a professor, just an old welder, but if you are happy, then it'll do I guess.
---
Go to challenges. Go to world or social (can’t remember which one) scroll down and you will see challenges with SCOUT at the start. You need to compete 3 of those.
---
It’s there on the right side when facing the door.
---
Nah its there, on the side facing the mine
---
Maybe you haven't received your default in game back pack through the quest yet. I think it's a skin for when you get your back pack.
---
Did you try the shopping mall one? I swear I saw some today. A whole variety of plans
---
Go to adventure mode? otherwise, yes - the other player will have to store them before you come near.
---
Did you already unlock the base backpack by completing the quest line. If not, I guess, that's the problem.
---
Awesome!
---
It's a skin. Need the original backpack.
---
It’s a skin. Did you unlock the actual backpack?
---
It's in the bunker
---
Will log in again and check, thank you so much!!!
---
If i understand that correctly. You must wait till daily quests resets.
---
It's also just thebiver all ease of use, hotkeys and smoother running rigs. Wouldnt be fair to consoles
---
Yes, this is an undervalued fix for a great asset.  I might actually participate in the event again.  LOL.
---
Well that a big ole bowl of gay....thanks bud
---
Check under World Challenges
---
Me big man me use survival me no like different approach
---
What is a shopping mall vendor? How is that the watoga guy?
---
Why complaining about jumping and shooting is not dumb...
---
I use a TSE gatling, if I get surrounded I use my jetpack to fly up and shoot so I don't take damage. I also sometimes use the jetpack to fly up and shoot over a wall.
---
First time I tried that today I couldn't help but laugh.
---
 No thats my pet cat dont hurt him! Lol ive had my camp there for a while now.
---
But on another note about alcohol, I'm unable to add items to my fermenter as it states my budget has been exceeded and I still have a quarter of my bar empty... is anyone else having this issue?
---
Definitely an added bonus.
---
Most of it is googleable
---
If you'd fast travelled in, you would have walked right passed it.
---
P.S. when buying from other players, 35-50 caps each except for bog, divide and mire. Those run 50-80 caps each. When buying from random people in world, it's easy to find people who sell them for 5 each or just give them away because they don't use them.  If people start setting them for just a few caps I'll usually ask them to set the last one to a few hundred if I got a lot to be fair.
---
Will log on and check now, thanks!
---
If anyone's selling 40mm grenades I'll pay 5 caps a pop
---
You know game companies sell their games to do this shit. Providing fulfilling content (paid DLC) even makes them a bit more money and adds to the longevity and success of a game.
---
Microtransactions however are there to make a lot more money than they actually need. Especially for a company like Bethesda. It's greed. And you all feed it. And for what? To look pretty?
---
Content Vs a pretty skin imo.
---
It always worked, it just showed for only half a second when you aimed, and the idea was that you take note of that. 
---
Still - yay :)
---
Oh 🤣 I was hoping a vendor had them...I need #4 and #10 for the forest
---
Must have missed it, thanks for the advise!
---
With a game full of bugs this is one of the bugs they wanted to fixed!? Slow clap 👏
---
Sexy build!!
---
Haven't looked, sorry.
---
I'm curious, is there anything in the game like a terminal, holotape or note that mentions Grahm?
---
YW. Hope that helps.
---
People just like to bitch because "I already spent $60, I should get all the new content for free!!!1!"
---
I'm digging this new change.  I had a guy try to take a very well-defended Monongah Power Plant from me, and when he failed to do so, he started sniping the fusion core processor from a distance since the missile turrets wouldn't engage that far away.  I started playing 'snipe the sniper' to discourage him until he finally server hopped away, but with the new changes, it won't be necessary.  They have to come in and take it and won't be able to grief the workshop owner when they can't get the upper hand.
---
You have to unlock te pack in the Pioneer Scouts quest.  Go to a train station and read the poster.
---
It uses your stash's space.
---
Maybe you just didnt get it displayed ... sometimes the games seems to forget to show things 
---
(for example, I already ran into 3 invisible ghouls today ... only got visible after they beat me down =(
---
Late to the game
---
Xbox
---
Selling legendaries in our vending machines is going to be an issue, if it does not allow us to view the stats. Currently you can’t “inspect” the item to see all the legendary mods, only the 1st one listed. Same issue when attempting to trade legendaries with other players, except with the vending machines you can’t just outright ask the seller what the other mods are. 😔
---
Behind the scenes. I can dig up some numbers if you like, but for example combat rifles have a much lower action point cost than handmade rifles, IIRC 26 vs 32.
---
Where you done the final exams?
---
My guess is that they won't let you sell anything less than 2 caps, since as you said the tax rounds up, so it would always be at least 1.
---
Actually with a good build you can beat 85% of people with armor and a handmade that you crafted at your own workbench. How is that pay to win?  I’ve had 35+ kill streaks in survival mode in power armor of all things.  Guess what?  Still called a cheater. But I ask, how is that pay to win?  
---
People are either unable to comprehend or refuse to learn the mechanics of this game and resort to calling others cheaters or exploiters by default and it’s actually sad.  Everybody who uses assassins sentinel themselves in pvp knows it’s basically a one to three shot kill if you know what you’re doing.  If you refuse to use the tools provided to you by the game to succeed that’s on you not the people who actually put some thought into their builds.  I don’t know about others but I’ve never been able to put someone down with green thumb or master hacker!
---
XB1.  Prime plans only have a chance to drop from higher level SB’s (80?) and SBQ.
---
I’m watching the clock! The fo76 reddit thread has been curving my urge to go home, and learning new stuff before I even get the update rolling!
---
Check the new tadpole challenges under "World" challenges
---
Did you see the poster for it at a train station or put one in your camp for free?
---
So next to where you go to start the quest the original camp counselor turn right and enter the building then make another right and you should see some terminals then take the exams the questions are actually hard and you will have to look them up.
---
Um so if i do three those it will be that last one in 3/4 part of quest?
---
Any of the pioneer camps will have terminals for this.
---
I am on fallout on xbox right now
---
What are they for?
---
you can sell for caps.
---
Do turrets still fire at you if you holster your weapon?
---
@ Bethesda i sold 2 items as made 12,000 caps almost half of the limit and i still have over 20k work of items on sale. It might be a good idea to consider a cap limit increase now that we have player vending
---
I'm stuck at work - mandatory over time.
---
Yes. The items stay in your inventory as well so they do take up stash space.
---
Just teleport to workshops when people are wandering aroound normally and pay to assassinate them when they step into the zone.
---
Ofc I did the whole WS, nothing, I checked there first, then I started checking from the higher level areas.
---
Grafton vendor is the one as someone replied, I missed it because it was kinda remote.
---
I haven't played in about 3 months, since the last "Master List of QoL" post of requests. I needed the break from the game.
---
I should read up on the changes over the past 3 months, eager to play again.
---
yes and my suggestion is a way for you good sir or madame to bypass that limit by selling legendaries to players for scrip.  
---
see, once you hit the daily limit you could put the rest for sale for scrip, and then by the time the machines reset you hopefully have earned some scrip from other players.  presto, you now have earned more scrip.  
---
Neato, right?
---
Yes!!
---
Just a joke probably
---
Changing the layout of the most common shopping hub is not an Easter egg.
---
If you haven't bought one yet I have one that I would like to sell. We can trade for legendaries or you can offer caps :)
---
They didn't say it was too late, they just said it wasn't a priority.
---
Look, I'd be happy if I could just carry (or port) my characters between platforms like you can in GTA Online.
---
Yh i went to the camp and spoke to the bot but now i have to demonstrate pioneer values and earn badges but i have no idea how
---
For PvE melee is the easiest build to start with. A lot of enemies are bullet sponges without the right Legendaries.  FYI 3-1 point perks will give you a 30% damage boost while 1-3 point perk only gives you a 15% damage boost. If your going to use 3 points spread them out.
---
Handmades and Gatling guns are nice even the non-Legendary varients. 
---
From my experience you'll start off thinking you're gonna do a rifle build then you'll get a great max level Legendary Grog Axe or Super Sledge and have a tough choice on whether or not you want to move points around.
---
I've always played Fallout games as a Sniper but now I find myself a melee player because I got some good drops. 
---
PSA if you get a good weapon/armor drop you can't use because it's level locked hold onto it. Good weapon/armor rolls are hard to come by. If you're not sure if a weapon/armor drop is good. You can always post what you get on here and get good feedback on whether or not you should hold onto it.
---
I will agree with you though that being outnumbered is a huge disadvantage for any build.  One of the most important considerations is putting yourself into a position to win. Being outnumbered isn’t one of those and it’s okay to walk away in those situations.
---
Yes. As it was mentioned.
---
You can't build regular or improved kits with mats, and you can't buy improved kits, but you can get improved kits free from certain events like SBQ. So, basically do a handful of SBQ runs, and only use improved kits when you're out of materials and tight on time. Rest of the time, repair to 200% at bench.
---
Ok thanks
---
I’ve been hurting for more space for a while. Not even to go bigger and crazier, but to actually display the atom shop items I’ve purchased and other cool plans I’ve gotten. 
---
I get server instability, but surely it can be increased a little bit. I’m going to continue playing for sure, but right now there’s nothing I can spend atoms on because I can’t build it anyway. Seems like that would be a problem a profit-hungry corporation would want to fix.
---
The reason I asked is because I saw the Atom symbol on it as if she bought it and it let her place it, but she didn't buy anything.
---
do you mean from claiming the workshop?
---
i have, and dont have any of them completed. yet i have 3 out of 4
---
Don't know what to say. I'm going through a purified water about every five minutes of real time.
---
The enclave vendor was the only vendor not to be included in the WS expansion.
---
The "value" field isnt really what everyone uses. Mostly everything has an increased value based on the player economy.
---
Aren't they on the computers at the Pioneer scout camp?
---
Noice ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
Still, bought quite a few plans during the search, such as the missile launcher ones.
---
Yeah that's a really good idea, just him talking about trading, making comments about the environment he is in, and using those environmental clues you have to find out where he is. Bethesda, hire me.
---
Btw it’s a gazebo.
---
+ karma
---
Nope, from collecting all the bug pieces
---
👌 Ty
---
Most likely they want it to be something people need to work towards. Have something to spend time in game with. You know, save up the scrips to be able to one day use them to something good. Ofcourse at start people will have lots of scrips but will run out eventually.
---
Tags SevanM83 hit me up and I'll buy that plan
---
On the patch notes you have to make it to "possum" rank or something.  I haven't started the quest yet since all I've been doing is checking out others' camps via the vending machine.
---
Sorry to say I'm on xbox but need the same. Good luck to you.
---
I don't understand this. Doesn't that mean every time you fast travel to camp it happens to yourself? I must be missing something.
---
2000 caps so far give or take
---
The archery one? It’s past the token exchange machines, past the showers and slight up
---
Lol, I have 4 of those..
---
That’s because you did the other 3 tasks that aren’t tadpole world challenges.
---
Seriously? Never put it on even though I had the plans for it, if you are right then perfect.
---
I’m at 2/4 and don’t know how to get more either.
---
I’m at work for a few more hours.  Send you an invite if you’re on later.
---
Dafuq lol
---
I did it TWICE! I thought the first time it was just broken. Didnt even realize that it was tied to me scrapping and did it againnnn
---
Why is that? It's still good to have them saved and ready for the exchange. Less time to spend on running around looking to kill legendary mobs to get all those 150 scrips / day. Im quite glad i did save up around 5000lbs worth of legendaries.
---
Literally how?  I've spent weeks upon weeks trying different builds and tactics but it still comes down to getting 1-2 while dealing next to 0 damage.
---
Then again, it is coming out of a factory, so being properly canned isn’t too weird. It made sense before, but I think it makes more sense now.
---
XD nice, I’ll build in the ash heap.
---
Yup, we all are one fallout 76 family, until a guy with a TSE pump action decides to come and shoot you right in the back.
---
You and me both :(
---
Boi, you rich!
---
Gonna take a while. Only managed to get one of the 3 a scout World challenges yet. Each one required you to do 6+ things. 
---
You can buy a backpack in the Atom shop
---
What platform do you play on and what’s your name on there
---
You have awakened the gazebo!
---
🤣
---
Go collect moar
---
Keep doing this. Give them all your money. Please.
---
Wait really? It scraps everything in your stash when you scrap all junk?
---
Yeah my shotgun is useless now.
---
😢😢
---
I guess ut was shortened cus phoenix located in watoga shopping mall
---
Well atleast we don't have to farm 150 scrips worth of legendary mobs/loot each day (until we run out stored ones ofc)
---
I’m so happy right now.
---
Sold   a T51 jetpack torso.  Can build both the torso and the jet pack.  Sold bomber jackets.  Was surprised that someone actually paid caps for plans for an ultracite leg.   Sold it for 150 caps,  way below suggested price and way more than it was worth IMO.
---
yes. thank you, so much
---
Yeah, sony's excuse for no crossplay is that they don't want their PS4 experience being ruined by other consoles, which is a shit excuse if you ask me.
---
There should be a warning. Just like a “hey dummy don’t scrap it all at once” pop up would be swell. 😫
---
PS4 and my PSN: MemezLord777
---
I do also have a PC account which is: spylord777 
---
But I rarely ever use it
---
You can buy a *skin* in the Atom Shop.   
---
If they outright sold the backpack, this sub would've lost its shit.
---
It’s not too difficult, got one more objective left for swimming and I’ll be able to advance to the possum rank.
---
I did Archery, Athlete and Swimmer, fastest ones available.
---
ok sweet, haven't started the scouts quests yet. I was curious if there were new mounted heads with this line or if there were suppose to be more CH Monthly hidden somewhere.
---
I don’t have easy means to transfer, and stash management is key for me right now. I definitely understand why others have done it. But me personally, I am glad.
---
I've never had my stashed junk get scrapped. I scrap all everytime. I do believe you're mistaken on this one.
---
If you give me 10 mins Im down
---
Look at all the other comments about mods, or remove your mods.  
---
This will happen every patch.
---
Nice one, send me a friend request and we’ll get it done!
---
Happens every time.
---
This is my biggest issue. It’s sooo damn laggy. Even when in my own and no one is at my vendor so there’s no interference
---
I think the atom one is only the skin, or at least it should be imo.  Like I said, I have not even seen the poster yet to start the quest, so I have no idea what people are talking about lol
---
Mine is already right where your curse is on the bottom road, junk node ahoy!
---
Probably a mixture of both I reckon.
---
x 1 0 / 9  
---
x 1 . 1 2  
---
It's exactly the same number of inputs (5) and less accurate.
---
since you did the archery can you tell me where to complete the shooting test
---
Ah you meant as of the current patch? Yes then, they can kill you while you defend the workshop.
---
Speed demon?
---
Ive seen horrible prices everywhere lmao
---
Well, i mostly play solo so i had the same problem. Until i realised that cdkey stores sell game keys for as low as 8e. So bought a mule account :)
---
Sounds like a bug I'm on PS4 and as I said no problems. That really sucks as it must add a ton of time to the process.
---
If you listen to them, I'm pretty sure that they do have a home. We just haven't found it yet
---
All I can say is it does for me. At first thought they were just disappearing. Then tested it. Put in stash, went to bench and scrapped all items, went to stash and the models were gone. Tested twice. Happened both times. No longer scrap all. Not sure if it's a bug it was/is fixed but this is my experience on several occasions.
---
So I looked through all the hunting rifle mods and it turns out Bethesda only buffed the normal .50 receiver. All variants (hasty .50, refined .50, etc.) do the same damage as last patch. That's why you gets less damage from the pictured critical .50, since that receiver didn't actually get changed
---
I’m on console else I would do that
---
The machines use your existing stash space.
---
Yeah. I bought something from everyone I visited.
---
Need to farm caps now.
---
It’s at the pioneer camp where you join the scouts, just follow the past right from the fast travel point and you’ll find it along with a crossbow plan and a weapons workbench
---
My CAMP box is on a shelf in the chem lab, spawning there would spawn you inside the roof. Best to stick with fast travel mats.
---
Sounds good
---
Just friended you, will hop on as soon as I can
---
I lost my main character's house a few months back, when I got a message saying the space was needed for DLC.  It killed nearly all interest I had in playing this game.  And now my second character's house at the Whitesprings will be gone as well.  I didn't even own any damn turrets.  What incentive do I have to play this game if they keep tearing my houses down?
---
Topiary? Either I’m dumb or your not speaking English.. probably the first one. If you mean the rug it’s in the shop the mini figure one I think is gone
---
Honestly with vending I don’t have this problem now. I sold a lot of stuff today and freed up 200 space. Are you a vendor by chance?
---
Talk to the scout master bot, he will have you clean up sludge
---
I’m gonna give it 3 weeks minimum before complaining kicks in, trust me it’s gonna happen and not just a couple of dudes being loud it’s gonna be a lot of folk being angry at something and seeing posts about it non stop. If I’m wrong then my hope in this game and community may be fixed a little. I could just be an asshole here but seeing how this stuff has gone in the past I have no doubt things will change.
---
Just pics. Tell him/her to pose for us. Teach it a trick. 😜
---
2-3 TSE shots and all Zombies dead. Collect junks and proceed.
---
I heard somewhere that console versions are also super cheap online. Around 15e or something like that. I could be wrong since i don't pay attension to console things (not having one).
---
what games are you playing now?
---
No 😁
---
Done athlete, working on archery. How did you do the revive one in swimmer?
---
The grass deathclaw is under floor decorations. It's unlocked for everyone I think
---
It's why we don't hear about 76 in the other games
---
He means the shaped shrubbery.
---
Because i commented not a post....
---
Dung Beetle can move more than 1000 its weight.
---
The something pidgeon was hunted to extinction in 1900s
---
The human with the jumping ability of a flea could jump across a football field.
---
Topiary is a bush.
---
did you have this mission pop up early for you like a month ago , that's why my quest is broke
---
Look in challenges under the world section
---
I talked to him but all he says is about tadpoles being the blood of the pioneers and that my badge won't earn itself. I don't have any markers to clean up sludge either :(
---
Today
---
Ok....I'll look!! Tks
---
But Phoenix is the BOS vendor, and they have their own vendor as well.
---
Fermenter is based on stash limit, not camp budget
---
Sony seems to be pretty much against any gaming progress, they blocked console mods on PS for a long time too
---
Let's hope they fixed targetting hud then.. The old bug from launch where you cant craft it even if you have the plan learned.
---
I can help as well
---
Pretty sure it only uses STASH inventory space, not CAMP budget.
---
PSN longtrainrollin
---
Thank you very much for this. Was struggling.
---
Shallow water I believe, just added someone to try and do it so I’ll let you know the solution
---
Do you know the definition of PVP?
---
I don't think so. I didn't even know this area existed until today lol
---
Probably because we were all dumping nukashine in them xD
---
Got you added already, join on me
---
And to answer your question, it showed up in the misc. section of the camp workshop after the update. It has an atom shop symbol next to it, but it seems to be unlocked for everyone along with a little cat one as well.
---
Agreed - 250 rounds in a standard magazine, a fairly slow fire rate (compared to other heavy automatic weapons), it really doesn't need a bigger magazine like a minigun or LMG does.
---
Found it!!! Wow...didn't see all the extra stuff in the building menu.
---
I decided not to get one anymore. Thank you though
---
A deathclaw bush?
---
I do wish they'd put this on patch notes. So many players won't know this for months
---
Shit, that's a $60 diner if you drink water and don't have apps
---
Many people complained to Bethesda that their husbands spend hours everyday hoarding legendary lead pipes, Bethesda listened and put a cap on the daily amount they should play 👌
---
You are a hero thank you
---
I don’t know about you but I bought some crazy 3 star pieces for cheap cheap cheap
---
No problem. I was stuck on that too.
---
ROFL man less than 2 weeks to prove you wrong.  How does it feel?
---
Yeah I can and I've just checked a friend so can they. I mean they look amazing no complaints here but I definitely don't remember having them
---
Lmaooo I gotta keep looking, I keep seeing ammo for like 5 caps, serums for 2,000+ and one stars for like 600-800 fml
---
Cosole or pc?
---
Hmm, I don't think so. At least, I've never seen camps with it
---
I’ve probably bought the game again so far, there’s some decent stuff in the shop, but the most recent time was to just set a baseline number to keep building upon, which the camera challenges make pretty easy. It’s weird, i was unemployed for a few months there and relied heavily on the challenges, i had a few jobs on and off but until my most recent gig, the challenges were also easy enough to scrape every single one off the list  like 60-70% of the time, now they’re a little harder****^*, but i can finally buy atoms, and so i can just keep that baseline going to scoop a few limited pieces here or there, i only play by myself and the creation club was decent wnough so ill eat some skins lolol.
---
****^*(level up once for 10atoms vs. level up while high on mentats but you popped a jet-JET?!- 37 seconds into the mentathigh and also be leveling up while the 8th ring of a scorchbeast sonic blast hits a bell tower exactly 62 units away from you for 5 Atoms/jk)
---
What's your gt? I need help too
---
I am but my current problem was hoarding legendaries for the scrip. 150 scrip this first day wasn't enough to clean me out. I figure by Thursday I should be close to good..lol.
---
Yeah, sony just has no tolerance for anything that isn't their's being used on their consoles, a bit paranoid if you ask me
---
Lemme just level quick, I'm a butthair away
---
update your fallout76custom.ini if you are on PC. many new archives added to the fallout.ini and they have to match
---
Reread the text, Camp Venture not McClintock. I completed Athlete 6/6. The frog habitat is definitely bugged tho.
---
my camp still there
---
Using the trading sub if your upset
---
Watchmefly420
---
I'm waiting on the handmade skins, myself
---
I just finished this days ago and have been playing since launch
---
Did you talk to the one near kiddie corner cabins?
---
I understand that but it is saying the budget has been exceeded and my stash only has 400lbs in it
---
Thanks I couldn't think of that word for the life of me lol
---
Its gonna be a problem for awhile until people start realizing the prices aren't realistic.
---
I was gonna buy 4000, but I didn’t want to show off.
---
I agree but then you would be able to use everyone's camp as a free fast travel. I think they should just remove the tax or make it smaller.
---
It depends on why you stopped playing.
---
... I mean I'm listening to live streams in the background and I don't need y'all distracting me lol
---
I am really worried here I don't see any way that they could possibly fix this since characters think  We have already started the quest
---
XBox One
---
this gets asked quite frequently
---
Oh I see
---
Does it have more than 10 items in it?
---
Says at the top of it you can only place 10 total items, something needs to come out before you can jam more in
---
Cool, my gt is urlnightmares, I'm joining your server rn
---
Sick, I always wondered about that
---
Guys! Something wrong with shotguns, especially in pvp. I think it was changed a distance for shooting. After patch 9 i can not play in pvp as i did it befor, can not kill anyone from middle range, only have chance to do it from very close distance! Please, pay attention to the problem....
---
Scrip is not transferable period, which is great. Otherwise they might as well just use caps altogether.
---
To hell with the downvotes I'm glad I wasn't the only one who felt that was the most pretentious way to explain such a simple concept. My eyes almost rolled out of my head at the OP.
---
Do I seem genuinely angry to you?
---
This has been a problem for me since Fallout 4.
---
The non-atom shop terminals, too. It'd be kind of awesome to leave a diary about my totally normal Fire Breather slowly succumbing to wendigo psychosis.
---
The 500 Atom one? Is a skin? Oh..
---
I think it's a bug, but on my account I *already* have the Cat Topiary and Deathclaw Topiary unlocked and can place in my CAMP. Anyone else?
---
Also on another note; that black and gold fancy Minigun skin already exists in the game...
---
You bought a skin for the backpack you get from the quest.
---
Gotta work for it.
---
Had to delete a floor because EVERYONE was getting stuck in them :(
---
Nothing is in it at all...
---
Yeah, but Fortnite is a massive game that is one of the most popular games of the last year and a half, it's hard for them to say no when they have millions of people asking them to allow it. And with Fallout 76's reputation as a mixed review game, I don't see it happening unless Sony decided to allow all games to have crossplay. Maybe one day with xbox and PC, but almost impossible for Xbox-PS4 crossplay.
---
At least the modding community fixed it sorta in FO4.
---
Just browse the trade subs mu friend!!
---
It is funny how you get everyone mad just for saying the truth, a truth that we all know but we don't want to see. History tells us the one who thinks different always gets burned. Sorry mate, that is how the thinks are.  
---
I'd love to make people change their mind about a lot of things in this game, about how the companies are screwing us with this stupid "play now fix later" system, the microtransactions with stunning details but letting the game stay in some shitty way as when arrived, the pay to win subject that everyone is taking so easily while for sure it is a test try, how many time will pass until some premium vendor appears or some shit like that.  
---
I'm sorry, I don't really want to be this asshole who say this, but fuck sake people wake up, you are all defending a AAA company who shipped an unfinished game just with the name of "fallout" and you eat their shit, I say this as a fan I've been playing the game since the day it launches and i fucking love it but I don't believe the shits they are saying I truly don't.  
---
The only thing Bethesda has done right is creating a problem and selling the fix tool, sadly you are all buying it, even if you don't waste your money on microtransactions you are eating lies of a AAA company, wake the fuck up.   
---
you don't want to believe me?  ok, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LGIntG-jFA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8LGIntG-jFA) Try this.
---
check you challenges go to the social tab then scroll all the way to the bottom, there be challenges for the pioneer stuff.
---
You can browse the market subs, but heres a quick rundown.
---
Junk is usually 1-2 caps per unit, except rarer stuff like screws, springs, ballistic fiber, etc which can run 5-10 caps per unit.
---
I'd sell stims for 5-10 caps. Supers 10-20 caps. Stealth boys around 50. Radaway about 5-10 caps. Canned dogfood is something people want, also 5-10 caps.
---
Ammo usually sells 1:1, can't go lower than that in vending which is unfortunate cause the common ammo types like .45 and .38 go for less.
---
Basic common plans are 25-50 caps, rarer ones (weapons, armor, etc) 100-500.
---
I unfortunately cannot go into detail about ultra rare items, like legendaries, high demand rare plans, rare outfits etc because those prices fluctuate and are determined mainly by what people are willing to pay and precedents set on the market subs
---
I have 3, never been in a silo
---
Me too
---
Dunno if I feel bad for your marked up monitor, or if I'm jealous that I didn't think of that before this patch.
---
It would be too lengthy to get into here but if you’d like, take a screenshot of your build and DM it to me and I’d be happy to offer any help I can.
---
Yeah I only go into silos for the lead :) level 151 never launched a nuke
---
True. that was one of the few mods I used too.
---
Hallelujah Jetpack here i come!
---
Really? I can sell it for 200 caps :)
---
That money is going to Deathclaw preservation.
---
Yes, his name is Pompy. And I just listened to him say the correct phrase giving the quest markers to two other players... I wonder why this is happening. Even world hopping didn't work
---
How did you start the sunny top ski lanes course?
---
the bot babies are growing up im so proud
---
The friend displaying at the main menu when in game was happening to me last week. It's not a new issue. Need to close out all the way and restart the game.
---
Finally I can legit buzz lightyear cosplay now that my x-01 will have a jet pack.
---
To infinity AND BEYOND!
---
Just build them
---
I’m almost 100% positive you can inspect them.
---
Oh. That’s gonna make the medic challenge a bit hard to do..
---
That it is not a new issue is my concern.
---
Apparently it’s not in the game yet
---
You pay 500 atoms for the vending machine on the atom store
---
Just build them, in a new tab called vendor.
---
I can't agree more! I'm one of those players who *has* to know everything. Knowledge is power in MMOs. And when they keep omitting random things for no reason, it annoys me.
---
I like asthestics so
---
ooook
---
I hope you’re right.  It seemed like when I got the message I scrapped a couple camp items then it let me add another weapon to my vending machine.  My camp was at 99% when started adding things.
---
Nope. There is nothing like that.
---
In the workshop/camp menu there’s a new tab ‘vending’
---
How do you mean? I cleared out my 150 scrips for the day
---
Would that mean that let’s can get murdered too? Not worth selling then if you have a pet.
---
Fo76 has now become Animal Crossing.
---
Then you should go invisible and wait for him to try and get his loot, only to kill him again and eat his corpse
---
Can confirm Plasma is fixed too
---
Ahhhhhhhhh they fixed the Gatling Gun sight!?
---
Looking like Responders finally getting some much needed love, so I'm stoked.
---
Added you
---
pc
---
Must be OLD old because I’ve been playing for a while and never heard or seen it
---
Omg! Yes!!! Please!
---
Vertibird + reduce fall damage armor = fun times for all.
---
Sell your 3 star.  Scrap all the rest.
---
Buy it! BUY! And make me bleed from my eyeballs with envy ...
---
I sell excess drugs. Diluted anything gets sold to the vendor. Currently have over 300 stimpaks. Same with RadX
---
I had a few and wanted to do the silo quest and a level 150 player a few months ago asked if i was xbox and said yes then he helped me navigate to where i was supposed to launch for Scorchbeast Queen then fast travelled to it.
---
Told him thank you.
---
Couldn't believe how huge the silo actually was.   
---
Try taking the biggest hospital you could think of then put that underground.
---
It's hard trying to find anything.
---
I listed some random note from my inventory for 25,000... its just a joke m8
---
interesting, makes me install fo76 again!
---
Hmmm, have you tried turning it off and in again?
---
(Scrap &amp; reinstall)
---
Ammo has to be the worst thing, I hope there’s an update soon where u can set a price for bulk as opposed to just selling per ammo
---
It's not about the number of inputs, it's the fact that 1, 2 and . are much closer to each other compared to 1, 0, 9 and the operation symbols (At least as far as Android phones go, that may vary if you are using a different calculator). 
---
Also, it's arguably easier to remember a single operation and number compare to multiple numbers and operations.
---
Of course, 10/9 is more accurate, i'm not going to say that's not true, just that the 1.12 is also accurate enough as long as you are selling individual items at small prices (Like bulk junk and things like that).
---
I've went to a few train stations and still can't find the Legendary Scriping Machine. Is it at a specific station?
---
Love me some drunken new river floating.
---
PLEASE tell me there are no tests to pass to get into the scouts.
---
The boot camp missions and their ilk are the worst part of gaming. Those quests and whatever lies after them will forever remain undiscovered on my accounts, which is just stupid.
---
I am sorry for your loss, but that made me laugh.
---
I half materialized inside a wall at one vendor's CAMP.  At other places I appear right in front of the machine.  Fast travel mats would be nice.
---
Came with this patch.
---
People need to understand the current functionality. Visitors to your CAMP arrive in the exact center of the build zone. If you lock your doors and I travel to your CAMP and it dumps me *locked inside*, then you ain't getting any business on your Vending Machine buddy.
---
The sunnytop ski lanes track is the downward path that runs mountain/hill side along the elevators i believe (not in game atm to double check). There is a speaker and button to start it (like for every other track also)
---
Are those events?
---
The best way to get rid of excess ammo and to acquire the ammo you want is to just ask other people to trade in-person.
---
Every time I go to a nuke zone with the rest of the players, afterwards I ask for shotgun shells and 1-2 people usually give them to me for free because they don't need them.
---
&gt; **Addictions:** Are no longer cured by death. 
---
The most awkward combination of words today.
---
Daily challenge of mine; find a way to phrase it in a way which is not as bad as my attempt:
---
Cures: No longer addicted to death
---
Do sheepsquatch event
---
Maybe people will actually be reviving during that instead of waiting for peoples junk, lol
---
Well now I feel dumb
---
Pretty sure the Pale Rider PA skin that should be releasing next week is T-51b
---
I’m not sure how they are classified, that’s why I wanted to get this post out there. Plus the comedic value.
---
I just figured it out. I accidentally unmarked the quest LOL
---
I saw it was a daily and mistook it for the toxic barrels daily where all the mirelurks pop up
---
I feel like an idiot now. Thanks for your help xD
---
I'm not sure if I'm reading this wrong but by Install do you mean the update? The new content comes with the update which needs to install and can be up to 8gb.
---
Updates come every few weeks so if it's installing more than that it may be a different issue otherwise there is nothing you can do.
---
Did mine at whitespring
---
Supposed to be at all of them. Mine are missing as well
---
yep. need same help) ign: achalkov
---
It depends. If an ammo is in-demand, I'll set it a little higher. For example, .308, 5.56, and .50 Cal rounds, I set to 2 caps per shot. If an ammo is more specialized, like plasma rounds, I also set it a little higher. Grenade rounds and plasma cores are set to 4 or 5 caps each. Most others are set to 1 cap per shot. Fusion cores range from 25 caps to 75 caps per core depending on their charge. If I made Ultracite ammo, it'd be way more expensive at around 6 caps per round. 
---
Plans, it depends, too. Jet pack plans I sell super high, like 3.5-4k a pop. This is still lower than the in-game vendors but it's still a plan you basically only get from Scorched Earth so it's worth that much to me. Most plans I set lower than the recommended value, though. I had a couch plan that the game recommended to sell for 100 caps, I set to 75. Ultracite PA plans, it wanted to sell for about 500, but I set it lower because you can just go over and get the plans at Fort Defiance. 
---
Armor depends on the effect. I have one Unyielding sentinel 3* piece that I'm selling for 4k. The third effect is meh so I think 4k is fair, since a perfect Unyielding Sent piece, like one with AP refresh, would go for *at least* 10K.
---
I've yet to put a weapon up for sale in my shop.
---
huh, my "refined .50" does 170 (iirc) and my hardened does 160.  Seems the "critical" .50 is a variant that doesn't exactly deal more than hardened .308.    
---
Moral of the story is get to scrapping hunting rifles again cause I know for sure at least the refined .50 is a straight damage upgrade.
---
So far it doesn't seem so useful. I already know what i did or not. The other option is just for news. It says something about connecting to other players but i couldn't find anything about it.
---
No I haven't I'll try that when I go back to camp thanx... Happy adventures..
---
Are you on PC and use "No news is good news"? Remove the mod until it is updated.
---
I kind of wish the machine made a wood chipper shredding noise when you exited.
---
Give me some closure in that stupid 3* rolling pin I’ve been holding onto for a month.
---
Oh shit. I read the patch notes but until this post I hadn't considered how much more useful they just got.
---
I’m on PS4 and i need this too, my user is LethalLoli
---
No i need to install the whole game
---
I really wish pets had spawning items like the Brahmin do. That way I could catchem all.
---
Is this per machine at each station or is it shared between all stations?
---
Hold up, how do I redeem the other fallouts?! I totally forgot they said that?!?!
---
I'm not seeing the items increasing budget only stash weight.
---
Hey I can help but you will have to join my server as I have a workshop set up! My PSN is awheaton65
---
On Xbox, sorry should have specified that
---
Fair enough. Like I say though, It's killing the industry. They see people like you and they throw up a store with a load of shit to buy on release. But what's the sacrifice? Good releases with decent content.
---
All the major publishers and developers are doing this now.
---
Admittedly this isn't the only reason the industry is suffering. But it's definitely one of the main ones.
---
I understand that little kids wont get this either so you can't blame them. But boy those old enough need to screw their bleeding head on properly .
---
Is, is a mic that much of a problem ? Lol easily solved issues with one.
---
Shared.
---
Same, I just chased a Stingwing all over the place trying to melee it with my Power Fists because VATS wouldn't work on it. \[PC\]
---
how to you even make the frog habitat?
---
That was really fun though...
---
yeah we need this... badly
---
I have a small room in my home where i built my fusion reactor, and it has a locked door (for a lore perspective), and guess what: people fast travel in that very room so they are trapped. (when I travel myself i never get there, it's wierd)
---
What platform are you on? I’m on PS4 and get the drop pretty much every time. I too was in Westek yesterday and walked out with 6 legendaries.
---
Thank you! awesome answer and much appreciated :) at least I have half a clue now.
---
Uuuuh. Can you explain the formula one more time?
---
What how lol
---
I like you.
---
Awesome I added you
---
Added, I think the little bit of water in the wavy willards swimming pool would work, I was just there taking a picture.
---
Add 12% to everything, got it!
---
Pioneer Scout camp. North West of Grafton Dam.
---
It sometimes works and others times doesn’t
---
No worries, I would suggest then a file integrity check if possible on Xbox. I haven't owned a console since N64, so I'm not sure what else could be done.
---
Hard reset did the trick!
---
Wait til you see the swimming glowing ones in nuked WS.
---
Haven't played since the update, but I wouldn't doubt it's broken still. Guarantee you I'll still get a syringer.
---
I fed her nothing and she gave me everything.
---
It took a while for it to spawn for me.   But 10 minutes later I saw them at every station I came across after.
---
I'm on xbox. I heard rumors that it wasn't just me. I was just curious if anyone had heard anything.
---
Time to check out the trade subs, thanks mate :)
---
I had to hard reset the console
---
Can someone explain the purpose of the 10% vendors fee? Does that's 10% just vanish and if so how does that help stimulate the game economy
---
My take for Assassin’s weapons/armor a long time ago was change it up. Armor effect switches names to Bodyguard’s, same effect. Weapon effect keeps the name, but it’s effect changes to “ignore’s Bodyguard effect”.
---
There is a fast travel mat for workshops. No clue why it isn't in for the camps.
---
You were paying to travel already tho
---
Is there a limit you can get per day? I haven’t tried it yet.
---
hmm... gaame says you offline. i'll try to relog
---
Best of luck on the fix!
---
Merry adventuring
---
How about free transport between stations, taxes go to funding Brahmin drawn train car type deal, that would be awesome.
---
I am about to do the same. 
---
Considering the amount of time is play this game, and the way bethesda is going, I think it deserves something around 10 bucks/month, so I will soon take the big pack :)
---
Hmm I actually read your message as "not for everyone".
---
Ikr! Sum beach, I got another syringer...  😂
---
Can you like... kick the dev team into making sure they tell you everything in the patch? Off the top of my head already we have the WhiteSpring Vendor bots getting proper stalls, and MODUS selling X-01 Mod plans also missing from the patch notes.
---
I must be on a bad server then. Thanks for letting me know.
---
Right?!
---
Alas, now I have 40 on my character I can no longer easily spread the love, lol
---
anyone need a teammate for Kindness: revive an ally  on XB1??
---
im looking for somone to help me with that
---
There is a sign and a speaker with a button to press.  I started on the east side of the bridge for that challenge, the lodge challenge starts on the top of the hill, but will have many traps along the way.  The last challenge is the obstacle course near the fort venture exit.
---
Looking for this myself on Xbox - ChalkyLynx3840
---
+karma Thanx for the help it worked
---
This is the prime FPS-Tanking area though, anyone else find that? Maybe 4 patches ago, they made the golf course grass absolutely tank my PC.
---
Just install the game in the directory that was in and it will detect the game automatically
---
Ye
---
Usually 100~150 like you, ballistic fiber I have no limit for lol
---
Not really. Full inventory just takes about 15 secs to scrap.
---
True, very good point. They certainly have the base of support pushing for it. But I’d just add that playing favorites is no fun. Seeing only one game get this treatment sucks for all the other games that could use it. Like fortnite was proof of concept that it can be done. Time to allow it as an option for all other games as well.
---
Hidden
---
Will require a hot fix is all
---
#PULL THE LEVER KRONK!

It seems they do Tuesdays as their cold-patch days and Thursdays as hot-patch days.

I see your point but it doesnt bother me, I guess it bother cap hoarders but as I was once one myself.
---

Because acid.

TAKE THE GARDEN THAT MUST BE TAKEN!!!
---
The problem is by spending money on the atom shop, you are indicating to Bethesda that releasing a broken game and fixing it later is good, regardless of the hours spent in that game, and will continue to generate money.   
---
People in this thread are justifying their atoms purchase as support for Bethesda for the work they are continuing to do on the game, but that's work they should have had completed before ever releasing it. You don't buy a car, find out the steering and gas is broken, then tip the person you bought it from as courtesy for fixing a car that should've been working in the first place.
---
it works sometimes but not all the time
---
A fact people may not realize; if they do not have mics, they could use the x box app on their phone or tablet in lieu of a mic.
---
Choosing not to use a mic is fine, but don’t let “not having a mic” hold you up if you wish to use one.
---
Maybe you and I just celebrated holidays differently.
---
Does not scrap my junk in my stash when I hit scrap all.  
---
New Xbone
---
I also just spent $20 on some. This patch is great! A double plus Bethesda.
---
Looking for fixer plan selling screws , bloodied weapons and unyielding armour .. come and get it “sickies”
---
I got an anti-armour one. Being a ranged build I basically just use it for roaches.
---
Well idk.. There is a BOS vendor in there
---
Thanks a lot, now to server hop for a damn fox and I'm all set :D
---
I play solo and this is how I solved it
---
Besthesda, I am blown away by this update, it's amazing!
---
You guys must have put so much work into this, it boil's my tiny mind.
---
There is a but, so I'll come straight to the point!
---
The screen on the player vending machines is massively bright (PS4), so bright it detracts.from the various colours you offer the player vending kit in.
---
If you could see to just turning the screen brightness down in the next update, I think it would enhance the ambiance of the camp massively.
---
Love and hugs,
---
Me.
---
Kill shit
---
That’s a win :)
---
You’re welcome - hope it’s not a new thing and we all have to scrap the thing every time we want to craft...
---
The booze shstem(&lt;typo, but I’ll run with it) is one of my fave things to do
---
Don’t even use the alcohol, lol
---
Thanks!! I ran past it so many times haha.
---
Some guy was selling a two shot explosive handmade for 1500 caps. Picked it up in a heartbeat. I kinda feel bad for him.
---
yep, thanks for you too ;)
---
That's probably what it is. My CAMP never gets attacked while I'm away, even for hours on end
---
Too much probably
---
Hmm I think you are very correct. That Lowe basement discovery was still quite something for me. It was well made.
---
I know people were all incredibly miffed by the repair kit thing, but if we as a community all actively decide that Patches like THIS are what we want and as a response are willing to buy Atoms, I think they'll get the point pretty quickly. 
---
And since the data mining looks like Responders will be getting some love finally too, I know exactly where I'll be spending those new Atoms
---
It is a big hit. It takes me ages to take out a landed Scorchbeast or Mirelurk King now with my TSE Pump.
---
It is a severe enough nerf that I am 100% changing spec. I don't see why I would voluntarily suffer a range disadvantage for subpar dmg.
---
Yes, I believe so. I don’t remember the patch notes saying that they were going to stop that.
---
Then you haven’t been paying attention (it didn’t apply to ranged weapons)
---
Thanks friend, that's really helpful!
---
150. The rumor is it follows the same schedule as the vendor caps: 20 hrs.
---
Keep about 500 steel on my person, if I drop it, I drop it, but need so much of it to craft ammo, lol
---
Bunny hop should cancel the effect immediately.
---
I can fast travel, but I get Stuck at black screen like half the time
---
I’ve kept up with the list below, hasn’t caused me any problems so far

3-5 bulk of everything except 10 bulk alum, adhes, steal and lead. 50 loose everything but screws and plastic

But my TSE pump shotgun just became a TSE junk shotgun.
---
&gt;Note: Our previous article on Backpacks stated they would remain functional while wearing Power Armor. This was incorrect and we apologize for the miscommunication.
---
So... bait and switch huh? 
---
We couldn't get a correction during the weeks before this release? A day before this release as a buffer? Did I miss something or is this the first that we've heard of this?
---
i think the Hornwright industrial headquarters has lvl 2 hack computer, You must take elevator from the bottom of building and on the top of it there it is

how much is the paint

PSA: For people having these FT issues... Move your actual CAMP device. The position of your device determines the load location. 
---
It might take a bit of experimenting but you'll figure it out and find a good spot.
---
I haven't run or fast traveled in two months...can't wait to get on later.
---
Even more PSA: If you finish this by claiming Dolly Sods campground, you check off a normal weekly challenge.
---
Good old bethesda though. I just sold the gun right back for 40 Scrip.
---
But I want skins for ultracite, or too use my t51 skins on ultracite.
---
I had three people spawn inside my house and inside the floors.   I ended up moving my camp, to see if that solves it for now.   I’m going to have a few friends test out where they spawn at my camp.
---
God I hope I have too much time in this character for it to be broke now
---
It was very clear.
---
Duping glitch and Nukashine effects were to two biggest issues people were seeing.
---
Was wondering what I was going to do with all those shotgun shells
---
Damn i'm 100 dr weaker now.
---
I finished one but I didnt get anything, I assumed that badges are something else...
---
People will finally learn that my character 100% believes that he is Robin Hood living in Sherwood Forest
---
That is pretty plausible
---
If you haven't done it yet, I'll add you. IGN Dharb
---
I have a Level 50 TSE Combat Shotty with hardened receiver, no muzzle/compensator and a stinging mag-- nothing too exotic.
---
I have shotgunner perks x9, demo expert, scattershot and enforcer. About an hour ago I ran out to the ranger output, and there were two Level 50 Mr Gutsys. At medium to close range, it took about 5 shots to drop each one, which was very surprising.
---
I dont remember this weapon being that ineffective. TS was once something coveted, especially in FO4, but now it's essentually worthless due to the innacuracy IMO.
---
A week! I can burn thru that in a day.
---
I can imagine that will be on the shortlist now imo. 
---
I hope so anyway because the spawn at my camp is in water.
---
Did it complete for you? I crafted two habitats and it's still not checked off.
---
I can play in an hour
---
RIP automatic melee weapons, it was nice to know you, Ripper and Mr Handy Saw.
---
Do you need ALL those badges to get a backpack? 😥
---
I havent made mine yet, one second
---
Having all the known plans at vendors listed together makes me all warm and fuzzy. So many changes for the better with this update. And so far no crazy bugs..........
---
Well yes,  that would result in confusion.
---
As someone who plays from a raider type standpoint, which would be a reality in a post apocalyptic world... I dislike this update. I enjoyed defending my camp. I enjoyed getting normal people to test their mettle in combat. I enjoyed following someone back to their homestead to attack. It gave the game more fun and realism imo.
---
Before you say "lololol go to pvp mode", it is not the same. If I wanted battle royale I would play pubg or fortnite. Being a raider, a theif, a savage and outlaw in a post apocalyptic world was the most fun I've ever had in a game. Especially when another group would come to someone's aid and we'd be in a small war. You can barely get "wanted" anymore and be an outlaw like the game touted from the start. Nor will there be the opposite fun of bounty hunting, as the fast travel will likely cost more than you'll reap from the small bounties that are attainable. 
---
Being in pacifist mode should protect your camp, being in normal pvp enabled mode should not protect your camp.
---
Bethesda has all but obliterated a very cool aspect of the game with this update. It's now pretty much a collect and trade simulator, or a market simulator, or a base building sim. The pve content is a joke. Let's be real.. How many times can you run the scorch queen? It's not even exciting and feels like more of a chore to accomplish than actual fun.
---
Judging by the atmosphere in this thread I'll likely get downvoted to hell for posting my opinion but I really don't care. This game isn't about building a thriving safe haven trade community. It's about surviving in a wasteland. Surviving monsters, surviving other humans, finding out who you can trust or who you can't... Taking that risk that someone might find you out in those woods and take all you have, or hell maybe you'll take from them when they fall into your trap.
---
You've neutered the "wasteland" part of your wasteland game bethesda.
---
Well someones obviously not a hoarder. I have to admit I'm a tiny bit jealous.
---
Sure, if that’s how their coding is set up then it could be as easy as changing a line to false and true. But if their coding isn’t setup as an encounter for the house itself, I think it would end up being that they would have to revamp the coding. From how the game acts, it seems like the coding is on the character itself so it can trigger those random spawns through out the world. The base itself is attached to the account but is it truly tied to the player itself. If it was, I’d figure that you’d only be attacked if you, yourself spawn at the base.
---
The one big annoying thing about coding is the hypotheticals and logic. Changing one string can ruin more than just a spawn.
---
Or even the possibility of respawning them. Like you put down the Brahmin feeder, Brahmin appears. I repair my cat bowl with plastic and dog food, and my cat comes back. Poor kitties getting murdered and being gone forever...
---
I got bored and frustrated with this game a few months ago, and this is the patch I've been waiting for to get back in. Looks like tons of new content and the sweet sweet QoL improvements I was looking for. Downloading the patch now, fingers crossed.
---
I've been trying to do the atheltic one, but don't understand how to complete the athletic courses. I'm standing at the top of the one by New River Gorge and I haven't got credit. I don't want to get down until I figure out how to get credit...
---
Yeah you revive someone while you’re both in shallow water
---
That's the same way I feel about it. A while back there was a different game where I paid $10 for some premium currency to buy a limited time character after an update. Same night I also spent $10 to order a pizza so I didn't have to stop to make something to eat while I played the new content. That pizza didn't last the night, but I was using that character for months.
---
Do do, do do do do
---
i fully support the creation of this topic
---
I don't know much about this or why its good, can someone explain?
---
Ive owned workshops tons of times, but very very VERY rarely get it contested. Like only 2-3 times I think, and I just didn't bother if it was.
---
np :)
---
Did it open possum challenges for you?
---
It’s what the prices would have been before duping most likely, I’ve seen serums decrease so much
---
It's likely done by a grumpy modeler. 'You want me to fix this? Enjoy you m@#&amp;*'
---
I wish I could like this more. I've been looking for the archery quest point for a while. Had to stop for dnd. Thank you so much kind kind stranger.
---
You shouldn't work in your off time! =P
---
The good news for these people is that they won’t have to “close their doors” like real life if they don’t sell anything. They’ll either figure it out or abandon the player vending entirely. Commerce is not for everyone.
---
What tasks?
---
It sounds to me like its a nerf to the players that actually own the workshop in the first place doesn't it?
---
Know, it did not check off
---
Yeah, looks like it'd be fun.. and I do like lobbing 'nades
---
Setting up a vending machine on survival  mode seems like an awesome way to spawn camp people who are stupid enough to fast travel to it :)
---
Car and food comparisons and reddit, pick a better pair
---
Lots great stuff... Hope we get some 'reasonable' challenges for us grinders.
---
Yeah, they are fucking crazy and you need 8 to get carry weight increase mod. LoooooL i gona kill myself rather than do that
---
I bought 1000 today,  thanks Bethesda
---
Anyone wanting to do the water revive on PC add me. IGN is Dharb
---
You can breathe, you can blink, you can cry. Hell, you’re all gonna be doing that!
---
Yeah. There's a lot of them.
---
Cool. Did you kill them, or did they let themselves get killed?
---
They jumped off of a roughly 150m tall cliff in the mire haha
---
I'm having general issues with Fast Travel. Just doesn't trigger every time. Wife is having the same issues.
---
Those armors were truly op and they still being, they should nerf those even more.
---
They are a series of challenges under world challenges category.
---
lol!! Good way to do it!
---
I found it just because i was searching wiki, where to get crossbow and this shooting range was noted there. Archer was easiest one.
---
Yeah, probably what's best.
---
That makes 2 of us LOL
---
Yeah seems to be a bug
---
I will absolutely buy shotgun shells for 1c each. I keep running out of either lead or plastic but have way more caps than I'll ever use.
---
It still op they should get even more nerf
---
Not seen it yet
---
Same. And I love seeing all the new vendor camp designs!
---
Worked, thanks dude!
---
I put my stuff in for free. My caps are maxed so I put all the plans/recipes/ammo I would have just dumped where people might or might not find it.
---
Keep at it.
---
Done all of them :)
---
No I feel the exact same way. Also I don’t really like trading anyways because it gives me a tad of anxiety so this works perfectly. I can just throw my stuff in and leave
---
Nah it's simple, you just need to use didferent cases to see the logic. If the tax is 50%, you need to multiply your prices by 2 to get back to the original profit.
---
Wait I'm thinking of the amazon idk
---
Not natively.

---
Cults? Religious fanatics? Either one of them getting ahold of power armor might lead to seemingly insane detail work because they want to make proper “avatars” of the Four Horsemen? Or eccentric raiders maybe?
---
thats what im asking
---
Grafton vendor sells them
---
I've seen CAMPS that don't appear to load into the world when you visit the location in game and show nothing for the player name, but it does list what kind of items they have for sale.  Do players who are vending and are currently offline still register a location on the world map?  Or was this just a bug?
---
Just said this haha, ive seen serums for 2k and trash armor for 1k plus its crazy
---
Make sure to put a stick in the jar, to simulate his natural environment
---
They used to, but with patch with selling everything it changed
---
It is not like we can sell bullets at 1.11 caps each.
---
Almost guaranteed to spawn in the parking lot of Wavey Willard's
---
I’ve heard MAYBE Greg in grafon for the BOS arms.
---
Made a deal with the devil?
---
Thanks for checking
---
I just built there bc it looked nice, and I was nowhere near the farm zones.
---
someone was a bit of a sloth fan in those sky mansions. had some in a zoo like enclosure. sprinkle a little FEV and boom, megasloth.
---
I just got mine from the vendor
---
Probably true but sad to see rippers, Mr Handy blades, etc. become useless again.
---
Just checked my overrepaired ripper and it was doing 6 damage. That hurts...
---
Same. I think it's rude if I don't buy anything :)
---
Whoosh
---
How long ago
---
por que no dos?
---
Oh cool some lore
---
Yes! Much yes.
---
I feel like I'd be interested in playing Survival if it never highlighted player position.
---
Like 20 mins ago
---
No just 3
---
Shhh you’ll tell people my plans
---
Honestly, I'd totally own up to the canvas bag mistake and turn the paper bag into the canvas bag in game.
---
Simple stuff like that would actually give a lot of goodwill.
---
I’ll help with this. You revive me, I’ll revive you. I’ll me on momentarily. Lnance101.
---
It was bound to happen as a lot of folks haven't been involved in player trading to date. They'll get the feel of what the values are soon.
---
Hope they leave it this way for every body now to keep it fair. Won't hurt for one week.
---
The explanation is "reverse the following equation: profit = 90% price".
---
-&gt; price = 1/90% profit.
---
i dont get xp from my turret kills, were they farming loot?
---
Ah sweet thanks
---
North of vault 76 is a farm. Arnholt homestead. I farm glands often, might need to server hop.
---
Have you gotten yours yet?
---
Go to Stat&gt;Collections
---
What's even the point of having to pay caps to fast travel
---
There will be a lot of players who have not done trade via discord or reddit, so they not sure how to price.....at same ti e there will be players who do and will be taking advantage of players who are not on reddit and discord groups.
---
Absolutely, just not for me. I’ve been going there the tea pot and white spring at least 30 times while hopping severs. 
---
I’d gladly join you if you can spawn it.
---
Same thing I thought also
---
Settle down Todd.
---
Ha! Thx!
---
They already got ride of the valkeries on the radio
---
Kanawha Cemetery spawns bloatflies but not every time. You might need to server hop a couple times.
---
I named mine Fran Drescher and would also like to pet her.
---
Thats a great idea. That event fucks me up. Thanks!
---
Sorry, dude. I'm on xbox
---
Interesting choice for name.
---
I use that trick with a Mr. Handy Buzz blade, it's hilarious
---
Other food does so it should!
---
tbh, I find it harder to aim with it. With the empty sights, you could use hitmarkers to tell where you were aiming. Now there's a giant gun covering up most of my screen
---
People are building player traps on purpose. I have got caught in a few while trying to visit their vendor.
---
Go ahead, you can use it royalty-free (but hey, credit me if you're a journalist! ;-)). Did you notice I also turned *scrip* into a verb? Standard first post reply for every price check post from now on: &lt;Nah, scrip it!&gt; Me and my fellow scrippers, we founded the first scrip club in Appalachia. And so on...
---
thank you, that wasnt clear enough and had me really lost
---
Look to challenge menu, don't remember. But they must be easy if I accidentally do them in one hour.
---
Seriously?
---
Holy shit sorry for the grammar. I was a bit distracted and obviously wasnt paying attention to what type of "No" i was using. And no problem

*PROTECT AND SEEERVE*
---
Psn?
---
Lol I don't like it when my 10mm drops below 20k. I have about 30k of 5.56 and .45, which are fine levels. Even like 8k of .44 I brought a little bit extra when I was using it. No longer am. I'm a bit low on shotgun, maybe 19k, it's not as worrying as 10mm because of significantly slower rate of consuption. But Im gradually using more shotgun ammo lately than I can craft for, so I've been thinking of buying or trading it.
---
People count the ammo they use when fighting SBQ. I don't. Would be really diffuclt, I use at least 4 different weapons, often 5, sometimes 6-7.
---
I only notice anything if like 3 of my guns break during it. If they were in good condition they won't, but they aren't always in great shape to begin.
---
I've crafted purely 5.56 and shotgun shells in last 3 monts when I realized it was best way.(most value per resource, rough estimate) Buy the rest. I just pick up junk items, don't farm them. I've now had lead collector in camp for a month, but it's not as great as I though. It caps around 14 scrap which seems so low. It doesn't even cap at max weight like suppoed. I might need to relocate to acid spot, then I can go and try farm lead ore from the mine. I have lead ore from the motherload event, far more than I could use as I can't get as much gunpowder. In the past few months I've dropped off extra gunpowder but I've started to outproduce lead over gunpowder or acid.
---
 I know the one acid+lead place but I haven't wanted to go so far out. Junk acid would be better IMO but I think one doesnt' exists.
---
 But I will try vending and shit on my current location relatively close to WS. My previous location I had for 4+ months, with no benefits, I don't like moving it.
---
It feels like they should have had *some* area for housing. I mean, it has a ton of vendors inside.

Did they ever make the rewards for that server wide? I remember a bit after launch they changed it so that not everyone on the entire server would get the soup, but I though it was neat that everyone on the server got the food because it went well with the event name.
---
I have about 800 shotgun shells if you wanna buy some tonight when I get on. What's your character name? I'll add ya
---
How did you find out there was a mod and what it requires? I got to possum rank and I don't know what to do next, nothing happened besides getting the backpack (I do see the new world challenges in the challenges screen though.)
---
They’re reused whale bones from the fallout 4 far harbor dlc
---
So if you mod the game, or the ini file, you just can't aim down sights ever again? I'd really like to know if this is the case so I can uninstall the game if it is.
---
It’s the same for everyone....so it’s no big deal. Just makes invincible builds less invincible which is better for everyone rather than just those with dipped god sets :)

I picked up BoS chest plans a few hours ago @ Gratton Station, along w/ultra-light CA limbs... finally.

Woke up this morning like it was Christmas. Woke up started 76 and waited. 5 mins later I was buying serums from a vending machine in Flatwoods for 250 a pop.  SUPER FUN.  Then went and checked all the other vendors machines - some people were jumping away (not ready yet?) or others had the same stuff I already had.  But it was great fun.  Scrip machine was interesting.  Either way it'll be a busy night cleaning out my stash and shopping.  Needs to be a better way of telling who has what specifically.  If I want leather
---
I'm annoyed that more people aren't more random in their pricing.  The prices are always dreamed up but boring.  Pick something fun like 867 rounds of ammo for 5309 caps, as an example.
---
Yeah I still think this plan is missing

No dirty pillows?
---
I have all the BOS stuff and have sold a bunch of them that I got trying to find the dense plans. Dense torso is the last combat armor plan I need.
---
Roget that - and pleeeeease be careful, siding against the masses here will get ya a visit from the down arrow reddit Posse. Sadly I forgot to mention the exploit shooters who defend their OP gear and live in their parents basements too.
---
Yes, already got bloatfly or something like that
---
Did anyone ever find a TSE crossbow back before the nerf? I've never seen one in game or listed on the trade subs.
---
Speaking as a big hairy lazy guy in WV, yes.  Apparently.  I'm very friendly though.
---
You mean golfer outfits?
---
Guest and owner spawn points can be different depending on if the CAMP device has been moved after it's initial placement.  For example, my guests always spawn halfway into the same foundation in my kitchen (they just have to bunny hop to get out but it's still dumb) but I spawn a good ways outside of my house when fast traveling and the spot where I spawn at will change a little depending on where I've moved my CAMP object to.    
---
If guests spawned in the same spot as the owner it would probably fix it.  I think that maybe the only reason the locations are different is related to PvP (attack a CAMP and wait for the owner to fast travel to  a presumed spot) but that seems unneeded, for the most part.  
---
Personally, I would prefer some kind of travel marker that must be placed on the ground so that visitors can easily find the front door.
---
I googled my answers..
---
Nah pretty sure it's Yongyea
---
"Oh man, this guy likes a game. Better berate him to make my own miserable life seem like it has meaning!"
---
Did they ever unfix that mission?
---
They are the value of scrip (Legendary Currency) that you receive when you sell one of your legendary weapons or armor to the vending machine outside of each station.  (The is my experience earlier today)
---
1\* Melee and Ranged weapons will give you 5 scrip
---
2\* Melee and Ranged weapons will give you 15 scrip
---
3\* Melee and Ranged weapons will give you 40 scrip
---
1\* Armor = 3 scrip
---
2\* Armor = 9 scrip
---
3\* Armor = 24 scrip
---
so we can assume that the logic follows the same for the PA...which may explain why they moved the X01 PA mods into plans within the Enclave  (Production terminals)
---
Watch your back when you deposit them tho...  been blindsided a few times by respawners, and during the event it is PvP if someone elsd shows up.
---
Must be this one
---
Banned for duping
---
I think my husband got his as a drop from the Technical Data turn-in to the Brotherhood of Steel.
---
There are vending machines at pioneers camp. Did you miss them?
---
I'll have my vending machine powered in survival.. no turrets I'll play nice!
---
i have checked all vendors and none have dense plans or raider armor plans, i mean for the actual pieces pieces not the mods.
---
Seems like one could make something of a trap with that... Find somewhere nice and cozy with only one way in and make a good old ambush..
---
Ahh thx. Guess I should finish the main quest then
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnHmoA6Op1o](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnHmoA6Op1o)
---
That's illegal.
---
I didn’t dupe though, and I remember playing for like a month after they went around and banned all those dudes. Is there a way I can appeal this?
---
I'll give that a try
---
As a 6foot plus hairy slow moving guy in west Virginia I second this. We are kinda common here
---
Do you know if this is per character (like vendor caps) or per account (like challenges)?
---
It’s an issue with the player invulnerability, after about 10-15 seconds of loading in, you can fast travel to your CAMP
---
Go to survival. Oh, you don't like "battle royale"? Too bad. You want the wasteland to be a struggle to survive in. GO. TO. SURVIVAL. Also lol, "pretty green targets". They will just log out lmao.
---
The way it is now you can sell anything in the vender .... it’s hilarious....I’m sure Bethesda will fix it up...maybe...lmao
---
Someone was selling perfectly preserved pie for 25k.
---
I was tempted.
---
You have to buy and learn "Marine Dense Torso" plan still 50/50 chance of it being for Marine Armor or Combat Armor.  Not fixed yet.
---
Go to PvP servers
---
Yes. I think it has to do with the changed they just made. You can fast travel with enemies around provided you take no damage from them for several seconds. I'm guessing there's something besides damage setting it off.
---
It has something to do with players using them to get into unintended parts of the map and probably asset load order as well.
---
Right, and that sucks. Because I love my camp and its location. But I'd love to utilize the vending function as well.
---
Oh so this is why my brahmin feelin' so dead today...
---
I don’t know.  I just visited some guys camp and he was selling a 1 star Gatling gun for like 3K caps.  Hate to break it to him but most higher level players have a lot better weapons and even still wouldn’t sell them for that price.
---
People forget that Super Mario Brothers cost $40-50 in their day. The value per dollar of modern games is insane, and all of that takes effort which means it also takes money. Raising game price just raises barrier of entry and could lead to an Atari style crash, so instead they find other means to pay the bills.
---
I did, thanks!
---
Looks like gulper
---
Exactly the salty type comments the title tried to avoid. Your comment did not add anything constructive. Goodbye.
---
Thanks, I did not know owner and guest spawns were different. I was not even aware you could fast travel to someone elses camp pre patch.
---
The Welcome Mats only work in Public Work Benches.  I always use them.  The one at my CAMP is quite lonely though.  It looks "Welcoming" but that's it!  ;-)
---
This only tweaks where the owner travels to.  It will stay the same for visitors.
---
Me head hurt.
---
I kinda felt bad at first too incase it was accidentally put up for sale. But I suppose one players loss is another's gain. Good find on the 2shot explosive though.
---
Thank you omg i knew it was obvious
---
Also want to kno where to get them
---
Yeah this. I fast travel (annoyingly half way down the mountain) but safely. Others spawn half in the floor, then plummet to their death if they touch anything on their keyboard.
---
I guess I did something right sold all my 50 calls ammo and made 3200+ caps - 1cap per round
---
That is so broken
---
After realizing that being a cap-ionaire in the wasteland is pretty pointless &amp; most people make up the digital prices anyway, I'm not sure it matters that much.
---
Totally feel you. I was just in my camp for the last few transactions and it was nice to interact with other players for once :).
---
they are located in the challenge menu , under world.
---
The bans continued for months, then they purged mass amounts of duped items and continued banning.   Either you duped, or you had gobs of duped items.  But sure, go to bethesda support and submit a ticket.  Good luck
---
Good complaints.  What would you like to see? A proper survival mode without the “death match” features? I don’t think unwanted camp destruction is coming back... what else would you propose for the Adventure mode?
---
Bethesda banned you dude
---
If in a group you could/can travel directly to group member's CAMPs.
---
Lol. Shh I'm being a violent video game murderer-guy.
---
Sorry about that.  I had no idea people would spawn inside the building since I never do.  All locks removed.
---
Agree
---
Being 'raider' means they can only take advantage of defenseless players, they can't survive real pvp.
---
I am online now
---
I don't know any dupers, but I still see several (not hundreds) of the same legendaries sold every once in a while.  Others have indicated duping is still possible w/server crashing (need 2 people).  I'm positive it's still going on, just not advertised like it was before on You Tube or on this forum.
---
I remember getting a lot of weapons from a friend, I guess I probably should have been smarter than that. Will do
---
True. It's not a roleplay. It's lack of skill.
---
Like when they rotated one of the weapons benches in Flatwoods?
---
Dude once i wrote an essay about my poop, people just do it, it isn't a big deal XD
---
Just great😂
---
My question is how many caps per unit should I sell it for in my vending machines...?
---
Honestly... The easy fix would be: pacifist = camp protected,  non-pacifist = not protected. That way, everyone gets to play how they like.
---
This was the best friggin’ update. I shall join you in the over excitement lol
---
[I assume this is what they are referencing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cAy4zULKFDU) from Monty Python
---
Ive had this so many times starting new builds, even with no high level players in sight. They should just make enemies a set level depending on the area, especially areas that involve early quests
---
Oh, right. Makes sense. I've never been in a group, I guess that explains the ignorance.
---
Did u dupe or do any glitches?
---
Anti armor, explosive, two shot.
---
Ugh. Then at least fix the murder/steal bugs at workshops BSG...
---
Complete the new quests
---
No but I got lots of free weapons from a friend. In hindsight taking those wasn’t very wise
---
Did the update get rid of that CAMP? I’m pretty sure you just described where mine is
---
All of them?
---
Not sure that's it. When it happened to me, I was at the Camp to start the Pioneer Scout missions, had stood around listening to the bot talk and played around with tracked quests for a bit so it was definitely more than 15 seconds.
---
Hopefully we get a few more details on Thursday's inside the vault. I'm only going to trade my garbage legendaries for now until we see how it wotks.
---
I just found out i can craft it, level 50 with more carry weight. This is like christmass and unwrapping presents :D
---
So I need the cacti, of course.
---
But what in the hell are those Kamen Rider Metal Alien Helmets? I NEED them.
---
He probably cried to his mommy and she told him to get his ass out of there.
---
No, its a nerf to griefers who can no longer put you in pvp at any time and any place on the map.
---
If u only took some guns I don't see why Bethesda would ban you for that as we all buy dupe weapons from someone atleast once
---
Black Cowboy Hat!
---
This would be amazing. Especially since I moved my camp for player vending and now when I fast travel home I spawn at the bottom of the cliff my shop overlooks. Terrible.
---
I love seeing everyone’s camps too!!!
---
Yeah someone spawned at my above a 700’ cliff. Poor guy didn’t intend for that to happen but with Seneca Rock as my base I feel your pain. Most people end up in my conservatory. Which is ok but they have to follow arrows to my shop.
---
Sorry it’s rhetoric lol
---
Defenseless? I usually target people a much higher level than my level 69. Risk/reward.
---
Yea all the new boy scouts ones
---
It applies to your challenges, which result in the badges when you finish them
---
i'm guessing it's a new recipe that got added in like how under cooking we need to make smores and i don't think we had that before either.  i'm sure there are others that we get also.
---
No. It's just when I click on my CAMP marker nothing happens.
---
I'm looking for the same thing will be watching this thread
---
At the end of the day it wont matter.  Bethesda will nerf anything worth having and then act like you are a jerk for complaining about it.  I think Bethesda enjoys screwing over their fan base.  Reminds me of the South Park episode where the cable company employees where getting off on giving bad customer service.
---
Ikr it's stupid🤦‍♂️
---
Yeah it was a few hundred duplicates of guns though. I guess I deserve it for taking that stuff when I knew it was duped. Hopefully they let me have my account back because I had hundreds of hours on that character
---
I got the torso plan as a drop that ended up being marine.
---
It takes budget to actually sell items. The more you sell, the more budget is taken.
---
I think you have to complete the Order of the Tadpole quest before you can advance to Possum, and that’s when you get the backpacks? I’m working through tadpole right now, I’ve heard that once you pass that you get to the backpacks.
---
Regardless, all backpack mods are for possum scouts only (there’s a vending machine in the middle of the pioneer camp)
---
I'm thinking 150 each for mine
---
Idk how to link from mobile, check my last post.
---
I have a feeling Bethesda's wheel grease room is like the storage room from Raiders of the Lost Ark.
---
Are we getting the BoS mods back from vendors? You said in the last patch notes that we were. 
---
Anyone know what the deal is here/if they are or are not in certain vendor’s inventories?
---
I had full camp budget and it wouldn't let me sell anything until I freed up some.
---
Them rads tho. Don't even think Lead Belly helps with cannibalism.
---
I got it!! Watoga Station , no pic but can confirm
---
A group of pre war church goers mistaking this for the rapture, thinking they weren't good enough, became raiders under the four horsemen personas?
---
Damn dude well my friend had  A LOT of nuka colas but Bethesda took them away and they didn't ban him
---
I think you can have them equipped but you don’t get the weight buff if your in PA.
---
Whats the challenge?
---
I can completely see your point. I also see the other side of the table that’s got a lot more chairs at its side right now. Maybe if more people outed themselves as a “outlaw” instead of silently hiding like y’all have been doing the rules might have changed. But from where I’m sitting there are a lot less of you, and a lot more of me. Not meant to be salty in ANYWAY. Just stating what I see. Sometimes it can be lonely on that side alone when no one else will sit with you. We have plenty of room on our side if you’d like to join us. Hell who knows you might actually like it over here. Or not, and you can just flip the table and roll out this bitch.
---
For the New Gorge Bridge athlete challenge - where is the course? I climbed to the top of that damned rope course and it didn't trigger. Is that not it?
---
I am going to have to do something weird to mine as well this evening.  People aren't spawning into my foundation, but they are spawning inside of a locked base - when everything vendor related is outside.  It has to be confusing as hell.
---
i’ll be busy for a while, so many things to do daily
---
1. vendor run (1400 caps)
---
2, daily challenges (atoms)
---
3, scout challenges (backpack)
---
4. players vendors
---
5. legendary vendor (scrips)
---
love this update!
---
This. I've had players spawn into the weirdest parts of my camp.
---
My phone won't work with remote play, but I've had success downloading free themes from the PS Store to wake up my console and start downloads.
---
I'm so sick of this damm question! Everytime the game updates there are thousands of you guys asking this same thing. It just means you cant play atm becuz they are maintaining servers for a new update. Thats it! You're not banned or anything, everybody gets this message.
---
I can't even describe how happy I am with this one!
---
Yeah well this post sounds like you need to not whine about them fixing the player to player interactions. You follow people to their homestead to attack them? That's pretty lame. If you want to play as a raider you still can, just don't be a rude about it to people. We spend alot of time building our camps and immersing ourselves in the game, you're bringing the worst aspects of GTAO gameplay into this game.
---
How about if you hit a scorched and they impaled and got stuck on a wall

According to one of these Bethesda replies you can still take Deathclaws with Wasteland Whisperer.

Oh nice, this helps a whole lot!
---
Fool-proofing? People are going to try extra-hard to get in if you lock it up. A closed door invites the curious...
---
Yeah they broke it since the last update when they nerfed milking them .. smh .. totally unnecessary as usual. Try the brahmin in Flatwoods, it's a hit or miss, some work, some don't try, different servers.
---
Man, I went server hopping and buying as many cheap Legendaries for Scrip. Keep finding 3 star combat knives for 20 caps. The Legendary Vender Machine ran out of Scrip and I have 20-30 more to sell.
---
i just received 5 from Nuka Cowla from the Sheepsquatch quest Free Range. (BTW the other Brahmin named Grognak would not let me milk her...could be a him, maybe that is why ;)  )
---
All i can say is that it worked for me, so just keep trying.

Best thing is, even if you make an alt and rediscovered the location, still won’t tag off

I am going to apologize in advance for my Plague Walker stank.  That shit just doesn't wash off.  :(
---
Much better than the 30. Haven't arsed to play yet, but this is good and definetely worth pursuing.
---
Yes, there have been several posts about that today and it was mentioned in the patch notes.
---
Yeah, I've been saving up for player vending so I just need to offload a bunch of stuff so my prices are probably too low. People are probably going to buy my stuff and resell. Just consider me a wholesaler!
---
Scrap it and build a brand new one.
---
On top of bridge, you will see yellow flags, thats the route, start is on east edge of bridge. You must use that box on stick, reproductor, gray, idk how to describe it. Hope it helped.
---
Haha, thanks for being mature and actually expressing your thoughts unlike some others. There are plenty of us. We just don't really complain too much on social media. Business was good, I won't lie... But to be fair you had to hit back for it to initiate. Honestly... It doesn't take much to repair a camp. Any high level player should have enough junk to repair ten times over. I never went for anyone sub LVL 50. I'm level 69 and generally would target the highest levels I could find.
---
No one’s gonna pay for my water if my purifiers are unlocked.
---
Good lord the Oppossum hat is terrifying.
---
Dense torso or Heavy? Heavy has always had a chance of being there.
---
lol, good point. Makes me feel better that I'll never make any money in this game :)
---
That’s why when I always run in to a low level I always make sure the get a hit in and then take care care of the rest. I hated this very thing when I was lower level so I at least try to help without doing everything or getting said person killed.
---
Haha
---
Instigating is great on lever actions and other rifles.
---
For the last few months I've been getting 11 or so bullets and some lead scrap on turn in. And that's with 14 luck and 4-8 technical data. It's really sad and doesn't seem worth the trip any more
---
No, you're overestimating. It'll just be the maximum amount of racial slurs.
---
Max level bandolier(I recall it has 2), can't be improved further by armor effects. 90% less is max on anything.

Very inventive!

I picked them up at the Grafton train station today. Super cheap compared to some other plans.

The Pitt did have one of the trickiest moral choices in Fallout, definitely in my top 3, and Wastelanders is all about 'choices and consequences'.

I aced the archery test 5/5 and nothing happened. Isn't something supposed to trigger on test pass?

I've found him 3 times in the last week. I'll be server hopping when I get back on in about 10 minutes. Add me- skellyassassin
---
Just a small suggestion, my quads are operating super great still, same with my bloodied combat.  AAE is not doing so hot lol.
---
Yea I remember them at Grafton station back then. They were not that common to find though, I spent about 4-5 hours server hoping to find all the plans. Then that patch came out and they were gone. I switched from pc to PS4 so had to start all over, i server hoped for like another 4-5 hours without finding anything, that’s when I checked online and found out the patch broke them, lmfao. Hella wasted time. Glad to see them fixed and no longer random like before. I’ll be buying those first thing today when I get home.
---
Bought the Jetpack, but don’t have the Stable Cobalt Flux to make it. Ugh.
---
If you talk to one of the robot scout leaders that get marked, he gives you a repeatable quest. Doing that quest is what finished that step for me.
---
Thank zarkwon!
---
Sorry, how do you start it?
---
when did this happen btw?
---
Yeah I feel you honestly I don’t know how and I wish I could be of more use to you hopefully when I get the chance soon I can run the course myself to see what’s up but hopefully someone else has

Couple.months ago I was in the same boat and was told the same thing.  I bought the plan from watoga station vendor and it was combat, when I was looking for Marine.  Bought it again it was Marine.  I guess you'd know now if you buy Marine Dense Torso, then a it again and it doesnt say (Known)?
---
Camp Lewis in a cabin to the right of the mr handy
---
Ammo store in clarksburg  level 2 terminal on the back wall. I used to farm the weapon plan spawn every day.
---
I thought that was code 4:8:2006 though. 4:8:2000 was the reported ban code.
---
For me they are fast traveling in an area I don't want nobody have access....
---
Amazing, ty
---
Thanks man
---
I get this a lot ((even before the Update)), just travel somewhere cheep and it fixes it every time.
---
I have mutiple times. Its powered. Garage doors work in other areas around location. Just not where i want
---
Complete the order of tadpole and once you advance in rank you will receive a lvl 20 backpack.
---
yeah tell 'em
---
I think they're being facetious
---
It's happened to me before, not during maintenance. I gave it a bit, resrarted ps4, and it worked again sooner or later.
---
What system?
---
I was able to sell a duplicate brewing recipe at half price of what it's worth. I figured half price would be a good incentive, so it seems everything for sale for plans is half off the common ones. Testing the waters and so far so good. I didn't expect anyone to actually want to buy a plan at all. Probably because brewing recipes are still sought after.
---
Lmao I know this is frustrating for people but I do find this funny in a sad way. Head's been waiting for this fix for looong and now they've completely fucked it hahah
---
I'm up on one of the ledges on the east side of the tracks right around that area.
---
So many pickaxe skins. Is Beth trying to entice fortnite players to come over?
---
I think the complaint was they spend some much time making houses like fucking sims or something and they had to start over. Not the actual cost. Hell I don’t know, I just have a wife open camp on a cliff with my box and work bench. Fuck decorations I wanna wreck shit
---
Just picked up a lvl35 2shot, +vats hit chance, -25% ap cost gauss for 700.  It's pretty good, definitely worth 700
---
I do have the same issue.
---
I just got on and it said this. I didn’t get any email saying I was banned or anything like that

Southeast edge of pioneers camps. On hill. You will find plan for crossbow there too
---
Don't think so... When u do the exams once u click view score it updates
---
 BOS combat armour plans are available at the Grafton Train Station vendor bot. Picked up all three plans for 97 caps each
---
Bot also had a lot of the mods for the armour as well
---
Same. The trade UI looks confusing and im pretty crafty at getting what I need myself as well. Player vending has just made it where I can finally get rid of the extra 50+ fusion cores I've been hoarding for no reason.
---
My PC name is the same as Reddit. If you see my camp and need fusion cores c'mon up (I'm on the cliff overlooking white spring)
---
I only ask that you not blaspheme at my camp. Praise be to Atom. 👼
---
...how can I get a cow?
---
I tried Wavey Willards and nothing man, maybe not guaranteed
---
As it should be. It’s very easy to make more than you’d get from robot vendors and still sell much cheaper than them. I think people will figure it out eventually, it’s just kinda painful to watch.
---
Pvp servers are worthless. It's just sitting at whitesprings and shooting each other. That's not being able to play the outlaw aspect of the game. That's not social engineering a situation to get you to fight. That's not planning an attack, or getting revenge, or setting a trap for bounty hunters. It's battle Royale pure and simple. Other games do that much better.
---
What's the chem rate at these days, I imagine this will open a whole new channel in chems.
---
I've had to buy a couple of weapons blind due to this.  
---
Was so nice to find out my new AA supersledge has a swing speed modifier too!
---
Some people's machines you can inspect, it's generally a 50/50 chance for me. Bought some armour earlier and it was a bit too roulette-y.
---
I have him on my server PSN: alooftreasure
---
Wait what? I justblogged in and mine wasnt removed.
---
offfffff course they did. Smh
---
It also sucks to be a high level player and have all the enemies be a way lower level than they should be.
---
Ugh  this is actually pretty brutal! I figured a little budget to make the machine, but taking budget to fill kinda sucks you are definitely right!
---
Just a suggestion, maybe when we fast travel to player camps for vending, can we not spawn INSIDE foundation? Has happened 3 times already. Thanks
---
Yeah but you just have to click "repair all" on your camp module and it's fixed. Not like it has to all be rebuilt.
---
There is no other posts containing the issue I am having.
---
I’m with you on the aspect of playing as a raider. Though my approach is more of a chaotic neutral play style. I would suggest, and am hoping for, some type of “Raiding Event,” where players like us can come together and raid for one more score. I just wanna blow shit up, do chems, kill some ghouls or anything living for that matter, and light stuff on fire. 
---
That’s just a shower thought, I’m sure somebody could come up with a better idea but that’s the gist of it. Give us “raiders” an outlet other than survival mode.
---
Request sent
---
Where is this?
---
I got drill today!
---
Explosive is only a secondary effect
---
But you cant see all the effects when you are shopping someones inventory. I'm not investing big caps when I dont know what I'm getting.
---
can confirm
---
Thank you!  I’m bad at direction but when you spawn in where do you go?
---
What happens when it updates? Does it remove that exam?
---
That defeats the purpose of the tax... It's meant to destroy caps to reduce inflation.
---
Really? I made an alt to redo the early quests to finally get those achievements that were bugged because I did them under beta, and I was going to hopefully get those locations finally “unlocked” for the challenge, but haven’t gotten around to that part yet.
---
Thanks for the heads up before I tried to do it and was totally lost and frustrated by it not working.
---
Check my last post. Shooting range is in pioneers camp on southeast edge. There is cabin up hill. There you must find reproductor, that looks like some comunicstion device that will start test.
---
Atleast someone likes us "filthy console peasents" atleast we dont need a 2000 dollar pc because wete lacking in our sexual department
---
That defeats the point.
---
You can get caps from friggen carrots my dude.
---
It's at the huge temple place in the toxic valley. Server hop til it triggers
---
My bad.
---
Found one at someones camp and it worked. At least I know its not jacked up on my end.
---
If you're fighting exclusively in power armor, there is 0 reason to wear regular armor. You're basically naked in power armor.
---
Just fast travel to me, I'm waiting with Ansel
---
I can see what you mean but... You don't want to play survival cause you don't have the 'agree to pvp' mechanic to protect you?
---
It's a tough call. Personally I'd see if you can compromise and adjust your camp around that center spot. You might find by moving a few walls and adding some lights to direct the eye, you can make it work.
---
No it doesn't.. Press options go to challenges and then world and then select the specific tadpole section. If the "pass exam" is greyed out and have a tick u have passed. Then it's just finishing the other requirements.
---
Them sounds are awesome though! Lol
---
I never thought of this. Good idea!
---
I ***may*** have come home from work early to 'work from home' so I could install the patch and get my vending set up... then spent the next couple hours walking around to see other vendor's camps.
---
Was it an AAE??
---
At your camp, put out the fertilizer resource.
---
Probs going to resell without the fix tbh
---
Thanks that helped all
---
They said they were gonna nerf that awhile ago, weren't they? There's plenty of other overpowered builds, they just fixed the one that wasn't playing like they intended. Don't get me wrong, this game has a slew of issues and problems. Just, you were given time. I think you would've been able to get a refund a long time ago, but not now.
---
Really? Wow have I been stupid all this time... Legendary effects from armour are still a thing while in power armour, right?
---
Thanks a ton man!
---
Any mods installed? Those mess with it, there have been a few threads already.
---
I just saw a guy trying to sell weapons for 25k caps each and each piece of the responders outfit for 25 k.... don’t be that guy
---
It was supposed to be nerfed with all the other explosive weapons and BGS bodged it. IE it was overdue.
---
Did you do this already? I still need it. IGN: Murderbones
---
Oh
---
Mine is floating in the sky and took hours to position, come to it once and you'd understand there is literally nothing I can change. Some of the cooler locations only work very specific ways 😔 I'm using that rock formation thing by one of the satellites as an entrance.
---
I’ll just go with this one as it was the easiest to find and it has the answer: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/blssok/pc_mod_users_update_your_customini/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app
---
Sounds like a decent gun you've got there and definitely worth the price.
---
It's good to see so many positive replies. I've not even started the new quests yet, I'm too busy shopping.
---
Do you mind cross posting one here? Reddit isn't sharing them to me. And i have the same mod as my friends and its showing up for them (perk loadouts)
---
Shotguns with explosive effect took a heavy damage decrease when factoring in their range.  The pellets with explosive effect use to have zero range drop in damage.  Now if your not within the range you expect a shotgun to be effective, your fucked.  They still one shot level 68 super mutants, but you gotta be face to face with em.
---
Switch to Unyielding melee, you can one shot everything in the game with the exception of SBQ.
---
Bloodied and two shot are good on pretty much anything. Quad/double are nice on most weapons too. Furious is good on anything remotely fast (i.e not a gauss rifle or missile launcher). Instigating is good on anything strong (gauss rifle, fat man, super sledge, etc). 
---
As for armor, vanguard, unyielding, and bolstering are pretty popular. Chameleon is nice to have but I don't think people trade for it much, it's relatively common. The thing is 1* legendary armor can drop from many events as a reward, so most of the time people will only care about 3* ones because of effects like weight reduction or sentinel/cavalier
---
Nothing seems to be working for me
---
Bye now.
---
Where is that? I don't recognize the area. Ground doesn't look quite as ash heap as it's supposed to.
---
Saw some guy selling serums for 3k each.
---
That happened to me today. I had to leave the world to fix it.
---
Where have you found them?
---
Are you joking or being serious. Cause this Sub-Reddit I honestly can't tell half the time.
---
No that's not it at all. Survival is just mindless pvp. Shooting each other over and over.
---
Playing as a raider style is so much more. Getting a wanted level and waiting for challengers... Attacking a team of four as a team of four or less and they decide to stand and fight. Following you home to attack your house, only to find you kick my ass and sending me running with my tail tucked... Or I kill you and take your stuff. Being able to seek revenge in a 1v1 situation without having to fight the whole server who are all sitting at ws...etc etc.
---
haha sry that was my mistake. You're right I kust checked...they look so similiar tho
---
what they should implement is team based pvp (raiders v. non-raiders) like the old EQ Tallon Zek server. Join the server and pick a side. Fight people on the opposing side. Right now Survival is closer to Rallos Zek but with naked wizard gankers replaced with bloodied build spawn campers. Unfortunately for you, your only real option is Survival. mode. 
---
Although I enjoy pvp in other games, but here it is implemented poorly. This game is not a pvp game no matter how much you want it to be. I actually like the changes and wish they'd go one step further and make the bags you drop upon death unlootable by anyone  but teammates.
---
I was thinking of upgrading to 32 anyways. I will try that out. Thanks!
---
Had to rebuild my entire camp (and of course the blueprints auto-stored from the crash couldn't be placed). Vending machines could be placed without a crash at that point.
---
I feel so bad for you
---
Evil, evil thought
---
At least upgrade to Level 35 Excavator - or wait 4 more levels and do it all up to 45.
---
Thanks for pointing it out! 
---
The "Legendary Players" feature could be really cool if they are like permanent mutations or very hyper specific specializations (that can be switched if you prestige again maybe?). 
---
I want to be able to focus my character on something really cool like a trade skill or something to invest in, and trade my services or products. And be driven to seek out other players for something specific that I need or can't do myself. Build a real economy to it!
---
Thanks again!
---
I doubt it would be an even trade from the purveyor.
---
Wtf are you still here?  Honestly curious.
---
Boohoo
---
I mean we still don't have text chat what else is there to say?
---
oh yeah haha you're right I just checked. They look so similiar tho...
---
Unless something changed in this patch it doesn't stack with cobbler or juice.
---
I don't know if same effects stack with food, because there are lots of 10%melee damage foods out there and that could get ridiculous.
---
You have a problem killing ghouls without ridiculously OP gun?
---
and what could we do?  there is no way to restart the quest right? :(
---
I got a mounted tick there.
---
The smart way to get around this would be to just not tax anything at or under 4 caps, tax 5-9 caps a flat 1 cap, and then regular logic can kick in for everything over 10. This way you can't *really* game the system and it doesn't affect anything that actually matters. Heck under these rules you could still use .32 caliber ammunition as an effective 1:1 replacement for caps and not get taxed in the process.  
---
Wouldn't be all that hard to program on the logic end of things.
---
Totally. Naked.
---
If you have a great set of legendary effects on your worn armor, it probably outclasses any set of power armor. But the second you put on PA, you lose legendary effects and don't gain any extra DR/ER/RR from regular armor.
---
They're for the Tier 2 challenges of today's update. Specifically the Tadpole Archeologist challenge. Take a picture with the camera item!
---
That sounds disgusting.
---
Yep. But that's just decoration.
---
This. This would be excellent. Almost a WoW type situation. You choose your faction, horde or alliance. The others are fair game. Very very good idea.
---
Well at the very least it doesn't rot like those do, so more versitile at least!
---
Damn okay, this will solve my issue thank you lots.
---
Very good tip. Don’t want to miss out on a potential sale.
---
Or the said legendary.
---
You get new challenges. Probably more quests are coming next week.
---
Probably. Haven’t checked to see what it looks like. Might not, ticks are disgusting enough already without being mounted
---
Patch just said "Legendary enemies now guaranteed to drop legendary items."  Maybe they failed to specify they would scale with * level as well?
---
Where are the world challenges? I've taken and passed every exam but I can't find them
---
Alot of games have this. Less caps going to vendors means more caps flood the game. This is how they balance it a bit
---
I didn't say I had a problem killing them without it, o said I enjoyed doing it with it.
---
You can still tame those. It's just using the intended perk card versus both animal and creature giving the option to tame and pacify at the same time.
---
We're dealing with percentages represented by two decimal places, so that, for instance, 45% becomes .45 in a calculation.
---
We want to figure out how much we need to price the item at to get the number of caps we want, given that 10% of the purchase price is taken away as a "tax." Another way to look at that is to say that we need to set the sell price of the item so that we earn the specific profit we want, given that we will receive only 90% of the purchase price. Using the 90% figure, we could represent the situation as an equation as follows:
---
[sell price]×.90=[profit]
---
That looks awkward, so it's easier to assign variables like x for the sell price and y for the desired profit. Furthermore, if we're estimating or doing these calculations in our heads, it's easier to use the cancellation properties of fractions to obtain smaller numbers via basic division rather than decimal multiplication--so we'll do the arithmetic not with the decimal .90, but as the fraction 90/100--which reduces to 9/10.
---
Now we need to solve the following equation for x (the sell price):
---
(9/10)×x = y
---
In order to solve for x, we multiply both sides of the equation by the *reciprocal* of the fraction 9/10--the fraction obtaining by "flipping" the original fraction "upside-down" to get 10/9:
---
(10/9)×(9/10)×x = (10/9)×y
---
A fraction multiplied by its reciprocal reduces to 1, so we have:
---
x = (10/9)×y
---
Now, a few remarks on why the fraction we used, 9/10, is actually simpler to use than the decimal .9.  The first reason is most due to the fact that the reciprocal, 10/9, has an infinite decimal representation. In order to use it in this form in a calculation, even on a calculator, the decimal must be truncated (cut off), which introduces a rounding error into the calculations.
---
The second reason to use a fraction is that most of us have a decent grasp of both division and multiplication by single-digit numbers, allowing us to complete the calculations in our heads. For instance, suppose we wanted to sell a mutation serum at a profit of 360 caps. The final step of the calculation becomes x = (10×360)/9 = 3600/9 = 400, which is simple enough to do without a calculator or even a pencil and paper.
---
lol whack  
---
I guess the more the merrier
---
I'm sorry the game has swung so far away from where we started. I can respect your desire to roleplay the game a certain way, and it was definitely initially possible. I would suggest very highly that yourself and the many many others like you provide detailed feedback about what aspects of the pvp survival mode you do and don't like. Shape that mode, or potentially a new mode to be the style you're looking for. I think there's got to be the capacity to skin this cat in different ways; but the feedback has to be given to them and not just posted on a downvoted reddit thread.  May you continue to provide hot death in a variety of exciting flavors.
---
Can I have your account
---
That would be kind of ridiculous.
---
3+ days worth of max scrip for a 1*
---
I can't see that being the case. Good to not get the hopes up though.
---
Same problem here. I was really surprised someone bought my tse guass rifle for 10k when they couldn't even see for sure it was explosive.
---
Even if they said that, not the case. I killed a 3* mirelurk queen just 10 mins ago and got a goddamn drill.
---
Do you not have a mic?...
