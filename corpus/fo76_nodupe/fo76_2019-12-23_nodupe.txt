I always go to a container that’s at some train station nobody visits, then I just pick some random person from the previous world and teleport to that location w my mule

---
Obviously they be hating because they're jealous of Bethesda's success.
---
You could learn the game, get better, and then minimize the time spent in loading screens.
---
The removal of unnecessary fear, the foiling of a plot by asses to ruin other peoples fun...
---

---
Oh what do I know, I just coded the most successful mod in NWN history., Path of Ascension. I's descendants are still being played now last I checked.
---
So I know this is hard work, this claim. No one is going to do all that and then let the company fix it before they profit. Someone willing to do that would definitely not instill fear in everyone before doing so. No, the hacker profits. because it's work. This is a sham. Fear mongering.
---
Also I caught one of the people insisting it's real lying.
---
What? I can't hear you with Bethesdas dick in your mouth, you gotta let go of fallout or the dick either one is a good choice

Dude I copied and pasted where you said it, rofl scroll up foo.

&gt;level 2jcarter315 Enclave2 points · 56 minutes ago · edited 20 minutes agoThere have been reports, here and on the Bethesda forums. Each one was either removed or the OP was attacked for reporting it.

This is not just popular, it’s near god roll. This can probably get you just about anything in the market outside of Fixers and uncommon legacies.
---
Edit: Previous statement only stands if it is max lvl. Guns under max lvl can still bring in a good profit, just not as much as the same roll on a max lvl weapon/armor.

I just tried to kill a wanted player.

Problem is my toon is level 11 and he pissed off down to the lower middle of the map and got jumped by 2 SB's and about 5 albino radstags.
---
Me: Nope, bugging out.
---
A few lovely people wandered into my small settlement just last night, I've tried to make a small village with a bar, a store, a workshop, and a guest lodge for people to use. We exchanged gifts for a little while and we posed for a few photos together. Hugely enjoyable player interaction. 
---
I really hope what is apparently happening doesn't detur people from having fun and playing the game. As far as I know they can only take from your player inventory and not your stash, I think travelling light is perfectly reasonable if you're that concerned.
---
I det for punctuation and spelling all the time, check my posts. And Im not gonna stop for you, liar.
---
Is anyone actually doing it in-game? or is it just this one person showing that it's possible?
---
And now you see why I edit. rofl
---
They havent *technically* released the hack yet, apparently theyre going to on either xmas or xmas eve, but theres still a small group of people who have the ability to hack you, and it wont be long before others get their hands on it
---
I do that im 200 my character is too squishy to survive
---
I guess they were intended to be there as they show in the list of “heads” in the camp building...
---
&gt;Its not some kind of “this is all bethesdas fault because its possible” bullshit.
---
That's *exactly* what it is, lmao.
---
You people are like battered housewives defending your abusive partner.
---
&gt;Fallout 76 apparently has almost no server-side validation.
---
It is absolutely mind-boggling that a triple A studio would set up an online game and not have this. What good did they think would come of that?
---
I called you on some information you had wrong. A few minutes after, your comment was edited to include that info. Now you're sitting here and keep leaving comments on one thing instead of focusing on the real issue: This hack's source code was released and we need to work as a community to ask Bethesda to fix it.
---
The scrapbox is genuinely great, I'd also love one for ammunition. I know you said you didn't want to discuss Fallout 1st but if I could, I'd say I dont see a reason these dont exist for all players anyway. I subscribe to 1st because of the deal I get on Atoms versus the price of buying them separately. Thats more than enough of a subscriber bonus to me.
---
I play other games, I'm frustrated beyond the point of any hope.  I subbed here back when I still played.  I saw this in my feed and in my current state of mind I wrote what I did.  And I stand by it.  Bethesda doesn't deserve fans as dedicated as yourself.  So to answer your question, I'm angry for the way this franchise has been treated.  It was a cash grab from the begining and hasn't slowed down.  Every decision they make reflects on their warped priorities.   I feel the way I do because of their neglegence with a game series I used to love.  I just typed it out because I know others agree but don't want to lose internet points.     I hope this helps you understand better where I'm coming from.   Thanks for reading it.
---
Intent.
---
In game exploits like duping is a flaw in their design, but it wasn't intended. However it IS their fault for letting it go on for so long and it also showed they were completely blind sided. Resorting to quick fixes that failed as soon as they were implemented. In addition it reveals they lacked an actual disciplinary system, rather making decisions on a whim to handle it. People who picked up items whether they created them or not received "indefinite suspensions" (perma bans lol) rather than just temporary suspensions and character wipes. Which is very unsettling considering NW cheaters just get 3 day bans.
---
However...
---
This isn't an in game exploit, a flaw in the design that can be easily repeated. Just like the hijinks going on in Nuclear Winter, these are 3rd party injections of a malicious nature. This isn't a case of people who are just curious or wanted to make the game a little easier for themselves. These are people who thrive on ruining the experience for everyone.
---
Oh, well, if you talk to them tell them I said not to... lol
---
Mini gun mods are all personal preference. Tri barrel is good for range, but accelerated can shred. Prime is a monster and fairly easy to keep fed. 
---
Outside of barrels sights are roughly all the same, especially in third person. The shredding barrel can be good, but because yours is explosive you probably aren’t going to be barrel stuffing enemies.

---
Yikes, Imagine being this dumb.
---
Thanks, ha ha, I'm sure that's that then.
---
No. This is on Bethesda for using an outdated Engine and releasing a DLC as a full blown MMO when they have zero ability to release a game that isn't broken because they are greedy.
---
I’ve had enemies spawn with ammo but no guns. Guns but no ammo, nothing on them at all and eventually if you watch them they might spawn a gun.
---
If I had to guess: "this shortcut will let us release the game on time."
---
The state of this game is just sad...
---
This is the real question
---
\*PUTS TIN FOIL HAT ON\* This is clearly done by Bethesda themselves there are no hackers it's so they can sell more subscriptions for fo1 !!!1!!1!! (please understand that this is supposed to be a joke although the issue it's not funny at all, if you hate bethesda and the game just ignore it don't fuck the poor player that just want to have some fun during the Christmas period you useless \*\*\*\*)
---
You'd probably be able to get a few thousand caps for it. 3rd perk isn't great but junkies, faster fire is very good. Only problem being that people are with a shortage of caps because of the Christmas event and the 50 cal weighs quite a bit, so you may be waiting a while for a buyer. If you've got the stash space for it to sit there, throw it up in your vendor for a price that would be worth not scripting it
---
Does the Santatron have a max capacity, and if so, how fast does it fill?
---
I agree.
---
Any online game can be hacked, some just need a little bit more effort.
---
Change your configuration in the configuration file. It's much better than the in-game settings. For example, by default the lowest shadow distance is pretty high.  
---
[https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/464](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/464)
---
I wouldn't call this purely hackers fault. By *all means* them hacking is making the game unplayable and they are in the wrong for making it worse and also hurting other people's enjoyment. 
---
But it's also on Bethesda's fault for not addressing this issue. What other MMO on the market has an exploit where you can spawn items, duplicate, spawn assets, steal directly from others and also crash the market in seconds.
---
There are a few, but roll backs and and patches are made **right** away. Ways to prevent this are steam rolled out in an instant.
---
The way Bethesda feels like they are dealing with the issue is by waiting until enough people are affected, rolling out a patch and then waiting for the next exploit. Nuclear Winter has been frustrating for awhile due too aim bots and hacking, and it has been untouched for months.
---
By all means, the hackers ARE to blame. They are ruining the game and should be stopped and reprimanded. But if you keep your doors unlocked, windows open, and are never home, would you be shocked If your house got broken into?
---
make sure you're playing on fullscreen  and check gpu/cpu usage
---
This.
---
There are other triple A games that get hacked all the time, maybe more than you realize. Just because this one is more vulnerable, does it make it right?
---
Normally, I would 100% agree, except the bugs and faulty practices of Bethesda have been numerous and sizable for over a year. You can't really say they have 0 culpability with how easy the game has been to exploitation, and how little has changed to curb it.
---
I'll only reach the metal armor skin.
---
This time around the rewards are not to my liking, but skins are always good for protecting gear.
---
While I do not agree that bolstering sucks, it is inferior to Unyielding in a low HP build.
---
I’ve had something similar a mob of super Mutants spawned at my camp when loaded in so anyway I started blasting and all of a sudden I drop through the floor die re-spawn and proceeded to have 3 star super Mutants spawn in and just fuck the shit out of my base for 30 minutes but did get plenty of scrip
---
Which means that the dev console is available somewhere in the game client, you only have to find it.
---
Bethesda should have never included any trace of programming code of such dev tooling in a multiplayer game client. It should have been stripped out altogether.  But FO76 seems to be little more than the old crap singleplayer engine with a multiplayer network connection bolted on.
---
So you hate the game but still go on here because you own it?
---
I can guarantee I would never have put this many hours in a single player game.
---
I got the Metal Skin earlier today. Looks cool. I'm grinding mostly just to see if I can. The beanie isn't something I've wear a lot. Nor is the Fur Jacket..but it gives me something to work towards.
---
Thanks.. duh should have done that.
---
It just breaks their promise of no pay to win
---
Well. Your not gonna need it anyhow if you don't play. So worst case would be that you'd end up waiting for a fix.
---
interesting thought here, what if this is all a ploy to move more people into the $100 subscription?
---
You don't have to pay another cent.
---
I don't even see the fun when they do that. The best PVP I ever had (out of boredom) was with a level 38 and I think I was level 45 at the time at one of the workshops. We were fairly evenly matched, but I was a melee build and he had a decent rifle.
---
This is the worst MMO ever released. Talk about being in denial! Sheesh!
---
Bethesda can't even make a web page securely so I guess we shouldn't be surprised.
---
You will need it if you ever plan on playing again
---
I feel like everyone is wearing a Santa outfit. I personally have switched to Santa hat, Santa beard, sunglasses and tropical shorts suit.
---
So as an outsider who just started playing a few weeks ago and was enjoying it, this sucks. As a distinguished engineer it makes me question what is the strategy Bethesda is employing here? If we agree the goal is success this is by far the absolute worst way to go about it especially considering there is no communication that it is or will be fixed. Even if we believe that to be happening.
---
It makes me question how the people responsible for allowing this to happen still have their jobs. If anything remotely similar to this happened at my firm it would be grounds for immediate dismissal.
---
Hold Bethesda accountable.
---
You mean your character is level 2 or you upgraded the card to level 2?
---
So you guys aren't raiders? Just claim the name. Isn't that unethical
---
The hack just got released too lmao now everyone can use it
---
I get what ya mean. It’s a complete lack of respect for what SHOULD be their coveted dedicated player-base. But we all know it and they all know it, yet here we are.
---
I am sure that once the hack is removed people will get their pipboys back.
---
There is zero chance Bethesda is starting those rumors. The PR is so much worse than any conversions to private servers.
---
Doing PvP with my friends keeps me playing. It’s the only thing to do at level 230. I rarely see hackers
---
Bethesda isn't the person. They are the architects of the house that players staying in it are at risk of getting robbed. Even if they forget to add in a door, the burgular is still committing a crime.
---
This post begs for empirical data.   
---
Anecdotally I've had more people in this game be total assholes than give gifts. This isn't to say that I haven't seen kindness, because I have, but man there are some major assholes in the community.
---
Are you asking how we tolerate YouTube people blowing things out of proportion?
---
I figure PvP happens most in customs, between friends. Thats nice to have a safe place though.
---
Only found one other post and it had three replies and no sure answer..
---
I mean, I agree with you. The hackers are scumbags, but you cannot try to lay no blame at Bethesda's feet. It's still their game, that doesn't have the right anti-hack measures.
---
If robbers decide to steal from a Bank on Christmas, loosing many people's valuables. And the bank never had the right security measures like having a vault to stop them getting in, or security to deter them, would you still think the bank is without blame.
---
There will always be bad people: hackers, exploiters, cheaters. However, Bethesda is providing a service, and as part of that service is security. If something happens, they are still equally or more to blame. That's how services work.
---
Nahhh we find a lot of action in adventure surprisingly, more people are opening up to PvP it seems. Generally they’re cool about it too and I friend them after
---
God, I feel sorry for your friends and family if you do this stuff to them too. Anyway, have a merry Christmas, mate.
---
LVL 160 with 15 AGL and no Dodgy card to be seen

I realize that, i mean, i watched nothing but gameplay videos and trailers &amp; sooome 'hype' vids about features &amp; such when it was coming out... But, im obviously not TOO invested nowadays, if you think YongYea is over the top, compare him to some other trash-talking channels...

I have lvl2 dodgy because I upgraded it
---
Console gang squad up
---
You might want to qualify your post, as cheaters/hackers are only 'rampant' on PC.  Not on consoles.
---
True, mb.
---
*Of course* the people actually abusing the system are assholes, no one is going to deny that.  But if we're talking about fault then it absolutely lands at the feet of the idiot architect who built a house without a door.
---
People suck.  Develop accordingly.
---
Or Hellgate: London where everyone had their characters deleted and were unrecoverable
---
Man I never felt good to be a console gamer. That sucks for pc people tho- hope it gets fixed quick
---
To ruin the game for as many people as possible and to do as much damage.
---
No.  There's only one Perk that affects items in your Stash, and that is Portable Power (affects Power Armor and chassis's)
---
I don’t watch youtubers talking about FO76. I can form my own opinions. After 600+ hours I can tell you it’s fun and runs as smoothly as any other online game I have. Yes it lags sometimes, but not more than any other game I play. It was rough at launch but has improved greatly. I have not seen any hacking being some duping exploits. I play on Xbox and have decent internet for what that is worth.
---
Are you comparing Bethesda to some fly by night  Indie company? Well I can see how their products would make you do that.
---
Yeah. Apparently this is only on PC. Most videos seem to neglect this detail.
---
That being said. I'm honestly kind of surprised FO76 really hasn't improved since launch.  I still play it (Xbone) and likely will continue to do so but I'm at the stage where the only work I can do, are the daily quests. Those get boring after the second time you've completed them.
---
Posts about 76 hacking posts being propaganda by Bethesda are propaganda by Obsidian employees trying to turn people against Bethedsa.

Edit:  Everyone who downvoted this post is in on it.  Pull up the video, Jamie.
---
For a long time, the trading community was what was keeping me playing the game.  I haven't logged in for over a week now since I pretty much got all the gear I could ever want and there's no new content to use it on, not to mention the new hack floating around.
---
You are probably fine
---
Hating on the game was popular when it came out and got youtube views which was easy money.  At this point the only reason I can think of is because they hate that people are actually enjoying it.
---
So, realistically, you may be ok. The source code was just released about an hour ago. The guy who did so removed some key parts, which means this one will take a slightly higher level of coding knowledge than the spawner one we just had. 
---
That being said, I don't think anyone knows where it's going to go before Bethesda patches it. I'm hoping that, with all the new players we'll have and all the existing base, we won't see too many people affected. Some will be though, and I hope Bethesda can help those folks out.
---
[removed]
---
that was different. It was a full on attack on the psn, not a game exploit. apples to oranges dude.
---
That is why i made this post frankly, thats a pretty scary hack. I'd stay in offline games or customs to be safe, if i we're playing. And i've heard trading is big in 76, which i love in games actually (im an ESO salesman).
---
So hackers are looking to kill the game. Seriously, This isn't something bethesda can deal with before it happens. Hacks like this happen in a lot of games and tend to only be solvable in a reactive sense I should know I Have worked with a few.  
---
This is litteraly a type of hack that has killed games, and if bethesda can take care of it quickly well we might see them get into the good graces of the player base but if not 76 may truely be dead.
---
Better than playing hunched over a pc and keyboard and having all your inventory items stolen
---
The odds are about the same as getting in a car accident.
---
Yeah, and the trapdoors don't even have a navmesh, which means NPCs can't walk over them.
---
Guess I’ll keep playing call of duty then XD
---
Are you trying to strawman me to boost your pathetic ego? Also if you hate this game so much, why are you even here? Judging from your post history you offer nothing constructive or interesting other than pointless toxicity. Maybe you might have better luck posting on a Star Wars forum or something, because your intentions are becoming more and more transparent.
---
nope, this is different. That was a full on distributed denial of service attack. Lizard Squad also had a history of attacking networks and leaving huge blast radii with large amounts of collateral damage. This is a game exploit, executed because of vulnerabilites in the game client code. Bethesda would have an extremely hard time pinning legally on an individual.
---
I won't watch the video, but the fact that the OP was able to spend 700k caps is absolute evidence that the caps limit is a total sham
---
Same reason the NW aimbots only work in 200m distance. Draw distance.
---
And you'd blame the battered housewife for being hit in the first place...
---
The container has a 10lb weight limit. It takes somewhere between 45-60 minutes to fill depending on what it collects.
---
This sucks.
---
All the best rewards (other than the icicle lights, come from NW.
---
What does a player that absolutely despises this game mode do to get a "holiday tree"?
---
Does this include our private stash or just what we have on us?  If it's just our direct inventory I would say  pack light and dont stay in one place very long.  I just bought this damn game too. If I wanted full loot I would of stayed on albion online.
---
I definitely agree on the Lizard Squad dude getting locked up for sure. Play stupid games get stupid prizes. I don't think it would be quite as easy or even possible to bring a similar case against an individual exploiting a game client that is already known to have vulnerabilities... that said, who knows I'm no lawyer.
---
Yes. I say this because a few days ago I saw some folks running around with miniguns that shoot nukes on adventure mode and had a ton of crazy stuff in their camp. The odds may be slim, but it is totally plausible with all the madness going on right now that it totally can happen.
---
You can see my post where I indeed got attacked and called a troll/liar, and why not, a 'fucking lying bitch' too.
---
At this point, I don't give a shit about this community. You guys really like to swing around the mantra that you are the nicest community, but you are nothing of the sort.
---
Also, I see people are a being a bit abusive towards you about this topic. And don't think that's ok, especially if you don't understand how or why this hack is happening.
---
A background. The hack is basically allowing to loot everything from a person, much like you would from a container. The reason this is possible is because Bethesda basically just ported all of Fallout 4s code, and then changed a bit for making it online, but alot of the underlying code is still there. It makes it very easy to manipulate the system (case and point, people have been able to add the prydwen; a giant floating ship from fallout 4, into fallout 76 because it's in the game files even though it has nothing to do with this game). So basically people have modified the single player code (which is there in the game still) to work for them, and so they can loot everything.
---
Alot of these hacks have come from the fact that Bethesda basically just slightly modified a single player game into a multiplayer, but left all the loopholes for people to exploit and their system of anti-cheat or following up/banning cheaters is almost non-existent.
---
 If i were gonna get the game, i'd get it on console, bc your experience sounds ALOT better. And what region are you on?
---
Even better lol pop your chems and hit a quantum and let that Tesla rip
---
Criminal charges would be on federal prosecutor.
---
Bethesda only needs to know who they are and they can file a civil case against them for any revenue that they estimate was lost due to the hackers misconduct.
---
I’ve had encounters with pvp many times, back when survival was an option, to get those weekly weapons. And I honestly hated all of it. I only had one pvp encounter that was engaged from both parties. And I believe that’s how pvp should be.
---
I'm calling it now: this is going to end just the spawner did. Where all of us who were trying to report end up attacked for doing so, the people here doing the attacking then get affected and attacked after complaining, Bethesda patches it, and no one acknowledges how the community turned on itself.
---
Oh man that's not hard to get. The first 3 rewards are super easy. You could have all 3 in 3 or 4 matches
---
[deleted]
---
Hacks like this happen in a lot of games. Think the first one I Have seen it happen in was runescape 2 back in the day.  
---
Not making an excuse for bethesda as every time a hack like this happen it can make or break a company. If they react fast enough and plug it they can save the game and show they are wanting us to keep playing.  
---
If they can't it will kill the game. But yeah everyone stick to NW or PRivate servers for now if on PC.   
---
  
---
And reminder reaction to these types of hacks are always reactionary as hackers who make these are good at finding loopholes that even the devs can't find.
---
Each vendor only has 1 or 2 pieces of gift wrap. You can get 6-8 pieces inside the Whitespring and then server hop.

Melee build here, I could never get the Tesla to be even half decent for me. Sometimes I feel like a chump with how easily someone else could kill me with one of those! Lmao
---
I miss when melee was awesome in PVP back in the day pop a stealthboy and punch ppl in the face with a bloodied gauntlet, was loads of fun
---
here is what I said and the responses to some questions
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/edsm4m/the_hackers_that_spawned_the_prydwen_sent_me_a/fbm4hu7/
---
Hunched over? I dunno what you see but I'm generally leaning back. PC is the way to go for ANY game...
---
No build is complete at 50-56, at least not one that is going to be competitive in PVP and fun in PVE.
---
They’ve been there along with all the others since the initial ones were released with Lying Lowe. It’s likely they are intended for another event or quest.
---
Don't get me wrong I totally think if Bethesda could manage to find people actively using the exploit, they could most definitely bring a civil case against them (they would only need preponderance(sic?) of evidence), and people using the exploit would totally deserve it. That said I don't think it would be easy or really possible to bring criminal charges that would hold any kinda of water in a federal criminal court... that said, again I'm just an average idiot, not a lawyer so who knows...
---
Honestly, I love the environment of the game. I think they crafted an amazing world to explore. Not to mention the positive player interactions which outweigh all the negative ones I've had. 
---
Sure there's an occasional issue with hacking, but Bethesda has addressed those issues relatively well. While we have a new one that was just released, I think Bethesda will get a fix out quickly before too many players are affected. It's pretty common for developers and hackers to be in a constant state of back-and-forth. I'd say FO76 has a slightly higher-than-average issue with explouts, but that's mainly because of how the creation engine was designed to be for solo experiences. As time goes on, it gets more optimized for online play.
---
There are a couple different hacks and supposedly a much worse hack coming in the next couple days. 
---
I would trust your gut. If you really want to continue playing this dumpster fire, that's your business, but you may want to take a break until it is resolved..if ever.
---
You realize the players are the battered housewife in this scenario, right?  I'm not blaming the players.  
---
Looks like you need to put some perk points on reading comprehension

👍🏻
---
Yeah I'm no lawyer either but I'm pretty sure there are laws in place to protect software developers from malicious activity. The fact that these people are not only planning to unleash this during a holiday while Bethesda employees are on vacation, but are bragging about it in chat groups shows malicious intent.
---
I'm sorry a game you like is turning into a waste of time and money for you. If we as gamers demand better quality from these companies instead of chugging the koolaid it will help gaming as a whole. What you call Toxicity is merely me calling out shoddy products and corporate greed.
---
Went does a PC only bug make you want to stop playing on PS4?
---
It's not. It's both.
---
If someone robs your house? Yeah, that's on them.
---
If you left your doors unlocked, a few windows open, and had empty boxes stacked outside from a bunch of new expensive items you recently purchased? You fucked up pretty bad.
---
Both things can be true at the same time. The hackers are assholes for taking advantage of this exploit, but Bethesda was seriously negligent in their security to even allow this exploit to be possible.
---
Not sure what you are talking about source code being released, unless they officially published the cheat. I haven’t checked that forum yet to see if it has been updated.
---
The method/tool for this already exists. It had been shown off in numerous videos. From what I can tell the guy who publishes all of these just like his shit finely polished, so he’s just putting on the finishing touches.
---
The user released it about an hour ago. He removed some of the stuff from it so it isn't fully plug-in-play, but it's out there.
---
Very odd. 
---
Have you tried re-logging?
---
There are games that do that. "Apex Legends" for example doesn't ban you if you get caught cheating, you don't even get a notification. Instead you just get matched with other cheaters in seperate games from now on.
---
The problem with FO76 is that i doubt they actually have the logs / tools to efficiently identify cheats. This happens if you take the engine from a mod-friendly singleplayer game and put a multiplayer component on top of it. Bethesda took the easy way to create this game and recycled as much they could from FO4. Unfortunately, the players have to pay the price for it now :(
---
Did he start a new thread or is it in one of the old ones?
---
Same one as the spawner. He did his usual method of providing a single post link to it. It's on pg 59.
---
Bethesda really just needs to implicate a system to level up our weapons so we're not stuck having to trade them in all the time!
---
The sky is falling the sky is falling 😂😂😂
---
As unreal as it seems, It is real.
---
Don't accept trade anymore, rumors even tell that some guys manage to get your gear from "afar" but no idea if it's true, won't risk it tho.
---
Yes, hackers are emptying player inventories.
---
Ah, ok. Figured he would start a new thread with as much publicity as this was getting for him.
---
Has anybody else been affected so far?
---
For my part, what draws me consistently into FO76 is the lore, the setting, and the atmosphere.  The biomes are gorgeous, and the game just feels like the Fallout setting, smack dab after the Great War.  
---
I haven't been impacted as much by the negatives, particularly the Hacking, as I focus mainly on PVE instead of PVP.  However, we'll see how the next month handles things.
---
Um, you do know there are videos proving this happens? For starters, watch the video linked in the OP’s post.
---
US
---
Weapon Swap.
---
If they applied same code from nuke winter to not allow any mods on PC would that fix it?
---
I thought the guy who created the hack hadn't made it public yet. Damn.
---
I've already learnt the game but I just don't like PvP it sucks so the only way to get what I want is hide I ain't bothered if you like it or not I tell you what I would consider it an honour if you find and kill me expect a bullet in your face for your troubles though
---
I think he's enjoying the attention he's getting. He asked people not to abuse the script, as if that'll stop people.
---
As long as they're within ~200m or so, the hackers can steal your inventory.  They don't even need to trade or have a line of sight.
---
Sometimes they do, sometimes they don’t. I don’t know the exact number but I did get scrip today.
---
I think its random. Sometimes u get caps. Other times u get script. Sometimes you get the mountef opposum head.
---
He absolutely has, anyone that has a merit of coding can change it to be malicious.
---
"Let me give the company who broke the game even MORE money, that will fix it!"
---
Maybe it’s Sony and Microsoft teaming up to get you to buy a console 🤫
---
It's like driving without a seatbelt. It's unlikely for something to happen, but if it does you'll have no  protection. The level of damage to character will depend on how "fast and loose" you are playing; with what you are carrying around. I'd say just to be careful, maybe use your lesser weapons if possible, only use armor if it's necessary for your character, don't carry an abundance of ammo or any important items and just keep checking the Reddit, especially around Christmas, because the rumour is that this is the beginning and that hackers are planning to drop an actual installation for people to be able to use this much more easily.
---
I'd say, definitely play it safe until Bethesda fixes it.
---
Overdramatization is a common problem for all news venues.  FO76 is not an exception. 
---
FO76 is mostly PVE.  Though PVP mechanics exist in the game, they are unbalanced at the moment and I wouldn’t recommend FO76 to players seeking PVP,
---
Overall, saying that FO76 is a disaster would be equivalent of calling a “fender-bender” a “multi-car-crash”.  Though technically correct, there are better ways to describe it.
---
Keep in mind that players on this subreddit are the most demanding 5-10% of the player base.  This is where you come to learn the innermost workings (not workings) of the game.  Many posters “here” have 1000+ hours in the game (is that a good value?)
---
For most players, the problems/bugs are a minor inconvenience and are far from game breaking.
---
Change the title to PC Users!- Stay Clear.. theres no reason to scare the console users or confuse them at this point.
---
What starts out as a moral debate   
---
"Is it the architect or the burglars fault if someone gets robbed?"
---
Turns into your personal vendetta playground towards a company or hot topic.
---
There are a couple hacks out in the wild and supposedly another even nastier one will come out on Xmas.
---
Sure ur not mixing up fusion cores with plasma cores they look identical
---
My prayers and condolences to those of you on PC 🙏 that's absolutely shitty you have to worry about something like this.
---
Pipboy that are removed are returned upon a relog
---
Just today I built a concrete foundation bunker with tall walls and a ceiling and I built out side of the map behind my bunker, all on the side of a rocky hill. So I found out how to do it without the campfire which is cool.
---
If you have a legendary . 44 (or I can make you a standard one) I have still got 1000. 44 I made by accident (don't ask😔) been giving away free to low levels...
---
It was actually posted and you. And you can find it yourself very easily.
---
Good thing money isnt an issue for me.
---
Check your hard drive speed
---
we literally just had a double xp weekend
---
Yes I have and thinking about it I haven't seen the LVL 1 dodgy at all previously and I change out thru-hiker and sneak cards all the time, so when I upgraded to lvl2 dodgy I went to equip it and it's not there. Could to many dupes cause it to push out and not show up  ? I tried equipping every thing I could but still no dodgy showed up.
---
Thank God I'm on Xbox 😅
---
Psychology fact of the day was really cool man.
---
Ahah I hesitated about posting originally especially because of conspirations that could result of it. I don’t think it’s a ploy, but **it does** give a bigger purpose currently to the ongoing problem.
---
This is a great roll and a valuable weapon.  (As was already mentioned in another reply and just so that you don’t miss it)...
---
I would easily pay 20k+ in a vendor (and that’s considering that I already have a similar 50cal).
---
It’s a high trade value weapon.
---
You sir , are the biggest fanboy in history.
---
They're called scrips, not scripts.
---
If they haven't been able to put an anti-cheat or actual server/client validation for a year now, you think they would now?
---
Why would it keep you from getting atoms?
---
Depends what kind of cheat it is. Cheats like aim bots are very hard to remove because they make legitimate actions that real players could make. Stealing someone's entire inventory is not a legitimate action so it's trivial to have some kind of check on the backend.
---
As far as I know there have been no exploits on the Xbox one to allow running custom code.
---
This is genuinely so sad, I’m sorry someone took your stuff. Hackers have made the game (Atleast to me) unplayable. I’m still logging on and getting my limited time nuclear winter awards and checking for free atom shop items. But I can’t trust adventure mode atm, I can’t risk losing my stuff or my pip boy for that matter. Hopefully it gets fixed quickly after Christmas.
---
I have been running finding scorched for presents the last couple of days in the hopes that I can wear my Santa Claus power armor and run around to give Christmas presents Christmas morning to people in the game in the community. This just makes me incredibly sad. I love the community in the game and the fact that some people derive their self-worth and pleasure from the misery of others is more than schadenfreude, it's just pure banality. Go find something else to destroy. We're trying to have fun here.
---
Someone else just posted in the new section of this subreddit that someone took some of his/her weapons. Sad.
---
why? when valve can do it when it goes to steam
---
Yes, don’t risk it mate. 2 people just posting in this sub reporting missing items from inventory.
---
But what is your strength without PA?
---
The same thing happened to me earlier today and most users called me troll and 'lying bitch'. I hope you don't go through that here too.
---
Also the mods removed my post, so...
---
My cat is a bit of a mouser so he has a massive bell. Every time he starts scratching if I'm in a party people hear him through mic and think there's a Xmas Scorched..
---
Theres challenges to repair chest armor. Can't repair what doesnt break. 😕
---
You don't want compensation for all the shit you have to deal with in this game?
---
It's insane... but as I said in a recent video, we desperately need an anti-cheat system for all modes. More and more hackers are coming because this is a paradise for hacking. They can do as they please.
---
Except the ones suffering (the players) are not the ones who failed to stop the hackers. You got burgled because the landlord, Bethesda, didn't put up bars.
---
Sadly that seems to be what people do. This all happened with the spawner too.
---
I recommend that you contact Bethesda through a support ticket, they may be able to roll your character back.
---
Yeah, I will do that now that I'm more calmed. Still incredibly frustrated, though.
---
Thanks!
---
So you're saying..."get out of my swamp?"
---
I get that completely. I'd be so upset if I lost everything.
---
I've been reporting this stuff as much as possible. Sadly those who attack the affected players are helping the hackers by dividing this community.
---
1) Did the mods give you a reason for removing the post?
---
2) Did you initiate the trading window before your items were stolen?
---
I've only had rabbits and chickens fall out of the sky. Then I look up and VOILA  Salty ass Scorchbeast!
---
This is just ridiculous. How is this even a thing? Name one other game in which people can just steal other people's stuff from their inventory with a hack. I'm staggered. I can't believe they haven't killed the servers by now.
---
You got burgled because there's a burglar. Let's put the blame first and foremost on the person deciding to commit a crime.
---
Not one of the affected players, but I've been refreshing here and the Bethesda forums all day. Posts about this keep getting removed. I think it's mainly from being downvoted off here though.
---
There was no reason. I just came back to it and saw it was removed. Mods in reddit are mostly free to do whatever they want, so it's no surprise, really. I just wish my post would be used as a warning at least, if nothing else.
---
No, I didn't trade anything. Normally I never accept trade invites from other players.
---
Wouldnt be much of a bother if it wasnt one of the few I have left that wasnt bugged.
---
Only workshop materials*
---
How about a refund?
---
Every major hack we've had has come from leftover issues from FO4. Bethesda needs to go through the list of issues from FO4 and get those fixes here.
---
If they aren’t weapons/armour with the super looked after effects I do the same.
---
If they have blood/junkies/unyielding/bolstering I sell them for 1K.
---
If they have AP regen or poison resist on top of that I sell them for 5K.
---
5K sometimes sell slow but then someone comes along, snaps them up and sells them for 25K.
---
I guess I am going to ask, "Let them eat cake"; Does it go without saying that those on the private servers won't have an issue if you 'know' your party members?
---
And if you played NW on PC for double XP it was absolute hell.
---
&gt; Could it be shitty code
---
Is this *really* a question you have to ask Bethesda of all people?
---
Definitly needs to be an increase for everyone for their stash especially with wastelanders coming
---
I have one encounter on PS4 but none ever since, someone spawned a prydwen above white springs trainstation, but the person i'm guessing had the console disconnected from online services in the next minute.
---
They may be trying to avoid potential witch-hunting and mass panic.  I've been told by one of the mods that they're "discussing how to handle it".  
---
If you haven't already, you should submit a ticket at make sure to submit a support ticket at https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
For bloody builds (IMO) unyielding works best.
---
You could run 1-2 Chameleon pieces if you rely on stealth.  AngryTurtle recently did an excellent experiment on stealth effects.  It seems that it’s worthwhile to equip 2 Chameleon piece.
---
AP regen is the most useful secondary.  
---
Tertiary depends on your play style (sentinel/cavalier or weight reduction)
---
That’s a terrifying thought, to think there’s something worse coming.
---
I agree with this. I like it even. I hate someone trying to sabatoge a game studio with minimal involvement. Sorta like politic now a days. Run around, scream and shout. The sun still comes up. Meh.
---
yea I hear you dude. I totally agree on the timing being incredibly shitty as well, on top of ruining the game for innocent players just trying to have a good time with it.
---
Yeah, I can understand that, even though my opinion is different.
---
I will, thanks.
---
I love this game all i want is for it to just work.
---
You can do it with a stealth commado build I used nukes and dragons to map it put was originally 57 but I can cut one of each of the commando perks cuase the damage cap of 110
---
Btw Unless they have a plan to sell they can’t just give you a backpack with one of those mods on it because you can’t drop backpacks
---
Why would anyone steal an all rise? I can't buy it but not saying you are lying. Just hard to believe with all the good roll items to steak they go after a script weapon.
---
That's disconcerting
---
It’s probably a tactic to encourage people to buy fallout 1st for the private worlds
---
I know, I meant can anyone trade me the plan so I can learn it then give it back
---
You know it uses the plan right, can’t give it back, plus as far as I know you can only get one of those plans per character so gl getting someone to sell it
---
Armour drops from the vendor factor in what armour types you can craft and some unique ones. So if you can make HCA it has a chance to drop for you.
---
That needs to be a thing if u die people can take ur pipboys could be a pvp trophy
---
i mean.. you have that option.. for $13 a month
---
This works great at the source - Morgantown airport - Collision Course
---
Went to do this event - there were already 4 crates there + the one that dropped from event.  All lootable
---
just now someone stole all my armor set from the distance and left my character naked
---
Not sure man.  I said that because mine died once and i was stuck there.  Took 10 minutes before i realized it was dead.
---
We are still the master race.
---
  Console will always be safe. If they could manipulate code on a console the last thing they would do is go after a game item when they could package it and sell for millions to bootleg games.
---
You could only join on someone's private world if you were on their friendlist, you couldn't just randomly get into someone's private world.  
---
That's still pretty damn private.
---
oh, boo!
---
Would be a  nice time for them to double size of private servers
---
I'll be on all night
---
I think that they don’t actually choose what to take on their end, instead they just wipe what a player has equipped
---
Is this happening on console as well?
---
On for awhile
---
2-2-1 Bolstering-Unyielding-Chameleon/Powered/Harder 2 Detect
---
Don’t be overly concerned.  It’s ot a simple hack to do (not yet at least).   In any case, hackers will be targeting players level 100+ for the loot
---
He is safe because no amount of work would make it possible. Console is a secure kernel hence there being no bootleg games since the good days of the 360.
---
Hasnt stopped me from playing. No problems and haven't heard a peep from other players
---
I agree with modern consoles. The few people who've managed big mods like that end up getting the console banned. We've really cone a long way since the 360. I wish PC could be as secure for online.
---
That was patched a while ago.
---
I saw that Ghoulish let me regenerate in combat every time I took radiation damage so a radioactive creature can basically grant you health regeneration. It is pretty fast for the first level too.
---
The private servers are also bugging out right now and you can only play by yourself as it will kick everyone else out right quick, regardless of it they are on your friends list or you are in a team with them.
---
If you haven't already, you should submit a support ticket at https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
Edit: fixed a few words
---
Ex nihlio might reign on PC, but on ps4 you can only get the overseer rewards through skill.
---
I level up and farm caps by playing NW on an alt. I like to wear the Samurai helmet, so when my level 19 is landing shots you know you're dying on purpose.
---
Err instigating explosive double barrel I guess.
---
I like it!  I could see some pvp action happening there.
---
Needs at least one fertilizer vein I think, placed very close to a headstone.
---
I put my santatron inside a 1x1 brick building with a keypad entry. I watched a guy come running up, jump "through" the wall and get a wanted lvl of 5 caps lockpicking my santatron. He fast traveled out immediately after. Thought it would be safe inside the brick lol

This really is an urgent matter, could I ask that you make private worlds available to all on PC until this is confirmed as fixed?  I am genuinely worried to login at the moment, as I do not want to lose the items I have had since beta.
---
Imagine having a game this buggy
---
Go to Encryptid.
---
Bethesda better do something and fast
---
The issue is if they US based or not. If they are in a different country,  there are different laws and there may be nothing Bethesda can do.
---
Yeah, it's called finding out early. You think it's not real until hundreds of people get robbed? K.
---
I really loved your camp! The design is really neat! I didn’t ask for anything because I don’t need anything but thank you for sharing your camp :) I hope you have a good Christmas
---
has that ever happened?
---
\^This.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Thanks you could look through my plans as well if you want
---
Sure I’ll drop by later if you’re still around. Gonna watch a movie with my sister :)
---
The whole stealing of inventory hack is completely unproven from a YouTuber that only puts out negative FO76 vids.
---
No it doesn't.
---
There is nothing you can do in a private server that you can't do in a public server, you don't gain ANY advantage from private servers so there's no way to win from it.
---
Happy holidays
---
I just did that glitch too and I stacked foundations by doing a bunker base on the side of a hill.
---
Oh shoot, it got patched?
---
Happened right a few minutes ago to myself. Luckely the guy just stripped my powerarmor and bloodied lever action rifle including ammo (\~ 10k .45), because i have lots of rare stuff in my inventory. But he gave me the lever action and powerarmor back, but it's still really annoing to lose all your ammo of your main-gun. I just gave the question-mark-emote and he just said via voice-chat "yea exploid man"... So i was just thinking, that this guy was just doing some testing and didn't wanted to hurt anyone. But right after that he joined a queen-event. I joined also and said to him via voice-chat, that he stole all my .45 ammo, hoping that he would give it back to me but than he stripped everyone nearby, causing a big chaos. Then i disconnected quick to be safe.
---
Due to reddit-regulations i'm not writing any names but he was a level 2-char with a glowing-skull-mask.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Checked all my inventory after that, but as far as i've seen, he didn't took anything else.
---
Reported the guy right away, but due to Bethesda i'm not really convinced that i'm getting anything back.
---
Lucky me, i got away with a blue eye, because i do often idle in my camp to sell some stuff. So for now i'm going to be out of the game, as long as this isn't fixed. Every PC-Player should be careful these days and stay offline or if you're 1st subscriber, just stay in your private world. My Fallout 1st subscription is ending tomorrow, so i don't have to pay anything for something i'm not using...
---
They straight up DID address those things, you being ignorant doesn't mean Bethesda is bad.
---
Call them out on shit they've actually not addressed or fucked up, don't spread lies about things they have addressed.
---
To help visualize this, think of the game engine and it’s subsequent reuse in sequels as a stack of chairs. Ideally, each release would build on the one before and get you a stable platform, like this:
---
https://i.imgur.com/8VEhZYX.jpg
---
Do it wrong, and any glitch from before threatens the stability of that stack, so it’s weak and tottering, like this:
---
https://i.imgur.com/bSiuEbr.jpg
---
Later Bethesda titles are like the second picture, and this was the case before they tacked on multiplayer.  Now visualize multiple stacks of chairs balanced all together and you start to grasp the extent of the problems with Fallout 76’s engine. It’s a miracle it works at all.
---
Before the walls load in for someone who's just FT to your camp, they're simply not there for that player and can be walked through. There's ultimately no way to stop someone from taking what's in your Santatron. 
---
Last night I saw a guy on the map FT to a camp, get +5 wanted, FT to another camp, +5 wanted there, and saw him pop in just below my camp. I just had time to take everything out of my locked Santatron but a single piece of fertilizer before he arrived and lockpicked his way in. I hope he thought it was as funny as I did.
---
Yep. Also the world quests
---
Yea sounds like a blast.
---
Well, if you dont want to watch that's ok. To each their own, I worked really hard on it though so if you do decide go watch it I hope you enjoy. 👍
---
I had been logged on for a few hours at that point. He didn't fast yravel to me, I saw him running around down the road whole I was doing other stuff at my camp, I watched him just come running down the road so the walls should have been loaded I would think
---
The photomode and camera features are fairly popular. Photo modes in general seem to be really well-recieved these days. I imagine the next offline betheada game will have it too, and it'll work better since you can actually pause it then. Dont gotta worry about that random ghoul trying to take a swipe at you while posing lol
---
The weapon does 670 damage possibly 740 when with all tank build
---
That's pretty funny
---
On the one hand, i play on ps4, and im happy no one bothers to do hacks like this on console.
---
On the other hand, this is beyond unacceptable.
---
Bethesda, i know you're gearing up to go on your holiday vacation, but... come on. This needs to be fixed.
---
And where is this? The fallout 76 Twitter is empty and inside the Vault was shilling 2 NPC’s from the Wastelanders dlc.
---
Yeah, quite some time ago. I can see if I can find the patch notes it was corrected in for ya.
---
oof
---
This ***is*** the nasty one.  Christmas came early for the bad guys.
---
Seems like you think it’s all a hoax and people are making it up. I would agree with you. The few posts I’ve seen of people warning of this and having “proof” all have made videos blah blah blah. It’s like these you tubers are just trying to get people to watch their lame ass videos. I’m on PS4 so who knows maybe I’m wrong.
---
Man, what a great community this game has. Well, there is the hacker/shitface element. But the majority of people have always seemed chill like you. I personally playing because I was forever crashing, and now I'm waiting for room renovations so I can set up my pc again.
---
In the day of social media its basically free advertising lol.
---
I am having the issue that even after days stuff is not respawning.  I have been using the charelston fire station to get lead up untill last update and now I got to loot the weights in fire station once for all the lead, got dropped and my drop bag got stolen and been checking every day on my private server only to see it not respawning.  And I spawn in just up the road about 25-50 meters
---
It's only what you have on you, minus caps and keys and undroppable quest items. It effectively turns your character into a world container which, really, is all it is. What makes this so insidious is you don't have to be engaged in a trade dialogue or anything that would normally expose your player inventory to them. The other player just has to be in your vicinity.
---
That's good news for the inventory theft. Just makes me sad about not getting or making custom legendaries tho. That would be awesome. Not to break the market with, but to play and emjoy
---
Everyone on the PC without First Private Worlds is at risk. Better to be safe than sorry. I moved all my valuable equipment to the stash and replaced it with second tier stuff from my vendor or crafted that I don't care about. I'm kind of enjoying the new stock minimulist look. I always carry around too much stuff anyways. I rediscovered how good The Fixer is for stealth commandos.
---
I don't play because 1 it's kinda dull right now and 2 constant instability and being booted every few minutes. I have friends that play on PC and I worry for how long will it take for it to spread to consolea
---
yes, but it only takes a single run in with a ass hat to ruin over a years worth of work.
---
There are multiple articles on inside the Vault.
---
Bethesda said they are going to reverse the change to reloading which will get rid of the bug, bringing back the old bug in it's place, until they fix it without any bug in it's place.
---
I can't remember what they said about the hacking incident however, but they did address it quickly having fixed the problem in 3 days.
---
Jesus Christ, this game is mad craic.
---
Funny thing - Scorchbeasts were originally going to be mutated vultures.  The models are still in the game files: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=otxKe1CXOmE
---
Good lord, this game is cursed.
---
&gt;FO1
---
Fallout 1?
---
Probably close to the same as being in the exact spot where and when a horde event spawns the boss.  Spoiler: you get to kill the legendary horde boss multiple times as it continuously respawns it and it’s buddies for a minute or so.
---
Yet you care enough to post about it on here?
---
I got kicked today bc "account signed in on another device" which just wouldn't be a possibility unless.. has this happened before? I've been playing awhile and that's the first it's happened to me.
---
Dedicated containers would be very convenient all round
---
really? the ones i get aren't lootable
---
I'm sure you could if you found the right person. Platform may play a factor though as the backpacks got duped on PC.
---
I'm on Xbox
---
lol who is even still playing this clusterfuck game? guys... it was time to abandon ship ages ago. bethesda clearly is no good
---
This can be a multi issue.   There are a few ways to try and fix it.  I ended up just doing a factory reset and keeping my apps and games.  Then I deleted and reinstalled fallout.  Make sure you dont have to many games on your xbox.  It can slow it dow.  But sometimes the standard Bethesda response works and fixes the issue.  I also reset my routers every few days.
---
This is debatable for me during an event like this. If you can pay to ensure that no one farms the location you want to farm, is it really fair for everyone?  I currently don’t have 1st so have to farm on public servers, and about every other one in every three has someone doing the same thing as me, or who was there just before me.
---
Also, with the change to how pvp works at workshops I would say it is definitely pay to win. If you look on any post about farming Holiday Gifts using workshops you will see that it is practically a requirement to be in a private server to avoid theft of griefing.
---
To a lesser extent, public servers also seem a lot more laggy or worn out I guess you could call it. With all the glitches blocking enemies from respawning so runs are virtually useless after following someone using a laser or plasma weapon. And now harpoons and railways can cause the issue too. I frequently see naked, headless scorch that jingle or santa scorched that spawn as non legendary/don’t drop gifts.
---
Nah it's a hack.  It relies on the fact that FO is a single player game that was used as the basis for a multiplayer one. Erectban didn't do it though. No one knows who
---
So what are u saying, they strip u naked?
---
Low levelers tried to add me to team, they were near vault 76, I was crouched and on the other side of the map, I only know where they were after I searched the map to see who the hell these randos were trying to team. They probably were using the social tab to find me, my guess is they comb the social tab for recent logins and look for non vanilla icons to determine what level you might be.
---
Another player I spoke to said he had a low leveler just walk towards him and steal appeal from his inventory, the thief then proceeded to sprint to his stash, no trade, no bag, and no interaction.
---
I have no video evidence, so take it or leave it, better safe than sorry is all.
---
That's the exact same thing as the Crafting Bag in ESO.
---
You have to buy the badges. Go to the market and look around there.
---
That's why they're giving us 3 weeks to do it.
---
 I agree it is a hefty sum, maybe 2-3 separate days for the last challenge, but if you focus on 1 challenge a day and don't burn yourself out, then it becomes a little more of a mountable task.
---
haha... yea no, it's also bethesda's fault.
---
they made a game with open source modding tools that has online multiplayer survival aspects and the framework of it is so incredibly bad old and dusty that hacks like this are insanely easy to do. that, and the lack of any serious anticheat is some next level buffoonery.
---
sure, the hackers are certainly to blame big time but let's be real here... bethesda left the doors wide open for this to happen and clearly never even bothered to double check them because *money*.
---
EDIT for analogy: The hackers are shooters, bethesda basically left a loaded gun out for them to use. obviously you blame BOTH parties.
---
Pretty trivial to get a different IP...
---
The bloodied hitman ran away with your stuff 🤔
---
we found the comedian
---
yup. this. it is hugely on bethesda's shoulders that people can even do stuff like this in the first place. the hackers are assholes, but bethesda put the gun in their hand.
---
Bethesda at this point release a FREE offline mode. I dont want to log in and have all my hard earned loot stolen from me.
---
This was the first thing I did, though i’m not optimistic that I’ll get my items back
---
Even with private servers, when crashing. You lose the workshops. I tested this out
---
It would have been diabolical if Beth didn’t make an anti cheat for adventure mode and “made” one for the private servers to get an extra flow of cash.
---
I wanna play it. For the lulz but I dont wanna pay $20. I'd pay $5. I hope they do another free week.
---
Let’s pray that those FO76 hackers get even better treatment 🙏🏻
---
How can someone steal your armor or weapon if I may ask? Since your on pc and the options for cheat mechanisms are far greater than on console, is this a pc problem or how should someone be able to steal your shit?
---
EDIT: I have my filter on „new post“ and haven’t checked the hot ones the last days, so I wasn’t aware of this. But damn, that’s bad...
---
Destiny 2 is free, fun, and plenty grindy
---
you need to unlock the framerate by going into your fallout 76 ini file and adding the line iPresentinterval=0. the game will run WAY better. make sure you go borderless fullscreen too.
---

---
Good ol' Bethesda. Introducing a solution to a problem they themselves created. AND charging for said solution.
---
Well, that is disappointing. I really wasn't expecting much and I ended up working too much but I thought I'd have some time to play. I guess I will watch a youtube video or something to try and figure out what the hell is going on with those presents people are talking about.
---
Exactly. Every one else is doing it. I dont give a single F in the chat. For your information that is.
---
Completely agree.  Launch was rough, but it’s great now.  I personally haven’t been affected by the vast majority of bugs reported, and the few I have experienced didn’t really hinder the gameplay, just minor cosmetic things ( slender man power armor, etc.)  or required a simple work around. 
---
This game is absolutely massive in scope, there’s a ton of different end game loops you can get in to.  Raiding, crafting, trading, plan hunting, camp building, finishing your character build.  Don’t get me wrong, the game definitely needs new content at this point, but most players in the community have thousands of hours of playtime, anything gets stale after that without content injection.  
---
The negative is blown out of proportion IMO.  The good in this game far outweighs the bad, but haters gonna hate.
---
😉
---
Possum badges don't get you legendary items.  It is possible to get the item you want from the purveyor for legendary scrip.
---
How the devil did you get so many possum badges?
---
Same was happening to me the other day. And supply drops also.
---
Because maybe they'll fix it and I might want to reinstall it.  Unfortunately it seems more and more unlikely every time I hear something new about this game.
---
Steam, where I bought garrysmod full price and put 5000 hours into it.
---
Plot twist: Bethesda implemented the exploit themselves to boost 1st membership subscriptions...
---
a buddy of mine gave me a junkie fixer he got, it's only 2 star, and it doesn't have the other effects I'm looking for, but I gave him my 2 shot one for it. I did give him a bloody one a while back though
---
A hunting bugs, a-hunting bugs, out here in Appalachia! I’ve gotten 48 across four toons.
---
Tried my hand at this and noticed something interesting. The workshops were producing 2-6 presents every half hour or so, while my camp got one gift in 2 hours. Is this normal? I had 5 workshops going and did a round every half hour to collect.
---
maybe this is just a ploy for them to release 'item insurance' in the atom shop.  if you have your item insured, it'll be replaced no questions asked... only 24.99 per item.
---
You're welcome. It should be noted that there are places where there's vendorbots that aren't in train stations. Usually "faction" orientated bots. I'd be interested in whether you get better prices the more quests you do for them.... I'm still learning myself :) so thanks for your kindness in thanking me.
---
It's totally fine to rob a house that was unlocked. But what do I know, I'm also not a lawyer.
---
No griefing, you could take every base if you wanted without fear that some group of 4 people will just kill you for your stuff, right now if I had 1st I could store more junk and more weapons to make more money in the game better odds of getting better weapons etc you lack perception and imagination, I was not going to buy the game I was on the fence I so wanted the game as I have not had an FO game at launch except maybe 2 and tactics and it was based on the place where I was born and I so wanted to go back to and it looked great  I got about 3 hours during the beta it was so buggy but I thought it was just overloaded many of the same bugs are there today but yes we were lied to and asking us to pay more for single player is a joke I already paid 60 for the game and 60 a year for the service to play the game, a 1st member can die as often as they like and never lose anything that is pay to play while I lose junk that should have been in my stash and have to spend days looking for supplies only to have it taken
---
This game is fucking TRASH. Stop playing it and let it die. Don't buy this crap from a company that has no business in Online Multi. Fuck Bethesda.
---
Depends. Does blame roll uphill or downhill?
---
Look at recent posts, there are a couple of hacks going on on PC where people can steal stuff from you.  There's some videos backing it up some, though it's still a bit new.  And a few people have come out here and on the BGS forums claiming to have had stuff stolen.
---
There's nothing you can do to prevent it, and there doesn't seem to be anything coming in the near term to stop it, so it seems like a bit of a risk right now.
---
True.  That's why legal action should be taken with things like this.  If this person is threatening to take potential money away from a company, I'm sure there's a judge out there willing to make it illegal for that person to get a pc, or any other electrical device that can use the internet.  There's always a way (on both sides).
---
If Bethesda actually cared about this happening, then they would have the paperwork written up and they would know these hackers email Addy's, account numbers, etc. and they would be banned already.
---
This is a PC issue at the moment. Probably won't file over to consoles.
---
Has there been a more sad game?
---
You really should have at least googled first because in like five seconds and just looking at the top results I found inventory stealing hacks for Terraria and Minecraft and one for Final Fantasy XIV that let hackers empty people's money.
---
The PC one is confirmed. It's done by injecting 3rd party scripting into the game that takes advantage of the lack of good server-client validation. From what I understand, it turns the target player into a container that has a take all function.
---
The source code is easily obtainable due to poor reporting naming names and giving links for the item spawning last week.
---
I... never said it would? Im expressing empathy for people who play on pc and have to deal with this.
---
https://www.techopedia.com/definition/1916/griefer
---
I can buy backpack plans and trade for it and I do the 2 daily quests every single day. Some days I'm lucky I get 2 and sometimes I don't get anything 3 days in a row. I don't really keep up how long it took m but it might be like a month an half of doing it every day an I keep a good amount of bug pieces in storage to grab an turn in.
---
There are people in threads right now who say they have had everything taken.
---
This sucks for us as players and all that, but... 
---
I'm gonna need some popcorn, too.
---
but that contact can be as far as 200 measure units away.  check out juiceheads video on youtube about it.
---
It happened on GTAV for a while, hackers were able to go in, and take everyone's cars, all their weapons too. Rockstar did eventually ban those hackers, but other hackers are still ingame and able to do all sorts of weird things like place NPCs on your head or blow you up remotely.
---
I would be inclined to agree with you if there weren't already bugs and exploits that have lasted for longer than a year now. They are either incompetent, or unconcerned.
---
*scrip
---
You did imply that "no one bothers to do hack like this on console." meaning that if they bothered, they could do the same thing on console, therefore promoting hysteria on other platforms.
---
Completely random. I've had my camp produce no gifts in 2 hours. But workshops will have 5+. And vice versa.
---
Those are only black-hat hackers mind you. Not all hackers are bad. 
---
That aside...........you could argue they are grey hats, not white or black hats. They are showing how janky and cobbled together 76 is to force Bethesda to change.
---
Oh. Your original comment made it seem like you were another hater of the game that just trys to throw people away from the game. But hey there's always wastelanders to look forward to.
---
Your pipboy is an equipped item like any other, just one that's invisible in your inventory.  It's been reported that relogging automatically equips a new one so it's likely that someone at Bethesda expected that through some bug or another someone at some point would manage to lose theirs and there would need to be a way to replace it.
---
Derailing a bit here but does that compare favourably with melee and automatics? I do find the Power Fist addictive and alluring. Must be the whole miner-punching-robots thing. I'm just curious as to whether you're mostly sniper or to eliminate confrontation sometimes or midrange pop-offs. Took a while before I got marsupial mutation but I still find it easier to jump and knife turrets than to shoot them sometimes because my perks that way don't add much damage.
---
Guess I'm tacitly asking whether your rifles are your main, the unarmed your backup situation.
---
Set it to team only and don’t have anyone on team. Or when you go into private, block for this session anyone on friend list
---
Quite a bit I recently got a b1515 combat rifle with ten badges.
---
That's nice! Early 2020 I'll be able to play some more. Thank you, guys!
---
I hope they get cancer.
---
It false information the spawn hacker has nothing to do with this hack.
---
Great... :/ Ive been playing it the last two days but didn't know and now I'm sad. I wanted to play more tonight but guess i won't be. Why do people suck?
---
I dunno. I still see videos on it. Jim Sterling, Yong Yea a few others. That aside , forcing Bethesda to be aware of how bad 76 is should get them fired up about the next Elder Scrolls. Because if that ends up sucking brahmin balls then....Bethesda could be dead.
---
Lol I too miss survival. And that would be pretty cool. Or a Holotape as sort of a dog tag system. Maybe a raider bot to turn them in for caps or scripts.
---
Are you on PC?  There's a new hack going around that allows the hacker to steal all items out of your inventory.  They don't even need to trade you or have a line of sight, as long as they're nearby they can steal everything.
---
Fallout First.
---
That’s bait.
---
Your items were stolen, new hack going round, sorry bud.
---
Oh sweet summerchild, do you honestly believe that bethesda will allow to freely mod this game? 
---
And you are aware that they are private worlds not server, it all runs from their side.
---
I just don't understand, people like that, look at their behaviours in the past years, if not much longer.
---
I know it's annoying to hear but the only thing you can do is file a ticket to Bethesda support.
---
I had the joy of talking with a hacker and he is one of the major hackers and what he told me was that they are doing it to either make Bethesda fix the game or keep making new hacks till it and Bethesda go under from all the outrage cause many of them started off as fair players and they were banned for things such as being in a group of people painting swastika's in game, albeit they didn't do it but they were a part of the group that did.  Bethesda has upset enough people badly enough they buy game keys from Russia at $1.50 and just wreck havoc.  Also when we report them first they get a 3 day ban, then they are allowed back and if reported again get a one week ban and allowed back and only 3rd time is perma ban for that account.  If Bethesda did ip banning it would make it harder at least.
---
You may have had all items stolen through a new hack. Do you still have items in your stash? The hack cannot (at this time) touch your stash.
---
Send a support ticket to Bethesda detailing everything you've done and encountered before and after the items disappeared.
---
post history checks out
---
I script two meh fixers (already got my baby) one was vamps/bashing/vats cost and one was suppressor 25/90
---
This is like those times when I script unyealding Marine armor thinking no one would want that shit. :(
---
I used to go and snipe wanted players for the challenge but more often than not it just ends up being some unkillable asshole spamming stimpaks while they rush at you with a tesla or explosive weapon.  Not worth the time, ammo and fast travel caps.
---
Had a few people suggest stuff on Facebook. Haha I can see me doing the same on console tbh 😂
---
Because they though they could make lots of cheap bucks with this game. Turns out if an already buggy developers half asses a game.... it's shit.
---
Same could be said the other way around, Bethesda could do the most positive thing yet everyone will find the negative. People were complaining about the free santatron last week lol.
---
Name it Edna.
---
Bethesda knows and will add it for another extra 5$ a month.
---
Because you have to paaaaay pay pay pay for every good feature.
---
Edgy as fuck
---
'Account signed in on another device' is typically a sign that your account has been hijacked, including password. That's not connected to this issue to my knowledge, and I haven't seen account theft as a problem in 76 before, so I'm not sure exactly what's going on. I just know this kind of thing was a problem in WoW when I played years ago.
---
Because it would make less money.
---
Selling the solution to a problem you created. Scummy buissness tactics 101
---
If you're carrying a year's worth of gains on you, I guess it would be. I'm not sure how that's possible though.
---
That the way of terrorist
---
That's not why the petrified corpse are like that but I wouldn't mind photomode if they didn't prioritize it and kept it out of challenges
---
The videos are demonstrating that it can be done, not that it's being done right now on live servers to common players. I just now read the first post I've seen from a player claiming to have had it done to them.
---
If more and more people post about it happening, then I'll acknowledge the actual problem, not the possibility of one.
---
THIS IS A CHRISTIAN SERVER
---
Pretty sure if you trade a vendor, then back out and trade again it restocks the gift wrap without you having to even move your character
---
Sounds completely plausible.
---
Sorry but I don't know where you're coming from. I rarely see anyone posting about griefers and all of my experiences but one have been positive. 
---
This community frequently prides itself on an overall good base of players. I'm sorry you had bad luck but I'm not taking that as a sign of anything widespread, as that kind of toxicity being common in-game would ~absolutely~ be talked about on this reddit.
---
Poor guy another victim of Bethesda rushed shoddy product.
---
So there is a relatively simple script, with which one can strip a player as if they were a countainer. Simply "Take All" and their complete inventory is gone including AtomicShop stuff.
---
Agreed
---
There's potential for it to be bad, but I'm not counting chickens until the eggs have hatched. 
---
Until then I'm going to continue having fun with video games as normal. Glad you're having a good time, too!
---
If you fast travel around the workshop you'll still have them. It's usually just visual until you get close
---
Reaching out far for those anti-bethesda upvotes now aren’t we?
---
They are shithats, destroying other peoples progress and wasting their money (imagine buying a bunch of scrap kits and having them all wiped by some fuck).
---
There's ego boost hackers, and then there's this trash that is actively assaulting others' possessions.
---
Thing is, in most games in the FINE PRINT -they claim that your game account has "no monetary" value. All things in the game,  pixels you wasted time and money on also have "no monetary value." In addition your account may be deleted for "any reason, or no reason at all". It could be a glitch, a bug, a virus, or a permaban -whatever and you are considered to have lost nothing of value. You already agreed to not hold them accountable for anything. In addition you cant see them in court, only in a private arbitration (?) and then a neutral third party has to agree that they were wrong and at most you get whatever money you spent in the last 6 months.
---
I love curry but it's not going to stop burning my ass
---
It does need fixing. However, you don't risk losing legacy weapons if you don't carry them on you, as every bit of info I've seen has stated that they can't hack stashes.
---
It's still possible to be cautious and play the game as normal. Bailing on a very tiny chance that you actually run into a hacker is your call but I'm not supportive of people posting asking the community to run away because fear &gt; facts.
---
I love how everyone is blaming the hackers but not bethesda that allowed this to happen. The game needs something like this so they take action.
---
&gt; liable for damages and intention to cause harm to the player base.
---
i dont think any court is going to care about ( and im trying to say this with out sounding rude) a video games player base or " imaginary " damages
---
I got a gun skin last time...I didn't login today or yesterday at all...I should try to pop in today at some point.
---
Make sure to time stamp when you were hacked. I hear its possible to roll back your character from a previous date.
---
"It's entirely possible"
---
I hope it happens to everyone so we can finally move on from this trash.
---
Not really, they're spawning in atom shop items so really Bethesda could definitely estimate how much lost revenue there was
---
New hack, sorry to tell you but all your items were stolen.
---
Yeah, I stood in the doorway of my shops AFK for like an hour (blocking the way) before some high level player took a shot.  I managed to heart emoji before he finished me off and bought a bunch of my stuff.  Had to log off to get the blood out of my nice floor.
---
Large Holiday Gifts have an 80% chance to give caps and 20% to give between 5 and 100 scrip.
---
As someone who started the game day one. I played about 300 hours until the patch that nerfed a bunch of stuff. Then I quit for about 7 months. This month I jumped back in and they have definitely improved the game since launch. I really enjoy the exploration part and resource gathering and base building. I like to claim the workshops as well. When everything is working I love the game. The game looks beautiful in HDR on PS4 as well. Once they iron out these last few kinks I think everything will be fine. This is definitely far from a perfect game tho. That's fur sure. Bethesda definitely could've made some better decisions
---
😂🤣
---
The game looks bad on it's own. Don't blame the hackers, blame the engine.
---
If only it wasn't behind a ridiculous paywall.
---
The hacking issue has not been fixed, it’s getting worse now and the same ha jet can now steal peoples inventories AND their pip-boys, essentially breaking the character
---
One could argue that Blizzard has had 15 years to address all potential exploits for WoW
---
I do love me some Juicehead, he is by far the most objective and balanced of all  FO76 youtube talking heads.
---
I just feel too nerdy playing on a mouse. Plus first person shooters feel strange on keyboard, but more natural with two joysticks on a controller.
---
Normally I’m informed about such things but I didn’t read that much on here the last days, but damn that sounds awful! I literally can’t believe that people who do this aren’t massive asshats in real life too. The „chill it’s just a game“ argument is fucking stupid too in my opinion, it is thievery at the end of the day. Maybe these hackers can get banned somewhere in the future but how should someone get his stuff back? Boy I hope that this doesn’t find its way on console
---
Yeah, uninstalling for the time being.  I don't want to deal with this.
---
Happend a few minutes to myself. A Level 2-character with a glowing skull-mask was spawning in my camp. I was in my Excavator-Power-Armor. He stripped all the armor-parts of my power armor and took my bloodied lever-action and all of my .45 ammo (\~10k). I just gave the question-mark-emote and he replied via voice-chat "yea exploid man", but then he gave me my lever-action back. He said i should drop my power-armor chassy. I did, he ran to the powerarmor station, changed a few mods and appearence and gave it back to me. So i thought, he was just trolling around and didn't wanted to hurt someone.   
---
shortly after that, he joined a queen-event. I joined also, because i noticed i was missing all my .45 ammo. Via voice-chat i said to him, that i'm missing my .45 ammo but then he started stripping all the other players of the event, leaving them confused as i've been. Shortly after that i disconnected to save my character. So i was lucky, that he didn't took all my stuff, because i've lots of rare stuff on my inventory. Especially while i do often idle in my camp to sell some stuff.  
---
Reported the player to game-support, but i'm convinced, they will do nothing. So... for what am i reporting?  
---
So PC players: Stay away from public servers if you can, otherwise don't play the game and be careful these days... My 1st subscription will not be renewed tomorrow.
---

---
  its a shame they "banned" their bug finders
---
I'm with you, was toying with creating an alt though to run around and see if it happens to me.
---
Doesn't matter, a vulnerability is a vulnerability and a hack is a hack.  
---
The question asked has this ever happened in any other game before and the answer with even the quickest and simplest of searches is an emphatic yes, even with games with far more popularity and players and from companies far more well regarded for having stable and secure games.
---
I'm not interested in a BE one. Just 50+ crit using vats and 90% reduced weight or is that a god roll?
---
Cheating forums are not actively trying to destroy a community, believe or not, that's a side-effect. 
---
Hacking forums are places for programmers to flex on each other to see who can break a game the hardest. When they get bored, they go after another game.
---
They're also very isolationist communities similar to 4chan on behavior, so they don't really give a fuck.
---
they should give all players free access to private worlds until they fix this inventory hack bug, public worlds are not safe and players should not have to be forced to pay in order to keep their items safe.
---
if they wont do it then fine i dont see players joining adventure anytime soon so bethesda just lost alot of players overnight
---
They won't
---
OP why is this your only post in your post history? Could this be a throwaway to cause fearmongering?
---
It’s up there for sure, but I’m certain I’d kill anyone in the wasteland for a comfy pillow!
---
naw bathesda dosent do anything and it wont do anything.. they dont care.
---
Greatest thing that's happened to this game. Keeps getting worse. Most entertaining game I don't play.
---
It rolls to whomever was responsible uphill or downhill.
---
Think they should make the Christmas decor free to make up for the Hacking issues and enter inventories getting stolen.
---
It’s seriously my favorite feature of this game, it’s so fun. Having your pictures as the loading screen is icing on the cake too
---
I love how these drones downvoted you
---
they seriously need to be more generous with xp in that mode.
---
F
---
I really appreciate your help insight on this. Merry Christmas to ya.
---
No prob! Merry xmas to you as well!
---
This whole sub in a nutshell
---
Have a good time by having all the cool looking cosmetics cost extra money when you already paid $60 for the game itself? Only to find out hackers are duplicating these items from other people's inventory for free?
---
If someone leaves their door unlocked it isnt some invite to go inside. You can call them out on it then good but if u invade the house then you are simply an asshole
---
YES. I was stalked by those damn boxes the other day, with the same prewar money it it I left the first time we met at the airport!
---
Because the Fed likely has far better security measures than this shithole of a game
---
Its called courage. Would you jump on the grenade or would you run?
---
this is why people hack in this game..
---
After you reach level 50, you are allowed to switch a special point every time you level up
---
Incorrect. First of all, Bethesda hasn't done anything anywhere even approaching being close to a mostly positive thing with regards to Fallout 76.
---
Secondly, people were not complaining about the free Santatron during it's first week available. They were complaining about the free Santatron during it's second week available because there was no new free item for players that claimed the Santatron during it's first week. So there was basically no free item at all that week for the majority of players.
---
Thats what i thought but ive seen alot of people here say otherwise
---
Doooope, so I’m not a lost cause!?
---
That would be a good middle ground indeed. Unless you make it in the top 3, you get at max 300 exp. That’s not a lot.
---
You down with OPP?
---
They should have made a patch for Halloween that allowed you to equip it and throw it!
---
Woof woof who yo mama get down with? 😂
---
It's a fkin rare arsenal what I have. I'm not intend to lose it. BTW watch the news man. It's out. It's true. So, no, it's called stupidity. Simple as that.
---
If they’re going for loot. Don’t forget trolls
---
Of course its not the fault of a smug, multi million dollar software company that their asset flip, Roblox clone is incapable of preventing intrusion and manipulation from a small group of script kiddies.
---
I like the camp rating idea. That way we would know what camps were worth checking out.
---
Sadly the screen shots in picture frames will probably never happen, because of data transfer.
---
Nope, I would recommend getting 15 perception with all 3 riflemen/commando perks, tank killer and glowsights or groundpounder. I would recommend at least 8 luck but get 11 if you want tormenter. Get bloody mess, starched genes and class freak if you are not playing vats. In agility, get sneak, escape artist and adrenaline (at least 1 rank) get gunsmith rank 5 in intelligence and probably lower your strength along the way.
---
And they called me crazy for making a Bethesda-proof, naked subsistence build. Who's laughing now!
---
That sounds horrible, but fear not, he hates us all equally. 🤙
---
Are you on PC?
---
Put in an official bug report, the more of those they get, the less they can ignore the situation.
---
The hackers are actually performing a public service by exposing the incompetence of Bethesda. I'd be doing psychological analysis on the Stockholm syndrome exhibited by people cucking themselves out to Bethesda on this subreddit.
---
Holy crap someone just did it to me,  I lost my Excavator of which i just grinded the calibrated legs for and also my two shot explosive gatling gun WTF!
---
lol OP asked for this less than twelve hours ago, makes me think this is a troll post
---
Are you sure you didn't transfer it into the overseer's cashe?  I have found so much cool stuff in that box that shouldn't be there. Gatling guns, armor, ledgendaries, meds and food.  It looks to much like a stash box.
---
Every now and then it'll reset, but it's very rare. Normally you have to server hop to get the vendors to reload on wrapping paper.
---
Yongyeah is a no talent parrot who maybe played the game for 15 minutes at launch. 
---
The game is nowhere near what the hate train would have you believe. 
---
But really my question to you is, how do you make it through life having your opinions spoon fed to you by other people?  Im not trying to bash you but it seems kind of weak that you accept other people's opinions as fact and even go so far as to post on a sub for a game you don't even play. 
---
It's like these other people's opinions are SO important to you that you can't even conceptualize that you might be completely and totally wrong about the game.
---
That's the thing, if the game even had a functional anticheat in the first place I would give them slack. But it doesn't and they've done nothing about it the entire year where they did not have holidays.
---
Yep... read an article the other day that one guy made 40k via eBay selling with this. It’s insane... and that’s not even the tip of the iceberg of course. Also These hackers can basically access atom store skins without purchasing them by stealing weapons/ armor with one equipped. If not for the players Bethesda HAS to act towards that issue because that literally is stealing (from them)
---
[Looks like your wish was granted](https://i.imgur.com/EX79Udh.png).
---
Except it's not a bug, it's a hack. Takes a third party tool. If it was a bug they would be able to do it on console
---
If I get wanted I go sit out by the Whitesprings station.
---
Would it be fair to say that avoiding other players would remove this risk?
---
And it would seem very high level players would not need to cheat? So can be more trusted?
---
Perhaps not a 100%, more a risk reduction?
---
I remember  him doing a video saying it was fake
---
Geeze. You are intense. What are you like irl?  Or is it the facade of anonymity?  Give a guy a break.
---
Why are people 0 karma allowed to post here?  Get this fearmongering shit out of here.
---
Pc only.
---
Make it epic too. Use a black powder to knock 110 of health and switch to something fun.... Like a paddle ball. Practice your weapon switching. As a reformed raider... Weapon switching and keeping them taking damage is key.
---
Use nades, nuka or pumpkin work great. Idiots who run fire proof will tell you you can't hurt them but they are wrong. Pvp runs whole set of it's own rules. 
---
Logging off even if you get the same server stops them from wrecking your base. 
---
Quick is the key. Train your vats to the head of your Brahmin or anything near by so when it happens it's over in a second.
---
How about, they should refund the game in full to everyone who bought it. This game is a smoldering pile of garbage.
---
Love those moms lol
---
Ok, but Juicehead (in the video above) was in a live server.  Hopefully, it doesn’t turn into a wide spread problem.
---
gj.  Look at the abuse and disparagements cast at the op.  History repeats.
---
Aren’t they already? :)
---
You should be able to tp camps or players as a joke. No damage, but that d be fun
---
This is so helpful thank you so much!
---
I dont know if he means the song or other people's property.
---
I really like Fallout, so I enjoy playing all of them regardless of their various problems, including 76. As far as what keeps me honest? 1) Just don’t feel like it’s right to ruin others’ game experience in a multiplayer (I godmode myself to death in single player Fallout lol) and 2) I don’t care much for PvP at all, so I don’t care if somebody has nicer, better gear than I do. I just wanna coop/PvE with my friends.
---
Of course he is.
---
Not so. Look at the bottom of the Private Server option to make it private. Press R) to see the different. Sadly it defaults to Team Only. Pressing it changes it to Friends. The words next to the R) are counterintuitive. But it’s not bugged.
---
So... FO1st?
---
The man already lost it all. Show some bloody compassion. Bethesda lied through thier teeth. Its no players fault!
---
The basic architecture of their multiplayer implementation implicitly trusts messages from the client to be valid, and the way they do anticheat (basically whitelisting .exes and .dlls that touch game memory) leaves a pretty gaping loophole that I'm not getting into here. Well, two loopholes. Anyway, it's not a huge deal to exploit the latter to allow abuse of the former, which is what's happening here. The hacker's client session is sending instructions that the server session is passing along no questions asked to the victim's client session. To wit, "show me that person's inventory" and "gimme it" which the victim's client session follows, because it came from the server.
---
I was a victim of this about 20 minutes ago.  The players name was \*\*\*\*\* or something like that.  He's was running around as a level 3 naked guy.  Ran right up to me and took my weapons and armor.  He was kind enough to give me everything back except for my 7k .45 ammo.  Im not sure what the point was unless he duped my stuff and kept the dupes.
---
Edit: removed name because I remembered that was frowned upon here
---
I was also just victimized by this, and several other people who were around killing the SBQ as well.
---
Thanks for stopping by. 
---
Have a cookie and a warm glass of milk.
---
I'll show compassion once he renounces Bethesda and deletes FO76 from his machine.
---
Ok byeeeee
---
Ok....
---
Did Todd Howard have anything to do with either? I'm not touching any cookies or milk from Bethesda.
---
Not anymore
---
This is my current build. Has some quality of life perks in there too

Only drops from certain events now and is super rare, might have better luck buying it off someone
---
I don't think you do...
---
Trolling subreddits and making memes.
---
You're a very productive member of society.
---
I'd love you significant others take on your Reddit history.
---
Really? When did that change? I thought it was still randomly available.
---
Honestly, I'm here to laugh at people who don't uderstand what "Gambler's Fallacy" and "Sunken cost fallacy" psychological effects are... So deep within your own illussion, that you're unable to admit that launching ANY other game would be better than ... Well ... This....
---
Buuuut yeah... Deliberate plan , people who enjoy blah blah blah... Totally. 
---
Have fun with that.
---
I’d like you to take a look at something ironic, my friend. 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/rickandmorty/comments/eeffu1/sometimes_it_do_be_like_that/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf
---
They changed it a few patches ago
---
Months ago. Really can't remember. I have it put up or I'd pay a pic.
---
Too many bugs for a game that is over a year old, really dissapointing
---
Well...
---
Bye
---
Start playing something obnoxious like baby shark over mic
---
Not sure what's ironic about that. Maybe you're using the word incorrectly like so many often do. :)
---
Oh shoot. I didn't know that. Thanks for the heads up!
---
Thank you for stopping by.
---
Thank you for the irony. 
---
If your idea of a 'productive member of society' involves letting greedy game developers raw dog your asshole while making you pay for it, then no I'm not.
---
We've got the trade glitch problem on XB1 as well and about half the time that I switch back to my previous weapon (which was loaded when I switched) it will be empty. I guess Bethesda just likes screwing everybody. No wonder it's got so many bugs... lol
---
I'm still playing because I find it fun, shocking I know!
---
If you don't enjoy the game why haven't you found something better to do with your time in the last year than to hate on people doing something they enjoy?
---
You seem to be investing quite a bit of time into this yourself seeing as how you write FO76 hate posts in this subreddit every other day
---
Or just go into a private world because no one seems to be able to join me on mine at all.
---
It'll run but not hugely well.
---
You can also say this about the game on the whole.
---
Want to see something even more ironic?
---
Young son ‘hates Internet drama’. 
---
Yeah, sure he does. Lol.
---
A bidet with irradiated water is bound to have some fun side effects
---
I'm gonna guess they find it fun like I do, a lot more fun than your idea of fun which is to hate on people doing something they enjoy!
---
How are you going to stop a hacker from acting like they want sanctuary just to steal everything from everyone on your server? How are you going to know they won't hack you once you let them in?
---
Sorry but I bought fallout first this morning and deleted everyone I didn't personally know from my friends list. Only my actual friends get in.
---
I'm in the middle of civil proceedings against Zenimax. Despite being aware of heuristics, Kahneman &amp; Tversky, I still don't think laughing at people for enjoying something that you don't understand reflects well on you. When it works, and fires the right cylinders, it's better than anything else I play.
---
The hacker collective doing this, threatening to release an installer for the inventory stealing script on Christmas Day, are malicious actors. If you don't understand that, you're uninformed
---
We are stuck? No one will miss ur negativity
---
It's only drama if you're butthurt. Clearly you're butthurt whenever someone points out, correctly, that Bethesda and Fallout 76 are trash.
---
Can't you just create a second character on your main account?  I got mine and my sons under my Xbox account.
---
I appreciate you spreading my memes.
---
I mean, the modders made stuff for FO76 when it shouldn't have been modable. so....at the very start, they knew what the deal was.
---
Redbox is getting rid of video games and they are selling fallout 76 for $8.00
---
If they have those in your state. You have to have two copies of the disc
---
He posts all the time on this subreddit for some reason lol
---
Okay, Reese’s Piece, you have a good night now.
---
Cya nerd
---
Without any way to guarantee i wont lose anything else i wont play outside private which suck no sbq fights dont have any god weapons to solo that mess i am just pissed it had to be my fixer it was my best rifle other then my explosive ak but it doesn't have the sneak perk which i was enjoying
---
yep pc also whats happening Tuesday i missed something it sounds like
---
I always do. Then again, I don't play a shitty game that's liable to ruin my night. :)
---
Plus if you do have a problem on your personal server it’s a small list of suspects to forward to Bethesda
---
pc
---
Scam by Bethesda to push players to get fallout 1st?
---
&gt;I’ll show compassion once he renounces Bethesda
---
lmao
---
“I hereby formally renounce the video game developer known as Bethesda Softworks, hereinafter BS, and eschew all of their games, products and services in perpetuity.“
---
Big F then. Shits about to go down hard in the upcoming days. I'll probably dub it 76: The Hackening.
---
I hear ya bro. I play private servers 99% of the time and I’m fortunate enough to be able to solo the SBQ. 
---
Still breaks my heart hearing about good people getting their loots stolen.
---
it was around 11:00 11:15 est my names soleks3500 on pc so if you saw my name running around the fight then the same asshole that got me got you
---
LOL I hear you on the hundreds of robco card. you pressed R didnt ya. also my wife and I just got hacked.
---
That's because  I'm taking your analogy and reapplying it, to show how ridiculous you placing all the blame on Bethesda is. 
---
The wife being Bethesda, the abusive partner being the hacker. 
---
You're saying "this is all Bethesda's fault because it's possible". Classic victim blaming -- it's the battered wife's fault for letting her partner abuse her. She shouldn't have allowed him to do that. 
---
It's definitely not his fault. Look what she made him do.
---
At this point, I wouldn't put it past Bethesda.
---
Props for not renewing. Some players will hop on the F1st train due to this. But Bethesda doesn’t deserve more money when they aren’t protecting players
---
Luckily I’m on PS4 hope ur not on PC
---
its live myself and about 6 other peeps were just hit at a queen fight.
---
Holy radioactive hemorrhoids Batman!
---
its killed my entire drive to play i logged back on into private and just couldnt do it so i am gonna just do destiny 2 till Bethesda responds to my email i know they can roll back accounts so maybe i can get lucky and they will help
---
I bought mine from vendors 200 caps was a bargain
---
yeah they got me mid fight while i was shooting no trade window was open.
---
Man, this is really upsetting you?
---
I didn’t realize it affected you this much. 
---
I know that when other people enjoy something that you don’t like it can feel like it’s a personal attack. But it’s not. 
---
It’s okay that you don’t like something. And it’s okay that someone else does like it. 
---
No one is going to make you play Fallout 76. It will be okay.
---
1. Distance doesn't matter at all.
---
2. Yes, as long as you are grouped you get the perk.
---
3. Yes you should allow everyone to tag the enemies.
---
4. No.
---
5. Capture locations and defend them, the quests are great exp and quick. It's just a grind fest after a certain point.
---
Eat food from Mama Dolces or a pie for some bonus exp. Also sleep and be well rested.
---
I didn’t realize it affected you this much.
---
I know that when other people enjoy something that you don’t like it can feel like it’s a personal attack. But it’s not.
---
It’s okay that you don’t like something. And it’s okay that someone else does like it.
---
Best of luck, man. It’s not worth having all that vitriol. 
---
What someone does with their spare time isn’t going to hurt you. There’s no need to be afraid.
---
I sell all weapons for 250 caps per star and armor for 150 caps per star. Flies off the shelf...
---
Ok kid sure ;)
---
No, I've never once traded an item with another player.
---
Haha OP’s name is abolish taxes and he’s pushing for subscribing to monthly payments for a game he already paid full price for
---
Damn I didn't know. Must have released sometime after I watched the video about it and left for work.
---
I didn’t get the name or rank but the guy I’m shur it was that stole my stuff was only in his underwear
---
They would have known this was a possibility as soon as they started development, so... Maybe a few more years?
---
As bad as it is I'd recommend fallout 1st
---
Thats like they are telling fibs to be honest with you, running the fact that i have never seen anyone maje a swazsticker in this game yet and only ever seen a small handful of posts on this sub of people who have seen them that doesnt say bethesda pissed off enough people, that says they are in the small minority of bitter assholes who just hate bethesda because this isnt new vegas 2
---
Todd's taxes are different. He gives us free gifts and hackers lol.
---
You're on PC. XBOX fills instantly. If you die you instantly can rejoin a full match and be back in game in a few minutes.
---
Yup i got hit as well, ran up and cleaned my entire apparel tab out
---
Probably.  Problem is, if they had known this was a possiblity, and still went ahead to rush it out for the sake of money, shame on Bethesda. I really wanted this game to be able to succeed.
---
I believe that his post got deleted by the mods. 
---
He’s upset for some reason that random internet strangers like something that he doesn’t like. 
---
I hope whatever is troubling him in his personal, real world life gets better soon.
---
Yes they should and they should roll back effected accounts like mine had my stuff stolen 50 minutes ago in a sbq fight by some asshole only in his underwear
---
With and intent to make all "all dlc free" and to "support this game for years" then a £40 price tag is not going to last you very long, the atom shop is the continued revineue to pay for an entire studio of people
---
One of the mods must be a salty FO76 player who just got their inventory stolen. :)
---
What's the opposite of McCarthyism? Because that's what this post is.
---
Just to make my reply somewhat productiv:  
---
While I agree that the "McCarthyism" of the FO76 community gets out of hand a lot of the time (e.g. everyone is an aimbot/wallhacker, everyone has every type of duped 5 star legendaries, etc), the concern isn't without precedent. As irrational as it can be, it's fear that things will get worse and destroy the game that we all want to love and play for the long term, a fear that is validated more often than it is unwarranted.
---
It's not like a player randomly loses an item once and then everyone jumps immediately to "HACKERS ARE STEALING YOUR INVENTORY! MORE NEWS AT 8!"
---
Instead, it's "okay, people are duping legendaries...okay, now people are able to buy legendaries for caps from Purveyor...okay, now people are crafting legendaries with the desired effects...okay, now people are crafting legendaries with nonsense effects..." etc.
---
The McCarthyism is annoying and ruins the game for the short term a lot of the time, but at the same time the fears aren't unfounded given the very tumultuous, short history of this game.
---
It just happened to me had my fixer the ammo for it and my power armors armor stolen
---
To be fair. If they had done a good job with the game it would still be selling well, and they would have had enough money. Thays on them, not the fans
---
Looking for a group as well. Infantryguy
---
It’s happening I’m one that just had my stuff stolen
---
Or they’re simply enforcing the rules of the subreddit. 
---
I hope whatever is troubling you in your personal, real world life gets better. 
---
Be well, and enjoy what you chose to enjoy.
---
The game was being attacked and flamed from the second it was announced at E3, in fact actually since before that when it was teased as "a rust clone" by kotaku.  
---
From that point on a huge chunk of the gaming community as a whole, not just fallout fans decided they wanted this game to burn
---
Nothing you can really do if they use mules and grab your shit when you aren’t paying attention
---
Sheesh ,thats terrible.
---
I dont know how bethesda could fix this,if they even can.
---
Had my stuff stolen a hour ago so yep it’s live to those who don’t believe it can happen beware
---
thx
---
Since fallout 4.
---
Nobody is stealing my inventory in real life. My life wasn't designed by a shitty developer who only wants to milk me for money. My life is way better than the dumpster fire that is Fallout 76. I can only imagine the sort of shitty life one must have to look for an escape in such a shitty game like FO76. :)
---
The game makes it seem like 50 is the end game, which is only partially true. Most characters and builds won't hit their stride until around 100 when they have utility perks to switch to and the gear to synergize with their combat perks. Then caps and scrip etc. start to flow more easily.
---
This shit shouldn't be possible, period!
---
Who hurt you?
---
The tree was disappointing and the beanie is complete waste of time but I need that outfit!
---
I totally agree man , hope that Bethesda gets a grip on the situation and puts a stop to it
---
Its in the Game since Launch, i done that serveral times.
---
lol these posts
---
That would make sense. Perhaps consider equipping the Class Freak perk card (Level 3, under LUCK). That will suppress the negative effects of mutations by 75%, so your STR (whilst in PA) should be closer to the 15-point value you have assigned. Chems would also help increase this stat as someone else mentioned, amongst other things. Good luck.
---
Bethesda: Damn, I guess you're not going to be playing then.
---
Even though I don't have any super good weapons and I play on PS4 I'm gonna stay away from the game just I'm case, you never know they could end up finding out how to get it working on consoles
---
I have it but I can’t do sbq fight solo I don’t have any god weapons for it so I was in public
---
All actors have containers in GameBryo/Creation - in FO4
---
    prid 1d162
---
    openactorcontainer 1
---
Will open Dogmeat's container.
---
I imagine they've just done something similar, but with scripts since you can't open the console in 76.
---
Aw man that fuckin sucks
---
Were do I get more materials
---
You can't ban the hackers if the hackers are Bethesda trying to drive up Fallout 1st subs.
---
That's sucks, hope you get everything back, since they should be able to do a rollback
---
If you watched videos on it, you don't have to initiate a trade
---
That’s not at all what’s happening lol
---
Level 280 something, I already stopped playing after the february patch broke the whole game, came back in march, left again when the vault raid update broke everything x2. I just came back last week and now leaving for a third time because of this lmao
---
I'm on PS4
---
And I can only imagine the sort of shitty life one must have to look for an escape in immature trolling. 
---
Clearly something has stuck in your craw. And I’m sincere when I say that I hope that whatever that happens to be is resolved positively for you soon. 
---
Be well and best wishes, young man.
---
The cumminty in general is really good here, all the assholes sort of thinned themselves out by not buying thebgame to start with and decided to hate on it from afar
---
It’s very much true
---
i thought pay for fallout 1st was crazy, and this suggestion is even crazier than that. lol
---
I hear hackers are taking players’ inventories. This could be a case?
---
Not a whole lot of people playing the game while recording video.  Hell, I turned it on for a bit earlier, before I decided it wasn't worth the risk.
---
Proof of concept videos have popped up already, but nothing from general live play yet.  Give it time though.
---
Very true, here’s an example video
---
Go to 1:22 on JuiceHead’s video: https://youtu.be/w7FtkkDhw_I
---
You just have to be visible for the player running the hack to steal your items. They don't even need to be close to you.
---
No it isn't... but it is Bethesda's fault for making so damn easy for the cunts to come up with a way (or ways) to fuck over the players who have continued to remain loyal to this game, despite the litany of bullshit they have endured over the past 14 months (or so).
---
I know the person who made the videos.  They were made as a proof of concept, using a different method, to warn everyone that it was real before it went public.  The hack that was released was initially supposed to require opening the trade window, but it seems that people found a way around that.
---
 "contact Bethesda themselves and put these skills to good use (seriously think of the good they could do if they used their skills in a good way instead of a bad way) "
---
They already banned those that tried to help.
---
iirc Microsoft gives hacked consoles a hardware ban, it's a great way to turn a 400-500 dollar piece of equipment into a giant paperweight lol I don't think it'll even boot to the dashboard if it's been flagged.
---
Last hack took two maybe three days to fix, the 5 star weapons right? It's not ages. Not saying they'll be as prompt about it, but it didn't take as much effort to fix the hack as it did one of their own bugs, so I guess that kinda says something about the skill of the original script writer lol
---
I literally cant do anything without a pip boy.
---
Sounds like every other case of people losing their shit to hackers
---
These exploiters probably have hope that this will make Bethesda shut down fo76. To be honest, as much as it pains me to say so, it might be for the best. Obviously 76 is just a cash grab(see reuse of non-multiplayer fo4 engine, pushing atom shop, non-cosmetics in atom shop, paid private servers). Only thing big studios understand is getting hit on the bottom line.
---
It does where I work.  You just have to make it happen.
---
I just got wiped out.  Dont even have a pip boy.
---
The problem isn't the engine per se. The problem is that the multiplayer component was tacked onto a heavily moddable single player client instead of 50% of client code being moved out from the client and into the backend.
---
Many things are or can be calculated client side when proper server side calculations and verifications could prevent the abuse: hit registration, weapon spread, clip size, items in general, etc.
---
For example: item drop tables, item configurations, etc are all known on the client, the same as they are on the server. As long as an item is configured correctly, regardless of how it was obtained, the server won't question the validity of the item. This is a fundamental issue that enables all the item hacks in the game. To fix this means a massive overhaul of the game's item dropping logic.
---
On the other hand, if only the server knew how items are allowed to be configured, generated a unique identifier for a given item drop, and then gave a character that item:
---
\- Clients won't be able to create their own items from the ether because only the server is able to register a unique identifier for items.
---
\- Clients attempting to duplicate an existing item will fail as that unique identifier will also be duped, clashing with existing entries in a database. Any duplicates would be thrown out by the server, possibly also flagged to backend ops / customer service so that the player can be investigated and potentially banned.
---
\- Clients can't steal items from one player and move the item to another player as, again, the server is in charge of transferring unique identifiers from one inventory to another. The server would be able to verify things like whether both players initiated a trade, whether both players agreed on the items to trade, and whether the other variables (price, existence of the item, etc) are still intact right before the trade is committed.
---
Without getting more technical than that, I reiterate that while the engine has issues it is the scapegoat of many problems that have nothing to do with the engine and more to do with the improper designation of duties between the client and the server.
---
Maybe, I see a lot of people shorten it to f01
---
That's what a hacker would say ;)
---
When you enter the PW, toggle it to Friends, instead of Team Only, and your friends will be able to join you. I haven't been able to get Team Only to work.
---
Fuck banning them.  Post addresses and names.  2 minutes with them and a ball pien hammer and their sorry asses will never use another keyboard again
---
Yes I feel for the people that will be targeted. But if the hackers dont fuck people over will bethesda ever feel forced to do anything? Its a weird situation
---
I mean Shadowplay can record video all the time and you can save last 1-10 minutes of gameplay at any moment
---
Tk mantis has good videos talking about it, hopefully they can fix it soon
---
If you don’t have a pip boy it should corrupt your character and cause a roll back if you join a new server
---
Honestly just have a lot of time riding the bus.
---
Damn. Looks bad
---
Seems legit.
---
The second xbox is the best way to mule. My s/os account has a spare character and I can mule over to that one, same on mine. Much safer than doing it on the same machine
---
Wait, you don’t have a Pip Boy? Weird. I know nothing about this hacking exploit, but I assume that the Pip Boy is a part of your inventory that can’t normally be accessed (perhaps except with hacks?) due to its accessibility when crafting (like in Fallout 4)
---
I just got raped in winter spring.  They even took my pip boy.  I cant even equip gear i had stashed at my base.
---
Imagine spending money on fallout 76
---
Sounds like bait
---
Do you ever play on public? I was told if you switch to a public server for about 10 minutes and then switch back, the PW will reset. But I have never had a problem. I play on Xbox.
---
Thank you for making this! I hope Bethesda can fix this and help those affected!
---
Join a new server, you'll get the pipboy back.
---
As a software developer, I am very interested in how this all works.
---
Everyone here is smarter than everyone else here, I’m gonna like what I like and they can call me a dumb boomer etc. 
---
Juicehead is Walter effing Cronkite compared to Mr Boss and others.
---
People have found looted corpses, even though its supposedly supposed to be wiped after a short time of no-one being online, not to mention the fact that telling people they get their own private when its recycled from someone 5 minutes before you, while pretty much every other company providing private servers give you actual persistent servers.
---
I was thinking of some loophole where game publishers can say that that there virtual goods don't have any real value, the currency you buy does. That is how they skirt the law with gambling mechanics like lootboxes. Unfortunately I went looking for an example of this but couldn't find anything so the point is moot.
---
THANK YOU
---
From what I've been told, joining a new server right away should cause the pipboy to come back.
---
Important note: console players are not affected, only PC. I'd love to play adventure but I'm not shelling out $12 for insurance on my adventure character to be Fallout first. Bethesda should give a free 2 week trial to people till they fix this mess. Luckily I have NW to play and not worry about losing important stuff.
---
How did they actually steal it? Did they open a trade window with you? 
---
And did they take everything or just done items?
---
More like actual players uninstalled this game as soon as bethesda became assholes, although some remained until that fact finally sunk in their heads.
---
Absolutely blame the hacker that stole someone else’s stuff
---
Was my favorite New Vegas companion.
---
It happens to me if I play nuclear winter first.
---
no way beth wants this it almost made me rage quit and i am level 380 +  a subscriber and I have been defending the game since beta. I cant ban the hackers but if I report, and if everyone else reports the people around them when this happens they can cross reference,
---
theres a new stickey explaining what your going through. Its hackers
---
We need this company to provide basic necessities a year after launch. That’s a shame
---
Looking
---
Being built on fo4 IS the issue.
---
Only? Also, I noticed this both before and after playing NW. I actually noticed this when I first logged in (I mentioned the sound playing alongside the usual mutation alert)
---
We need a hard reset of the game and the dev team
---
true - you have the power not to belive thats all you bud. but if it does happen to you report the names of everyone around you when it happens so beth can investigate them and cross reference it from all the other reports. its player initiated and they have to be within 300 meters from what i read.
---
Couldn’t agree more
---
I wouldnt give Bethesda another penny.
---
I agree entirely. I'm hoping they've learned from this and don't repeat these mistakes in the future. They've had this engine for years and they have access to expansive lists of bugs and how to fix them. Yet they never have.
---
Maybe swing by a pub or bar and ask them for some haha
---
I mean to be fair, Bethesda’s been on Vacation since launch
---
oh and i gave you an upvote. people down voted because you basically called everyone who gave the report of this without evidence a liar. invest a few points in charisma next level up  :P
---
I would love to add this: I have been robbed three times now and these are my findings  
---
The only things taken from my inventory were my outfit, my equipped weapon (and the ammo tied to it), and my equipped armor. I did not have anything in my AID, MISC, HOLO, or NOTES touched at all from this particular hack. All three times the "hacker" gave the items back to me in a paper bag because I was lighthearted about it (also I was using trash armor, outfits, and weapons) so I think this is more of a demonstration by some, a malicious attack by others.  
---
**This should be clear though, do not play adventure mode with gear you are not willing to lose. The hack is very real and very quick and not every person who uses it will be forgiving.**
---
Thank you for making this! I hope Bethesda can fix this quickly.
---
For those without Pip-Boys, I've been told that joining a new server causes it to return, so don't delete characters over that!
---
pay attention to people around you when this happens and submit their names while you submit the bug report so bethesda can crossreference reports to investigate and find the hackers for banning. also in my case i am rockin non legendary crap right now :)
---
Here's a suggestion. You can play the game, record your play session and when a hacker steals all your shit, including your pipboy, you can save the last 1-10 minutes of gameplay and post it here for the rest of us just to ensure satisfaction of the need for "evidence".
---
Whatever helps ya sleep at night I guess
---
Do you think that having a vendor attached to a camp increases the risk or has no impact?
---
can I also add to pay attention to all the players around you and report their names when you submit the ticket so beth can cross repference reports and figure out which players to investigate.
---
Once you're feeling like playing again, hit me up and I'll replace your fixer... I have a furious explosive.
---
THANK YOU!
---
Never had Either of those hugs happen, the only time the game unloads my weapon is when spawning in
---
This was posted in a deleted thread:  
---
But most people don't.  And even if they can, why risk all your stuff to get evidence of something that is already starting to be widespread?
---
yes please take a screenshot of your recent list to give to bethesda so they can use that. It really does help a lot
---
Hey man yeah sure. Im level 20 at the moment. Trippypanda880
---
That's quite a interesting mom, let's kid play a 17+ game and then yells at him for saying some terrible stuff, I wonder where he learned thoes words from
---
Thank you for the notice.  I will be making use of my private server until this is fixed. I do see it as an opportunity to get better stock for my machines and to maybe do some work on my camp.  I hope it's fixed soon.
---
Given the nature of the situation, the PC version of the game is practically in hot water until a fix comes around-- Which I certainly hope is possible, alongside the implementation of a proper Anti-Cheat system of sorts. Without them, the Steam release is basically doomed. Anti-Cheat definitely needs to be their number one priority- especially if they want said Steam release to be 'damn near perfect', quoting MMOG.
---
Pfft, report glitches to bethesda? Yeah right, they'll just ban you.
---
The engine is clearly a big problem, but no thanks, I'll keep blaming the people responsible for the malicious act.
---
I didn't think an account could be logged into two consoles at one time? I have multiple accounts but I still need a friend that is added between all of them to facilitate a proper account transfer. I've been looking for used xbox's for this purpose
---
It's more like do anything about hacking. I'd give bethesda a shiny nickle if they actually mentioned their fuck ups.
---
Yes, the game checks if you have a Pip-Boy every time you log on, due to a bug (what else is new) stemming from the BETA. The game will give you one if you don't have one on you.
---
As for why the Pip-Boy can be stolen through this new hack, technically it's also an item in your inventory.
---
Sounds like something someone with an inventory-stealing hack would ask.... I jest. Kind of. Other than Whitesprings, though, the only place that comes to mind is Watoga (and to a lesser extent Flatwoods).
---
It’s not possible to roll back characters. 
---
Which is incredible considering Bethesda still hasn’t bothered to add two factor authentication or even fix these glaring account security concerns.
---
Yup. It's just a hidden item due to how the engine works.
---
Lol wut?
---
Well i dont conceptualize much about the game at all? Im not even subbed to him, i watch them when infrequently. For the first time im literally seeking out a direct source of information, YOU, the players??? I really didn't mean to shit on the game in my post, ofc ik people play it for a reason, but i just want to hear with how you guys emotionally push-through, and handle various hacking ingame.
---
There's not going to be a boycott to put this game under, no player base is that unified and most players are in the game, not here posting and worrying. I'd also say the scum of the community would be the only winners if that did happen.
---
If the hack is still around and causing problems weeks from now then there would be cause to complain, right now there isn't really.
---
&gt;  I subscribe to 1st because of the deal I get on Atoms
---
I subscribe to 1st because the scrap-box. Zero interest in those dumb atoms.
---
If they make the scrap-box for everyone, cool for me, I will just stop paying for 1st.
---
Huh, this hack shows up right after Fallout 1st is launched, and the only way to avoid said game-breaking hack is to play in a private world.
---
Yeah, I'm sure fixing this is going to be *top* priority for Bethesda. /s
---
*It just works.*
---
Seriously, hope this gets fixed soon.
---
Oh boy, this feels like the energy that put me off at launch.  I'm on xbox.  I don't think we have a hacker issue.  Regardless, thanks for the recommendations.
---
I think it would be a great idea, but since they are a big corporation most likely not, look at fortnite epic is pooling everyone no matter what your playing on, so console players can get killed by aimbot hackers and plus they have a anti cheat system, But if they did I think a free 2 month subscription to fallout 1st would be nice since if they give out atoms it won't be enough
---
Lol touché 😂
---
Im just waiting for people to start defending Bugthesda
---
Well Bethesda can implement a anti cheat but it would be rendered obsolete in a month or 2, hackers would code a way around it, just look at fortnite, has anti cheat, sill has hacker problems
---
Also remember, the only way to completely avoid STDs is to never have sex.
---
I doubt this is going to be fixed any time soon. Since the only precaution we can take against this hack is to play in a private world, Bethesda actually stands to make money off of this.
---
And before everyone claims I'm an insane conspiracy theorist: I do not think Bethesda had anything to do with making this hack. I just think they'll take a look at this and decide to sit on their hands and hope it "encourages" Fallout 1st subscriptions.
---
I have a theory that this is why Bethesda is charging for private severs. They’re just too lazy/understaffed to fix anything.
---
I'm not sure what is more entertaining to watch, this games frequent and unbelievable problems, or the fanboys relentlessly defending every single one.
---
Send me a msg gt: Unbeatable04
---
Brah, a controversy regarding fo76 emerges every month. You can't blame players for buying this broken game.  
---
From breaking console to uninstalling itself. You name a bug and this game will definitely have it
---
Will do
---
Unfortunately not, would be nice if are perks did, would free up losts of weight in my stash
---
Not that great cause of bashing damage, but it's okay. My friend sold a quad fixer with bash damage for 26k
---
I don't think sony or microsoft's end would allow this type to process, and I don't think this specific hack can even work on console.
---
I have perk cards that don't show up after upgrading them...
---
What you are describing is what I'm asking for
---
HAPPY CAKE DAY, MAN
---
Maybe to a small degree, but cheaters are always going to look for an easy way to get  what they want over working for it.
---
Yeah, many people are on the 76 'news'-train for that YouTube $$$, and shitting on it to rally. I can understand being so into a game, that the bugs or small issues don't faze your enjoyment anymore.
---
Happened to me too (I think). Didn’t play for months due to bugs, logged back in the other day to see if anything had been fixed and my player was completely stripped. Literally just my player in underwear with 0 inventory. Nothing.
---
Oh wow that’s a lot. I’m new to think whole trading stuff so I just had no clue.
---
I mean it's also a huge part Bethesda's fault for building the game on such an unstable and easily exploitable engine?
---
That will show em
---
I HAVE.
---
&gt; I get why people don’t like this game I really do. But why not just leave the people who do enjoy it alone? Why go out of your way to f it up for everyone else?
---
Because it's not people who hate FO76 doing it. It's people who enjoy breaking games and Fucking with other peoples' experiences in general. FO76 just happened to be an easy target.
---
If you get a reply before 2021 I'll be truly shocked. Even if you do, it'll be them telling you to reboot your console and/or blaming it on your internet connection.
---
This game is made on a 20 years old engine. People/modders have been working on this engine even before some of us were born.  
---
No wonder this game is getting suplex to the ground
---
I wouldn't call it happy, but thanks, Sage haha
---
Nah people hack because they’re assholes
---
did you open a post for this?
---
I think is a good thing that these first cases get some camera... to force Bethesda to act asap.
---
I am banning legendaries from my play - I am 380 + I dont think being able to craft them would change anything.
---
Would be cool, but I wore doing that event out when it came out, ended up with 20 something mutton meat pie plans
---
I know it's not really what your post is about, but if you're ever interested I would glady let you have a look at all the stuff in my inventory on the character that I dont use and if you see anything you like I would be happy to gift them to you. It's all mostly max level though so you would still need to level a bit.
---
All good! You could definitely get a decent amount of caps or a nice trade for it, but if you post it to m*rket76, post a picture of it, but refer to it as a 2*. That's why my friend was able to sell his fixer; he posted a photo of it so people could see the legendary perks on it, while in the title called it a 2* fixer, cause the bashing damage basically makes it a 2*
---
Also, that minigun is definitely worth something. Not sure how much as I don't follow miniguns, though
---
Nope, just go on Nukacrypt. You might have to pick up a silo piece though for the sake of quest checkpoints
---
Anywhere near a train station or where public events occur
---
Awesome thank you so much 😊
---
Most likely it wouldn't, but I'm just being cautious, don't have anything super valuable, but I'm carrying my favorite weapons, so loosing them would be bad
---
this almost caused me to quit entirely and I have been playing and defending this game since hour 1. no way bethesda wants this. personally i am going to go with basic gear and seeing how challenging the game is without legendaries. I have deleted sold and scripped all legendaries from my inventory.
---
That would require better server and more money.
---
considering the new hack going around on pc its worthless. why pay forsomething someone can just take from your inventory.
---
I’ve been seeing some say that joining a new server will give you your Pip Boy back.
---
True, just think they are more bored than anything and idle hands and all...
---
Blizzard also didn’t let people poke about in their game code with a mod suite on pretty much the same code as WoW runs on either.
---
Even with me having an Xbox?
---
Aunt Beth now will be f*****
---
Maybe, just tossing it out there...lol, thought about something similar...make a nice set of combat armor and a regular rifle and see what happens!  Think you just inspired me to go do it, lol! +1
---
Legendaries Fixer are pretty new . On ps4 I sold my 3 stars 16k last month.
---
Yupp. I had 15+ last night. XD
---
god speed aqualad
---
I doubt a fix is even possible. This is exploiting the base code of the game; it would practically require an entire re-write of the Creation Engine to patch.
---
&gt; I have deleted sold and scripped all legendaries from my inventory.
---
That's a bit overkill, since everything in your stash box is safe.
---
It disturbs me that this comment is controversial.
---
Lol. Good luck playing this kind of game without legendaries and keeping yourself interested for more than 1 month.
---
The root of all these problems is Bethesda's inability to make and keep a live multiplayer game, not the existence of legendary gear.
---
Can confirm this is live just had all my equipped items stolen while I was at the purveyors. 
---
3star legendary armour and weapon, leaving me naked
---
Unfortunately only aware of this after it happened and the level 3 person didn’t have his name recorded
---
ED-E was the best NV follower.
---
Definitely staying away from the game until they implement anti-cheat measures that WILL ACTUALLY WORK. Not risking my cumulative lvl 550 acc with tons of top-tier gear, no sir.
---
Fallout 1st is literally Fallout 76 insurance for your inventory.
---
While it would be cool, it would also make it less fun for some people, they like to farm for their weapons
---
A good start for Beth would be to check the number of pipboys upon log in, if more than one, instant ban. Sure, wouldn't take all of them but many, and simple enough to get started. 
---
This is a result of the free weekend.
---
No. It shows up after the free weekend.
---
Flatwoods has a good amount of traffic, but mainly of lower level players tho
---
sToP SpReAdInG MiSiNfOrMaTiOn
---
I hope everyone who scrutinizes every single claim gets all their items stolen. you deserve it.
---
because of course Bethesda can do no wrong, right? it's not just me, either. people have warned you multiple times of bugs, exploits and hacks and you always dismiss it as "paranoia"
---
to this day they still haven't acknowledged the disappearing items because of their terrible netcode.
---
Actually the problem is Bethesda never had experience with a multiplayer game before, if they would have let the eso online team handle the game, it would be better
---
3star legendary armour and weapon, leaving me naked.
---
Didn’t know this was a thing until it happened, didn’t even get the level 3s username
---
Plans are at all vendors at level 15. Only known spawn is in Berkley springs on a roof. Check player vendors though lotta people sell basic ones for scrapping.
---
There’s a robot vendor in Harper’s Ferry that usually sells the plans
---
For now, sure. Next week? Probably not.
---
Thanks, Bro!
---
Good advice.
---
Happened me to as well, was playing tonight and for the past 4 hours I had these drop right in front of me everywhere I fast travel, and when I exit interiors. Seems like this started happening when I was at the Morgantown airport and I triggered collision course, didn't intend to start it and I ignored it. After this, gov aid boxes would fall from absolute fucking nowhere.
---
Very lucky, happened to me and I didn’t get my stuff back...
---
If it is, and word gets out, that would be the end of the line for them.  Between lawsuits and the horrible press, nothing could save them.
---
Ditto on the private server play.
---
I hope they identify the hackers and sue them for a million dollars each.  They are beyond annoying and deserve legal punishment.
---
I'm not not saying that would go away...but even those people (like me) would like to see a light at the end of that long tunnel hoping to hit three 7's.  
---
Like it could require an extreme amount of relevant "modules" that can only be acquired from drops with them.
---
i.e. you want to craft an I/25/25 weapon...you will have to break so many weapons with each of that module to extract it, etc...still have to farm, but you have a little more control.
---
Well, I gambled for (12) 3\* armor pieces today and one was a Heavy combat armor chest piece 61DR 61ER
---
they don't need to do anything other than get within 200m.  Happened to me and guy ran up cleaned me out and fast traveled away.  He didn't trade request/invite
---
I don't think a lot of  people play fallout 76 for pvp, I don't do pvp unless it's nuclear winter, because I'm playing the game to discover the story at least what little story their is, the game was gonna be imbalanced no matter what, even if you don't play with legendaries, others will, if everyone had the same items and same perks, then it would be balenced somewhat then it would be about how skilled you are, then it won't be balenced anymore, look at fortnite that game is even more unbalanced then 76
---
The specific rooftop is the spa in Berkeley Springs.
---
Im playing now even more D2 after this hack went live. And Bethesda still do nothing about it. I Think It’s time to say goodbye to them.
---
Lost all my 3star armour and my 3 star lever action rifle I feel your pain...
---
Same all my equipped gear, gone...
---
thats hard man, so i need to make sure im not running around with good weapon /armor /stuff. Damn thats not good, this will take bethesda to do some reverse engineering, and that will cost time, much time i think.
---
On nukacrypt i read you have to stash your valuable stuff in your camp that cant be stolen, at least thats sure yet.
---
Its like a notification sound
---
Help! I'm not joking right now. Some low level dude came to my camp and stole everything on me! I didn't know what happened except i hear the sound effect where you drop stuff. Next thing i notice everything i had was gone. 3* Bloodied Handmade, 3* fullset unyeilding marine...
---
I thought it was a glitch hence i left the server. Only to find my things still gone. What should i do now????? I wasn't able to get any screenshot or anything in time...
---
It curb duping. The system sucks as it is and the RNG system is horrible which is why duping is so popular. In a year of playing this game the best pieces i have were from someone else. I have zero motivation to keep grinding for random drops. Id rather grind for currency to fully make my own legendary unless they fk it up and make it like vault steel. I dont want to put 100+ hours into 1 task.
---
What good time? Getting instakilled by hackers in Nuclear Winter? Revoked access for reporting bugs? Unfair advantages that Fallout 1st players have over others? Get real.
---
True, but u think that's what Bethesda was trying to avoid having easy access to things, just looking at modding weapons from 4 to 76, in 4 you had pretty much every gun and armor mod from the beginning and now in 76 you have to unlock or buy them, it seems that Bethesda wants us to work for it, get the satisfaction of earning it the hard way, but I think it could be cool to add legendary effects to already legendary weapons instead of full on crafting, like you said the modules can come from scrapping lengendarys and you could add it as a normal mod, instead of adding a star or something like that
---
Yeah, I'm game to anything...always good to keep an open mind!
---
Better yet, at the *very least*, stay off your mains, or any toon you have you don't want to lose all your stuff on.
---
Personally, I'm not going to even log on, one less person to prop up their population numbers.  I'm certainly not going to pay *more* money to play securely, but if you're already a 1st member, you have that to fall back on, at least for now.
---
Probably going to uninstall to send a somewhat stronger message if we don't get some word ASAP that it's being fixed.  Not that my one uninstall will send much of a message, but if the choice is that or $13 a month more to avoid losing everything, I think that choice is clear.
---
Bethesda shits the bed once more. What are we at? A dozen?
---
Sadly all you can do is report it to Bethesda and get a character roll back. Not sure how to help beyond that, sorry it happened to you.
---
Well that's gonna disappoint the 6 people left playing this trash.
---
Been playing on pc for hours but I have been recording the whole time using geforce exp I have had no issues on this server right now also shout out to funtime_ for the gifts.
---
It may be the completion of possom quests
---
&gt; because of course Bethesda can do no wrong, right? 
---
This post, and every other post on this subreddit criticizing Bethesda is evidence to the contrary. Meanwhile, your recent post history on this subreddit has some pretty hostile comments in it. Criticism is fine, attacking other people on the subreddit is not.
---
True that, and if people could craft lengendarys they would flood the market with them most likely, but I think better weapon customization is a must
---
Didn’t know about the hack until all my stuff got taken... whilst I was using the purveyor and lost all my legendary equipped items...
---
Yeah, I'm just thinking about a hybrid of all the successful gear crafting that I've seen over the years of gaming...I'm sure you can envision the same, not reinventing the wheel or anything...
---
Looks like it's private servers only from now on. Thankfully my friend has one.
---
The problem is, at the current pace they won't even consider fixing anything before last couple weeks of january...
---
Yes pretty sure its a glitch
---
We on the same page there...even just the non legendary shit modders were putting out and all the weapons and stuff...very cool and needs to be added.
---
This is why I chose to be a poor fast food worker instead of a successful engineer. Thieves can't steal what I don't have.  
---
 #lifehacks  #stonks #soupkitchen
---
So i think, a  temporary solution is to get everyone able to start his own private session for free, without subscription.
---
Strategy guide:
---
1. Create alt
---
2. Stuff goodies into stash
---
3. Transfer to main playing in two Windows once resolved.
---
Buying Fallout 1st will cause it to start immediately.
---
As for what I'm doing: I'll be playing in private with my main, public with a new character, and taking short breaks to play other games I have piled up.
---
&gt;then he started stripping all the other players of the event,
---
Holy piss, that is scary. My condolences and thanks for warning the rest of us.
---
They really do.  I love the social aspect of the game and I'm sad to lose that for now.  I love to visit other people's camps and see how they designed it, how they built it, and anything cool that I can use to make my camp better.  I'm also disappointed that I can't sell my plans right now.  I love to have people stop by, buy things, and look at the camp I've put together.
---
The only way I can see them fixing PC is if they somehow make it so that we can load the whole game and play offline or give us private servers for free. 
---
I dont see how they can stop the hackers now, they probably know the code better than bethesda by now.
---
I'm thinking about doing this too. These utter fecks have ruined the holiday period as far F076 is concerned.
---
thanks :)
---
Didn’t know this was a thing until it happened...
---
Go ahead.
---
You are able to farm gifts early on so really, a better option than risking your main. Pretty much no risk involved if you stash stuff regularly.
---
May I suggest 2h melee? Alot of axes out there with the event.
---
Not everyone at Bethesda is on holiday, so they could possibly have it at the earliest beginning of January, hopefully it doesn't take till the end of January because losts of people will have all that possible play time wasted and it would hurt Bethesda, if their playtime/current player counts drop it would hurt their investment opportunities and as a business they thrive on more money, just look at how much console players would pay to play this game every year, they would pay 59.99 or if it's on sale less, then on PS4 59.99 for a 1 year of PlayStation plus to just play the game and if then want fallout 1st for 1 year add 99.99, Just look at epic they saw their player count was dwindling so they did the current holiday event where you could get 1 free present everyday for 14 days and have a challenge to earn more rewards, they did this because they were not performing well
---
But they can wipe your stash too, no? Also what is 2h melee (I understand melee)
---
No problem!
---
Problem is the free weekend. Script kiddies can play around at no risk at all.
---
When I'm done swearing (bought FO76 last week, barely got to play; just level 25) I'll be avoiding playing for the time (can't really afford a month's sub right now). I don't have much shiny shit worth stealing, but it's my junk nonetheless. Looks like I'll be playing something else while this gets fixed (hopefully soon)
---
To be fair they have the source code to the engine and can modify it to the fullest extent to allow these functions to not be a problem, but in this case they were far too lazy i guess, too focused on raking in easy and fast cash even though their code for the game is a fucking disaster.
---
Under US law at least companies can't render your (any) device inoperative.
---
There's two more datamined, and I believe they teased a third but I'm not 100% on that
---
Seekrits?
---
except you're accounting for the people who don't actually play any longer but show up every other week to weigh in on the current mess up. which yes, there is a new one every other week by the way.
---
I'm talking about the regulars who actually still play the game. those people were defending Fo1st and rationalize every absurd stunt Bethesda pulls as "not that bad".
---
it's impossible not to be hostile when people are seemingly OK with everything that transpired this past year. heads would be rolling if this was any other company or medium. the current state of Fo76 is nothing short of a joke and people act as if everything was going according to the plan.
---
Ummm... shhhhh
---
People in this sub are just dumb (you have to be to still be playing this imo, borderline masochistic at the least). They are blaming the hackers, when in fact they should be blaming Bethesda for not creating a secure code base. When you develop an online game, one of the basic fundamentals of the network code is to prevent hackers. There will always be hackers, you can and have to stop them via the quality of your product.
---
IF it could be proved that BGS was aware of security issues and allowed them to continue in order to sell more subscriptions, it wouldn't be too hard to find a lawyer willing to file a lawsuit over breach of contract or something similar.  Not saying they'd win, but filing a lawsuit isn't terribly difficult (and it's possible to sue over just about anything).
---
That being said, I was thinking about the morons who were saying that it's actually BGS doing the hacks to push their subscriptions (which OP isn't claiming), so my comment was a bit out of line here.  Were THAT case, lawyers would be lining up to take the case.  But it's a bit less cut and dry with what OP actually claims.
---
It's weird that they Prydwen is even in the game files, right? I mean, it is completely superfluous, there is absolutely no reason for it to be there as it should never, ever be using in fo76 seeing that it is from the future. It just shows that they simply copy/pasted most of fo4 and it is no wonder that the game files are so bloated. 76 is literally a fo4 mod.
---
Upvote this. We need to get this to the top.
---
Appreciate the information :)
---
Could we as another option strip down our main character
---
Remove everything to inventory or an alt
---
Remove power armour &amp; all legendary armour
---
Craft some basic armour &amp; stick them in a vault suit
---
craft a basic weapon
---
keep just basic ammo
---
&amp; a bit of food
---
Would our C.A.M.P &amp; everything else be safe?
---
I sent a ticket to Bethesda  describing what items were lost aswell as the circumstance of how they were lost, considering how widespread and the amount of people it's affecting I only hope they roll back our characters.
---
F's in the chat bois ;(
---
I appreciate the offer however I prefer to earn things through exploration, trade, etc. Thank very much though!
---
My friend and I (on xbox) four times now have taken all the workshops on private only to have the server "shut down for maintenance" within 15-20 minutes of claiming the last one. It's extremely frustrating.
---
Huh, I assumed PS4 would have as many active players as Xbox. Are you in the US?
---
Don't think Bethesda planned on fucking up Christmas... Still, no need to attack other people on here for Bethesda's mistakes.
---
2. Luckily, I’m out of town until Thursday anyways so no 76 until Friday at the earliest. Hoping things are resolved by then. If not, I’ll just wait it out. Plenty of other PC and console games that haven’t been getting enough playing time. Just sucks for those that did want to play during this time and during a fairly lucrative (scrip) event.
---
And on this very day, for a slightly different reason, customer support gave me the answer:  **Please be aware that due to tool limitations Customer Support is unable to restore lost items.**   
---
Damn(
---
Going off of current info, that should work. They can take any weapons, armors, aid items, junk items in your character's inventory. So, anything in stash or on other characters would be safe. 
---
Anything you put on the character in a public server is at risk, but if it's just crafted, it's not a big loss. 
---
Personally, I'm using my private server from 1st for my main, and using this as an opportunity to finally make a new character to level.
---
They've rolled back characters before when characters have been damaged by the failings of the game.
---
The hacking problem is so wildly blown out of proportion it's ridiculous. 
---
Block the handful of hackers you run into in nw and poof you never wind up in lobbies with them.  Problem solved no worries. 
---
Never had hacking impact me or anyone i play with in adventure mode. 
---
It's a non issue.
---
My problem is that when I take every workshop on private, within 15-20 minutes of taking the last one the server "goes down for maintenance". This has happened all 4 times we've done it. Had the same thing happen when we took every workshop but 2.
---
Anticheat won't fix this specific issue, anticheat is meant to ban players for using cheats, not for utilizing a vulnerability.
---
So, the only way to stop this from happening as of now is by playing on a prívate server, which requires you to pay Bethesda for a subscription. How CONVENIENT.
---
No, it was datamined and confirmed that CAMP budget has nothing to do with the level.
---
15 base. +1 From Vault suit, -3 From egghead. 
---
Not including Perk effects should I choose to use them.
---
Make sure you dont post anything on here about the hacker if you get it on video.  You will have your account banned.
---
Moar Science needed it seems.
---
Screw you bethesda. Time to uninstal this effed up pile of crap!
---
Do you know the locations that where datamined? There's so many great spots for new  Nuclear Winter maps.
---
OP if you play on PS4 nobody stole your inventory, that's a PC only exploit
---
One in the Mire, one in Charleston
---
I think you're talking about different hacks.
---
and how it turned out many were correct in there skepticism. nobody can refute that. this game has had the least stable release and development ive seen since DayZ and other failure games have fixed themselves in half the time. The game has its amazing moments, and a mountain of flaws.
---
Right. I hate the white knights who pretend it doesnt deserve hate. what these hackers are doing is wrong, but being pissed off half the time is appropriate because this game is still a flaming pile of broken code.
---
Me too. I've also noticed that sometimes I'll take off faster than I normally walk. It's gotta just be lag or another of their wonderful bugs.
---
Still laughing at all the clowns defending 76 XD
---
As if the hackers weren't going to take advantage of that practice, how jaded are you lot seriously.  Fallout 76 is dead already.
---
The game makes itself look bad. You forget that it must be super easy for them to do this, as it doesn't happen on any other "Triple A" title.
---
When hackers know more about how your game works then you do, maybe you need to hire competent staff.
---
Aren’t you guys worried about your actual information getting hacked? Like, your credit card is attached to the game. It just seems like a bad gamble to keep going back into a game that is so prone to hackers.
---
Thank you very much, but unfortunately I'm on Xbox ☹️
---
several months since the last incident that proved account roll back and amin was required by bethesda....
---
guess we will see if any of that time was used wisely
---
Lmao you’re playing a dangerous game there lol! I haven’t been in a public server since the rumors a few days ago. Been avoiding them like the plague until this blows over
---
If you have the hack you can, wakka wakka.
---
HO HO HO
---
For the record, there are two other fixed spawn points - one is somewhere in The Burrows, and the other is somewhere in Charleston Capitol Courthouse. I don't have anything more specific.
---
🤣🤣🤣 dang
---
Or it requires having competent game devs, which Bethesda have always lacked.
---
Supposedly need to be over level 15 and less than 45 for them to appear, not sure if that is still the case though.  They were there fore on the first try at level 30ish.
---
Sad truth about today's gaming industry. When micro transaction makes more more than sales of game then all devs will focus is on MTX and give a shit about game.
---
Why did this get downvoted it’s true
---
Eso: i am play on PC and can use cool addons
---
F76: i am play on PC..  f*ck ;)
---
I'm hoping they get real greedy and sell the IP, the only hope for a good fallout now is a new dev team.
---
Yeah, come to my private server and I'll nick all your stuff.
---
Maybe but then console players don't have half the problems pc players have.
---
The guy may be doing more good than harm on Bethesda's part, so long as they manage to stay on top of things and keep patching.  
---
My Discord FO76 server has "gone underground" and is moving strictly to the private servers. Four more people have purchased them this week SPECIFICALLY because of these attacks.  
---
Soooo, way to go? /shrug
---
Happy cake day, brother. I'm sure our commanding officer will give you a new Plasma Rifle for it. You just have to sign a few tens of papers.
---
Bethesda letting out of fallout ip is as likely as to make a Mexican a us citizen in a year
---
True, but one can dream.
---
Why are you here?
---
Hard to say right now. A lot of plans use to be super rare and valuable but with the Christmas event you can get them from scorched. One plan though that hasn’t changed is the fixer plan which most people will sell for 10 k ish caps
---
Everyone who saw this and left during the release winter was called crazy. The fact they've had the gall to do this one of the most loyal ganbases in gaming is incredible.
---
na man these people have their heads buried so deep up bethesdas asshole that nothing short of the game somehow straight up bricking their pc or console may wake em up. Maybe not even that. Even now instead of an outrage they are so completly docile and are waiting for a patch like the good little fanboys beth wants them to be
---
conspiracy time, they wont patch it until after the holidays to try and get people to get a 1st sub for the private servers
---
doesn't really make sense at all because the people who are so addicted they cant put it down probably already have subs 
---
yeah nvm its a pretty shitty conspiracy
---
i put it down 1.5 months ago waiting for it to get better, and im still waiting. thing is the opposite it looks like as the time goes by the game get worst. not holding my breath anymore lol.
---
Ok wait... I think I own destiny 2 because of blizzcon. Should my wife and i play? She likes the grind 76 has.
---
Same here, too dangerous to play right now.
---
There are older rare plans posts that detailed super rare difficult to obtain plans. Depending on your characters level pretty much all of these christmas gift plans are valuable.
---
Lol, a master race? Preying on one another.... Smh. Over pixels, scamming is rife in this game but this shit is on another level. Its sad the lengths people go to for... Pixels. People need to grow the fuck up.
---
Be nice if they made a caps box that was limitless
---
Bethesda can't make a single player game not be filled the brim with game breaking bugs. What made them think that they could make a multiplayer game?
---
Awesome I will keep an eye out, just in case.
---
Holy Shit man that’s awful
---
Oh god...I’ sorry mate...have any proof ?
---
So does that mean that if i want to sell these plans, i should ask for them more than what the "value" says?
---
That’s me at 1:35 playing the piano. Fuckbag
---
I know it’s not the point of your post, but headless scorched can often be fixed by fast traveling away and back.
---
None of this is engine level. All the interaction code between players and world props that results in things appearing in your inventory will be part of their scripting layer.
---
Hell, it's showing up in other franchises.  BL3 also has a photo mode.  More importantly, less bugs.
---
Just open you eyes and scroll through this subs Hot feed
---
And I just upgraded GPU and was going to reinstall lol
---
All them people "oh theres no proof, it ain't live, they lying to us". Oh I hope they lose their inventories. Ahahaha. Gg bethesda. Well played people.
---
After you are able to craft a handmade, Farm blackwater mine and scrap everything then craft low level handmades and scrap them to learn mods.
---
Well same for Trapper, Raider, Robot &amp; Marine....hopefully that'll essentially change.
---
True, but if the kid did learn it from the game or anywhere else it's the parents fault for not monitoring what their kid watches and plays the rating system exists for a reason
---
Now, I’m not saying there is a conspiracy here, but it seems like there could be a conspiracy derived from this.
---
BuT FaLlOut DeVs ArE GoDS. Fo76 Is BeST GaMe AnD DoN\`T HaVe BugS. YoU AlL HaTERs -This post was made by Fallout 1st f\*ckslave gang
---
Well, that is kind of a dick thing to wish upon others. Proof is easy to document if you are a victim, and with the attitude in here I see no fault in asking.
---
But since it is Christmas I'll be nice. If you ask Santa for a ps4, I can gift you some legendaries. Since, you know, my inventory is full of them and no one is stealing them.
---
Will do, thanks!
---
Ah shit I thought it started on the 6th
---
What a**holes. I bet it is the same group who claims "they are doing it for the community" to "force Bethesda to improve" yet it is the normal players who are getting screwed over.
---
In the last 2 days i had random people sending me friends invite. I did not accept because i don't know them but, is there a chance theybuse theae hacks on me if i accept friendship? Anyone can answer?
---
The mass downvotes and the multiple claims of people lying about the exploit are "dick things to do" too. I'm a console pleb too. Couldn't care less about the issues pc has. Just dont like people being called liars for easily provable things.
---
Please screenshot your recent players and get that in to Bethesda ASAP. They may be able to get this guy once they start working.
---
Oh? So you can just go and craft scrap and repair kits for basically no cost whatsoever and get them back no problem whatsoever yeah? 
---
Do you even play the game or did you just assume I was only talking about cosmetics while completely forgetting there's a whole other section of the shop people pay money in. 
---
Jesus 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
dose this hack work on console? do i need to avoid playing until its fixed?
---
You realize that most people aren't recording everything in the game at all times right? There's been plenty of documentation at this point and people who are well known for being accurate have reported it not to mention the stickied post by mods...
---
It used to be tired to FPS the fixed it.
---
Jesus fucking Christ. This video deserves to be seen by everyone; players, devs and mainstream gaming sites.
---
I get that point, alot of people jump the gun. Mass hysteria in here right now. But not everyone who were asking for evidence were being rude. 
---
I didn't believe it myself until I woke up today and saw posts across different boards.
---
lol this
---
There are numerous videos on YouTube of it happening, show compassion asshole. People have spent a year playing 76 only for some pathetic little turd to come and steal all he or she has. There may be people who cry wolf but it's a fact it happening.
---
lol they had an entirely new engine for ESO and hacks were rampant there during the first year, it's not the engine, it's the fact they don't put in anti-hacks because it's easier to just skip details like that during development and rush out the product
---
Hire Obsidian and their engine. Problem solved.
---
Plot twist it’s a Bethesda employee pushing people to 1st 
---
(I am of course joking, anybody feel like naming and shaming those hacking?)
---
On the bright side I’ll save a lot of stash space not needing vendors
---
Oh boy, check out this much better video of the hack attacking multiple players. 
---
https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk
---
Yeah, I know that.
---
But last night there seemed to be alot of troll posts surrounding the subject.
---
Yeah, we are lucky. Hoping it gets sorted soon, the game needs its players.
---
Yeah damn. Okay so basically, don't sell any plans before you haven't checked for how much its sold at other vendors.
---
Thanks for the help!
---
They didn't twiddle their thumbs.  They focused on the Atom Shop and creating Fallout 1st.  That's their focus.  It's a shitshow at this point.
---
I really hope Bethesda gets on this. The PC community was already kind of small, I'd hate to see it fall lower.
---
This crap makes me so angry! WTF? Im even more angry at Bethesda than at the hacker (don't get me wrong I will put him in hospital if I can find him irl). The real reason is Bethesda's crappy code! They should fix this vulnerability - and fast!
---

556, 45, 308, fusion cells and plasma cartridges, fusion/plasma cores.
---
Nah I don’t remember that.
---
I implore you to do something more productive than to jump on the band wagon of a hot topic or go post on a Star Wars forum right now.
---
Mabye player specific roll back
---
There have been several rumors that were proven to be false during the last year. There was a "trade exploit" rumor way back in 2018 even that was found to be untrue. Even a couple of months ago there were rumors of people pickpocketing
---
Yes you can still open them and even craft them if you have wrapping paper.
---
Yep, same happened to me. Some asshole stole my silver excavator armor with calibrated legs right off my back while I was browsing another players vendor machines. Logged it with Bethesda, but not sure if I will get my PA back. The violet is a bitch to farm and you need 10 to make 2 legs. Thinking of rather going back to ESO, looks like this is quickly becoming a shitshow with hackers running rampant
---
If I'm remembering correctly, the backups they have can be very bad at times (still better than losing everything).
---
Maybe they only rollback the affected players?
---
What’s the “private server timer?”
---
Would putting atomshop skins on all of you good stuff help since it cant be seen in trade? Just asking to find a work around.
---
Yong yea is getting free content at this point 😂
---
Pics or it didn’t happen.
---
Sounds good. Did Bethesda say this somewhere?
---
The smell of money I guess.
---
If the video showing hundreds of people being stripped of their gear is legitimate - thus just the tip of the iceberg if you will - investigating and manually restoring each and every individual account might be too time intensive to be feasible.
---
Hope you guys get your stuff back this is just scummy.
---
Before when people lost their inventories, they roll back the characters
---
There's no coming back from this. This game is dead.
---
Tis the Christmas season for YouTubers.
---
Wow :D 
---
Catch of the day i'd say. Congrats!
---
Most of them are probably on holiday vacation like last year when duping was at its worst around christmas.
---
Shouldn't you be more upset with the hackers? You're bullying the victim here.
---
Damn really?  Didn't even know that was a thing.  Well that's good to know at least I suppose
---
As much as I agree that keeping the playerbase happy with their decisions is quite important for the stability of cash influx, the recent history of their major fuck-ups one after another doesn't do a particularly good job on persuading me or lots of other people that they *really care that much*. Right now, a year after the game's launch, it seems like they are simply incapable of making weighted decisions on how to make their game better. I played it since b.e.t.a. but I stopped hoping for anything long ago. If they will succeed in turning the situation around with Wastelanders, good for them, maybe I'll even consider to support them with a subscription. I'd still play the game if it weren't for total lack of new repalyable content and ever increasing heap of bugs that for now seems quite a bit overwhelming for me personally to even consider launching the game.
---
So yeah, all I was trying to say here was that if their whole team can't get their shit together and start making right decisions to significantly improve player experience, I won't be so sure a fraction of it that's not on vacation will ever do the job.
---
And then the "Bethesda abandoned the game" threads reaaaally began so buckle up for a shitty subreddit experience soon
---
This must be the single biggest fuck-up in F76 so far.
---
Excuse me but why are you coming to a fallout 76 sub to just hate on a game that you might not even have 10 hours on ? Acknowledging few informations before farming karma perhaps ? Do us a favor, go away.
---
So you'd buy morr f01st subs.
---
Some goon already using this. Apparently he cleared over 500 inventories in one evening.
---
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk)
---
It's not a bug, it's a hack. Lots of games get hacked. GTAV, Fortnite, ESO. The difference is that Fortnite and GTA actually sued the kid behind it and he cried in court. Look up what happened to Lizard Squad lol
---
I really hope these hackers that are doing this stuff are doing so to kill this game so that Bethesda, and gaming in general, can learn that games like this are unacceptable. All the way from the monetization, to the bad management of the game, to the glitches and broken code with makes the game fall apart. None of this is ok.
---
Bethesdas lack of communication is appalling. Seriously, like why can't they tweet, yeah we're aware of this hack and are working towards a fix.
---
Nope. They can snatch Atomic shop items too. To see it in action, look at Juicehead's video where he demonstrates.
---
Try to stay low on lights, you really only need one light between every 2 roof panels for decent lighting.  I also recommend seeing if you can minimize the number of foundation squares, they take up quite a bit of budget.  Also try not to keep too many plants/water purifiers, I find that I really only need two melons planted and two small purifiers tops to survive, and I fast travel to places whenever I need a specific plant/veggie.  Hope this helps!
---
Heard it from a streamer that asked one of the community managers.
---
Yeah, it happened to a v few amount of people and they had to roll back their characters despite claiming they couldn't restore lost items. Though the restored characters were rolled back from a two week timeframe, and most people's inventories change a lot in two weeks
---
PC only as it relies on a script injection.
---
Don't forget there biggest asset that's updated almost every week... I bet they will take more money and won't get onto it straight away. Let's see what's if the atomic shop gets updated before the hacker problem gets fix...
---
The problem is the dev teams inexperience, it's not their bad developers and the worse part is since it's an online game their will always be bugs it's never gonna be bug free and we also need to realize that even the most experienced of developers can have trouble coding, sure they reused code but reusing code when coding isn't that rare, let's just hope they can fix it as soon as they can and I don't even want to pay the subscription especially since I'm on consoles so I'm already paying 59.99 to just play the game yearly without the subscription, also let's hope that Bethesda learns from this even if it's just a little bit
---
I didn't even know it was coming. That's what happens when you don't visit this sub daily. :(
---
Here's hoping we get a surprised increased scrip cap from the exchange.
---
I hate how realistic this sounds
---
I'm just not sure what these hackers are thinking. Luckily i'm not on PC so don't really have to worry, but if it did happen to me as much as I love the game I would probably never play it again. Pretty sure most people would be the same so what's the point taking stuff? If they're selling it and people just stop playing who is buying it anyways so why?
---
LOL, play stupid games, win stupid prizes.
---
I've seen it since the start and that's why I haven't paid a cent to support them after paying for the game. I love the game but always said I will spend money when it comes out of beta... Lol
---
Lizard Squad... now that's a name I've not heard in a long time...
---
West-Tek anti-Mugging device available in the Atom store for a limited time at only 10,000 Atoms, It's only here for a week so get it while you can. /s
---
Which is a shame, I want to hear more about the sobbing
---
The only reason anyone cares enough to try to exploit this game is because there are some people that are willing to spend loads of money for in-game items for whatever reason....
---
If you think you're special enough to be deliberately targeted as a community just makes me pity you more..
---
how do you make sure that the ones who seek refugee arent using the hack? 
---
just out of interest im on ps4
---
probs for your help though i feel with you guys 👍🏼
---
Feel like they can accomplish the no content bit at least
---
No hacks don't work on console thank god, it's a pc only issue
---
Hero engine isn't new, it was used for SWTOR in 2011. Nevertheless, I also don't understand why didn't BGS use it, especially since Zenimax has it licensed AND ironed out for ESO already.
---
It's just to piss people off, that's all any hacker ever really wants at the end of the day.  They want you to react, and they want you to be upset.  They're genuine pieces of shit just for the sake of it.
---
Because then the game would be shitty
---
But thanks for that info, I didn't know it was the same engine! Does SWTOR still use it? Because I played SWTOR in like 2016 to try and it didn't feel like ESO
---
Modders/Hackers have always improved Beth’s shit.
---
There must be a a few people around right? What if the servers catch fire or this happens? 
---
Don’t you get paid double if you work during holidays anyway?
---
"16x the hacks"
---
Well i guess what little chance of existing bugs with this game being fixed gets smaller and smaller everytime they have to fix this crap
---
So is there any video evidence for this? All hacks
---
/exploits in the past have been complete bull.
---
I make my leather armor out of toilet paper, baseballs, and tin cans.
---
Oops thought I did
---
? Certain kinds?
---
Im not playing the game. Im just subscribed for these hilarious bugs : D i dont understand how you can still play this piece of shit : D
---
I have still yet to see concrete proof of this and it has been asked for several times. This is likely another rumor that gained traction without any basis in fact.
---
Oof what a wankstain.
---
&gt;be more upset with the hackers? You're bu
---
No the guilty one is bethesda for using and old and not secure engine. They were warned but they hungry asses didn't pay attention and we players are paying the consequences
---
What engine?   Obsidian don't have a multiplayer game engine.
---
goes to show just how many people WERE cheating already.
---
i refuse to log in atm because of this :/
---
Tag the junk you need, otherwise just pick up everything.
---
Place your camp so you can use a junk extractor. Get yourself a santatron.
---
Do workshops.
---
I don't think so, this is not a trade hack, instead the hack treats players like containers so skins would still be vulnerable. Only safe bet is to not carry valuable items, play on a private server, or don't play
---
That is (fortunately) impossible.
---
The characters inventory is stored Server Side, and it stays that way until you log-in.
---
The current Inventory Steal hack can only steal things the client sees (For example the Weapons and Armor you currently have equipped) but it can’t steal things I hasn’t seen (for example Stimpaks).
---
"content"
---
Of all the things i find myself running short of, junk in general is definatly not an issue lol, if ur on xbox ill give you bulk
---
I think Bethesda should take the pc version of 76 offline completely until this is resolved... it might at least save what player base is left on pc..
---
Yes I'm on xbox
---
&gt; 3 months in low security prison is easy

And putting a tick in that box that says "do you have a criminal record" every time you apply for a job?

Rivi Fanquu   thanks btw
---
Why do people stop to look at terrible accidents on the highway or trainwrecks? If you like that sort of thing then FO76 is the gift that keeps on giving.
---
Wish my bank account could get a roll back for the price of this game, hi oh!
---
I'm doing the same thing and it's working quite nicely.
---
Seriously thank you for info. Wife and I are excited.
---
He's not wrong though
---
That really stinks!
---
Maybe if you had another player that could be in the private server with you, so when you crash, they would still be there, so you could join it back?
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk
---
Here you can see a hacker using the exploit to clear inventories.
---
I would say the hackers are naughty, but Bethesda takes the coal for "allowing" this to happen.
---
The release was timed just right, while Beth would be out on vacation
---
enough proof for you?

I have over 60 hours in the game purchased when it came out, quit when disconnects made me lose items and support told me eat it because they can't restore items. But to answer your question: because I can, this is reddit not your inclusive cult.
---
Any source? I don't trust Bethesda to have any common sense now.
---
Can I play on anyones private server? I don't do much i jus walk around killing stuff while doing quests.  I'm lvl 100 an use some stupid pipe gun
---
Strange that no one has hit the .. record the last 30 seconds button yet..
---
Damn that looks bad. I hope for everyone's sake it's not clever editing and that's really just a mule account.
---
Waoh 60 hours ! Dude you must know the game better than anyone else since you played it so much ! Because you can ? Dude thats the worst possible fucking awnser, like, "why im killing people ? Because i can", just what the fuck ? Also, this isnt your hate cult, go on r/Fallout or on youtube for that, there is already enough of it.

&gt; Those of you who are willing to put your fate into the Purveyor’s hands will be able to select the Mystery Pick option when you’re browsing her inventory. In exchange for 60 Legendary Scrips, the Mystery Pick will give you a completely random 3-star legendary item. As always, you can find the Purveyor cozied up amid her vast collection of weapons and armor at Berkeley Springs Station.

That's 17:00 24/12/2019 UTC to 17:00 31/12/2019 UTC.
---
Oof better give them to a friend while we can then!
---
BRO THEY'RE STEALING PIP BOYS !!!! we can't even equip extra shit
---
The hackers are complete fucking scum.
---
There is in no way you could compare them to Bethesda.
---
So I don't understand a couple things here:
---
A) The game is server based. Outside of some limited interactions (trading), there's no way for our client to view the contents if another player's inventory or stash, and if this was true it wouldn't be as easy as just jumping from one person to the next.
---
B) It doesn't actually show him taking anything if you pay attention. You can see in the sections where he goes into the stash immediately after that there aren't any new weapons in his inventory, and the contents of the stash box are the same each time, with HIS name on it. Not the other chatacters.
---
C) What's most likely happening is the characters are becoming "unequipped" from his clients client's perspective. The best indicator of this is the clip of the guy fighting the ghouls at Whitesprings. In nothing but a power armor frame, those ghouls would have chewed through him quickly. They didn't, and he was still killing them.
---
I know everyone WANTS to believe this, but this video honestly shows nothing conclusive. Just someone manipulating what their game client shows.
---
shhh, I think you forgot your meds friend.
---
Raiders gonna raid....
---
I heard that it can be used in PC in nuclear winter, but I don't know for sure, only seen proof of it happening in adventure mode, but be careful
---
Grow up
---
Just want to drop this here for ya. 
---
PS4
---
The videos I have seen don't actually show what's being claimed. I've seen people manipulating what their game clients display, but none that actually show another player's inventory being stolen. If you weren't paying attention, it might LOOK like it's happening, but it's not.
---
Dude, it takes lesser time to search for those video than writing your comment. Also there's one just above you, courtesy of Baronik.
---
Also Earth is flat, vaccines cause autism and Moon landing was a fake.
---
I've seen the videos. If you pay attention all that's happening is the game client is being made to show other players being "unequipped", but there's no actual transfer of items, and the players continue to play as if nothing happened.
---
There is no Source, it just how this game works. The Players Save Game is stored on the Servers.
---
Do you have any examples of rampant hacking in ESO? Because I played at launch for quite awhile and on and off again since and I've never even heard so much as a whisper of any hacking nor seen any news articles about it.
---
People like this are all over the subreddit
---
That's terrible. I'd just uninstall the game and never look back, if this happened to me...
---
I mean you can sorta blame the players too. Security issues in the game have been a problem since launch so there was always a very big possibility of this happening. Just don't play this game people how many more times do you need to be burned. Get F4 with mods and you will have a much better experience
---
10,000 is low.  I'm not a real caps fiend but I have over 20,000 on two characters.
---
To grind caps you need the max hard bargain perk card, don't fast travel or at least get travel agent, loot all enemy gear and sell it.  Never buy anything from vendors.
---
Destiny 2 is legit. There's a butt ton of shit to do. You can play all day and not do the same activity twice. You could probably play 8 hours/day for years and still have stuff to grind for, even if they didn't keep updating it and adding more stuff to grind for. If you're looking for a satisfying grind look no further!
---
What about all the people reporting their items being stolen, both here and on the beth forums?
---
7 hours 14 minutes from this post. Couldn't figure out how to use the time bot.
---
Mate, no one buys repair and scrap kits. We get better ones in game
---
Pay attention to the video.
---
The characters appear to be unequipped, but when he goes into the stash immediately after doing it there are no new items in his inventory, and the guy at Whitesprings keeps on fighting like nothing happened. He would have died almost immediately trying to fight ghouls with nothing but his fists and a power armor frame.
---
All that shows is a visual, client side glitch. Not inventory theft. Stop feeding into the hysteria.
---
I agree completely. The people who have that backwards are what's wrong with society today. Victimising the bully, and bullying the victim, seems to be how they attack. It's a pathetic expidemic nowadays, and should be called out. We don't need that type of mentality taking over.
---
What about all the people that reported the same thing about the trade glitch, and pickpocketing, and the vault raids deleting inventories? None of which actually happened? This happens all the time.
---
You must be stupid or blind (or both). He run towards the player, point the cursor and strip out of inventory items. If you'll read earlier information you'll know he can't get access to someones stashes but only inventory (on character)...
---
That's incorrect info. ESO doesn't run on the hero engine you were right the first time it runs on a custom built in house engine Zenimax made. SWTOR however does use the Hero Engine yeah.
---
Upvoted, I also wanna know... been playing NW for hours coz of this issue, but im not gonna log in back to Adventure mode (even just for checking my equipment) until this is dealt with.
---
If the hackers can also mess around my gears in NW, I have no hope for this game.
---
I'm not going to answer you twice, go there and check for yourself - I wish you'll loose all your equipment...
---
ESO isn't running on the hero engine though. The Hero Engine was only used very early in ESO's development during testing while Zenimax built their own custom engine. 
---
However it would have been better and made more sense to use the custom built ESO engine for a fallout MMO yeah.
---
Except if you look and pay attention, the items aren't in his inventory, and the characters that were fighting keep on fighting, with no adverse affects. The character models are just being made to look stripped on his game client. It's not real. It's a hoax.
---
Here's a post on their official forums I found after a quick Google search, appears he was a well known PvPer and was banned after hacking with Cheat Engine to change the values of player input and things. I don't know anything about this story other than reading about half of the OP on the post though

Go check yourself, don't forget to video the whole situation.
---
Improved repair kits, ever heard of those, not to mention the countless number of workbench’s
---
Okay thanks for correcting them, I didn't think it was the same lol
---
I saw enough from the video to know this is just a hoax. He's manipulating what he can from his game client, it's not real. It's a hoax. It LOOKS convincing if you're not paying attention, I'll give you that, but just actually pay attention and you can easily see what's going on here.
---
I didn’t quite the understand your post, is he in a room with only walls, no doorways? That’s the best way to keep him safe. Remove a wall to access him.
---
If yes, the only thing I can think of is maybe people are running into the area when they fast travel to your camp and everything is loading in.
---
Beth was just being lazy while developing FO76, so they get some of the blame.
---
Huh well thanks for that that was an interesting read, totally had no idea there were ever any exploits then again I didn't do much PvP till years later. Still learned something new today 👍🏻
---
I doubt it's coming back from this, unless bethesda actually decides to do their fucking job for once. The only reason this isn't hitting thousands of people at once is because somebody got sloppy and bragged about it a week in advance to multiple youtubers. The next time a major game-breaking hack is made (and it's only a matter of time; calling the game's anticheat spaghetti code is being generous) it will likely be by somebody smart enough to not spread news of it to the community first. And in that case, anybody playing on PC will always be at risk to have something like this happen with no warning. 
---
Maybe the next cheat will be hacking people down to level 1, or planting a false flag of some kind that gets them banned, or finding a way to brick their character by making the game crash every time you try loading up. The few people still playing on PC are mostly the veterans, I rarely see somebody below level 100, and many of the lower levels have some be weapons or something else that makes me highly suspect it's a higher lever player's alt. How many of those people are going to want to play knowing their hundreds of hours of progress might be trashed at any moment with no warning?
---
It would take BIG steps from bethesda to bring back the confidence that was just lost. And based on their track record, I would sooner put up my life savings in a casino than expect they do what needs to be done to fix this
---
Don't need to, I understand how server based games work. If you did you would know better too. Hell, if you just paid closer attention to.the video you could see for yourself.
---
This is what happens when people who don't know how something works jump to conclusions.
---
You dont have access to your normal gear in NW, so doubt that it's possible.
---
Im sure they can steal whatever weapons gear you found, in that specific round of NW.
---
Source no one buys them at all? I don't quite get why they'd be in the shop or why Bethesda would add more "connivence items" if not one person ever bought them?
---
The masks do NOT drop from Enclave events (although I agree that they should). They only drop with a 0.01% chance from events in the Savage Divide (Violent Night, Uranium Fever, Messenger, Meditation, ...)
---
Now you're just being absurd, and obviously have no idea how server based games work.
---
Yeah, I haven't played in months.  But rather than update, I think I'll uninstall until they fix this mess.  Assuming they do fix it.
---
Probably just the marketing side of Bethesda beings an ass
---
From what I have read, the hackers described it on their forums somewhere. The player inventory is a hidden container somewhere in the current scene. So the hacker just opens it up as a regular container.
---
That makes sense thx
---
Get off your high horse, if you want to blame Bethesda fine, but it isn't like this dosn't happen to other games. GTA V people could tp in to your personal garage and blow up your cars for example.  
---
Bethesda may share some guilt in this but they are by far the minor party.They did not force these people to make and distribute this hack. They did not log in to a server and steal someone's hard earned items. Don't excuse the hackers they are the far bigger a**holes.
---
Will not gonna use your kind help, but appreciate your offer.
---
Will stay offline or in NW only until things get sorted.
---
What do you play on if I find the plan I’ll let you know
---
Oh man, don't waste your time on him; it's futile. Let him play. Maybe we'll hear from him tomorrow, with quite a different opinion...
---
probably that, try to make his secret room as high as possible this way they can't jump in there before walls load in.
---
Are you on PC? I still got 1k .38 ammo left if you want it
---
I’m looking for more people add me KSI ToxxicDucky
---
I hope all the victims will get their stuff back.
---
I also hope the Christmas event will be extended, because now many of us are afraid to participate. I wanted to farm as many plans as possible from gifts, but now I'm too afraid to log in.
---
There should be a law against Bethesda charging money for this game... it stopped being funny long ago.
---
I’m on PS4 pal, sorry for being an inconvenience.
---
I just watched this "video proof", and I'm not convinced. None of the items end up in the "offender's" inventory, and the other players who are actively playing the game keep nm playing as if nothing happened. Likely because from their end, nothing happened.
---
All the guy did was figure out a way to make his individual game client "unequip" other players. This is a server based game, none of our stored character data is available to other players. It's a hoax.
---
Asking the real questions
---
You're going to end up opening your presents a day early!
---
Sav game and progress sure but can it be modified when not online?
---
I keep my Santatron on a balcony, which is accessible only by jumping on roofs with marsupial mutation. Haven't been robbed even once.
---
Yeah, while it’s now been proven definitively to be happening, there were legitimate reasons to be doubtful at the start considering how many times people have cried wolf on this exact issue.
---
I believe will take long time because the strangler power armor from raid vault 94 can be dropped till this day because of the exact reason.
---
I'm not advocating tracking him down or anything, I just wanted to be sure that was the guy before I said "yeah that looks like the kind of person who would do that." Like he just looks scummy ya know? Like if he sat down next to you in a dark movie theatre, you would probably want to switch seats. I just don't want to insult an innocent person :(
---
Yes but there roll back is like a month ago, how about all the players that looses stuff from the roll back?
---
You are right. Bethesda is much worse.
---
Yep, I hope so. Today is the last day of my 1st membership, I even thought of paying for another month (possibility to transfer gear between characters is nice...) but I won't pay a dime if BGS won't patch this shit. I won't be logging in to the game on public servers even for a second, it took me too much time and effort to collect the gear.
---
That is extremely unlikely. Also I would say many of those people will just stop playing and uninstall - I know I would. No game is worth such hassle.
---
Honestly I agree the hackers have picked the most malicious well planned moment possible, but if bethesda made the game properly none of this would be possible. They need to be held accountable for how little effort they have put into this game. It has so much potential but its wasted due to the poor effort on their part. You don't solve problems by sweeping them under the rug you solve them by bringing them out into the open. People were warned that this would be possible lots of big fo76 youtubers made vids on all it takes is watching a 10 minute video and you'd know not to login or stay on a private server. Now people know don't play the game boycott it make bethesda respond.
---
They don't care about your wasted time when UI bugs caused you to scrap your hard-earned loot or even legendaries that normally cant be scrapped. They don't care about your wasted time when you wait for a NW lobby and sit through the timer just to get immediately killed by an aimbot. They don't care about your wasted time when a quest or challenge doesn't give you any rewards or tick off as completed. Not sure why they would care about people losing gear that took them hundreds of hours of rng to get. At this point I would expect them to turn this into an opportunity to sell legendary drop rate boosters or something in the atom shop
---
I'm pretty sure atom shop paint makes no difference. They can use the hack to transfer anything, treating the player like a container. The non malicious use of the hack was apparently for transferring raid armor.
---
Guy who robbed over 500 people in his video stole painted weapon:
---
[https://imgur.com/a/yMf1hk7](https://imgur.com/a/yMf1hk7)
---
pretty sure they can take atom shop-locked items as well. it takes you pipboy even.
---
Good choice, at the very least uninstalling does send a small message to them.
---
In the video linked, that's not what's happening. At all. The naked character is going up to other players and pressing a button, and then it appears as if the player's character models are reset. The players that are actively doing something though keep doing whatever they were doing. One guy even keeps fighting a pack of ghouls at Whitesprings. If he had actually been reduced to nothing but his power armor frame, he would have been dead. He did not die, and his weapon even reappeared and then the "offender" went up and reset his character model again.
---
This is a server based game. What is probably happening is the person has found a way to make their game client "reset" character models, which ends up just being a visual glitch from his game client's side. That ex pl claims why none of the "stolen" items end up in his inventory, and also why he himself is running around naked, because the command probably affects his character model too.
---
It's a hoax, and people are eating it up. Someone found a way to visualize something that looks like what everyone is talking about, and instead of actually paying attention to what's going on in the video everyone is just reflexively freaking out.
---
Thanks for making this, way too many people on this sub keep saying that the hack isn’t real. Be safe out there guys
---
That custom engine is a modified version of Hero.
---
They can take everything that's in your inventory, even your Pip-Boy. It doesn't matter if you have skins applied. Only way to keep your items safe is to stash them, play on a private world or don't play at all until the exploit is patched.
---
PS4 I have been selling in my vendor for 4K. They’ll go back up soon but I don’t think by heaps. My 2 cents :)
---
&gt; You don't need to wait for the crossbow to fully break to repair and satisfy the "repair 3x" requirement. As soon as it degrades slightly, you can repair it.
---
The crossbow degrades faster if you use it for bashing.
---
**Don't forget to unequip gunsmith while using it**
---
**Don't equip weapons artisan when fixing it**
---
From my own understanding of the hack it can be used in NW but only to steal your current NW inventory and not your adventure mode inventory.
---
So essentially yes you are safe to play that mode, in my opinion.
---
Realistically, a lot of stuff is already done and not released yet. It would be a rude gesture to continue releasing stuff as normal while this garbage is going on, but nothing they ever did showed much compassion for the playerbase, so I doubt they will change that schedule at all
---
Same here, just bought the subscription for this month as a christmas gift to myself. The scrapbox really makes the game so much more enjoyable. I've got at least 400 extra stash on each of my characters.   
---
Since this is the solution to a problem the game has been having since launch, it should be made free. 
---
They won't however. Ammobox and Med box will be also fallout 1st. It is exactly what has been mentioned here, we are paying for a solution to a problem they caused. BGS is behaving exactly like Trump.
---
&gt; Second, this incredibly helpful post by u/wickedychickady, which takes all the guess work out of trying to find the goddamn Deluxe Pro Snap camera, which is needed to complete the Swimmer badge:
---
Get the free user terminal from the atom shop, in the news section you will find a notification about a suspicious stranger, reading it will give you the coordinates of the Tourist.
---
Yes, sadly it looks like that, i just payed 15€ yesterday for a second account where i can play more character and can transfer items, damn.
---
Bethesda really needs to give free access to private servers right now, or maybe just a free trial to FO1st to catch players with the scrapbox, but jesus christ.. Bethesda really needs to give us something as an apology, game bugs is fine but this.. big no. 
---
I mean.. game would sell a lot better (If it can sell right now jokes apart) with free access to private servers, you can still pay FO1st for that scrapbox and all but give free servers. Dont be greedy, it cost peoples items lol.
---
You clearly have no idea how servers work. He's injecting third party scripts because there's no server-client validation, so the server interprets the hacker's commands as coming from the game itself. He's turning the player's model class in the game code into a container so that he can loot it.
---
I just had this happen to me. It was very strange. First, a level 3 player with no armour or clothes runs past me and then away.
---
Next thing I notice I'm over encumbered so I check and find that my Excavator armour is missing. 
---
I figured it was a hack but not really understanding what had happened, so I looked for the player and found them at Whitespring. I went there, found them and saw another player with no armour or anything. I saw the culprit run around a bit and then come around to me again. Thinking I'd try to get evidence, I opened a trade with them. They accepted and proceeded to nearly clean out my entire inventory. I got the capture and submitted it, not sure if anything will be done.
---
GTA V is peer to peer? It doesn't have dedicated servers like Fallout 76 is supposed to have so that's completely different?
---
Just because two things happen to be video games doesn't make them at all similar you know? Video games are big complicated multi part works of art and entertainment. 
---
Also going into your garage and blowing up a car is a lot less severe then having all of your items and gear stolen with no way to get them back. 
---
Had bethesda actually put money or work into the game engine or even better used a more reliable and secure one then yes they would be the less offensive party. However that's not the case. This has happened as a direct result of Bethesda's own actions, they were quite literally warned that this would happen over a year ago and they boldly claimed that no it never would. 
---
It's shitty and awful people are losing their stuff but at the same time this is perfect example of the games issues and why something needs to change with Bethesda moving forward. 
---
Sorry defend them all you like but they literally said OK to doing this through inaction.
---
Yea from what I read they were going for 2-4K now but after the event they would go up who I read it from made it seem like it would go up significantly
---
Unfortunately apart from my now naked character, no. As stated was not aware this was a thing until they took my stuff... so that’s fun
---
Only thing I’m really put out about was my lever action rifle - 3 star having quick reload, quick shooting and VATS increased generation...
---
But no doubt people have lost far worse than I have - I.e bloodied and junkies builds; entire power armour  sets...
---
Ahahahhahahahahahahahahha. Go play some adventure. Have fun! :)
---
How is my credit card attached to this game?
---
It's still easy compared to the sentence he could be serving for burning millions of dollars from a big company with top lawyers. He has to pay (partially) for his actions and people in the future know he's a shitty person. That's not so bad considering he could have spent a decade or more in prison on top of all that. $350,000 also sounds pretty light for millions in damages
---
Ofc it increases the risk. Now they can wait for you in your own CAMP
---
It's not though the Hero Engine was only used during early development of ESO so Zenimax had a testing area for their own engine they were building. You can check out the Hero Engine wiki yourself it states very clearly that it was only used during "early development". 
---
Anyways it's not a big deal anyhow and not relevant to the thread anyhow.
---
I am garlandtd found at about 3:17 is on the airship looking base. he did in fact take everything I had on me.
---
Probably? Less incentive to cheat, less fun to ruin for other players. But that would also completely kill off the end-game for most people
---
I'm sadly upvoting this. I guess no more F76 until they fix this crap.
---
The hint is in the word "traveling".
---
I'm pretty much in the same boat. Also all the discord guilds I'm in and friends tell me they are going away for time being; until this gets resolved. If it doesn't quickly... Well, I have only so much free time and there are plenty of other games to play.
---
Never mind, I manage a big 76 community and we are getting reports with proof as well. I’m very sorry for your loss...if it helps, Bethesda is aware of all of this...
---
its not a conclusion that people "jumped" too. it is legit. call me a liar if you want it doesn't change the truth.
---
So he **did**. Okay.
---
What are you selling?
---
Not gonna go through every video and screenshot I've seen in the past week to find a source, but I'm pretty sure you need to be within roughly 200 in-game meters or so of the target for their inventory to load in a way you can loot it with the hack
---
Tell that to literally dozens of people on reddit and beth forums, that got robbed. Here, you can start with these guys:  [https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377294/well-i-just-lost-all-my-equipped-items/4?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377294/well-i-just-lost-all-my-equipped-items/4?language%5B%5D=en)
---
When they strip the pip boy, does it dissappear from your arm?
---
The hack was originally made as a way to scoop up atom shop items.
---
But it was very easily turned into something far more malicious
---
Honestly curious, are you gonna keep playing the game? I wouldn't if that happened to me...
---
Yep, shame it'll ends that way but I won't risk loosing my gear. I finally have time to watch all the movies I've been postponing for such long time ;)
---
This just to know Thier ID and loot. But can that ID me manually entered?
---
Yeah, maybe its a hoax, im 50/50, but u cant cleary reject such a possibility. Maybe its Campaign against Grafton Mayor Bethesda (Fallout76) Its hard to make clearly proof of this Video or its fake.
---
It's real.
---
Two weeks of progress lost for those unaffected, or a year of progress lost for those affected. Seems like a pretty obvious solution even with bethesda's convoluted morals
---
&gt; my prices are usually 1/2 or even 1/4 of what I see other people charge. Am I doing something wrong or what?
---
Simple law of supply and demand.
---
If it's not selling the price is too high.
---
From my POV he can only steal an item if you are equipped with it. So if someone get robbed, that person can keep fighting if he cycles to another weapon.
---
No? It's not the hackers fault bethesda purposely allowed the game to be so exploitable even after being warned?
---
At 1:35 you can see him take my stuff. He then proceeds to wear my sheepsqwatch outfit the rest of the video. If you paid any attention at all it’s pretty clear what is going on. He shows all the items he took.  I boggles my mind the lengths people go to argue shit
---
People are really *not* blaming bethesda? 
---
I mean sure the hackers deserve the worst of it, but people have been reporting script-injected duping, NW hacks, and Spawning Entities and the whole ass prydwen before the hack was even a rumor.
---
This was preventable, hope they can make it right with all those affected.
---
It's all "hdtu fa hjffPCMASTERRACEfkfu" until you start complaining about hackers.
---
That's the price you pay for playing on PC.
---
Except he's not looting any containers, nor is the command to loot a container showing up. Which is the other way this "hack" was described. If there was no server-client validation there would be no way for the game to tell who has purchased the game and who hasn't, so. You were saying? I know exactly how server based games work. Your client is nothing more than UI for interacting with the information being sent from the server.
---
This is nothing more than a visual glitch.
---
I really. Really. Feel sad about you.
---
I know I'm wasting my time, but look here:
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV8INQvlbrM&amp;feature=youtu.be](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV8INQvlbrM&amp;feature=youtu.be)
---
Yeah I'm leaning this way too from the vid and player reports, it looks like they can only take equipped items like your armor and the gun/ammo it uses that's in your hands at that moment
---
Does this hack work on all platforms ? And is it only possible if you trade with someone ?
---
I would. I mean.. its not like other games (Day Z, Rust or 7 Days to Die) where you feel dead when you just lose everything. Legendary guns are always a pain, it hurts when you have your "Perfect" one but you can survive, thats what I think..
---
But for sure i wouldnt not play like "EH LETS DO IT AGAIN". I would rather stop playing few weeks or months and try again later.
---
This guy is a piece of shit, but that's not what made me the angriest it was the dumbass bandwagon comments like 'Doing gods work' that made me the angriest. I don't understand why people have to shit on others for just playing a game they enjoy.
---
Kinda like how alliance war works in elder scrolls online?
---
I feel sorry for you, but I'm glad that more video proofs are being made.
---
Interesting, why he didn't take all of your stuff, including pip boy? It's possible afaik.
---
They shouldn't be able to take out of it if it's locked without causing themselves to go wanted
---
Don't forget the daily/weekly atom challenges that need you to be on a team.
---
So all the dozens of people claiming it happened to them in the bethesda forum and on this subreddit are lying? Honestly your attempt at damage control in this thread is pretty entertaining.
---
Only PC at the moment. Trade is not needed to steal items.
---
Hey guys, I can't play at the moment because I'm away for the holidays. I don't understand all the dramatic posts about hacks. What is going on? Can anyone explain it to me please?
---
I really wish a single day could go by without a fallout 76 hacking story lol 
---
I don't understand the mindset of people that hack.
---
tell that to the guys showing off how it works step by step.
---
Great. This saved myself a 7k grind i wouldn't have done. Thx
---
Fair enough, but yeah semantics aside - ESO engine should've been used.
---
At this point anyone claiming the hack isn’t real may very well be one of the many hackers themselves trying to push people back into public servers
---
Was wondering where the canned laughter came from
---
Yeah, he’s in a room with no doors.  I tested all around him to make sure you can’t exit PA anywhere near the walls.
---
I assume they are just jumping in when camp is building now.  I have moved the room up high and removed the stairs.  Maybe that will work
---
This https://youtu.be/qjpUcD8ST00
---
Just did that build.  Thanks!
---
I wouldn't risk it.
---
Dam - just hope they fix this quick. Hope theres not such a thing as a jail broken console lol
---
It's an internal timer Bethesda has for how long your private server will stay up...so if you're trying to server hop private servers...you have to wait the timer out so your server goes down and a fresh one goes up...otherwise you'll get the same server you were on...with all the enemies killed that you killed...so on and so forth.
---
Juice head has a video of the hack. It clearly shows his entire inventory being stolen. Equipped items and non equipped items. Everything except quest items.
---
It takes everything you have in your inventory, even ATX items. The only thing left are untransferable misc items like keys and quest related items
---
Yeah, I got hit tonight. I stepped out of my PA for a minute to craft some food. A level 2 comes by and I go back to my camo x-01 with jet pack and it's stripped. They also took my clothes and the laser gun I had on me. Didn't catch the whole user name. Scarlet something. Maybe it was them, IDK. They need to fix this shit. 
---
Anybody know where to get x-01 limbs or the jet pack mod?
---
Months? That's highly optimistic of you
---
I didn’t think that comment was that hardcore?
---
Game would sell more and better (If it can sell a sht right now) with a free private server access, but Bethesda is greedy, wont happen.
---
It's Sinseer
---
I mean damn, these damn people don't have a life. It's just a fricken video game that won't do anything for you in real life. Maybe Bethesda should have never made this game online. Granted this game has it's faults but these people just ruins it for us who play the game the right way...
---
I see wanted players all over the map, so I don’t think they care about that.  😀
---
Are you seriously defending the developers and blaming the hackers?
---
So uh... how does Bethesda's boot taste right about now?
---
Yeahh! 1st to everyone!
---
So Sony was right about the whole cross play stuff then, huh?
---
The hack turns you into a container, they can take everything.
---
Its dangerous to go alone take this! *Yoink* huh? Hmm its dangerous to go al..*yoink* wut?? Its.. *yoink*. Welp you have your fists right?
---
OMG this is so broken
---
What an absolute scumbag.
---
I would say having your expensive super car permanently destroyed is plenty damaging and even if it is peer to peer at the end of the day things save to rockstar's server. At then end of the day regardless of any negligence on Bethesda  part the hackers are the jerks who are causing people harm.
---
Fucking sold!
---
The current exploit that allows for items to be removed from players' inventories only 'exploded' yesterday.
---
Providing that they can hotfix it today it would be a day or two of lost progress.
---
Thanks for the video. The only good news is that I can't play at the moment :-(
---
You know what?  
---
F\_\_k this guy... I'mma buy a private server too. Full year, in fact. I'm going "all in." This joyless asshole isn't killing my game.

How in the fuck can these people live with themselves? Just going around destroying other peoples' ability to enjoy their free leisure time, injecting this venomous anger into other peoples' lives. What has to be wrong with a person's heart to feel like this is an okay way to live your life and an okay sort of person to be?
---
Can’t quite believe I defended this game so much
---
pretty demoralized right now I am having trouble logging in.
---
part of me feels like this is part of some larger orchestrated push to close beth down and or steal the customer base, so I somewhat want to keep playing out of defiance to the scum who are causing so much grief. 
---
part of me feels like its a hopeless situation, the beth team are just out numbered even if they fix this hack the million monkey army will just find another way. the engine is old and easily exploitable. so I should probably just uninstall.
---
but when I look at the market there's just nothing out there for me to go to, I have been pc gaming since 1992. I grew up on first gen ataris. market wide the other games are all bland as fuck for me because I have played them all just in different skins. 
---
In summary yeah I will keep going. My main is level 380 and hasn't had a proper challenge for 280 levels. I tried a test run of the silo using only regular gear and succeeded in successfully launching a nuke solo. it wasn't too hard but it was enough of a challenge to make me pay attention. myself and a few other diehards in vanilla gear killed the queen even. it was a tough and enjoyable fight. 
---
so I guess next step is to tweak my build to run well using only vanilla weapons and armor that are easily replaced. 
---
the root of all toxicity in this game is legendary weapons. they broke pvp to the point I already stopped that out of principle, people dupe them to sell them, and this guy will probably sell that crap or at a minimum enjoy the fact that he caused so many people so much grief. I will be destroying all looted legendaries in the future and I am going to be embracing the BOS faction. they were right all along. I wont even sell or buy legendaries because that's what props up people who do this sort of thing and profit from it. 
---
so brotherhood it is, if the hackers ever figure out how to make the game completely un playable I will quit. till then I will just adjust my strategy, not aid the legendary market place, and continue on with my favorite game.
---
It did according to her visual. It left a blank invisible part where the pipboy should be on her arm.
---
It sucks for the players, but this was inevitable. The PR nightmare has only been building steam for sometime. The only thing that will force bethesda into action is when people finally stand up from the circlejerk an walk away from this shit show.
---
Look at the comments on the videos. A lot of garbage people are cheering them on.
---
She also cannot access her inventory. It doesn't crash, but her stats and whatnot don't show up on the pipboy. She quit when that heppened. 0i can log again and take SS if needed.
---
The're too greedy to do that.
---
Or a target
---
I mean, not saying that you're wrong, but.
---
anger is the natural response when someone is blatantly wrong to the point of affecting others negatively, including oneself.
---
I guess I could force some other reaction, but it's not like I'm the wrong to be angry.
---
There is 0 chance they will compensate this. There  is no real money involved
---
It’s PC only (you mentioned controller, but appreciate you may use one on PC).
---
All my stuff is gone.. just happened to me tonight.... im pretty lost for words. Looking for more info if anyone can help...
---
I’ve heard there’s a new method that just allows you to walk up to someone and take all of theirs.
---
Hope you saved a few bucks for a private server then :)

"Trades are not needed (they are only added to show transfer took place). You can do this hack within 200m of a player, and you don't need to see them"
---
And they can take everything you have in your inventory, doesn't matter if you have them equipped or not. The only thing left are untransferable misc items like keys and quest related items
---
eh don't be too sad that's life, I've been in love and not had it returned, broke my heart, but in the long run I met my wife had an awesome kid who turned into a good young man. 
---
I have been homeless but in the long run I worked my way up from the bottom into a pretty cushy middle class life. 
---
I have been to war and seen the absolute worst done to and by people, but in the long run I have seen good folks do amazing things too. 
---
losing a few things in a video game is kinda small potatoes in the overall scheme of things. I mostly feel bad at the fact that some people cant be happy in life unless they're making others suffer. I think the worst of it for me is looking at them from the outside and realizing they don't even comprehend how wrong they are.
---
Thanks to your advice I have moved my camp there now. The scorched aren’t too bad, they are a bit annoying as neighbours but some well placed turrets will deal with them like you say. Thanks for your help.
---
Submit a ticket, hopefully Bethesda will roll back your character to prior the hack.
---
Some people are just plain scum
---
I think this just killed the game on PC.
---
I did cranberries, blackberries, and firecracker berries; I think those are are all pretty straightforward.
---
Then, following a queen nuke, I popped I to my power armor and harvested the nukes Flora. for some reason, nukes cranberries (blast berries/crimson flux) count for two different kinds of berries.
---
:)
---
I made a ticket on her behalf. Still no response. Granted it's been only 12 hours now. You know what's funny? I can no longer log into her account, it errors 0x000000171 or something when 76 loads under her acoiunt now. Liek I know it's a fucking game but man, she's really upset and wants nothing to do with besethda now. She keeps asking about density 2 and Cyberpunk 2077 now lol. She just started a shaman on wow classic. I call that upset!
---
Originally they made the script to obtain Atom Shop items off people, but it could with some coding knowledge turned into the malicious device that’s being used right now:/
---
I'm getting a flat earth theorist vibe from reading this post. "I know how this works guys, I'm an expert developed and it's impossible, trust me it's a con from NASA".
---
😂
---
Thanks for your useful contribution.
---
I can confirm it only took what I was physically wearing. I was out of power armor at the time luckily. But he got my sheepsquatch outfit and scout armor set. Along with my equipped Gatling laser
---
People still defending Hackthesda?
---
No, lol, Sinseer is hated in the fallout 76 pvp community, and the guy who made the video ( Bodega ) is part of it, Sinseer is a meme for the pvp community thats why he used him as a thumbnail
---
You can learn the full plans for X-01 next to the military wing vendor at the computers. Mods are sold by the vendor there as well.
---
I’m Romulox at 1:35
---
They do it because:
---
\- they're bored
---
\- they like to troll people for fun
---
\- they want to get good gear without working for it
---
\- they want to sell stolen items on ebay
---
\- they want internet attention
---
One or all of the above.
---
YongYea, is that you?
---
Any news on if they've moved on to stealing pip-boys and atom shop purchases?
---
Yes haha i was happy and said when i found out😂, I’ll let you know if the outfit is the same when i start it tomorrow 14k xp 😪
---
I've started a new character until this all blows over, ive forgot how fun and how different it is compared to being end game and starting fresh lol, its alot more fun starting from fresh again
---
&gt;the root of all toxicity in this game is legendary weapons. they broke pvp to the point I already stopped that out of principle
---
I'm in the same boat, I have played enough endgame pvp that its stale and repetitive, but pvp below lvl 35 is amazing, nobody has a tesla, no legacies, and a good standard fixer will last you all day long. I've deleted and restarted new characters twice now after they got too high level, its just a lot more fun being low level where the game is more challenging.
---
oh i quit pvp ages ago lol. to be more lear i will just see how well i can get things running on the pve side of the house.
---
Would still rather play on PC during these hard times than play at 10 fps on console.
---
Wow, maybe we were on the same server? That's the one who got me about 1.5 hours ago.
---
Yes, that's usually how we've done it. Is the workaround here inviting him once I'm logged into the world?
---
Source on the crying?
---
I have a question.  I'm not sure if all this is true but if the game only saves every 10mins, log off, fast travel, exiting vendor/trade/stash and not when you alt+f4 or other "force close" couldn't you just immediately "force close" and have all your stuff back?  I have lost stuff force closing the game due to the "Aid bug" but only things I've picked up in the last few mins.  This would be a nice thing to know.
---
Yes. As per juicehead’s video.
---
Literally said "look up lizard squad" lol but I'll pull up the article
---
They do it because fallout 76 is a buggy pile of shit and idiots that still play it deserve to be robbed
---
Because even they best game can be hacked and regardless of anything else this wouldn't be a problem with out some jerk out to ruin other people's fun.
---
Bye!
---
They can’t restore lost items.
---
&gt;le, alongside the implementation of a proper Anti-Cheat system of sorts. Without them, the Steam release is basically doomed. Anti-Cheat definitely needs to be their nu
---
Probably not the maker of it.  
---
That guy isn't able to render a video
---
Because it's fun to see people who spent tons of money on a horrible game by a horrible company grieve
---
If by action you mean shutting down 76 because everyone walked away, then... sure.
---
You can ping them on twitter.
---
I took it as "hey this kid cried, also look up this."
---
Peppeebridge Farm Mints remember.
---
Wow I though ESO had it bad... Why are you guys still playing this game :O
---
Bet there are just many many hackers in this reddit and they are pretending like they don't care. Whenever I post something regarding hacks or calling out hackers, I get insta bombed with dislikes and get this sarcastic people out of nowhere. Abandon ship people, this game is done for at least on PC.
---
I just went through the comments and I feel the same... People saying we deserve it for just playing the game? I'm just like... Wow.. Man they wants us to work together and then something like this happens.
---
Oh I feel you. Anyway here this is enjoy

1. It's not the same company.
---
2. It's not the same engine.
---
I find it so awesome when I recognize a gamertag! Kudos to you for being such a cool player!
---
Dude was not talking about Beth, he was saying that person is bullying OP, the victim.  
---
To OP it doesn't matter that Beth has an open door, just that some ass exploited it on them.
---
Too lazy. 
---
Over-reliance on Modders to fix their blunders.
---
Not enough return on investment, when they just want your wallet without you playing.
---
Inexperienced Devs.
---
Its a very sad day in the waste land!
---
Sigh...
---
Anyone know if I have to log in to receive twitch prime rewards because this situation is not encouraging...
---
I hope this will be resolved soon... (and I don't mean blizzard soon)
---
Hop on public servers and you can find the proof it exists once they take all your items.
---
It doesn't..... They already have your money.
---
That's what you get for financing POS software.
---
Take an eco class.
---
.I..
---
“Fallout 1st, so you can pick who mugs you”
---
yes.
---
So, serious question here? Who's the bigger assholes? These guys for doing the hack? Or Bethesda for designing the game in such a way that this is even possible in the first place? Because in 99% of games, this is literally impossible to do.
---
The guy who made this must be lower than whale shit, what a wanker and anyone who uses it, the game is massivley frustrating as it is with all the bugs but to throw this into the mix will kill adventure mode overnight, hackers once identified should be hit with a massive fine and banned from the game for life.
---
Offline FO76 is ideal for me vs the online anyway, as 5 of 7 days I am stuck on Wifi currently.
---
And what should they be playing not alot of stuff out there that doesnt suck these days
---
just purely off the top of my head, youve probably nailed it. 'validation'. should be a relitively simple matter of checksumming the files .  check the checksum at run time. Any currupt file get trapped. wouldn't make it 'impossible' to alter the files, but would knock out 99% of the hackers. you can alter a file, but it would be extemely difficult to find the checksum and even harder to calculate the new checksum, and, the checksum of the file that holds the encrypted checksum will also be invalid.................or something like that...
---
funny meme man
---
They can take everything, even your pipboy and ruin your character forever.
---
Wait your wife has a boyfriend? That's pretty ebic
---
lol item stealing hacks? Sounds legit huehue
---
Not sure, had a hunting rifle equipped too, but managed to hold onto that? Hopefully it is fixed soon
---
This is the most autistic comment in Reddit history. Congratulations.
---
HOW THE FUCK IS BETHESDA STILL SILENT ON THIS.
---
Bethesda: it's the holidays we couldn't get back to this in time but we are working on a fix for the next patch in 2 weeks.. check back soon for updates!
---
I went back to playing my lvl 25 alt who is running basic gear.  Only leather, wood and pipe weapons.  It’s been fun.
---
you'd have to be extremely naive to believe anything that stems from Bethesda's PR.
---
I get downvoted all the time for saying this but I've more than been proven right at this point. so have at you.
---
I mean with the exception of Skyrim there's always been Classes in TES games and same with Skill Trees. Same with abilities too they just weren't nearly as impactful or flashy and spells technically are abilities on their own. ESO's combat still has basic attacking, power attacks, blocking, bashing and so forth which are the core of TES combat then with abilities/spells mixed in, again which is core TES combat. Heck they even added a pretty decent 1st person mode which is cool. Then you've got all the awesome lore, things like the ability to steal and a whole crime system, choice based dialogue and quest choices with different outcomes and such. Honestly ESO just took everything from the TES games and added more RPG to the mix. There's nothing generic about it as with the exception of sure something ultra basic like cooldowns the game does, at least on surface level a lot of things unique to the MMO genre. 
---
Personally I think it does a lot of things better than the core TES games and thats after playing them since Daggerfall but hey to each their own, you strike me as someone who was probably just looking for "Skyrim with friends" or something which is totally fair.
---
Yeah but the rest my mule is  over-encumbered &amp; the only way to play the game safe mode on PC is buyin new account play the game normally start from 0   .  
---
 But this not really solving the real problems cuz need main char for doin some Scorch Hunting grind etc right .  
---
Hopefully Bethesda found permanent way to fix this Thief Guild problem on PC . I guess gonna play Fallout 4 / another game for this week but wasting my time skip this Scorch Event .
---
Ok go ahead , But ill enjoy both my items and bank balance.
---
They can just steal your pipboi and fuck your character up for good if you don't have anything good on you
---
trying to bring some common sense to this community is more than "anything of value"
---
I swear you cannot make this shit up anymore it just gets worse and worse, glad I got my copy for almost nothing
---
The Players with skill Sneak 0 &amp; pickpocket 100 , you know what i mean :P
---
It’s either your private world being open to friends or your team , therefore if you’ve chosen “team only” you can’t invite someone who’s not in your team to your private world once it’s been launched.
---
As a PC player, I will not launch the game until the hack is solved...
---
She probably wouldn't need a boyfriend if he didn't play 1000s of hours of fallout. Just saying.
---
I wonder why I retained a lot of my stuff then? Is the script/code they use inconsistent? or just luck? Either way, 0/10 not recommend.
---
Good so we know his username and his face. Bethesda should ban him and sue him.
---
Wouldnt it be funny if this was put in place just to encourage the purchase of private servers?
---
Cynical and highly unlikely, but funny to think about.
---
The remaining people still playing this are just masochists that love getting backslashed by bethesda. Im pretty sure they would put a pile of garbage in the atom shop for $200 and people would still buy it, these same people probably have thousands of hours in Anthem too.
---
What will they do when they ban them all? Back to 4 Chan or some shit? That still a thing..? Pop them pimples, look for a job? Make their own pizza rolls instead of momma?
---
Possibilities are endless for them..
---
Some kind a of a cheat or hack? Heard of a hack that steals a persons inventory a while back, is that this?
---
Everyone should get christmas off. We can chill on one game for a little while. People should have that time with their family.
---
 
---
nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger
---
So glad this hack and other’s misfortune has vindicated you. You must feel so special, right now.
---
You made 4k caps, be happy about it. Who cares what they set them at?
---
Think you misunderstood what I meant. They waited for this until Bethesda would go on holiday like last year to ensure it was broken for as long as possible. Which will cause a rise on the "Bethesda has given up" posts, but the last hack these same people put out was fixed in like 3 days, which is faster than Bethesda is able to fix their own bugs lolol. Kinda makes it seem like it will be a fast patch if the last hack got fixed so quick
---
"The nicest community!"
---
Because we like playing it? Don’t get people who don’t seem to understand this concept.
---
Probably he was looking for some items in particular
---
​That is Bodega.  Well know duper and hacker from the Gemenaii's group.
---
Go say hello to him if you want in his discord:  [https://discord.gg/wHD3Xp](https://discord.gg/wHD3Xp)​
---
This isn't new, the month of release some dude logged in to find his character and saves switched with that of an different player. Bethesda told him there was nothing they could do. We are all just beta players to these devs. 
---
Sales obviously didn't produce what they wanted, and rather than fix the game proper, devs are seemingly forced into finding more revenue streams before Bethesda just pulls the plug. I feel like at this point criticizing bethesda is just kicking a dead horse. F76 is a broken, but fun, and sometimes interesting game, in that exact order. 
---
I can't feel bad for those that choose to spend their money on what is widely known as a bad investment at this point. Just buy the thing off a cheap key seller site. Play through the main storyline, ignoring the handful of crashes and glitches you'll come across while playing obviously, kill your first scorchbeast queen, and quit. Because there's honestly nothing of value here after that. After that, what you do is on you, not Bethesda.
---
*whiniest voice ever* “Nah nah nah nananah - I told you so”
---
Why do I have a strange feeling that the hack will be exploited by alot of people who will claim to have been targeted, hoping for some sort of goodie bag like with the scrap box?
---
How has it been the past times stuff like this happened?
---
Oh well, I can just report and block. Have a good one!
---
Beth is going to give a shit about their inflation problem. Every mmo has that, but every mmo also has a team that cares about their mmo. Beth doesnt have that so you are going to wait foreve, have fun with that xD Prices are going to raise even higher unless they invent newer stronger weapons, which makes all the afford to hord those 3star legendaries useless.
---
You too! And have a merry Christmas!
---
**nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger**
---
It’s very real.
---
Movies have taught me there are people who put shit inside paper bags and set them on fire and leave them on your door. The news talked today about a Turkish company which sells fake Lifesaving vests which soak up on water and drown refugees. 
---
This is the usual. Morties fucking Morties.
---
You talking about Bethesda?
---
Another thing to keep in mind is that the goal of the hackers isn't to get stuff for their own use, it's to make people afraid to play the game because they're so pissed that people still enjoy playing a game they don't like that they've decided to force people to not play it. They're sabotaging the game, not with a bug or bad code that was left in, but by injecting their own code into the game and taking advantage of the lack of anti-cheat software. That's the only part of this that can accurately be blamed on Bethesda. They really should have had some form of anti-cheat software by now, especially since Nuclear Winter.
---
Gifts give between 5 and 100 scrip with a 20% chance of getting at least 5.
---
What this game needs is an "all-hands-on-deck" approach from Bethesada to fix it. Even if that means they have to transfer resources from starfield and the new elder scrolls they working on and take down the game for some time. Then start with a proper relaunch with wastelanders.
---
The situation players have to deal with right now is just an insult to their dedicated and loyal fanbase. Fallout fans deserve than this!
---
Because when I find a plan that I don't have, its priced in the 1000s like that. Its frustrating when you find out you added to a system like this instead of helping out someone who genuinely needed it.
---
# nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger nigger
---
nice try mr. hacker
---
you won't be getting my wood armor
---
and my axe!
---
This is on Bethesda as much as the hacker.  They have let hacking happen for far to long and lost control of their own game.  This has been building  and building.... bad people do bad things and when the people in power this case Bethesda do nothing to combat it then its totally on them.  
---
We the playing community new this was coming how could Bethesda not know or care.
---
I'm at the point now I can't pvp because AMD and strangler/laser throws me to desktop and now I can't pve with the community because of hackers.  So I have  multiplayer game I can't play.  Nice work.... I think a refund is in order for al of us.  Game cost, fallout first, atoms bought all off it.
---
Fix this or give us all our money back the game died 22nd December 2019.  Do something your loosing the tiny amount of support you have left and that's not just fallout Bethesda that's going to be all your games....once trust is gone it's gone and so will our business (mine at the least)
---
Wake up fix this or get fucked Bethesda and the hackers 
---
@OP wake up kid they let this happen you can get fucked aswell
---
Yes, everything in your inventory is fair game. The only thing I haven't heard being stolen is caps and scrip.
---
Lol
---
Nah. Every applikation has vulnerabilities. The only reason something isn't hacked, is because it hasn't peaked the interest of a competent enough hacker.
---
Then sure, some things are easier than others to breach, guessing fo76 would fall into that category.
---
Don't let the people that come onto this sub every single tuesday and shit talk this game freak you out. It's only a PC issue. There are tons of people right now trying to convince people that all platforms are affected. It's just those on PC.
---
I was convinced that it will be a problem, but this? This is beyond what i imagined!
---
How do they get around the ‘destroy’ thing then?
---
It's not an accident that the hackers released this the weekend before Christmas. They deliberately picked a time when Bethesda would be slow to respond.
---
500 Atoms
---
Amen brother!
---
GTA and RDO are in similar states as well and those are my favourite games along with Fallout/ES.
---
I’ll take my 30 frames more than happily because I get to keep my progress on all games!
---
Which is the frustrating part. Its things that just sit and people that won't sell unless it's for crazy amounts. I message people to negotiate and I've found people rarely budge. Its frustrating when greed is thr game other people are playing.
---
You're getting downvoted, but you're correct. Repair Kits were obviously marketing looking for more revenue streams. And the portion of people that actually buy (and I use buy loosely as well, as atoms are attainable from in game as well although at a reduced rate)repair kits is minuet . Still is P2W mechanics, although done really poorly like you pointed out.
---
My wifes boyfriend just got his items stolen, be cautious
---
Message is, look at me I'm scum
---
This, the "nicest" community, has a tendency to attack everyone who says anything negative about the game, even if it's warning other people about a hack.
---
It's literally impossible for a hack like this to exist in 99% of games, and even if it did exist, the anti-cheat would catch them very quickly. If other he's could be hacked this way, they would be. There's tons of other hugely popular games that never have to deal with problems like this.
---
Sure, lets give our money to the company that broke the fucking game! That will definitely fix it
---
Ouch. Sorry to hear.
---
you a hacker? i wanna know if you use it and ask some othet questions
---
In a game that has vats (aimbot) built into the code from start. It's funny that you think that people need an outside software to target you.
---
That's really nice to read to be honest. Hope you can still have fun with this game along with your life, mostly deserve it, not like those people filled with hate ruining others players experience
---
Although true but at the same time they must know this shit is happening and there must be someone working
---
The hack is confirmed, and now you are running to Private Servers. Eat your words, son.
---
It's not platform's fault if Bethesda is unable to clear the engine of vulnerabilities. Other more professional games have no issue whatsoever.
---
They'll implement a new anti cheat in the atom shop soon, dont worry.
---
The quantum/stealth boy community would like a word...
---
And Bethesda reveals its kekkaiku.  Now you MUST buy the 1st subscription or be vulnerable to hackers.
---
So this sub is on fire with reports similar to mine. Hmmm... I guess everyone is trolling!
---
This doesn't have anything to do with Beth, it's the way the community. Since launch trade prices have just gotten crazier, I can only imagine what it's like for new players.
---
The "official" script isnt out. They shared the proof of concept and people made an unofficial hack using that information but the true "you are a container" hack isnt in the wild yet.
---
If they do something, would be for sure set the entire game into maintenance and good bye servers until they want to set them on again.
---
Yeah, they should give an entire month worth of Fallout 1st, or give public access to private servers at least, but Bethesda is damn greedy..
---
Yeah, lets blame the playerbase, not the idiot corporation who made all this possible.
---
Wait, people are not trolling anymore? 😲😲
---
Don’t ever hesitate to message a player and ask if you can buy cheaper or make a trade. I have often just given players items they needed or a very big discount if they asked nicely.
---
Have we even had a "We are looking into community reports.."?
---
Dude, I said the same thing and got e-hate. Just shush and let them be afraid.
---
If we're getting technical here, am I the only one bothered by the rifles bolt handle being on the left side?
---
It happened.
---
I have to reply to my own posts now because god forbid I edit one.  Anyways: Make them show you a victim, not an edited video.
---
i hear the hackers are trying to get the new hack to work on consoles as well. have fun while it lasts :), you'll be joining us PC players soon enough.
---
If I saw that shit on my console I’d probably butch like everyone else. It seems Bethesda is keeping enough of us satisfied.
---
&gt; **What recourse do we have re: these hacks?** 
---
play a different game, one with competent devs who give a shit
---
Until I see corroboration or evidence beyond anecdotal, I take that with a grain of salt.
---
Hahahahahahahah The people still playing this dumpster fire or defended Bethesda deserve this. I hope they never get their items back lol
---
Downvote away!
---
That's just it, the hackers aren't the playerbase. The playerbase wants to play the game. The jerks who made and use this hack don't. The only part of this that can be blamed on Bethesda is that they still don't have an anti-cheat solution that could have prevented this.
---
Yeah this is like showing nuclear bunkers to the USSR during cold war.
---
Unfortunately, hacking is not possible on *any* game on Xbox One atm and PS4 is extremely hard to get into for stuff like that.
---
If there are hacks coming they won’t come for a game like F076 first lmao I can guarantee that
---
Have we **ever** had a "We are looking into community reports.."? in regards to exploits?
---
Wait what wtf??
---
Not to my knowledge, no. They've been silent with most of the hacking problems.
---
Yh i asked him aswell, basically he was in his inv and saw stuff dissapearing with the drop sound.
---
It's like taking everything out of a container. It doesn't get destroyed when you take it out of your stash, does it?
---
&gt; GTA V is peer to peer? It doesn't have dedicated servers like Fallout 76 is supposed to have so that's completely different?
---
I am not sure why that would be an excuse for Rockstar, it is their own engine, it was their design choice to make it peer to peer, knowing all the disadvantages. And it is not like they lacked the manpower or money to implement dedicated servers. I mean, I do not really care much about the current hysteria either way, it just seems like a weird argument how GTA V keeps getting a free pass essentially for being even worse.
---
It won't stop, all it took was for one guy to release the code and it spread. Bethesda need to stop scripts running in thier games or at least prevent them from being run by users
---
There is always something happening, if it wasnt this it would be something else. This is the one time of the year everyone should chill out on stuff. This is the most meaningful holiday we have. Not saying you, but some kids screaming fix it now are being selfish. Stop worrying about fake in game items people and go spend time with your loved ones.
---
Oh well I'll just play in nuclear winter now oh wait that's broken too and has been for a while and Bethesda has done nothing about it.
---
dont have to be 1st, just priv worlds would be enough
---
Didn’t happen.
---
&gt; pc players on suicide watch
---
True hero, this is what we need more of. This is what I do as well but unfortunately, I don't have much luck when I try the same.
---
Unlock it, let it roam free, and relax :)
---
I'm gonna hazard a guess he's on Xbox or PS4 and has zero experience with fo76 on PC. Today is day zero for this hack and it's already generating so much noise, I'd be interested to see if he's still got his head in the sand a week or a month from now.
---
\#cutforbieber  
---
We are on suicide watch and it feels baaaaad man.
---
The way of terrorist
---
Well, the devs have said many times that they won't restore items. Maybe this time will be different, but I wouldn't get my hopes up.
---
Hackers are omnipresent. Be mad at them all you like, your only defense against them is to have proper anti-hacking measures. Bethesda not only refused to implement proper hacking measures when told to their faces how laughably vulnerable this game was, they denied that it was possible.
---
Here we are.
---
You can either get mad at the wind, or you can get mad at the people who didn't think it was important to put windows on your house to keep it out.
---
Maybe you should read through a bit more of the sub first...
---
If anybody wants to play I can provide a private world, just hit me up :)
---
Well, we cant deny that to be honest, console is such a waste to hack that no one really wants to mod a game into console when you can already do that for PC with LOWER prices.
---
You have Battlefield games as an example, most hackers, if not all plays PC version, meanwhile console versions are "fine".
---
You have a point, but they, exploiters and hackers has points as well. Its not the same loosing a game for PC that you can buy cheaper with few webs than loosing a game for console that barely have low prices, that's the key here.
---
Enjoy the game mate, we PC players cant right now, but meanwhile enjoy as well the sluttering at 30 fps while we have it around 60-50, that's the price of consoles. 
---
Nothing wrong about me with console players, the facts are there. That's all. Meanwhile, just enjoy the game as I said.
---
I'll be honest, this is the truest thing I've seen so far 
---
If I wasn't skint due to Xmas I'd give you gold
---
If you want to pissed at someone for this, be pissed at the people who made and use the hack, not Bethesda. They're so mad that people still enjoy a game they hate that they decided to ruin it for everyone. It's not a bug or bad code that Bethesda left in. At worst, Bethesda's guilty of not having an anti-cheat solution that might prevent the hack from working.
---
Was thinking of going back, hmm might not take the risk now
---
Something needs to be done quickly, these hackers have ruined the Christmas event for everyone on PC.
---
At this point in time I have lost faith in bugthesda due to all the issues they have had with this cashgrab of a game
---
Yup.  Later tater, be safe friend.  I’m staying out of game for a while.
---
You for sure deserve my entire stack worth of rice
---
10k is a bit much
---
Apocalypse incoming.
---
Not on PC but what you're basically saying ruining people's experience in a game that players have potentially spent hours grinding for is a good strat? Seriously? 
---
I can think of 6 other ways to do damage but not fuck with players
---
They're gonna lose a lot of players if they won't restore their stolen items...
---
Stash all you legendary gear and only use vanilla stuff for the time being.
---
10k Caps? Most I'll give you is a pile of garbage.
---
What about that Fortnite/GTA hacker who was sued for damages and had to do 3 months in prison and was liable for 350k in damages? You would think Forknife or GTA would be under that 99% of games right?
---
No. Not necessarily. Those games could be in the 1% just fine. My statement still stands.
---
Yeeeh, that might work as well ;)))
---
You heard me. They can steal your pipboi and once that is done, you can't do nothing with your character. Re-logging won't help. Turning your game off won't do nothing. You are fucked.
---
As far as I know, there's a web to sell stuff at "nice" prices, like Warframe do. 
---
Dont know how it works, but was like a trader web, you check prices and set offers IMO. 
---
Im one of those guys that prefers low prices - fast sells than high prices - no sells.
---
Why not. Anytime anyone does or says anything negative through internet theyre solely taking advantage of the fact it wont result in them getting there ass beat. Even if its a simple remark. A hacker on a game? The scenario couldnt happen, but idk what someone can say to me irl that would get me as mad as getting hacked like this. They would probably have to actually rob me. Like I said the scenario wouldnt happen.
---
Hrm no! I guess you're right, not about exploit stuff, oh dear
---
Wow.. Bruhthesda needs to get on this as that's just beyond ridiculous
---
Remember when people wondered what an online fallout would be like? Now you have your answer.
---
Ah ok, so the server thinks they are ‘me’ in effect.. it’s not a transfer between two different entities
---
This guy looks like he want to strip kids as well
---
Sprinting into them moves them ... Or makes it worse.
---
Bricht sie aus?
---
Not willing to pay for Fo 1st? Then y'all deserve getting hacked and having your stuff stolen. 
---
Worship Bethesda. Subscribe or die!
---
LOL
---
Obviously the year couldn't end without another huge fucking scandal going on in this game.
---
No, all Bethesda did for anticheat (simplified) was that the programm checks the name of your processes, THAT'S IT.
---
One of the worst methods, because of false positives (which happened a lot last year) and you can just change the name!
---
It's is 100% Bethesda fault und was bound to happen at some point.
---
There is a reason that this doesn't happen in all other thousands of mmos.
---
I'm talking about people who implement and make use of third-party software whose only intent is to interfere with people trying to play and enjoy a game that they purchased and which they like and who aren't harming anyone in so-doing. Sadists and deviants who feel that their enjoyment should come at the expense of total strangers who are just trying to find some happiness in their free time. 
---
Don't you dare try to make excuses for these hackers.
---
lol sounds like you just don't want to lose the argument but if two of the most popular games ever weren't able to stop someone from hacking then it's pretty fair to say most games could be hacked. Do you wanna read the article? The lizard gaming kid cried in court apparently lol
---
This is depressing considered the fact that I literally switch from ps4 to pc this past week :(
---
Will do!
---

---
Just in case you wanna check it out
---
Just remember some of these people will steal your items and then sell them on eBay so they are actually profiting real money.  I personally have been offered cash for some of my items (which I declined).  There is unfortunately a huge Market on eBay that seems to be doing pretty well if you sort by completed items. Of course this is against the TOS of the game but just like these hacks it doesn't seem like anyone at Bethesda has the time or know how to fix it.
---
Will toggling run with the X button on PC work?
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed. 
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. **Avoid the use of trailing ellipsis.** Posts with ellipsis are generally clickbait and non descriptive. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a more descriptive title without a trailing elipsis. If you have questions you can feel free to message the moderators.
---
It's a waste of time - all you could do with that picture is to remember how nice gear you had. That's sad but true. All you can do right now is to not log in to the public servers AT ALL (so either join friend's private server if he won't block others or play only on your private server).
---
Honestly. This is the mentality of someone who sees a drunk girl passed out in a bedroom at a party and says "There's nothing stopping me from raping her and I might enjoy it a little bit for a little while, so there's no reason not to do so." There's a fundamental disconnect in their brains where human empathy ought to reside; an understanding of and concern for the suffering that they're producing by victimizing someone else.
---
"POSSIBLE"? Check again my dude, wanna see some Battlefield 5 gameplays from consoles? \^\^
---
Game is safe for console since no one would crack an entire console for that. Not when you just can mod the game or use third-party stuff with your own PC. If you get banned well, buy the game again with cheaper prices, not like console games plus you have to buy the entire code to crack your console, its not free.
---
That's the point about "Why "Is not possible". Is not a matter of possible, is a matter about "worth it"
---
Anyway, you have a point, no one IMO would do all that sht to just ruin F76 console players.
---
Its the holiday season. They deserve a break from working on bugs, making stuff we *all* love and adding it in for *free*. Oh! And let's not forget about the *TON* of fun holiday activities we have!!
---
...Happy Holidays and Merry Christmas...
---
I'm on PS4 but I was on PC I'd just not play at all till it's fixed.
---
"Nice" as long as you never insinuate that you don't think Fallout 76 is a perfectly fine game *with no problems* and totally reasonable thing to spend upward of 300 hours grinding at.
---
That what hacker would do to get new victims;)))
---
I will send everyone an request but just so you know my weekend was kinda busy so I haven't even had a chance to start yet. But i got up nice and early today and have nothing else to do the whole days so I'll be diving right in soon!
---
Fucking hell, it really is Grushnak/Bodega; I looked up his other videos. This guy is a true cancer.
---
I wonder how Bethesda's going to solve this...like ok they might be able to stop the hack...but what about the victims? Rollbacks? Or a goodie bag of stuff? Either way I imagine people will be pissed off. I don't know if Bethesda could give players the same legendaries they had if they do a goodie bag.
---
The thing that bugs me is, ok your stash is safe...so store everything there but...uh...what if your stash is full? And then your caps and scrip can still be taken too!
---
At the very least I hope Bethesda extends the event...
---
Rollback and extended event perhaps?
---
I already know the story. And it's not about losing the argument. I could care less. It's about holding these companies accountable. I said 99% for a reason. It's perfectly reasonable for those three games to be in the 1% of 'more easily hackable games.' It doesn't make it OK, the developers should still put the necessary work to prevent hacking. But Epic Games and Rockstar need to be held accountable same as Bethesda. And I remember people were all over them when those hacks happened, same as people are all over Bethesda now for this 76 hack. Seems like you just don't want people talking bad about Bethesda.
---
It's sad though because an online fallout game IS a good idea and COULD be good. Just, if done right and with care and the desire to actually make a genuinely good game.
---
They will have to compensate them. They’ll have to.
---
That’s why I’m going to purposefully have one of my alts stolen from, so I can claim the compensation. 😉
---
pay yearly subscription? =)
---
The fact that you'd be stupid enough to come back is ridiculous lol
---
git gud,, that bank balance reference was actually nice
---
What if you accidentally rent your server to a hacker? 🤔
---
True
---
They can’t rollback unless they compensate all the players that lose progress because of the rollback. There’s no way in f**k I’ll let that slide, I’d lose a whole bunch of levels and hundreds of large gifts.
---
That really sucks, I'm sorry.
---
Wanted to say I really like the structure of your camp, looks really cool!
---
Some people just shouldn't have access to the internet, laws need to be put in place to make hacking online video games illegal, the West and Europe really have something to learn from Japan, Doubt it'll happen anytime soon, all we have in power is old fucks who don't know jack shit about the modern world.
---
In each individual case, it's a person making the decision that hurting another innocent human being is okay if it benefits themselves in the short term. The reason why stories like this make the news, why you have at your fingertips a few examples of this type of behaviour doesn't mean that it's normal; they're reported specifically because they're abnormal. Anyone who gets onto a crowded train basically trusts that the person behind them won't randomly stab them in the throat from behind "because they feel like it." When it does happen, it's a newsworthy example of sadism and moral deviancy. 
---
I'd just like to be able to peer into their heads and understand what mental process leads up to the decision that harming innocent strangers is okay if it provides a few moments of amusement. What exists inside of them where the rest of us would feel shame, remorse and empathy?
---
Of course its going to, check we already have a nice Country Roads song, what more do you ask from them? Free private servers that would sell the game MORE? Nah.
---
They try really hard, but its not enough, not when they use that engine.
---
No it just requires them to change how items are stored. Change the pretence type of a player inventory from a container to something new and set it to not be accessed. Don’t pretend you know anything about games when you clearly dont
---
God Damn, people are really p.o.s.
---
No, invite new victims to steal from them pretending to allow them to join safe server ;) 
---
Today is the last day of my 1-month subscription I payed try try and looks like I have good reason not to play this game outside the private servers of my friends or just make a break untill the break is fixed.
---
Because Peer to Peer means that it's easier for someome to acces the program, becaise all the assets and content IS NOT SERVER side, like with Bethesda.
---
When everything is server side like in Fo76 the devs have in theory complet control at all time, they are the source and can modify it. Dev's dp that for in theory better connection, faster intervention, more control, BETTER ANTI-HACK, but you can't mod the game and have to buy any kind of extension the developer offers.
---
Mhmm sounds like they did it for the money and not for performance.
---
A simple owned/traded flag in the dB table..
---
Rollback wouldn't have to be extreme, depends on where their backups are at. How long has the hack been going? Less than 24h right? Hopefully they could roll back to a point close to when it started and revolver most of most players items that way with minimal lost progress.
---
Sometimes even initially 'modular' systems can get bogged down if some functionality is needed that doesn't work with how the module system is designed so various hacks and direct calls to things get added and you start getting chains of dependencies and monolithic objects doing more than they should.
---
So while I do think 'archaic engine' is a bit on the side of hyperbole, since we don't really know how modular the originally engine was, or how much or what parts they have actually torn down and refactored it can be hard to make a real judgement.
---
But given it is such an iterated upon engine and given the problems we see I get the feeling rather than it being like an alternate model from an official lego set it's more like something built from some lego that was collected over a few decades. Sure you may have gotten some new pieces, but ultimately the model ends up with mismatch colors, and some faded and scratched contrasting with new and shiny. Some pieces are superglued to each other which can't be separated. A few of the more fragile bits actually broken off, and a couple of pieces where someone actually sawed pieces in half because they didn't have the individual pieces, which sure they work mostly, but they clearly have ragged edges.
---
Always a good idea to check history...
---
I don't know what they will do, but I've already been hacked, and I don't see myself coming back any time soon.
---
I have never seen denial so thick before.
---
not possible, unless old user with some decent karma or post history will become hostile hacker?
---
You will never get any to this apologist.
---
If you look at any update post, there are a large amount of people, worshipping Bethesda for fixing the bugs they created, it's so bad that I sometimes think that they are bots or smurf accounts.
---
"May be able". 
---
They could correct the issue, but they wont. You aren't willing to pay for that private server, and this is how they teach you a lesson for not buying into their pay-2-play scam.
---
Haha lol 7/10
---
😂👍
---
Gotta get soemthing out of life looking like that, he can't go outside... Mfucker looks like shrek and donkey made a baby.
---
i read a post about this yesterday and thank god i havent logged in a while , im not super high level and i dont have too much stuff but certainly i dont want to loose what i have
---
Why would I be pissed at someone for taking advantage of something a company purposefully left open to be exploited? Exactly what makes you think these hackers are "so mad"?? If anything all they're doing is demonstrating to Bethesda and the world just how truly broken and easily exploitable FO76 is? 
---
Are you okay? It's absolutely bad code?? Do you even understand how hacking works? The reason these guys are able to do this is because FO76 is running on a decade old Frankenstein engine that was meant for singleplayer games and has been heavily modded on and laid open for the entire internet for over a decade now. Even WITH some basic anti cheat this would still work because it's heavily based upon the actual game code and not just exploiting a server weakness or using a cheat engine like most hacks do. 
---
Again, Bethesda fully and completely are responsible for this happening and were PUBLICLY WARNED over a year ago that this would happen and they did nothing. 
---
I get you just want to be mad mean people are ruining your game and it's easier to just blame them for everything rather than admit any fault lies with Bethesda and Fallout 76 but for the love of god at least please learn a little bit about how hacking and video game engines work. 
---
I mean jesus man you tried to compare this to GTV hacking lmao as if they're somehow closely related 😔
---
20-40k for plasma grenade? More like 100k+ lol, they were absolute unicorns before.
---
The hackers are playing the game. Therefore they are players of the game and part of the playerbase. 
---
Anti cheat would not do much to prevent this. Please stop posting this I don't think you even understand how anti cheat works.
---
I couldn’t take a pic I left before he could take anything else
---
Problem is that they dont test shit either, its like they change or add code and just think "yeah fuck it looks good" and pushes it through, i mean just look at that whole Patch 16 mess with the legendary effects..
---
If there's 2 things we need its a good AC and a test server for patches, even games like War Thunder open dev servers for players to test their game and report issues before they release updates..
---
Somehow this isn’t worse to me than crashing the in game economy. There are people that use games as a form of income and to mess with that market is really unfair to them.
---
Don't waste your time the poor fellows too far down the rabbit hole.
---
These guys for doing the hack.
---
One video of someone doing something with their friend is not evidence that ot can be done to the general public. Two PCs with the same script injected into their code can do things together that cant be done to one without it. If all the guys gear and clothing had just disappeared while he was in 3rd person view I'd be more convinced than I was with him opening a trade window and then all his inventory disappearing. Then we would know he didn't open a menu to trade or accept any trades. For all we know the only thing he invented was a quick key to 'trade all' he CLAIMS it can be done without opening the trade window and that's just as an example. I don't believe that video anymore than I believe the videos of old karate guys throwing people around without actually touching them.
---
Or playing nuclear winter :)
---
Same except xbox. Not worth the risk and from it takes what, 2 seconds for them to do it. As a 30 year old I'll be honest... I'd probably cry if it happened to me. Took ages getting what I now have, I have only endgame stuff. I feel for those pc players who aren't doing it, all that effort t for nothing. Some fuckin bum low life stealing your shit because he's a pathetic no mark irl.
---
I saw the same bugs from PC into consoles, the fact is that hackers/exploiters will love and milk PC since its cheaper.
---
But anyway, maybe you're lucky and never saw those bugs, almost all bugs from F76 are network related. Keep playing, at least you can so have fun for all of us out there \^\^
---
I can unironically say that I’m having fun with Anthem these days. It’s not yet as polished as some of the other popular looters (Destiny, Division, Diablo) but it’s getting there. 
---
Unfortunately no game has quite the same exploratory charm of Fallout, but if you like combat driven games there are good options out there.
---
Hack was confirmed before your troll post. You are still the one to show proof that -you- have lost your stuff
---
No. Relogging gives back your pip boy.
---
Oh I wasn't giving GTA a free pass jesus no I just didn't want to get into that can of worms I was just trying to clear up the OP's attempted point that because "Hacking happens in GTA" so that makes it okay here in FO76. 
---
GTA V has a whole host of its own issues but it's still a bad comparison to FO76 as it is peer to peer. Not that it should be. 
---
But yeah fully agreed don't worry!
---
I’d consider playing the game again if they did that, and were able to reimburse the rest of you for the year of play. It sucks you’re all losing your items, they need to be able to pay you back for your time and loyalty somehow...
---
Please not another canvas bag.
---
So... how far do they roll back the characters?
---
Hope you're being sarcastic
---
You're right but it's so sad, these people are literally in an abusive relationship and can't see it and it's really disheartening.
---
They have and have been. The pip boys pop back in if you log off and log back on, into a different server. It’s a backup for a bug, so you can’t lose your pip boy.
---
Atomic shop items are stolen and lost and gone forever, though.
---
Yeah i know PC seems to be having more issues and the hackers can be a problem but im having a blast on console.
---
You have no idea what you're talking about. Buchta was sent to prison for a long list of various attacks, most of which were harrassment/DDoS attacks rather than any genuine "hacking".
---
Bethesda has repeatedly failed to secure their game and supporting systems on multiple levels, and clearly have no idea what they're doing as far as securing an online game like this. Every game has it's vulnerabilities, but nothing on this level would ever be possible in any MMO run by a competent developer (GTA is not one of those, FYI. They have their own bundle of issues and it's clear that the monetization of their game is the most important thing to them- as shown by their carpet-bombing method of banning people who are linked to hackers for any reason.)
---
Find me any major title with a security flaw or fuckup as big as this one that was run by a competent dev and I'll back down; but you can't. Don't forget this is just the cherry on top of other catastrophic fuckups, too- from leaking player personal information (and even vital information like credit cards!!!) to something as absolutely pathetic like this- the actual wiping of another player's ingame content, and according to them- they have no 'tools' for restoring items.
---
What a fucking joke of a company and game.
---
Wow... Charging people... Why don't you let them in for free? You POS.
---
You mean nylon bag...
---
Sadly it's very true. Thankfully the bethesda fanbase has definitely shrunk a lot these last few years thankfully but there's still a good chunk of people still in this highly abusive relationship.
---
Nice try Todd.
---
My gear is so bad, i doubt they would want to steal mine
---
But even games like Battlefield 5 dont have dev servers. Bethesda is obviously not that rich, cant open a second server to check how game works with new codes.
---
Simetimes I just wonder if they ever played Skyrim with mods, since some errors that they manage to do are related with how sht the actual code of the game is.
---
Just move on to a better game honestly the game will never be actually fixed.
---
but its free
---
read first post
---
i hope they dont delete your post because you are speaking for all the normal players of fallout 76
---
What did you lose?
---
I list stable flux at "retail" (as listed in the value box) - 100c per.
---
Bobbleheads also sell relatively well at 75c per.
---
I've level 146 and I had a pleasant experience of the game with more positive experiences than negative.  I think the worst exploitation attempt I ever heard in regards to console version of the game was the several short lived duping attempts.
---
Nice try, Beth.
---
Blame Bethesda. They're the ones who allowed this.
---
This is really getting outta hand, have we gotten an official response yet?
---
There is also the fact that for Bethesta tyo really fix anything outside of teh shop it has to blow up into a PR mess.
---
These hackers are doing just that, giving Bethesta a christmas gift of what needs to be fixed.  
---
Because its christmas time I can guarentee you that its going to get reallly really public over the next few days.
---
Bethesda, is shouldn't be to hard to track this one celled amoebas , hit them with everything you have and make sure they spend a along time in jail picking up soap from the show floor.
---
Also make sure to get a big compensation from them, then they can spend the rest of there lives paying back  🤬😈
---
Protected read writes would do it. Honestly allowing variables to change like that is an amateur mistake. They just need to validate changes.
---
Thank you for the offer but until they fix this exploit I’m just gonna stay away from the game can’t risk losing any more of my stuff
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Apology accepted, son.
---
Doing God's work
---
Thanks I appreciate it. It's the thought that counts 👍.
---
point taken.  Mine doesn't lag too bad when the vertibots are around, so ... different experience, apparently.
---
The only way that Bethesda could right this wrong would be to restore everyone's character from a backup a day before the hack was known to go live. I honestly can't see any other way of making it right for those that lost out.
---
Well after hopefully Bethesda fixing the exploit that allows for the hack. Good luck with getting the fix to stick too given Bethesda's past history of unfixing fixed bugs.
---
You're fine on PS4 and Xbox, it's only a problem on PC.
---
Bethesda should shut the game down before to many  people loose stuff to the hacking and kill the game.  Your workshop problem is not important right now sorry about your luck but bigger things going on.  Stay off Adventure mode everyone.
---
Agree, but let's be real, everyone on this subreddit is a diehard fan of bethesda and fallout 76 and can't see how shitty this game has becoming day by day, i'm still waiting for a day where this game will be not broken enough for me to come back, but it seems i'll have to wait for a loooong time, atleast there is fallout 4 for me to play, or R6, Fortnite stw if i want some online interaction
---
Yeah, thats what I mean. Its easier to find an error inside the code, than attempting to do one for consoles. 
---
You have GTA 5 as a big example of how to exploit the game instead of actually hacking it.
---
Bethesda.
---
Basically my understanding is they can just be in the area of you or be looking at you and can access your inventory like you do and just select or take everything
---
Why? If Bethesda hadn't created the ability to do it no one would be hacking?
---
It started on Sunday, when most aren’t at work. Worry if we’ve heard nothing by the end of today (presuming they aren’t already on holiday break).
---
Need anticheat that would wipe system32 if the player attempted to cheat.
---
I think it's also to kick Bethesda around a bit for doing such a terrible job managing and maintaining the game. I don't think it's an accident at all that this hack was released to the public this close to Christmas.
---
K
---
I mean if this isn't violation of TOS and serious and punishable offense irl, then I don't know what is.
---
Game really looks like an MMORPG where you sell actual accounts with nice stuff. That's for sure the Bethesda dream.
---
Why bother mentioning something that you don't even know about?? That incident had nothing to do with hacking it was to do with DDoS and literal attacks??
---
Scab scab scab scab scab
---
So Bethesda made this hack themselves?  Need those sub numbers up!
---
But can you play the both at same time ?
---
Last time there was a shitshow I remember telling someone "you might be upset, but I bet you'll come back in a week and start playing again as if nothing ever happened".
---
Well, nothing surprises me about this fanbase. In 3 weeks everyone will be happily grinding again as if nothing ever happened, while bethesda launches more Atom p2w items.
---
Your late with this info, juicehead already showed this was an issue before and even made entire video about it.
---
Got lucky over the weekend - I found a new piece of chest armor... modded it up to 112 DR, but had to give up the deep pockets to do it.  Don't have/haven't found the deep pocket mod for the new type)
---
Well, I know what I'll be doing for the next few hours.
---
No I owned lvl1 then used a level to rank it up to lvl2 and it's not there to equip. I have 15 AGL and LVL 160 and I need 2 points to put it in the slot but I look through the cards I have and it not there, I know dodgy is in AGL and I own lvl2 because I upgraded it.
---
Their focus isn't on fallout 76, they simply dont give a shit. Pretty sure they only have a 3-4 man team working in the fixes on this game and the rest are working on new games. This game was just meant to grab some money until the next releases
---
Private servers aren't safe either!
---
I think the fault lays in as much as the deliberate hackers as Bethesda. Bethesda has made some ridiculous decisions in regards to Fallout First but IMO the way the media rip into the game that is in a better position than it was year ago. It's not perfect but it's not a heathen that many players consider it to be. 😂
---
That is what the 76 haters want. The end of the game. Because nothing would make them happier than to spread their misery to other people.
---
Yeah watoga is still 20 fps
---
You play a bad game, you get what you deserve. If it allows people to do it, then it is ok. Why do you think online games die when there is no security? 
---
I think this guy is having fun, he should be alloed to, until it is fixed. I played a lot of games with this kind of crap, unbalanced shit, and it was still fun for a while. then I moved on. Noone wants to be in a game like this if not for the LULz.
---
Look at this, it is amazing how someone can steal other people stuff and nothing happens xD
---
We dont need to set the game offline. We need to tell Bethesda a few simple words. "OPEN PRIVATE ACCESS FREE".
---
Game will for sure sell a lot more (If the game actually sells) with that damn option open, I mean keep FO1st for the scrapbox and NV costume, but at least give the playerbase a way to play """"offline"""". Bethesda is just greed, they want players to buy it and that's all. The entire game feels like a new game with private servers, but its not worth that price.
---
Rated with Thumps Up and subscribed! (Sarcasm btw since only thing posts like this do is help the person who made the video by giving them views and even down votes make the system show it to more people)
---
I think you're on the wrong post friend.
---
Don't recall.  
---
I do not have a collectron, but I thought I had the option of gifts or junk when I built the santatron.  I could be wrong.
---
Let's not forgot these hackers chose to be human scum who might as well be robbing people on the street. Fuck hackers.
---
Nah I'm not installing anymore lmao
---
Good luck, been waiting for this game to be fixed since its release.
---
Great so in January?
---
&gt; I'd honestly stake my life that your average Skyrim modder knows more about the creation engine than your average Bethesda developer does. It shows. 
---
That's a sentiment that I've had for years and it seems to be well supported based on some evidence of some modders who had helped Bethesda out directly with finding bugs, troubleshooting them and in some cases even give instructions for the exact fix needed to correct the problem.
---
Okay, he did prison time for the other attacks but he had to pay the 350k to Rockstar and whatever company puts out Forknife. 
---
It's a little hard to track down exact hacks in games because most articles online seem to equate "exploitable bug" to "Hack" which I guess is just bad journalism. 
---
However many game companies have had their users personal data leaked, including credit card info so not sure why you added that as a caveat because that's an easily identifiable list. Even Steam was hacked and people's credit card info leaked back in 2011. Steam is known for being pretty secure but I might be mistaken in that
---
logical context is not your strong point lol
---
I recently had my workshop,a long with my fusion core generator contested and taken over by a group of users. That's fine, but shortly afterwards one of them run up to Grahm who walked by and locked him within the trade menu solely to make it impossible for me to buy stuff from the super mutant. He would keep the trader locked for several minutes, so I returned to the workshop to take a bunch of fusion core from the generator that I personally plugged ;)  
---
The player would then run back and forth from the workshop to the trader just as I tried to catch him before he left so yeah, some players have way too much venom and time on their hands...
---
Relax bro when i posted there was nothing else posted.
---
Well yea, it would be simple. If Bethesda cared about that at all. Look at all the other very popular online games where shit like this is impossible to do.
---
But Bethesda wanted to make an online Fallout game to sell MTX with, but they didn't want to put in the effort to stop exploits and hacks like this. Really if Bethesda made this game properly then the only hacks available would be aimbots and wallhacks...
---
Private worlds aren't safe either!
---
The prison time was, but the 350k he had to pay to Rockstar and Epic
---
It's not even like he's hiding, as he's identifiable from his channel:  [https://trello.com/c/gTBsvfmr/668-grushnak-pc](https://trello.com/c/gTBsvfmr/668-grushnak-pc)
---
Yeah probably best to wait
---
Yup and Bethesda did nothing whatsoever to try to prevent it. 
---
Also remind me, when did WoW get hacked to the point that everyone lost all their gear?
---
Private servers are vulnerable too!
---
Don't, the hackers can access the private servers!
---
It's cute that you think Bethesda actually gives a f*ck about their playerbase.
---
Let's be real Bethesda NEVER finished a game properly and I mean it take any Bethesda game and play it for 3 hours and you WILL encounter bugs.    
---
But after what I've read this is even bad for Bethesda the game is kinda in an unplayable state and while I also think hacking is a bad thing and people should be punished things like that simply shouldn't happen in a game that is out for over a year and made by such a big company.
---
IMHO Bethesda is to blame they don't give a damn about this game nor the community
---
From what I've read, some hackers designed a way to create your own weapons, even 5 star weapons. So they're probably just doing it to be malicious, if they can just create whatever they want then sell it.
---
Game is fine, you can enjoy it a lot, but as you said, you cant really sell a game that has an infamous position.
---
But Bethesda will do it, will set the game for 40€ and still give you a pass to take 15€ for scrapboxs and private servers, and well, its working right now, Todd dream.
---
Tell that to ErectBan (the guy behind the hack)
---
Okay thank you for the feedback. I will try another and check my tokens!!
---
If I had some stash space, I would. I am guessing PS4 is safe, but, what the hell. It is a game. If I get robbed, I will finally have a reason to go outside, fix my bike, run again, etc.
---
Thanks I'll be on this afternoon and tonight if you want to check it out
---
They're trying to kill the game and rightfully so. Bethesda needs a wakeup call.
---
I took a break a few months ago, decided to wait to the NPC's are released before jumping back in, and damn am I glad I have waited.
---
Let's play that Fallout card based games with family, it for sure works and that's Todd dream, something with features working!
---
They aren't safe either!
---
Until you realize no one is going to RMT for new items until this Hack is patched due to the risk of them being stolen.
---
Baby with the bathwater. This game is flawed but at it's core is beautiful and unique. When I think of the effort it must have taken to create this world I am in awe. Now some 400 pound INCEL sitting in his Mom's basement is calling the shots? Nice world. No Props, just disgust.
---
They're not playing the game to play it, but to discourage everyone else from playing it. Their fun comes from ruining the game for others, not from the game itself. 
---
Anti-cheat software would absolutely prevent this. One of the things anti-cheat software does is make sure third party programs can't inject code into the game client, which is what this hack is doing.
---
Nice try, hacker.
---
Oh you remember the URL trick earlier this year? The one where you copied the URL of someone logged in and thus you gained access to their profile and was barely fixed in Q3 of 2019. Remember Juicehead talking about it in one of his videos around the time of map 76 guy closing site.
---
iirc that exploit was patched out and can no longer be done.
---
Him and his hacker gang will be taken to court.
---
Apparently, you are correct.
---
Hes a turd, the world is full of them.
---
Yes. Twice last week. Changed my password and okay so far.
---
look at my karma, im clear
---
Stores in my country are packed with FO76 copies for 5-10€, that shit isn't selling and isn't going to sell no matter what, the damage is already done
---
Depends on the system as well. On PC, on the one trading subreddit I can't remember the name of lol, I had seen them go in that range.  I'm sure plenty of them were sold for more than that as well though.
---
Did the pop into your private server?
---
Yep, that was one of the things I was referring to as well; you could literally just log into anyone's account.
---
Oh boy oh jeez ahahahahahahahahhaah
---
They straight up need to give everyone on PC access to private servers until this is resolved. The game is officially unplayable on PC right now
---
What? So they can do it again??
---
Nice thought. Wonder how many Grushnak will get before you spot him?
---
Sadly a "all hands on deck" approach isn't the magic bullet you would think it to be. There are massive overheads that come with that kind of approach. It could even make things worse if it's poorly managed (and Bethesda are infamous for poorly managing things).
---
As much as I hate to say this, I feel that Bethesda would rather shut down the game entirely that to devote those kinds of resources to the game. 
---
All I see them doing is a smash and grab - do some quick hacky fixes to tide them over until Wastelanders launches, sell as many copies as possible and then drop the game in like 6 months.
---
No but the forums the hack originated from bragged about being able to access the "private servers".
---
It's pretty selfish to sell a product in such state to people as well, innit?
---
I do agree with ya bud but you can easily pick up the game for around £15/17€/$20 digitally via CDKeys etc. I picked up the game for the XBOX around that much as well as just under £10 for the PC version.
---
There's a video of a guy stripping Bethesda of their livelihood. I wonder if they understand this?
---
You're right, there's no way to get a y enjoyment from the game at all unless you're a diehard blinded fan.
---
I was joking.
---
Hey it's the Grushnak who stole Christmas! He can tell his Mom he's famous! Just shout upstairs from the basement.
---
yup
---
Innit? As I said, let's let it go for a few days. There is plenty of time for hate later.
---
This is what I like to see. A well thought out reply with proper facts backing it up. No shit throwing.
---
The word I was looking for was “crack” being not possible up to this point. Even if some mastermind did it it wouldn’t be for FO76, but as of now they don’t have stuff like that for X1.
---
Imagine taking 76 this seriously
---
Hello CRs, where are you? Not here obviously.
---
That happen... also the balance is pretty weird, but overall playing in a team with a microphone is pretty fun and enjoyable )) sometimes the frustration is up to the stars for problems never solved
---
Beth is the victim. You blame the person/s doing the bullshit not the victim. Derp
---
I was always against Name calling hackers or scammers (because it was always “harmless” to an extend, and you know who hacked/scammed you) but this time it’s different.
---
Everyone who uses the hack: You’re worthless scumbags
---
Unfortunately while the uncommons and common plans were more reasonably priced this Event, the sheer aspect of human greed makes it a given that anything rare will automatically be hiked up to the highest the market will bear for it.  
---
I applaud that you tried to play above the lowest common denominator, but yeah...  I would have warned you that pricing Icicle Lights or Santa Crash meant that you were going to be used.  The only way I would have said you could safely sell the plans under the expectation they were not going to be resold, was to sell to a friend that you *knew* was trying to learn them.
---
Do you have a link or any more info?
---
Oh I bet they're already gone.  In the trading groups, they go for easily 12K and above.
---
I’m not saying it’s the perfect answer, it’s just the only option to prove what you had prior to the hack. 
---
You’re assuming I or one of my friends has the membership. You’ve got to remember, not that many casual players bothered.
---
Would be nice if Bethesda gave proper self hosted private servers and mod support, so we can actually fix the game.
---
Im one of those guys who have the physical game which one just have a damn paper with the key soo.. welp.
---
Game price right now is good, at least for PC. I always try to get my friends play it, but well.. its going to be a bit more hard now.
---
So, what you are implying is that it would have been better for Bethesda to simply make FO76 fully peer to peer, too? Both cheaper to implement than what the game currently has, and gives immunity to criticism. Looks like a win-win. /s
---
well, some other hackers doing hacks on another game (Sony) got 3 month sin jail and had to pay back 350.000 Usd, have fun guys, lol
---
Ayyy, love you too bb.
---
Difference is that game is good lol
---
thanks.  i picked up metro exodus during the microsoft black friday sale.  also read that outer worlds seems to be good.  might have to get it as well.
---
I don't even have 76 lol
---
Sale as the other person, I used it everytime on ps4 and it worked even open.
---
It's not for me - I rarely enjoy multiplayer experience, I usually play alone with my own pace. I played NW for 7 minutes and will never go back to it, it's not for me.
---
&gt; We need to tell Bethesda a few simple words. "OPEN PRIVATE ACCESS FREE". 
---
I honestly don't see this ever happening. It'd be too costly to have that many private worlds running.
---
Even then it's not a guarantee against loss. You'd have to make damn sure that anyone that has access to your world is someone you know and trust. Make one little slip up and all your gear goes bye-bye just as much as it does on public servers.
---
Oh damn I guess I misread gambling as gaming lol thanks for clearing that up. Also this isn't Zenimax's first MMO, ESO was on an entirely fresh engine and also had hacks that ran rampant in the first year. This isn't to defend Bethesda/Zenimax, just saying that it's not solely due to the age of the engine. Also I found the MMO fail blog that covered F76 until recently and he covered a few other games. This is a link to an article covering Black Desert Online's past hacks. Like I said, most of the articles I'm finding are confusing bugs/exploits as actual hacks.
---
http://mmogfails.blogspot.com/2016/04/invites-from-russian-bdo-guild-this.html?m=1
---
Add me, jeremiahlupinski, I can at least get you a nice wep.
---
Thank fuck haha
---
I get ya bud, it was difficult enough to get my friend to play it but luckily he loves it now. I'd love to create a lore-friendly C.A.M.P settlement within Appalachia, that's the dream! haha
---
Well, technically BF5 company just dont test those patches, they just set them live and sht goes on. They fix it online. But we have this engine where you just set a few words and break the entire code.
---
Todd just makes fun, like you said with that E3 he even used a damn skyrim trailer playing it via Alexa.
---
I know, glad I don't have to play that garbage
---
I ran through Glassed Caverns twice and had it done. Legendary scorched.
---
Lol, it's already deleted. Mods in here are sure vigilant.
---
&gt; he's identifiable
---
It's all fun and games… until someone loses an eye!
---
No idea and I wouldn't want to be the one who tests it, but if an immediate alt+f4 and reload could save you from losing everything, that would be priceless info right now.
---
I don't mind not playing until there's a fix. It's this apologetic behavior, that I do not condone.
---
As a customer - it's not my problem, that they are missing holidays. I paid for a product, that wan't brought to acceptable level in a year, but ok - the bugs and so on I can live with. A malicious exploit that directly affects players is an entirely different animal. It's inexcusable, and should be fixed instantly.
---
I don't care whether Beth loves me or not: it's a corporation. For all the bugs their games are still the only ones I enjoy playing: I don't like magic and like to shoot guns in an open world rather than a tunnel. I like being able to build a character, and a base. Lot's of people enjoy this game every day, despite the bugs. Do not side with scum that spend time and effort destroying other people's joy: they are truly worthless human-like beings.
---
Here's to hoping you find a game and community you enjoy and it doesn't get fucked over by jerks and you can chill and have a good wholesome time
---
Aim-bots and wall-hacks, ruining gamer's fun since the 90's. Ah the memories. I hate cheaters, lol.
---
You all need to wake up and see what they are doing, that they really don't care, you just need to look at the canvases in the limited edition, they don't care, not really... It's so sad but it's the truth.
---
Sadly the fallout 76 hate train is to big and more people are praising it and hope it finally kills the game and calling this guy a hero for doing it cause we alll deserve it or some shit
---
Had this happen last night on my private server. No symptoms of a incoming disconnect. Just instant disconnected from server.
---
Ended restarting the PS4 and it seems to have gone away.
---
Okay your opinion.
---
I can't see a multi billion dollar company as victim that lied to it's fanbase over and over again while also turning the game more and more into a cash grab
---
not sure its stupid, but more that I am intrigued by wastelanders.  will it be a massive failure with not enough wins to offset the bugs and missed opportunities or did they get their heads out of their asses and write some decent code
---
Believe me, it wouldn't proof anything - even if you'll make screenshot for every item you own there is no way to make sure they're yours and not borrowed from friend.
---
You know that Final Fantasy XIV came back after being taken offline, right? It went from a shitty game to a solid one once the devs took the game offline to focus on fixing it before its relaunch.
---
Are they suable?
---
So literally any other game? I already have btw, got Halo a few weeks ago 😍
---
Assuming they get on it right now. Knowing the time it takes them to even respond, let alone act, it will be so far past that people will never want to go back.
---
Giving yourself platinum makes you look like a complete and utter MORON according to Arch Dornan.
---
Surprised you haven't been banned from the subreddit yet.
---
This hack has been the best christmas gift the 76 haters have ever hoped to receive.
---
it's more than trolling, it's sabotage.
---
Thanks for that. Im tired of downvotes just because of console players being mad by nonsense.
---
About that crack, im pretty sure that PS4 has a crack, but well its more like an external chip, you cant crack consoles like that lovely PSP with just using a SD.
---
Mate the players are the victims, Bethesda already has your money, why would they care?
---
GGWP BETHESDA.
---
I claimed my twitch prime items by connecting to twitch via bethesda's website, then going to the atomic shop from the main menu. if the items are shown there as claimed, you should be all set. You don't need to be in-game proper to receive them.
---
Yup what shitty way to ruin someone's holidays.
---
Bethesda knows what is best hence why they never asked Obsidian to make another fallout game. Pff Outer Worlds was at best a masterpiece and at worse a Triple A experience we haven't seen in years that made us wish back the days of being milked by microtransactions.
---
Scrip them
---
It would be kind of unfair to console players (who are likely the large majority) to shut down their game for a hack that does not even affect their platform. And shutting down PC only would still piss off a lot of people who would not mind taking the risk, or have private worlds to play on, and have already paid for in advance.
---
I’m not saying it’s the perfect answer, but it’s about the only way to prove to them that’s what you had. 
---
Honestly, if they don’t restore items, they might as well admit this was one big cash grab, turn the servers off, and await the lawsuits. I’m honestly surprised they haven’t been hit with one yet.
---
Mhm, sadly I don't think getting a new game engine for fo76 will ever be a thing, would be too much work for them moving things over and or redoing stuff.
---
Bethesda also LOVE their creation engine, i believe, but dont quote me on this, but heard Elder Scrolls 6 will be on the creation engine.. i honestly fear for that game, it'll probably be worse than NMS when that came out
---
very cool and stuff
---
but this is the problem (example): 
---
- hacker is located in russia 
---
- playing on a german server 
---
- hosted by an american company 
---
who has jurisdiction? what country will charge him?
---
Either sell or scrip at the machine. Never scrap, there are too many other "plain" weapons out there to scrap. Your scrip will build up over time and you'll be able to MAYBE get colder weapons once you gather enough scrip.
---
This. They were able to see the fundamental issues with the game and rework it from the core up to put out a very successful mmo
---
&gt;As much as I hate to say this, I feel that Bethesda would rather shut down the game entirely that to devote those kinds of resources to the game.  
---
&gt;All I see them doing is a smash and grab - do some quick hacky fixes to tide them over until Wastelanders launches, sell as many copies as possible and then drop the game in like 6 months.
---
Unfortunately, i have to agree with you. At the moment, "wastelanders" is their carrot on a stick to keep people playing. If it doesn't deliver, and i can't see how that should happen, the game will go into maintenance mode with only some bugfixes and atomic shop updates. And damage the reputation of the franchise and bethesda in general even more. Let's hope we're wrong ;)
---
I doubt I can play - today is the last day of my membership (don't know what time it'll be over), so if all friend from my list won't allow any joining I'll have forced break from the game ;)
---
That's awesome, do they have a friendly community you could immerse yourself in that you might enjoy more than this?
---
And lose the opportunity to sell FO1st as a solution for this mess they created for being lazy as fuck? XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
It's a virus that kills the host.
---
His names BodegaTheKid aka vonwiclehoffer report that hacker.
---
Make sure to clear the mobs from your workshops every so often, as they can destroy the Santa pod if left unattended for too long, requiring you to repair before accumulating more gifts.
---
You're not crazy, I get it too. It's more like a two string muted plunk than a full strum... And I will just be walking around or something. No notification or quest related thing. I think it's a bug.
---
Where are the CRs? The PRs?
---
Yeah I know, I dont like that a new engine would fix the entire game, just check Day Z. New engine, new code, new errors.
---
For bethesda would be worse.
---
What was his username? I didn’t see it in the video.
---
?
---
If anyone is thinking about paying for a private server because of this, please just put the game down for a bit instead of rewarding Bethesda for this bullshit.
---
Never happening, Bethesda wants to make money while they work on starfield and Elder Scrolls 6. Ironically if they chose to make a single player game with coop instead of an online service game this wouldn't of been an issue as much as it is now.
---
Netflix NW afk time.
---
But even that's just a brief annoyance, right? It's within the framework of the game. Frustrating as it may be, it costs you nothing but a little bit of time, and the other guy is still himself playing the game. These hackers are something else. There's a level of hatred there where they want to effectively undo all of the progress you've ever made without any interest in playing the game themselves. 
---
The more I think about it, the more I'm reminded of an article I read last year called "[The Cruelty is the Point](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2018/10/the-cruelty-is-the-point/572104/)." It talks about how groups of people can take genuine pleasure in being a member of a group inflicting harm upon other people who are part of another group who they've identified as "the enemy." One of the examples it gives is otherwise normal, law-abiding white folks from the 1920s grinning and posing for photos together along with the black victims of lynchings, hanging dead from a tree, because they're all so happy at having harmed someone for being a member of "that other group we've decided we hate." 
---
This feels like the same sort of emotional drive. These people who have decided that "people who support this game" are now "the enemy," and that it's not just *fun* to harm us, it's *morally justified*, because after all, the act of playing a game they don't enjoy places us on the opposite side of an insane ideological divide that they've spent the past year convincing themselves is real and *matters somehow.*
---
I'm not sure how I should interpret the /s...
---
What I'm saying is that Bethesda had their cake and ate it too.
---
If you make a game server side you have to full responsibility to secure and stabilize it. Of course the hackers are pieces of shit, but it's Bethesda neglience and carelessness that lead to it.
---
If you leave vault open in a bank without guards, don't wonder if robbers walk in and take some money.
---
My friends usually say "Game is fine but... well you know, not the game that I expect" But well, its always nice to play alone, its not like that we've done that before \^\^
---
I can imagine the possibility of giving one week of free trial of the subscription during the holidays, and using that time to implement a hot fix. Still doubtful, but I recall one week free trials were planned anyway, although that might have been only a rumor.
---
Well you can't scrap them... So sell or scrip
---
Yeah, I would hope they can just improve on their engine overtime, if Rockstar can put a game on the old 2006 RAGE engine and make it work for them, i'm sure Bethesda can do the same.. (I hope..)
---
ok smart guy, how is grinding for the right mix of weapons and armor for ones play style being an idiot?
---
So now it's like a real apocalypse, with all of us hiding and terrified of strangers. Goodbye vending machine, we're going underground!
---
Sadly those are cheats that can't be prevented, you can only catch them with an anti-cheat. But thankfully most games have good ACs, and at least in EU cheaters are very rare.
---
Charity? Seems like the bare minimum this team could do to the few people who are still around for this dumpster fire. What on Earth is in the water over there? I've not seen a dev do such a wild 180 in quality in quite some time.
---
I 100% agree. And that's why I refuse to buy any more Bethesda products. I even stopped buying stuff off of the Creation Club. You're right that they chose this path but it is also our responsibility as consumers to tell them they're wrong by not buying their broken products anymore. Send a message. I feel like not only is Todd Howard ignoring us but he's laughing at us well counting his money and giggling to himself "ssssuckerrrrrs"
---
How can play the game like that? what's the point? I'm going to stand together by not playing. 😕
---
This is way past trolling, my dude. Me and my pals canceled F1st sub, there are actually some money at stake. I won't support a company that lets this happen while doing **absolutely nothing.**
---
Are you sure? I'd rather be robbed and lose the $20 I carry on me then be hacked and lose countless hours of grind and work for equipment. You're weirdly sympathetically to a bunch of scum bag low life hackers.
---
Well.. that's a fact. But just remove the "We host your server" and give us "Host your server" instead if that's a problem.
---
I really love the way Fallout 76 runs with private servers, feels like a new game, but im not a FO1st target.
---
Besthesda would ask for you to drop down your pants, in case you haven't been fucked enough, because they CAN'T (in their words) roll back a character to get the lost items.
---
And HUNDREDS of dollars in some cases. A guy on discord paid for items on ebay and had them all swiped...
---
It's not your problem at all, but your missing the point here. A few days away from 76 isn't going to kill you. A little consideration being that its Christmas is all I was saying.
---
Why would this be downvoted? We're all thinking it
---
I'm super confused on the whole eBay thing. You mean to tell me people pay REAL money for things to use in a GAME? That is so weird..I mean, I've been guilty of buying extra atoms when I REALLY wanted to dress up my camp. But still, that's for my own pleasure. Not to one-shot the SBQ.
---
What? This is such a bull shit response. I'm not sure why you're some big defender of hacking scum on here.
---
They've been made aware of this situation. I only hope that there are Bethesda employees who aren't on vacation who can deal with this in a prompt manner. It's very possible that these people are going to have to be pulled away from their families and their vacation plans in order to have to deal with this malicious act.
---
The people using this hack are the ones selling shit on Ebay. Scum all around. People who sell game assets for real cash arent obtaining these items legitimately.... big oof
---
they have known about this for months
---
How'd you come by them? 😆
---
FO76 hasnt had an event where everyone lost alk their gear either, the potentisl is there for a lot of people to lose a lot, but its not exaggerated like you just claimed it to be
---
You seem to have missed the point.
---
I like this idea, since they don't seem to be able to steal stuff from your stash, just what's on you, might make for a good way to catch these guys.
---
They created a product that people paid for. In some cases people still pay for via the atom shop. This apologism is just as bad as the people who scream Bethesda sucks for not fixing this within 30 minutes. 
---
"If it wasn't this hack it would be something else"
---
There's only one other time when there was something even slightly similar to this level of destruction could occur and this hack is far more versatile. So what you said doesn't really hold up.
---
Also, blame the P.O.S that found this hack, and instead of reporting it to Bethesda, and NOT hyping it, showed the world how it worked on yt, and let this disease spread.
---
The entire Creation Engine is fine, but it just gives lot of blank codes if you set too many codes inside, that's the main problem with it. That's why you actually need scripts to play Skyrim and F4 with mods, but Bethesda cant do the same.
---
Probably chillin at home with a hot chocolate waiting for xmas
---
Yeh they really need to fix the game. Have a massive overhaul before releasing any new DLC and so on.
---
scrip them unless they are:
---
- low/mid level gear that fits your level and build (very rare cases)
---
- max level playable gear.
---
No.
---
The second part of your comment was not there yet....
---
I did this last night in my private world.
---
Or just go full Warframe and the grind will never end
---
is it really hacking if nobody is playing anymore?
---
What prevents the hacker-seller to steal the item right back once you purchased it?
---
Yeah, unluckily that the true fact, never been a prime member cuz until wastelander this game don't deserve more money from my wallet, hope Bethesda will fix that soon cuz this is also a massive lose of money for them.
---
I expect nothing
---
I mean, this isnt a new poor bethesda desicion, this is a new attack against the game thats been vunerable to this since launch
---
How can this have been allowed to take place?  It’s been common knowledge over the last couple of days that this exploit was out there, in the wild.
---
Surely, Bethesda should have acted?  Hell, it’s that severe a bug I would have thought taking servers offline for PC until fixed wouldn’t have been out of the question?
---
I suppose that just makes it a whole lot worse if you slap a multiplayer aspect to it aswell, almost like using bandages to patch things together lol.
---
Open private access for all players or at least let them host instead. I mean even some dudes are making a damn entire Co-Op mod for Skyrim..
---
never said I carry all my shit.  i carry my current build favorites.  a years worth of work getting to the point of having what i have.  i guess if you are buying stuff off ebay it can be easier but any real players have to grind and wait for the right drops, player vending, etc.  this takes time.  you don't run with your full armour build and 2-3 favorite weapons?  why grind for a full set of unyielding, vanguard or other 3\* armor flavor and not use.  Same for those top tier bloody, aa or furious weapons.
---
I need nukes.
---
People on console are fine though right?
---
BGS is already working on two large single player games, Starfield in full production, TES VI in pre-production. I personally speculate these to come in 2021 and 2025, respectively. Those titles already take up all resources for future development for a long time, so if FO76 was to be shut down, I suspect there would just be no AAA Fallout for a decade or so. Not to mention staff could be laid off at the Austin studio, as their expertise (in online games) would no longer be useful to the company.
---
Can guarantee the victims won't be spending money on atoms any time soon if they no longer play the game.
---
They can. They did it for the people affected by the vault raid inventory wipes. If they say they can't its likely they mean "they can't be bothered".
---
Never mind ,was ja German pun.
---
They all do. In Canada a crime that has ONE ELEMENT occur in Canada can be prosecuted in Canada. There are Russian players affected. Russia has physical jurisdiction. Just how much does Russia suck is the question.
---
I'm too scared to go into the game and even do that!!
---
Yes I believe so.  It's just a PC issue
---
&gt;It's sabotage 
---
Get over yourself, it's just a game.
---
They should ban the Bethesda accounts of those youtubers sharing the videos too.  They helped spread this.
---
Yeah lets kill this game, then bethesda can decide  to never make another fallout again and we all lose yeah, great idea man, i love when the bad guy wins
---
ROFL
---
Haha, my friend does the same. But to be fair, I just can't wait for Wastelanders. Been playing since the original Fallout from 96.
---
I pay for a lot of stuff. For 90 percent of it I'm not going to ask people to drop what they're doing during a holiday to run and fix it. It's a game dude. I'm dang sure not gonna ask someone to fly home because of a hack, bug etc on a video game. It's not apolgism, for whatever that is. Its asking you to stow away your contempt for a few days and let people enjoy their family, friends etc.
---
No, I'm being unsarcastic.
---
Community's pretty great yeah, really friendly people, but 343 really fucked the weapon/map selection and the progression system.
---
&gt;Lizard Squad
---
To be fair I would be crying too. Getting sentence to prison/jail surrounded hardened criminals, dudes going to be someones plaything within 10 minutes.
---
Hopefully it will bring the good guys together and single out the scumbags. Takes their reason away, to steal I mean. Although PC players shouldn't have to go to these extremes it may just save them from a big loss. Id honestly he gutted, as I said I'm a dad and I play most nights for a few hours, sometimes during the day if I'm not at work and I've put in some effort and time, so for some asshole to come take it I'd be a tad sad to say the least.
---
WTF are you doing on Reddit commenting about then? Take a break, your Mom needs to do some laundry.
---
I know right. If christmas cant stop it nothing will lol.
---
That just fix the game, but almost all bugs from Fallout 76 are network related, that's the main problem that Bethesda has with the Creation Engine. You have to re-do the entire base, not just slap some codes for multiplayer support. 
---
I saw mods for Skyrim that adds Co-op with less bugs if im honest.
---
I think Fallout 76 is probably the only game that you can win at by not playing
---
There's someone trying to make money off this deal.. Bet you anything the people behind the hacks are in cahoots with the people trying to sell Beth the fix to this.
---
Maybe soneone saying "you might wanba lock your door buddy, i just walked in and could have easily robbed this place" instead of actually just robbing the place and claiming it was the fault of the unlocked door
---
I think there's some truth to this. For the past year and change, there's been this whole community of people who don't play the game, who have never played the game, but who hate it with all of their hearts and will very happily lap up any and all YouTube videos which tell them that they're right to do so. I don't even want to think how much money people like YongYea have made in ad revenue by encouraging and nurturing this community. 
---
Would it really be surprising for there to be people who are a part of this group to buy the game specifically in order to create more drama for the sake of these videos, just to *get in on the action* of all of this hate that they've enjoyed drinking in for the past year and change?
---
And the other video just shows player inventory stolen.  I dont what to believe.
---
I don’t blame you. The worst part is, they’re probably camping next to popular fast travel points, waiting for unsuspecting people to drop in.
---
You’re welcome.
---
Bethesda bad
---
Upset has nothing to do with it some people do it becuz they can
---
It happened on a sunday like three days before Christmas
---
May start a new character to see what's going on.
---
What games are "actually good" then dare i ask
---
Bethesda will most likely encourage everyone affected to contact support, and from there they will make a clone of your character at an earlier level, similar to what they did when vaults were clearing inventories.
---
Or Bethesda can get their shit together and fix it?
---
There is no downside to that.
---
I really think that wastelanders will ruin the game. 
---
I mean.. Charisma will be a useful perk but you can just remove points, set them to Charisma, talk with NPCs, unlock new dialogues and then remove those points again. Its kinda.. broken
---
This works both ways. What about a *little consideration* for people who bought the game and wanted to play during holidays? 
---
I don't know if you're in IT industry (I am), but shit like this doesn't fly. Even with games.
---
Why are you all still playing? If Bethesda cared, they wouldn’t have left the game so open to vulnerabilities by allowing client-side code injections.
---
That could be a solution to some issues, but chances are it would undermine the originally planned business model. At the very least it would likely mean no free content in the future, or any content after Wastelanders (~1 year of active DLC support would be normal for a non-GaaS title).
---
Yeah, it was just a minor annoyance. But robbing hundreds of people of one year of their time is...is just wrong. There are people who have real life problems, mental issues and a game like this, especially one where you can integrate with others, is their only way to unwind, relax enjoy what little joy remains in their lives :(
---
huur duur i dont like it ur opion is wrong i am internet i win
---
"Listen, the guy left his window open when he went to work. He LET me sneak into his home and steal his belongings. Plainly he's the villain in this story, not me."
---
Keep in mind that BDO's publisher, Daum Games (or I guess, it's called Kakao now) is also a relatively new publishing company, and BDO was one of the first online multiplayer games they'd ever published (and developed). I know from first hand experience just how pitifully that game was handled from it's launch and how many exploits it had, and it's not exactly the pinnacle of an example for online games.
---
Also, you seem to be confusing companies. TESO was developed by *Zenimax Online Studios* which was a new company specifically made to develop MMOS and ended up staying rather silent for seven years before developing and releasing TESO.
---
F76, on the other hand, was developed by Bethesda Game Studios, with no particular help from zenimax online studios (Although they did apparently get some help from Battlecry studios since they were new to it all; now named BSG Austin), and BSG itself had only ever developed singleplayer games until F76 came around.
---
Also, although i'm still open to that "Find me something this level of fuckup from a major competent game dev" offer (and Daum definitely isn't one), that cheat engine bug for BDO hardly constitutes a fuckup nearly as large. Speedhacks, cooldown hacks, item hacks and whatnot tend to be fairly common- but I've never seen a game that has such shitty security where you can literally just delete other player's entire inventories- *and* the support team doesn't have the tools to help with that.
---
Even Mabinogi and Maplestory haven't fucked up on that level before, but they've come somewhat close (The black robe bug from mabinogi is probably the closest example, but even then that was a fuckup on the dev's side, rather than an exploit able to be abused by players).
---
Guys, this problem is on PC only! The game works fine for everyone else. Make your suggestions with that in mind.
---
Don’t get me wrong, I understand that. But what alternative is there for those who don’t want to put it down? 
---
Honestly, I feel bad for everyone. I’m on Xbox, and haven’t been able to play since June (we moved, and only get satellite internet, which has too much lag to play online), so I haven’t been having these issues. But for the amount of trouble this game has been, it was never really worth it to me. Say what you will about Bethesda, they really dropped the ball on this one.
---
It's a normal working day from where I'm from. I haven't seen a word from community managers, F76 Twitter, anything...
---
I do feel bad for the prison rape but when you do something you know is illegal for monetary gain then you know prison is a very real possibility
---
I hope somebody troll your bank accounts.
---
You fail
---
Well, this is more like bethesda left the door unlocked and someone else came in and shit on their bed
---
Can people request FO1st refunds based on this?
---
I'm not a subscriber but sure would consider asking for a refund if I bought 12 months...
---
You would have to ask them.
---
no
---
I love your attitude. I'm gonna follow your example and go make Hard Lemonade out of this giant lemon.
---
A fast patch, you say? Makes me wonder what other bugs will be introduced in the patch, or will come back from the dead. lol
---
The hackers on PC are ruining the fun.
---
Bethesda should refund us all because of the hack.
---
Im fine without Wastelanders, for sure it will break the game anyway. 
---
Just think about people removing points and using them into Charisma, talking to NPCs, unlocking dialogues and then setting those points again. 
---
What's the point with that? Game used to die with lot of camps giving a lot of pressure into servers, translated into lag making mobs with hp regen sometimes, just imagine it with NPCs too.
---
This is in America no one is awake yet and they will make a announcement when they fix it probably
---
Yea this is what I meant by it all. I don’t know much about it I just know nobody has anything right now for Xbox, and PS4 is either extremely difficult or super expensive, maybe both.
---
Global thermonuclear war.
---
Im currently winning at both.
---
It CAN still be done, but only with 3 star max items. There would be a market for those if the entire PC platform wasn't screwed by the latest theft hack.
---
It wouldn’t surprise me to find out most of these hackers are trying to kill the game out of a sense of revenge against Bethesda.
---
Alternatives have been listed already in many topics lately:
---
- play on private world (your own or friend's if he allowed to)
---
- make yourself a brake from the game (we don't have much to do anyway...)
---
I don't know, the only bug that came from the patch that deleted 5 star weapons was that the Santatron collected way more presents. I mean they said they upped the chance to at least one gift an hour but I seem to be getting way more than that
---
FO76 should've never happened!
---
Dick Hacker either sounds like the villian in a 1980's nerd comedy or the name of a serial killer.
---
A shoutout for a safe place isn't a safe place. Sorry. Hackers heard you too.
---
Mark what u need so u know what to grab or take over workbenches with junk resources.
---
then those payed players will request refund
---
I think so. It only started when I started playing NW for the Xmas rewards. When I play later today, I'll try adventure mode first and see if it stops.
---
Not sure how there gna pull that off if all this is true unless they have backup player data somewhere
---
This made my morning. Kudos on your security system.
---
You're fine on console, it's a PC only problem.
---
No one is going to be able to sell anything on the PC platform because of the latest theft hack. These guys aren't dupers. These guys are trying to stick it to Bethesda for being so lax on security and community feedback for over a year now.
---
&gt;You know what's sad.. all the people in videos that support the hack. 
---
That, to me, speaks to a fundamental sickness in YouTube culture; the sense that if someone is on a different "side" than the YouTubers that you follow are, then you're a bad person and deserve to be hurt. These people think that innocent people who are just going about their lives deserve to have their happiness taken away from them because they're not on-board with the clickbait creators that these people are following. There's something about the way that people emotionally connect with YouTube personalities which seems to genuinely warp the way that they regard normal human interactions.
---
R.I.P Fallout 76. Can't say I will miss you.
---
They are not going to give 1st for free to every shoeless out there, dude.
---
Non-1st users are considered leeches, parasites, at this point. They are irrelevant for them.
---
As the post is pointing out.. this is abuse of the game and the people. Passed being a troll when they are stealing things.
---
I am not calling you a liar, but I am confused. Someone who said this happened to them also said they recovered pip boy by changing servers. Some other guys explained why but I didn't pay it attention. Either way it still blows donkey balls. Hopefully it doesn't permanently screw your toon.
---
I'm Netflixing NW because can't risk my items in adventure.
---
???
---
That is the most fucking dumbshit series of statements I've ever heard. Like this some "I'm 11 and quirky edgy xDD" kind of shit, vro, even as someone that jumped ship on this bugfest of a game once Pay2Win got introduced.
---
Its like looking at someone genuinely believe "it's not illegal if I never get found!", under some false guise that if they're having a good time there are no victims. 
---
Like, yea, FO76 is in a pretty shitty state for a game. That doesn't mean they are warranted to have their time investments destroyed *by forces outside bethesda*, and this isn't a warrant that *you* get to parade as if its just how life work. It's legitimately a slope that could lead to sayings like "your opinion sure is different, I think the death penalty would suffice!"
---
You see how that saying doesn't make any fucking sense? It's because its stupid. Your whole comment is stupid. Is this even real or is this bait? If this is bait it's legitimately too stupid to even be humorous, it's just weirdly petulant.
---
What is even a mod? -Todd
---
Yeah for one they have stolen in game items worth money two hacking is illegal no matter what three they have posted their crimes Bethesda or zenimax will take them to court and might even file criminal charges against them.
---
This is not the way.
---
Yep most businesses stay open, only closing on 25th and MAYBE 26th in Australia. Some companies however run skeleton staff for \~2 weeks or so while people have a break.
---
Salt and rotted meat with some non legendary weapons crafted at workbenches to get by with to farm presents.
---
Yeah, with private servers being secure and Bethesda trying to get people into the required Fallout 1st subscription I am sure they will rush into their office RIGHT NOW to push a fix over the holidays...
---
I know it can be frustrating to have to deal with hackers and trolls and haters like the people who are responsible for things like this, but if you let them get you down, you're just rewarding them for their cruelty and malice.
---
Hmm, you do have a point there. It'll be interesting to see how they try and tackle it. Maybe introduce a combination of perks to unlock a certain dialogue? Just going to have to wait and see. But I think before Wastelanders gets released, it is vital to sort out the current hacking problem in the game. Just winds me up that all these hackers are doing is preventing the rest of the players who enjoy the game to have to wait longer for all the new upcoming content.
---
Is still the victim...the ones abusing it are thee abusers..If the whole "goal" of the hackers is to make people turn against Beth ..they are in for a rude awakening.
---
Well, everybody that bought the game are parasites, welcome to the colony
---
This subreddit is literally a seething ball of Bethesda hatred. Deservedly so with the PC mess, but damn haha.
---
Same.
---
And once the hack is over, they will sell those items.
---
Just the character you're currently playing as, apparently. So keep your "main" character out of play until this gets patched.
---
Actually, this hack, according to people "in the know", is relatively easy to fix. And it was reported to BGS before it went public.
---
Lawsuits? You actually think people can take them to court for losing their gear?
---
Rewarding Bethesda for the existence of a hateful group of cruel trolls going around victimizing innocent people 'for the lulz?'
---
Well what if one of them is a person who gives stuff to people that he stole from the theives
---
How exactly is this a win?  Sounds more like you just want to rub this into pc players faces tbh
---
They don't need to steal them. The same people who made and use this hack are the same people who made and use the still functional hack that creates any 3 star legendary. They don't need to steal your possibly good stuff when they can make definitely amazing stuff without any effort.
---
Whats most alarming is there is no official response to this yet from Bethesda. They should be in Defcon 1 right now.
---
I'm not making much headway in the cesspool lol. All I am saying chill out for a few measly days being that's its Christmas. Not trying to argue anything other than that. I'm not condoning the games state at all, but some of you arent getting that. So have at it I guess.
---
I just can't wait for Brotherhood return, if not, I'll play right now to give up my stuff! \^\^
---
wouldn't it be more thematic to have black sheepsquatch as krampus
---
Hopefully they’re not nitpicking who they steal from. 
---
I could see them letting low level characters go, because they figure they’re scouts for the high level guys.
---
That's awful, especially happening in the holidays. Tbh for me hackers on PC is one of the reasons why i personally tend to prefer console gaming.
---
i have the ps4 copy, and have neither the time nor the inclination to delve into this ,to make any informed, anything about how this is done or how to prevent it. I would need acsess to the, actual source code, which Im not going to get in a month of sundays. I know what it looks like tho, lazy high level programming in something like c++, with no forsight into 'what if'. I have no idea what the programers were 'told' to do.
---
I go back to the days of machine code and , maybe 60k to play with. one had to know what your doing. error trapping and handling, is a vital part of any routine whether in a game or anything else. I can however, picture, some poor bgs employee, with his head in his hands, crying. "they did WHAT,   please make it stop.....PLEASE make it stop. "
---
Can you explain why this sort of casual, pointless act of cruelty and sadism on the part of these hackers is so delightful to you?
---
There are inhibitors which prevent you from doing certain things. They KNOW it is wrong, and find it pleasuring. It is no different from most of what happens daily around the world. When they can do something you can't, and you are totally under their control (they can steal your bloodied fixer and you can't defend yourself from it) they feel powerful. They are in control.
---
I’m saying for those who don’t want to put it down, but don’t have access to private worlds. Not everyone wants to pay for a game, then also pay monthly/annually for said game.
---
you could also just play nuclear winter but I feel people would use the steal items hack combined with preexisting hacks just to be dicks
---
I could run around butt naked scaring people. 😈
---
With everything going in right now, this is much needed merriment.
---
They only got my orginal purchase money. I played since BETA. a FULL year this game had my attention .. that is so hard to pull off, I can't even tell ya. I don't claim that Beth cares about the players more than the pocket book.. it's a fucking company not your grandma. They still the ones being attacked .. I blame the attackers, FUCKING DUH.
---
I meant more from the posts about new updates bringing back old bugs. I can’t remember specifics, but there was a big one from the BETA that came back a couple updates ago.
---
I love fallout franchise and I enjoy a lot F76 but common sense say otherwise. I also want the end of the game because Bethesda/Zenimax deserve the money backlash.
---
Anyone can sue for anything, unfortunately. I’m not saying they’d win, but what’s to stop them from trying?
---
how is grinding for years worth of work in a dead, bugged game being an idiot
---
 Some of us decided to keep supporting the proyect (paying), some just did quit, and some decided to stay, beeing leeches.
---
 I feel bad for those poor unsupported kids (or under-average adults) who love the game and stay in the game, but in second class, because they can't afford 1st.
---
It must suck to be a second class citizen in a two clases world.
---
Oh yeah almost every update reintroduces a previous bug, was mostly just joking about the patch having a positive bug
---
Maybe, just maybe, that they are actually making most of their money on the microtransactions in the game, and if people dont play they dont buy atoms or fallout 1st ?
---
shit is like that southpark episode where that dude is murdering people on WoW. cant believe this is happening lol.
---
Pretty much bang in there...
---
Nuclear winter on PC is full of hackers so I don't see that as a viable alternative.
---
Besides, I assume(by looking at the average size of a NW match) most people who play FO76 aren't into PvP/NW.
---
Bethesda Support XDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
But you must understand that if you'll join public server you can loose all your inventory - for me it's unacceptable risk. If I can't join private server and won't make myself a break from the game there is no other option (I don't count NW, since I never played this mode and never will). Making screens of items I'll loose (it's sooner or later if join public server) is a waste of time, not alternative.
---
you're a foodbuild dude, the fuck are you talking about, nothing will be done
---
Well, time to farm nuclear winter...
---
I don't get all the comments about they sold a broken game and blah, blah ,blah. For it to be so broke, there are a lot of people who are enjoying it. It's also ridiculous for someone to steal what other players have probably worked hard to get simply because you wanna prove a point. Honestly it seems to me that there are people who have no life, so they wanna try and tell everyone else what they should or shouldn't do with there free time and money. When in reality if you don't like the game anymore or never have then stop playing it and move on to something else to gripe about. And leave the people who are enjoying it alone. Seems pretty cut and dry to me.
---
Hmm.. so keep supporting a proyect that was sold as a full game?
---
How this private shit will help me get my gear back?(
---
That's great. I thought they nerfed those traps.
---
exactly what i was thinking
---
AY LMAO mrrmprrpgprpgrggmrgmghrghrjhrufhfhf sale in middle of THE GREAT HACK. Can't laugh harder.
---
It's a PC only problem.
---
Mhmm. Diablo 3 is a good example of folks doing it.
---
If you’re on PS4 come visit. Lots of cheap legendaries in my vendor.  PSN is dixiemomma1577
---
And I’m no hero. I just believe in the golden rule.
---
It happend to me today too. Didn't know About that it's possible... until all the equipped Things are gone… even elves costume :-/   
---
Start to avoiding public servers for now.   
---
It's going to get out of Control.
---
Single player games are for PVE players though. As a hardcore PVP player, PVE bots are considered for noobs and are far too easy to kill. As it is I can nearly solo the imposter Sheepsquach, and that's the only tough boss. For veteran players, PVE is a joke insult to each other. Please keep this in mind when dedicating a whole game to the less experienced
---
If people is willing to pay real money for fake objects... Wait, we have the Atom Shop. It's the same thing.
---
Well I have a plan for the lights. I could sell them to you later when this is fixed.
---
Yes, I just did this. Stashed everything off any value and outfitted my character in vanilla armour and weapons. I just played for a bit an hour with max level guns and deep pocketed armour (+ backpack) the game is fine.
---
It's OK guys.  Just subscribe to Fallout 1st and play on a private server. 
---
/s
---
My eyes needed to see that. Thanks for the chuckle!
---
Well, I dont think Lady hruffrelpruff de ides the dates. :/
---
I mean I have my low frames rubbed in my face every second day so I like to do it back when I can tbh.
---
Not wrong. I gotta ask, what does it take Bethesda to care about their fanbase? 🤔
---
I got a TSE Dragon from a vendor. He was asking 5k and about got him to drop to 2k...it happens.
---
Yeet yourself off a cliff, thanks.
---
Weird... I've never had this happen before.  Maybe try to add a mod or remove a mod from the armor and maybe that will update it?
---
The Todd-Mod?
---
What if they come from the hack wave? \**DRAMA INTENSIFIES\**
---
Original wow had quite an extensive macro feature set.  That actually allowed for people to program quite powerful bots with the help of macro commands that could do things like farming.  Those aren't hacks as much as they are people simply building into the games features, or better yet, exploits.  
---
Even stuff like speed hacks (which in many cases could take advantage of core clock manipulation) would show you faster on your screen but the game would never register it.  
---
Hacks that could "steal your inventory" quite simply didn't exist.  This link you've provided doesn't somehow counter my statement.  Most of those hacks listed are both detectable by blizzard or no longer work, and haven't for ages.  
---
The changes to WoW's macro code set is one of the reasons why decursive broke after vanilla and has never worked the same way since.
---
 Pac-Man days, when you bought a game and that was all, are gone.
---
 Game companies these days base their business in "new" things like microtransactions, monthly subscriptions, online services, PTW tactics… 
---
 Take it or leave it. No one forces us to spend our money and free time in games.
---
But if they didn't use an outdated engine they might of missed out on the live service bandwagon. But dang I miss mods I used on Fallout 4.
---
I hate that I feel this way but I feel like somehow Bethesda will mention private servers and fallout 76 as a stop gap
---
Glad to see you back on form, Anthony. Posting twenty times a day about how terrible game is, and trying to get others to boycott it while you keep on playing it.
---
Don't ever change, baby.
---
That's a new feature? It works? -Todd-Mod
---
its been around for months thank erectban for getting bethesda off their lazy ass
---
Yep, just like I posted in all the PC groups I belong to on Facebook and moderate, I would stay off PC unless you're in a private world. Also after talking to someone who knows a whole bunch of shady people oh, apparently this isn't the worst of it coming whatever that's supposed to mean no. I don't know why these people have such a vendetta against Fallout 76
---
Besides people losing money. And some people DO enjoy the game.
---
I'm not expert on the server infrastructure and I doubt anyone here is either, my point being the issue is happening on PC. Not PS4 or Xbox. Sounds like you have a toxic community problem on PC. It is possible Bethesda could have plugged whatever exploit was used, who knows, maybe they did or wasn't aware of it? The point is the victims are other PC players using PC exploiting methods. Sounds like Bethesda should just say forget PC personally since all you people is complain about modding and hacking and exploits. You don't have people on PS4 and Xbox loading in NPCs and other objects do you? Getting mad at a company because your community is TRYING to break the game? Give me a break.
---
On the flip side, Bethesda's able to learn from 15 years of MMO's fighting hacks on online games.
---
I can ask for more info, but I don't have a link. It's coming from within a private group that has eyes on the hacker who is releasing these hacks. Providing anything too specific might be enough to cut off the source of info.
---
The first two of the five points in the original article were true.  The others were bullshit just tacked on to beef it up.
---
Neither I do. So I won't get closer of Mrhgjismehsl. Robbers could be waiting (I would if I was a hacker, just wait next to Mrshskfbhsk)
---
&gt; If it allows people to do it, then it is ok. 
---
Being able to do something doesn't equal being allowed to do it. I could literally kill a man in the next 15 minutes but that doesn't mean I'm allowed to do it and even less that it is ok to do so. That's why we have common sense and rules, which responsible people follow.
---
And what happens when the anticheat glitches out like everything else Bethesda puts into this game and wipes non-cheater's PCs?
---
I dont get how people can hate it so much, but keep playing it.
---
Learn laws... there is laws when there is conflicts between states 🤦🏻‍♂️
---
Of course not.  This will run well through Christmas if not longer.  Mark my words.
---
Love the amount of butt-hurt soyboys in the comment lmao.
---
The idiot who made the hack posted a video of him and his friends using it.
---
More proof those of the people who heard 16x the detail were obviously mistaken especially when 16x the details still can't be found.
---
It will not. Game saves upon exiting a server
---
I can relate somewhat. When building a persistent world for NWN, which was not intended really for such use, about 80-90% of my time was spent tracking down and stamping out exploits. New content was easy to roll out. Exploit crushing the new content however would take weeks on a test server. That was some cheap basic coding there, NWscript, and there were still ways to stop abuse, and prevent it from happening again. That seems like ages ago.
---
IDK whats going on at beth. Doesn't look good from this perspective tho.
---
Because its funny af to see people being absolutely triggered like u
---
We are not a gang of hackers you fool
---
Dude quit crying. Either grind for the plan, trade for it, pay for it, or don’t. Don’t get mad because someone has it priced more than you feel it’s valued or buys it from you and up sells it. Does it suck? Yes. But when you get on and whine it just makes you look bad.
---
When it comes to plans and playing you don’t “genuinely” need them. They just make the game either a smidge more fun or easier. 
---
I’m sorry I’m just tired of people crying because “they can’t get the item they want, or afford the price it’s listed, or the trade system is unfair for their particular situation”.
---
100 percent. Without a real anti cheat this game is done
---
If they don't fix this soon that's going to happen anyway.
---
Reading this I feel like I need to adjust pricing... I have both plasma grenade and santa crash priced at 500, and feel guilty about that!
---
Thinking about pulling all rare plans I've gotten from the 300+ gifts I've opened and let the market settle until after the new year.
---
Don't worry, the devs will still be with their family's on Christmas.  Bethesda won't fix this until well after the holidays.
---
Whatever turns you on haha
---
Like having to pay for McAfee to keep your computer save from 90s viruses?
---
What? A positive bug? From Bethesda? 
---
Now you’re just confusing me. Ha
---
Why is that funny to you? Why do you take pleasure in the unhappiness of people who have done you no wrong?
---
Still watch out using a hack to steal peoples inventory in game might come back to bite you in the ass who knows i am not a lawyer but well corporate lawyers love gangs if hackers like you
---
Sadly i can totally see them banning YOU (the victim) for duping with this method
---
I like players that don't take handouts 👍
---
Anyone has the link for the Appalachian trading co discord
---
Hopefully they extend that event as well. Purveyoe mkjkkjjkkrrchackalacka needs her scrip.
---
Lets just hope they don’t hack the Kovac-Muldoon platform too.
---
We have MODUS working against them as we speak.
---
Bruh this game is a year old, they deserve to be roasted for failing this hard
---
I dont even play fo76 but this alone makes me want to buy it, to see the rages in a hilariously bad video game.
---
Yup, did happen to people [https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=wow+lost+all+gear](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-d&amp;q=wow+lost+all+gear) for various reasons.   
---
The more "obvious" examples usually do get found easily and banned / patched in some days/weeks
---
sure they will apply... 
---
hackers from the start are still hacking 
---
the only players bethesda has banned are those guys who bullied another player calling him a homo
---
And just like any job, if there is an emergency there should be people on standby.
---
A lot of people are former players that stick around in the hopes that Bethesda sort their shit out and make the game worthy of the Fallout title they slapped on this badly made, bug riddled shitshow.
---
Upvote my friends we need to be heard.
---
Depends on how they plan to fix it, if they do. Put it this way, if they don’t add items back to people’s inventories, they’re going to lose most of their PC crowd after this. If they can’t be trusted to fix what they let break, they can’t be trusted at all (and that’s saying something, consisting just how much crap they’ve let happen.)
---
Someone should start a podcast called The Todd-Mod-Pod and only talk about bugs and exploits. A bug or exploit being a Todd-Mod.
---
The fact that the most downloaded mods for Bethesda games are the Unofficial patches is a big sign as well.
---
If you want those weights to respawn you have to go loot a few hundred items somewhere else to reset the loot respawn for them. They changed it to that so people couldn't create a character just to farm a fixed location for scrap constantly.
---
Dude I just said below I'm not condoning the games state. Reread please, I just said in summary, chill out a few days during the holiday.
---
Nobody of us is actually hacking, but keep thinking that you foodbuild. You just got raped a few times to much from ppl like us
---
The hackers can make any gear they want. They are not interested in any of your gear. They are just interested in doing damage and hurting Bethesda at this opportune time where they would be out of the office for the most part. The gear that's stolen is most likely destroyed or dumped so the person can steal more. They are sending a message to Bethesda.
---
&gt; These guys are trying to stick it to Bethesda
---
By fucking over the players.
---
You would probably die from an aneurism trying to figure out how some of the people who comment on here think. Personally I feel the same as you. If I don't like something I just simply stop doing it.
---
Pretty sure you are hacking if you are stealing players inventories.
---
I don't want to be a bad prophet, but I'm sure people won't get back exactly what they've lost. They'll probably patch this exploit but they'll at best compensate victims with some atoms or (like was last time) with some mats bundles. We'll see...
---
That also happens commonly when your client crashes or you alt-f4 out and then try to sign back in.
---
I love it!
---
I picked the perfect time to get back into the game it seems.
---
We don't do that here. Proof it or leave.
---
Simple.  They won't.  They'll claim that there is no way to prove who lost stuff and how much/what specifically they lost.   They might do something like they did with the big scrappable items when people lost their entire junk stash when FO1st launched, but your legendary weapons/armor, power armor, event exclusive items and rare aid items will be gone.
---
A win? Since when haven't we won with multiplayer lol. PC games are flying hack fests.
---
Not sure what point you're trying to make here.   The OP sold rare plans for 2k, and the guy who bought them turned right around and put the same plans up for sale at 10K apiece.  Greed is eternal.
---
Honestly, everyone throwing out MMO-focused engines are forgetting a single important point: Fallout 76 isn't an MMO. It's just a multiplayer Fallout game with a few multiplayer-specific features and activities added on.
---
Dude, are you seriously claiming that YouTubers made those hacks in order to make videos about them and stir up drama?
---
Are you that delusional and line in some fantasy where Fallout 76 is actually bug free and its developers don't screw players over and over again?
---
Probably February
---
This is how Bethesda forces people to use fallout 1st. It's all an elaborate con.
---
&gt; although it could be better for us if Bethesda touches hard bottom 
---
Sad but true. :(
---
And that's why you don't buy in game items off eBay
---
We had that but on a single video, someones talking about a lot of bugs and exploit from F76
---
It's a fine idea, but...  Not sure what good this meeting will accomplish other than paint a target on people's backs.  The smart thing to do in my eyes in hunker down and weather the shitstorm.
---
That would require Bethesda to keep backups of character data
---
Is this just an issue on PC , or is console impacted too?
---
&gt;Honestly it seems to me that there are people who have no life, so they wanna try and tell everyone else what they should or shouldn't do with there free time and money. 
---
&gt;When in reality if you don't like the game anymore or never have then stop playing it and move on to something else to gripe about.
---
Oh, the irony.
---
Yeah, it's that easy. The market is flooded with games. The options are practically endless.
---
Do they even have community reps?
---
They're just mentally ill friend. Mentally ill. There's no sugar coating it, trying to make excuses for it, or anything else. They're sick. They think it's hilarious, they have nothing better to do and they're desperately trying to find emotional balance in their lives. They don't see you as a person.
---
How about pc players start you own subreddit 90% of hate for this game comes from pc players
---
Anybody has the tools to track down the maker of the cheat who made it public?. I imagine he is not constatly surfing via vpn and using proxies. You track him down for me i do the rest to him and his family.
---
Thats what we plan to do, its a discord meeting its after the shit storm that we rebuild and help people. Contingency plan.
---
I lol so hard when people is so conformist with injustices. Sir, you are part of the problem.
---
And I can understand that completely. But it's been out for over a year now, either the people who are complaining are actually enjoying it or they have way more patience than I do.
---
They’re going on break over Christmas. They won’t be able to patch it until the new year probably.
---
Man I gotta watch out, who knows what kind of goodies I could have equipped to my level 22 character. I hope your friend recovers!
---
That would be because you're mentally ill. You take pleasure in someone else's anxiety. Only sick people do that.
---
The fact there are million of posts saying hsckers have stolen people's inventories the post we are on is even about the hacking
---
Nuclear Winter is safe from the gear stealing hack, however there are the ocassional 1 or 2 hackers per day.
---
AFK farm.
---
No.  It wouldn't help.  The actual Mods built by the community and the Hack work off of two different methods.
---
Thanks to you for posting this, hopefully they can’t get to consoles otherwise it’s over from there. I don’t play on PC but like I’ve seen others say, don’t play the game at all or use a lower level character that doesn’t have much. (If I played on PC I’d just use a low level one just so I could get the last laugh. Because I’d purposely not have anything important on that character anyways)
---
Yeah, building a camp in nuclear winter is a lot of fun, with the lack of restrictions.
---
Thanks! Building into a train car is MUCH harder than it looks, fiddilly angles and Bethesda's ability to make an already weird building system even worse. But I guess it is too bad :)
---
Glad to actually have a conversation with someone instead of an argument.
---
I doubt Russia would extradite a citizen to Canada over this crime. Also, I doubt Canada would pay for the extradition for this crime. Even with murderers, it takes a substantial amount of politicking just to get it done over the course of several years.
---
Get cancer you fucking pedo
---
Nope. Tis the season
---
And I'm pretty sure the mole-lady-miner Marhdgaakpakehi wants those 950 scrips...
---
You could say that again.
---
Why do you need cloth? Gunpowder,
---
There one way to put an end to this.  Loot can only be shared between teammates with an hour timer.  
---
It will kill vendors, but will put and end to this inventory BS.
---
Have you been banned for telling Bethesda yet? :P
---
Yea, those people are the ones running around emptying peoples inventory, flying above the map killing everyone and destroying any semblance of fair play. As for the money, I bought it at launch at full price.... sucks to suck I guess.
---
Let me tell you it's no easy feat 😅 took half my weekend trying to learn the floating ceiling trick align the floors not to mention the traps...
---
Actually ran into a roll back glitch (does not benefit anyone 😒 tested several things 😬when life gives you lemons😂) involving those traps when lay down in a certain configuration and blueprinting they have trouble laying down (green to lay--lays down different set up/configuration) causing a server disconnect for just player respawn to before disconnect.
---
DAMN, TRUE! A new house in every game XD
---
I'm sure there are probably a few people around, but it'll be like the C-team or a bunch of interns.  No one that will be able to fix this.
---
I hope they get the cheaters but that would put Bethesda in a world of legal pain remotely wrecking someones operating system is kind of illegal
---
This doesnt proof that B. or our community stole anything
---
Yeah sure, you guys are making me want to buy the game very badly but i dont want to spend 60 dollars on  such a game. What’s the refund policy btw ?
---
Always with 200 frogs inside ! Lmao
---
Destiny and Borderlands series are both in good places if you just want to farm gear.
---
&gt;Dude, are you seriously claiming that YouTubers made those hacks in order to make videos about them and stir up drama?
---
No I am not, my r/conspiracy -dwelling friend! What I'm suggesting is that fans of these YouTubers did so in order to get the attention of the personalities which they follow and are fond of. But I thank you for asking for the clarification rather than simply assuming the worst of me. 
---
&gt;Are you that delusional and live in some fantasy
---
Whoops! Well, maybe I spoke too soon! 
---
&gt;where Fallout 76 is actually bug free and its developers don't screw players over and over again?
---
That's not really relevant to the topic that's being discussed here. We're talking about a group of sadistic hackers who are interfering with innocent peoples' enjoyment of a game they like.
---
Definitely march, they gotta make sure wastelanders is working properly haha
---
You'll have to have the digital version to run both. Set your secondary mule XB as your "Home" Xbox, and play on the main XB with your main, XB Live account.
---
Easy peasy.
---
Just someone whose mentally ill and desperately needs the high and attention of other people watching them cause harm to others. Surprising how many of these poor individuals there actually are.
---
That's almost $5 are you nuts!?
---
Can I ask you the same question again, and appeal to you to try to, like, engage with the actual subject of my inquiry? Why does it make you happy when other people are made to feel bad?
---
Can I start using that? Wankstain...classic.
---
It's a nice idea, I just wish bethesda cared half as much.
---
You picked a doozy of a time to come back, but once the dust settles, there is a Text Chat Mod available from Nexus Mods.  I highly recommend it.
---
I've got 2K cloth 😂
---
Strange, as I could have sworn I got mine from Bots on Parade earlier this year.
---
Oi I’m calling you on ur BS. You’re bluffing and you’re bad at it too. Hello, it’s me, the guy you’re talking about. Grushnak.
---
If you deadass wanna go then hit me up in my DM’s or on discord. Let’s do this, I’m calling you out.
---
That goes for anyone that thinks they got shit on me IRL. Hit me up, I’m down.
---
Jokes on them...I'm only level 5 so I don't have any items to steal.  
---
But it REALLY sucks that this is happening. Hopefully Bethesda responds and fixes this immediately. This could be the final nail in the coffin for a game that's lost a lot of support since launch.
---
Ive been playing for like 8 hours today and let me tell you that there is absolutely no risks. The hackers from NW are now probably annoying people in adventure mode instead...
---
If it gets to consoles than the game is dead. But mostly this did it.
---
76 has stumbled from one fuck up to another, although this is by far the worst.
---
You just made my day. This is what is going to happen in every single NW play. 
---
RENDER THIS! XDDDD
---
Hey u were just doing gods work
---
Totally out of the loop, what’s happened on pc servers?
---
I don’t think it’s fair to blame this entirely on Bethesda. They are quite shitty but I don’t think they are doing nothing about it
---
Never played fo76 just here for the lulz, bethesda 8 : customers 0
---
So get the hell out.  Fallout was never meant to be PVP in the first place.  We don't want your kind here.
---
Most of the content in the game can be played fine with non-legendary gear that is not too valuable, and is likely to still be used by many new characters created during the free weekend.
---
Nah, to do that you just put items in the other players inventory that corrupt their account and make it unusable. Much easier than relying on Beth to do it.
---
If you still play this game you deserve it lol
---
No need to extradite if Russia prosecutes (and I don't think we have extradition treaty with Russia anyway), And nothing stopping Beth from civil action in Russia. Plus having a warrant for arrest at the airport can lead to interesting situations, as that Huawei executive we have banged up for extradition to the US can attest. I doubt this dirtbag gets out his Mom's basement much, but if he travels we can wait.
---
Im not trying to hide anything..... if your trying to say you’re one of the guys hacking on pc, idk why your calling me out.....
---
Same. Glad im on ps4. Though watching this still makes me wanna uninstall. This games been out far to long and has had to much shit happen to it. After i lost  all my junk from the stadh box i was wondering how they raised the bar. And dam people able to take your whole inventory. Thats a pretty high bar.
---
It was rigged from the start baby!
---
maybe thats just the issue - 80-90% of your time, and weeks of it. end result means a better product, but at a cost. like I said, I / we , have no insight as to to nitty gritty, but in what would appear to be in this case, should return an invalid signiture and trapped as a corrupt file. I would have immagined that this would have been the case from day one...lazy programming / security. iv'e seen some of the data mined files on these pages, and could not help thinking " why the f , can you even see that. " Looked like a windows reg file.
---
Hackers can steal people's entire inventory
---
They were doing great since now with that no content part
---
And it's spreading pretty quickly from what I've seen
---
Thats finally a good use of those traps.
---
Huh this game looks awesome, might pick it up on sale!
---
Hackers can steal your inventory
---
just check the top ten posts
---
Bethesda staff are away on Christmas break so whoever has come back to work probably need permission from higher up's to close the server and could be hard to reach them this time of year.
---
The scum bag who created this hack knew this and waited for the right moment to release it.
---
Farm the event in Morgantown airport the supply crate has 100 old world money each time zits called "Evebt Course" I think?
---
No, and if they did that nobody would play anyway. I only play on PC so I can use mods. Not hacks, just mods for perk card presets and inventory sorting to make the game less tedious. I doubt many would want to go back to playing without that stuff.
---
Set one to home Xbox so you can share the games between profiles.
---
That’s how I kept multiple profiles filled with 125k-150k caps and junk
---
I used to play daily, now I'm down to about 2 or 3 hours a week, which I generally don't enjoy but I do get catch up with friends that still play, which is the part I do enjoy. I don't have a lot of good to say about 76, but i still stick around hoping it will bounce back  and up until recently I thought they were at least facing the right direction but it looks like this game is never going to be the stable, fun, living game fallout experience it was sold as.
---
Thanks for that idea, I hadn’t tried that! Unfortunately, it still didn’t fix my problem.
---
A hack went public last night that allows someone to remove all equipped and unequipped items from another player. Most the hot posts on this subreddit are people losing their gear and the Bethesda forums are blowing up even more so.
---
Ummmm they dont? Sucks to be u but not bethesdas fault
---
I fucking hate that people like this exist.
---
No emotion towards others whatsoever. This is the literal definition of a psychopath.
---
just so you know for the past hour I have been tweaking my character to run with all vanilla gear. I swapped from laser gat to .50 cal I wont even give pvpers a target to try for from this point forth ( they are a primary customer of dupers hackers and ebay sellers. ) with laser gat you need fusion cores. for those you need to take a power plant which leaves small chance of being killed in public server if you arent carefull. with .50 I dont ever need to take a shop again. 
---
since I am abandoning legendaries I have adopted the BOS faction and some of their ways. I have dropped and destroyed all of my legendary weaps and the ones I loot get dropped and hidden away in some bushes or a ditch. not even going to sell or buy them any more, if I sell them cheaply there's a chance an ebayer will buy it in game and just resell. I am just one person but this one person will not be selling cheap legendary by the dozens any more. 
---
I solo launched a nuke and we took down a queen. damage output is  a little less with the .50 than my ultracite laser gat and I used more stims but the overall damage was pretty good. we took her down fairly fast and almost all of us were using vanilla guns. This tells me that the game is very playable without god guns. 
---
for now I am discontinuing sales on vendors to reduce my visibility. I am abandoning the role of quantom force.  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)  and taking up the role of paladin. 
---
I dismantled the air ship in favor for an easily moved base while I search for a new more permanent home. sad to see it go but it no longer suits my needs. 
---
the adjustment is not quite over still some kinks to work out but overall I had a blast meeting these new parameters in my playstyle and working out how to continue. 
---
this new role as a BOS running around destroying legendaries as I loot them suits me . 
---
next up is to start collecting and painting T-60 peices for repainting with the BOS logo. 
---
I need to work on a more stable and lucrative supply of .50 ammo. I make enough for sustainment with current in game knowledge however there has to be more I can learn and I am looking forward to finding it. 
---
this was a punch in the gut initially. but in the long run this new playstyle is a good change of pace. if I do get robbed again screenshot will be ready to go and I will have a chance to cost the hackers an account at the low price of basic vanilla gear I can easily replace. 
---
in the long run I am good. once I get all the kinks worked out I will post a new thread and IMGUR with my new role. 
---
so take cheer I am happy again :) no more worries mate.
---
How do you figure? If I don't know you you aren't getting on.
---
I’ve been very loyal to 76 since I started playing. Constantly defending it and spending time and money on it...
---
I do absolutely love it when it’s “working” but this is the end of it for me until this is fixed. I won’t even play on my server and I’ll be canceling my subscription until it’s fixed. 
---
I was having so much fun with this holiday event too. Didn’t get to play at all last week due to 12 hour work days only to finally reach the weekend and the games not playable.
---
Victim of this; Yes it's true. We had a zerg fighting the scorch queen and all of us lost our shit.
---
FREE FALLOUT 1ST for all pc players is need to hang low until fixed
---
But once again, they're are bigger fish to fry. Why do you think those Indian phone scam companies and Nigerian scammers are able to get away with it? Their impact is much greater monetarily but you never see any action done. I hate to break it to you, not every crime is prosecuted.
---
Thats why we as a community need to come together more then ever my friend.
---
Maybe that is exactly the issue. It sure looks that way from this perspective.
---
Conformists.
---
Hackers can steal all your inventory even without trading, only need to be on the same server, they can also insta kill everything and everybody on the server, spawn any items and assets, have god mode..... the list goes on.
---
Back before mumbles crawled out of her hole, friends and i were hypothesized that you would bring her crafted gear and spend scrip to roll 1-3 stars on the piece. If you got something you didn’t like you would be able to spend additional scrip to reroll the primary, secondary or tertiary star. Like to reroll a 3rd perk on a gun would take a 3 star weapon to reroll.
---
Ha that's cool thanks
---
Why would you ever buy repair kits when you can repair at a workbench for free??
---
I'm not asking for **ALL** the benefits that Fallout 1st provide, I just want to be able to stay on private server while Bethesda will be working on a fix. After release of the fix all non-subscribers would lose access to private worlds.
---
Just PC
---
I'm not angry. :) But then again I play on my private server with r/l friends and if there's a bug affecting the PC version we usually switch to the PS4 version and vice versa. #options
---
So let’s post how to do this so we can back until it’s fixed. A armed society is a polite society.....
---
It is, just look at all of the posts about hackers stealing inventory right now. That is one tiny drop in the bucket.
---
It's nice right?
---
Damn thanks for letting me know. Hopefully Bethesda can get off their ass and do something
---
This is actually the first Fallout game I have ever played. And honestly the only reason I got it was to check out all the places in the game, I live in West Virginia. I wanted to see how my home state looked in a video game. Lol, but I started playing and haven't stopped. I really enjoy the game and the people I've met.
---
&gt;but it'll be like the C-team or a bunch of interns
---
I highly doubt the main devs will be working on the game over the holidays.
---
Fuckin porch pirates. Shame they haven't figured out flight yet.....   xD
---
So you think the rarest items in the game should be sold cheap to you because you don't have the time to make caps?
---
Nah, Ill keep my prices where they are. 5000 for a good rolled weapon is reasonably priced.
---
 I just sold a santa crash the other night for 7500 caps.
---
 Also sold junkies explosive LMG for 12000 caps.
---
 I'm not lowering my prices for people who don't want to put the effort into the game when i have buyers who do.
---
Nor was Elder Scrolls, but PVP is 70% of that game too. Crying won't solve anything. PvP is with us for good now, tell Bethesda to remove assassin's gear and ruin everyone's builds then to suit only you, what if us PVPers don't want your kind?  It would be very selfish to say get out because we're now the majority in games
---
If you still want to play, go to the alt character and keep useless stuff with that character that way everyone wins. And you get the last laugh for having nothing important to steal in the first place.
---
Guess ill run around in my new low level alt and test the waters.
---
Yeah, I very rarely even try to argue anything with anyone.
---
Of course they do, but they aren't the ones who chose to be mega assholes for their own amusement.  Beth was just being incompetent, not malicious.  Fairly big difference to me.
---
Why were you even playing? You knew the risk of getting hacked was there when you logged in
---
Sorry, I was thinking about players that haven't lost their gear (yet) but are afraid to log in into adventure mode.
---
I hope you will get your gear back after Bethesda cleans all this mess.
---
I would much rather read an article about the results than watch a youtube video given the place YouTube has served in the history of 76.
---
Only in very specific situations though, like this one. The reason is very similar to why people go to the zoo or circus to amuse themselves, because they get to observe others behaviors resulting indirectly or directly from their doing. Like how murderers return to the scene of the crime.
---
Just gonna play my PS4 version for now. #options
---
99%??  Its possible on a lot of games. This is just getting attacked cause it's still the trendy game and company to hate. 
---
If there was another game this popular and this hated at same time, it would be targeted. See: Fortnite.  So many hacks and cheats in that game it's insane. Watch someone streaming and in less than 30 minutes they'll encounter a cheater. 
---
I've had versions of this happen to me in other games.  Rust someone took my inventory. Pubg someone made me drop everything.  Fortnite someone stole gun from my hands. 
---
It's not just possible here. It's possible almost everywhere.  Just depends on what the scum of the internet feel like targeting. 
---
And this is also why I'm done playing any multiplayer on PC.
---
Are we 100% on that? I recall stories of people losing them permanently in the past.
---
They don't have to take them down, they just need to make them all private. Taking them down would pretty much give the people doing this exactly what they want.
---
Let me save you from scrolling through the comments below. Play your console copy for now - or don't play at all. Simple as that.
---
No no... I think Bethesda ment to say *unfixable* not unhackable.
---
Everyone can hack, but no one can fix infinite machine gun sounds or get your gear back after a glitch.
---
People are getting paid by Beths competition? Shitty marketing tactics online are rampant so it wouldn't surprise me in the slightest. 
---
Also gonna add that online games can be accessed by anyone.. Real shitty groups out there want to get people turned against each other. Why wouldn't we accept they'd use a game? It's not unfathomable. It's actually cost effective with no real punishment, hits choice demographics.
---
I've been thinking about this a lot. Here's the best I can come up with. 
---
These people have spent a year or more building this community around hatred of a game that they don't play. There's got to be a thousand other games from 2018 which they also don't play but which they don't spare any thought to. I'm sure that many of these games are objectively worse than Fallout 76 on any given metric that these people might choose to judge the value of a game by. But none of them matter because there isn't the same community built around hating them that there is around Fallout 76. 
---
Hating this game that they've never played feels rewarding to them. They get supporting comments and upvotes and likes and whatnot. They get to watch new videos from superstars of the "Hating Fallout 76 community" like YongYea who makes a fortune in ad revenue by telling them what they want to hear about this game they don't play. 
---
There's a group identity which has formed around hating this specific 2018 game, and it's a group identity founded around hatred of an identifiable consumer product from a year and change ago. Those of us who DO like the game, who continue to enjoy it and just want to have a fun time with it, seem like we exist on the opposite side of an ideological divide from them. We don't. We don't care about them. We're not in a fight with them. But *THEY* feel like they're in a fight with *US.* 
---
Because we disagree with the stance which defines this group identity that gives them so much pleasure and validation, we're the enemy, and therefore we deserve to be hurt. It's valid and justified and ethical to hurt players of this game because in their eyes, we're "them," and they're "us." 
---
It's not just the game itself or even the company that produces it. It's that there's people out there who have realized how much ad revenue they can make by fostering this community, and all the people who get their little dopamine spikes by taking part in it. It's an exploitation of the human need to be a part of one group who hates and victimizes another.
---
Nope not that I can see. Absolutely shameful not informing people of this latest issue. There are players out there now with no idea what's going on.
---
No nothing, not even a word on Bethesda forums.
---
They know who's doing this!So why are they not suing their asses until they shit lawsuits???Track whoever is doing this and sue him!!!
---
probably leaked some exploits to the hackers instead and are now ashamed to even acknowledge the hack rofl
---
*" Why haven't the actual servers on PC been taken down"*
---
Everyone at BGS are away because of Christmas break.
---
Haha they’re on holiday. They don’t give a fuck about you all until they need to put more items in the atomic shop, or sell you more shitty subscription services.
---
Ha no
---
This hack is not motivated by money ( unless it was from a Bethesda competitor ). You don't need to steal from other players to gain and sell duped items. This hack is about shafting Bethesda and gloating. In fact, it hurts the ability to sell items. Fewer and fewer people are going to buy items ( cash or otherwise ) the more likely their product will simply be randomly stolen from them. If you want to maximize profit, then you want the game to be very popular in order to increase demand.
---
This is horrible. I feel especially bad for those who don’t know and can’t protect themselves. 
---
Chances are no ones going to get back what they lose either
---
It is relevant if the code is so broken that such hacks can be released in the first place.
---
About YouTubers - I can understand that some just style attention and views - but at the same time: it is good that such blunders are being reported. It creates pressure on the company to do something about it.
---
Depends where crime happened. They can simply get reports of it happening to U.S. players where Bethesda is based and build the case here.
---
True, but does Bethesda have the server space on AWS to basically make the same amount of Private World's. How does it even work, does the amount of  private servers available fluctuate based on the demand?
---
Man that’s kind of the point. If you don’t have the plan it’s probably rare. If it’s rare it’s gonna cost money. Be happy you made 3600 off those plans. Next time price them at 5k each.
---
The same hackers have bragged about being able to get into the private servers, the safest way to ride this out and still play the game is to make a new character to play for a little while so you don't run the risk of loosing anything important!
---
So you’re saying april
---
Lmao dont forget you can also put tonns of juke boxs and mounted mothman. You should send or post screenshots of the abominations you produce !
---
When a company that big just dont do a sht about this not even on twitter.. It gives a lot of how much they care about their own playerbase.
---
Maybe a server rollback for everything on PC? It’s honestly the only way I can imagine it, way easier than doing it player by player
---
Lol at the people saying this hasn't been mentioned or fixed because bethesda staff are on holiday. IT support works 24/7.
---
I know it’s the holidays but surely someone is around to at LEAST put out a warning!!
---
&gt; It wouldn’t surprise me to find out most of these hackers are trying to kill the game ~~out of a sense of revenge against Bethesda~~ *[ because they are trolls ]*.
---
Given that the lions share of content they've added has been skins I'd say we're easily pleased. Arguably the hackers have added more content, 1st npcs in appalachia after all.
---
It is illegal, hackers have been in jail before.
---
So as a community leader you thought it was acceptable to troll another communities Christmas event earlier in the week ColonelSilva? - you sir are a clucking shambles 🤬
---
They don't deserve a break with the mess they've made
---
Has any of this duping and hacking made its way onto Xbox ?  Was planning some holiday playtime, but if the game is that compromised, what’s the use ?
---
Shit, wouldn’t surprise me right now...who knows wtf is going on out there
---
Wow. Just wow. Ur still defending BGS when there’s already been at least 2 posts of players losing items. You do you, bro. And I’ll stay smart and safe with my gear and time. No reason to support a game that can’t protect its player base
---
Unrealistic. There needs to be time for development and testing to ensure a thorough and clean deployment. May.
---
They block mods in NW but people are still using hacks in NW.
---
Not only would it not work it would likely chase away a fair bit of the PC playerbase who use normal mods.
---
It is not a file modification, but tampering with the Fallout76.exe process while it is running, using tools like Cheat Engine, or one written specifically for this purpose by hackers. The best solution would be better validation on the server side, so that clients cannot just request item transfers from other players' inventories as soon as they find out their IDs. As a band aid, some kind of Denuvo style strong anti-tamper system could be used on Fallout76.exe, currently, there are only some simple checks on other running processes that are easily circumvented. But again, the best anti-cheat is on the server.
---
Specifically, claim the munitions factory. You'll likely get attacked and if you don't, free ammo.
---
Life ending vests
---
Any business looking to generate revenue works 24/7.
---
And we all know how much Bethesda likes revenue.
---
Exactly. I’ve been so loyal to this game. 
---
So many are saying stick to private servers but I’m honestly just thinking of canceling my sub and not coming back till this whole issue is fixed. Why would I want to return to a game where this is a possibility? I much more prefer the public servers and if I can’t use them then there’s no point
---
I cant imagine losing my gear, but I just wanted to show another perspective and maybe give them some peace. I mean look at the downvotes bc I said let people enjoy christmas and step away a few days. I expect they will rollback or reimburse people, just as they did with the scrapbox lost stuff.
---
The guys doing the hack.
---
Just because you don't have proper security on your house doesn't change the morality of someone breaking in. 
---
Bethesda absolutely shares some of the blame for being far too lax on security, but the people doing this are still supreme assholes.
---
That's what I'm afraid of, tomorrow Atomic Shop will get an update with new items, but stealing hack will still remain in the game until everyone from BGS will come back from a holiday break...
---
/u/BethesdaGameStudios_ /u/Ladydevann /u/Valseek /u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
Come on guys, move all this stuff server side so the client-side work cannot keep being exploited, this is becoming a joke.  
---
Have a chat with your colleagues at ZOS - hacking and exploits were prevalent until they did this.  Surely you would have expected people to do this, so just move it all server side like a normal multiplayer game studio.  This is on you.
---
The PC support section on their forums is lighting up with people who lost everything.
---
Best I can do is Christmas 2021, take it or leave it
---
Give us a robotics perk that lets us tame robots
---
This really sucks.  I watched the Final Render video talking about this.  I've been trying to get my friend to play, and then this happens.  I hope they can fix this quick.
---
Of course that’s what he looks like.
---
So much for the pc master race 😂😂
---
Tomato potato.
---
You where trying to kill a level 25 how about you answer for that im not a troll I stayed because you all wanted to be toxic dont try and kill level 25s all you had to do is have manners and ask me to politely leave but no you fired on me like *trolls bud so sit down and close your mouth like a good degenerate*
---
And here we go again, people came back to this sub to farm karma...
---
This should be the top comment. I already have F1st so it only matters to me that pc players don’t become disillusioned by the game.
---
So far, all they're doing is getting on internet forums and suggesting that people temporarily subscribe until the issue is fixed.
---
If you’re a criminal yourself. If each victim spent 200 hours on their digital assets (some have way more hours in the game), that’s more than 100,000 hours of work stolen in minutes, in just one showcase. How many hours does he work every day? Less than 8 hours I assume? Then it takes decades for him to pay back the victims’ loss, for only the ones shown in the video. Who knows how much more he had stolen. Bethesda needs to go after criminals with full force.
---
I have no problem with issues like this being reported. What I have an issue with is a third-party hack like this being released to the public to be used in such an obviously cruel and unethical way.
---
Bummer.
---
😂😂😂 love it
---
I have to admit, this is quite funny. I stopped looking at this game seriously after the release pf NW. it is just one big joke and a giant middle finger to the community.
---
I don't know how things are where you work, but in a company office like this, there's never anyone actually in office during holidays like this, save the janitorial staff.  Everyone's gone on holiday.  Some senior people might have emergency contact numbers for massive fire/physical shutdown level of emergencies.  But right now, the only people actually at the consumer level of interface are probably minimum-wave customer service reps whose only ability to help is limited to entering the data into a Tier 2 helpdesk ticket.
---
Can’t believe they’d turn this into a money grab. At least offer to refund for like the first month once the issue is fixed or something
---
No: rewarding Bethesda for releasing a game so full of bugs and exploits with shit for cheat detection.
---
Yeah, you suggested they take a break from a game they supposedly hate to play anyway. And they downvote you. Imagine that. And I agree completely with your suggestion, but like I said before it's just to easy to do that. There would be nothing to gripe about if they tried your suggestion.
---
You son of a bitch. I’m in.
---
If they do, it will be in the form of Atom Shop exclusive emotes.
---
There's a mod available for more than a year.
---
I hope you find the help that you need.
---
Does it not seem more emotionally-healthy to extend empathy and compassion to the victims of deliberate cruelty than to jeer at them for having been made the victims of these hackers?
---
I hope this wouldnt be across the board. I finally got a good roll from the purveyor. I have a nice weapon. I cant go back.
---
And yeah I haven't had anything stolen either. And like you I couldn't imagine starting from scratch trying to find my armor set all over again.
---
Look, I know people like this game (though I couldn’t even begin to tell you why) but you guys have got to realize they don’t give two fucks about any of you. They literally want your money and that is IT. I’ve never seen a developer so incompetent that they can’t even put out a single patch fixing something that doesn’t break 82 more things at the same time. Honestly I follow this sub just to see the dumb shit they do on a weekly basis. But I gave up on this game months ago. It’s never going to get better. And Wastelanders ... oh man is that going to be a dumpster fire on an epic scale.
---
It isn't insane to want justice
---
Don't you guys have items?
---
If your on xbox 
---
I sell my cloth for 2 caps
---
Wait I know him. He is me 😂😂😂😂
---
I know a lot of places are like that. My office only gives Christmas Eve and day off and for others who don’t have vacation they have to remain in the office. 
---
I don’t want the employees to have to scramble for a fix right now because it is Christmas but at least put out some kind of statement on Twitter you know? Just a “we are aware, please be careful, the issue will be addressed”. It’ll take seconds to do
---
Such things will always be created, unfortunately, which is why any developer should do what is possible to protect their creations from it and have a working set of tools to solve the problem.
---
In case of 76, they should turn the damn servers off and fix this shit.
---
you play PC?
---
Yeah I don't know, but it's probably cheaper for them than permanently losing all these players.
---
Nothing to do. That's all for now, sadly.
---
I am not a leader or anything prior to this hack I did this though  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb) every day I would sell about 20 to 50 legendaries cheaply, even the really good ones. with legendaries being the root cause for people duping and hacking I have tweaked and adjusted my character to run well on vanilla gear. no longer will I buy or sell legendary weapons. 
---
I adjusted my build and solo launched a nuke. fairly hard the first try. easily done the second try. in both cases we killed the queen with a smaller group with mostly vanilla weapons. 
---
I beleive if we outright killed the legendary trade market we would be much better off as a community. I have no faith beth will be able to stop this. I do know the game was pretty fun for me today on vanilla, I also know with just a few adjustments to our characters we can actualy have more fun in endgame without being carried by our god roll weapons. 
---
as of this point I am destroying all legendaries I earn, screen shot button is ready If I get robbed again I will get a chance to link a photo of surrounding players and my recents bar before submitting my bug report. If I get robbed again I may get to have a hacker banned for the low cost of vanilla .50 cal and some vanilla unmodded power armor. dunno what the going rate for the game is right now but I have nothing on me I cant replace in 5 minutes. 
---
I dont expect anyone really to take up this approach. but it is something I would like you all to consider.
---
Enotionally-healthy is subjective, if you were a victim of a legit cruelty like identity theft or scam then i wouldnt even think of ridiculing you but alas, this is a shit game and a disaster like this is bounded to happen.
---
What about the people who want to hang out with people they've made friendships with in game? What about *their* holiday? Who gives a shit about them, though, right? Not you. Nope, just Todd and his merry group of elves.
---
Yeah, they said: "hey guys, why don't you subscribe to FU 1st and play on Private Servers in the meantime?"
---
Well, I have seen Mole Lady Miner Rats Supervisor around the Black Hole Miner Mumpher and could ask him how Lady Mirediresirehire is Planning to proceed.
---
I'll keep you updated.
---
They should work on offline servers that allow us to host our own servers. This is what I thought Fallout 1st will be. Sadly, it turned out to be just another cash grab before everything goes to shit.
---
PC? https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eeggdl/warning_to_all_pc_players_about_a_new_hack_that/
---
Someone choose the perfect time to swipe your gear.
---
Nope.  They chose to issue an always online game so they should be dealing with this. Their inner workings are not something one should even have to care about.
---
Ever met anyone that does IT support? They are frequently on call 24/7. Even if the multi billion dollar bethesda doesn't have any support the least they can do is bash out a tweet to warn people.
---
Wow I thought that by now Bethesda would have figure out their stuff by now. But nope I was wrong.
---
Yup, could be argued that it falls under the computer misuse act in the UK, the wording is insanely broad for a reason.
---
Preach! So what if maybe fighting the queen drops me to 15fps I still got weapons to fight her with
---
Jokes apart, thats a good way to
---
Maybe if we didn’t have to pay $100 a year to make a private server this wouldn’t be as much of a problem
---
Ok I upvoted for the fallout first idea, but fuck the first part.
---
Unfortunately, you got hit by a hacker that jacked your inventory.  Been a common issue for a couple days now.
---
There's a hack going around stealing peoples items, check the front page.
---
Jokes on them, Bethesda got there first!
---
Yeah, shut down the servers until this is fixed. We all know it won't happen, everyone will just get 200 atoms as an apology
---
No, but do check out those sweet Xmas pics on their twitter!
---
You are late. We already had that.
---
No one was trying to kill you until it became clear that you were just being a dick and hanging around just to spite us, clipping through locked doors etc. But yeah your right, I'm the degenerate maybe when you have you little sit down with the rest of your "community leaders" on how to approach Bethesda - I'll send them the clip of you clipping through locked doors.
---
So they can deal with the hackers and YOU, but I doubt it.
---
Yea, I'd love that, but I think the issue here is a bottleneck of incoming communication to people who are all out on holiday.  Nobody with any actual authority seems to be aware of the issue.  It's just the low level reps trying to forward the information upwards.
---
Don't worry, they will.
---
just had a lvl 3 char called "Joe" take everything. pissed. i've continuously held out hope for fo76 but this might be it for me, i think. what's the point of playing if everything's just going to get taken anyway?
---
At this point I have no idea why I'm doing it...
---
I definitely don't have the acid to process into gunpowder
---
You should probably calm down before you give yourself an aneurysm. This is a shitty video game, not a civil rights violation.
---
I'd be angry too no doubt. What can you do though? Past experience shows they have reimbursed people, despite what some say. I myself was reimbursed before. So that said if it happened I'd just step away, cool off and wait for the fix. If it didnt happen then yeah I'd be on here with the rest of them, but let's see if it's made right first. I have a gaming pc as well and most multiplayer games I've played have been hacked, exploited etc. Its the nature of PC.
---
I was one of the guys thinking it was a hoax, I stand corrected.
---
I've looked at the source code, and it's easily modifyable to loot your stash as well.
---
Stay clear of adventure mode, it's not safe.
---
I guess it makes the game more realistic now with real raiders.
---
hmm,     side note - on replys which deserve nethier up or down votes - perhaps the serial downvoters, could perhaps.........contribute ?
---
Proof?
---
This whole video looks beyond fake and staged
---
It’s a theory, but i’d say that it even the most greedy money grabbing director isn’t going to be that stupid....
---
Most will just quit because of the risk!
---
Seems odd that this is this guys only post or comment ever with this account......
---
They are already paid with the honor of losing things in a post apocalyptic unfair war
---
Man have I got a long list of very inappropriate things to say about them right now
---
Cause that’s what the users want!
---
Ok tin foil hat time: dupers are a few Bethesda employees that's why they haven't been after the dupers. Thousands are being made from buying legendary gear, if you can't sell it on the atomic shop then why not sell it via "black market"...
---
At no point did I say I was a raider, you did. You asked a simple question I gave the obvious answer. A level 39 is easier to kill then someone in their hundreds. As far as being Raider Nation goes, the Raider Nation existed before video games were ever thought of, and I've been a member of Raider Nation since long before the Fallout franchise was ever invented. If you don't know what the Raider Nation is I'm guessing you're not American?
---
lol no my friend that cost them many customers at minimum my wife will probably never play again. thats 50% of this households subscribers there's just no way beth wants this.
---
Man that guy looks like he eats paint chips every morning for breakfast and finger paints in his own shit.
---
You do realize using photo mode is and phasing the camera into your character is how you do that right and I recorded the whole thing even the part where yall stated shooting me after a used a work bench and started cussing at me your picking the wrong fight bud. Have a nice day and everyone you come across that knows some tips and tricks about the game isnt a hacker. Toxic people like you are what hurts this community.
---
It’s sounds like you are trying to justify the actions of these lonely ass scum bags. There is no reason for this. 
---
If their intent was truly to send a message I’m sure a better way could be found. One that doesn’t involve steal from the player base.
---
Good for you, now you can start playing a better game instead of this garbage.
---
We got you. Buy Fallout 1st!
---
How about eat shit
---
Okay, but again we come back to the topic of empathy. I want you to put yourself into the shoes of someone who genuinely enjoys this game. For whom it's a pleasant pastime that they look forward to and value. Please, put aside snide jokes and jabs here, I'm being serious. If you want, imagine it's some other game that you enjoy and value. 
---
Now, imagine being this person and suddenly having all of their possessions taken away from them and not even knowing why. Their day is ruined. Their ability to have fun and enjoy themselves has been taken away by the senseless act of cruelty by a total stranger. Imagine the sense of violation and sadness and hurt that you would feel, finding yourself in that position. 
---
Now, imagining yourself feeling this way, would you feel that being laughed-at and mocked is what you want? What would you, u/reznendez111, think of the sort of person who took delight in the hurt and pain you were suffering in that moment? 
---
Now, step back into your own shoes. Do you *want* to be the sort of person who deserves to be thought of that way?
---
maybe Bethesda will reenable the hack that lets you create your own gear for those that lost so yo ucan just recreate all your stuff?
---
Except private servers aren't safe either.
---
Bethesda’s incompetence and lack of respect for the community is what is criminal. You can’t get sued for hacking something you own. You can get sued if you profit from selling hacks though, but since the hack is free and incredibly easy to execute, I doubt something will come out of this. Don’t get me wrong, I am against hacking in online games but at the same time it is Bethesda’s fault for not securing their product and customers.
---
No. Relax. This is what the attacking hackers want. This is literally an organized propaganda anti-Bethesda movement. Relax and let Bethesda fix it. Dont spread hate like this, you're feeding right into what the hackers want.
---
Yes shutdown the pc side, but the consoles are not affected as far as anyone has proved...
---
I'm on console and going to cancel my 1st subscription if Bethesda don't do something soon even though this hack don't affect me it's not right for a company to do nothing when people have put 1,000's of hours into this game, spent money and lost it all.
---
Some friends in my circle who still play 76 often think that Beth is aware of this hack on Pc, and they are not fixing it because there has been an increase in Fallout 1st purchases for the Private server safety. 
---
The people still playing aren’t going to stop because of this hack if they stuck around through all the other issues, they’re more likely to purchase the ability to play safely and keep their items.
---
Bethesda Headquarters:
---
"Man this cash flow is crazy, people are paying stupid amounts of money to play singleplayer just like they did in our previous games without any additional charge, and they actually think it's a luxury after they already bought the game, would you imagine that?"
---
**phone rings**
---
"What's that? Our game is getting exploited and people can steal inventories because we cheaped out and hired like 3 developers to deal with our dogshit codebase to maximize our end profit? Uhhh, i got christmas in a few days just let them buy fallout 1st to not get all their hard earned work stolen in the span of 2 seconds by some neckbeard cheater, more cash for us anyways"
---
I don't understand you bethesda fanboys.
---
If a bank lost all your money to hackers, would you sue the bank for having poor security, or pray for the police to find the hackers, who by the time they are caught wouldn't have the money anymore anyways?
---
I don't enjoy dystopian or Western settings so I never enjoyed any FO games, but Mass effect/dragon age are my favourite universes. If this was a mass effect/DA MMO instead but with the same problems (horrible bugs, no real NPCs, easily exploited programming amongst a host of other problems), I still wouldn't have supported it. A shit game is a shit game, regardless of the IP.
---
But you guys still fervently support a company who couldn't be more obvious that they don't give a fuck about you or your enjoyment of the game, from day 1!(the canvas fiasco and broken promises made on e3). 
---
I don't understand. It's like you're putting fingers on your ears screaming "la la la", closing your eyes and breathing through your mouth so won't smell or see the pile of shit in front of you, or everyone else screaming at you stop walking toward it.
---
I think the game saves relatively often to be honest. Mainly cause whenever it has crashed on me I usually lose very little (I find GTA is much more likely to have me lose a lot if it crashes on me, same as red dead. 76 seems to be pretty good about saving often... or in this case unfortunately bad about saving often).
---
I too have opened close to 1000 gifts. I never got the grenade or tomahawk plans until I started transferring my gifts to my low level (5) mule. In the first round of about 20 gifts, I got 2 plasma grenade plans and 4 tomahawk plans! I had read somewhere that your chances for those plans increase at a lower level because some of the armor plans won’t drop for a low level.
---
I guess the hack was probably possible for some time bow. They only chose this time because they knew Bethesda will be unable to do anything about it.
---
I heard that the hackers turn players into "containers" which allows everything to be taken from them, could be wrong though
---
As a matter of fact, I have.  I've worked in the IT industry for several years.  And I can safely tell you that being on-call is not the same thing as being available or in-the-loop.  Save for the actual servers imploding, system-wide hardware failures on a massive scale, and customer's personal data being violated and put at risk, you're not going to get the big honchos back from vacation.  
---
Let's not even talk about the fact that their IT architects, admins, and coordinators are very likely people that were ignored from Day 1, when this system was set up.  No competent engineer or architect would have allowed the monstrosity that debuted on Launch Day to do so without protest.  In truth IT is like the circulatory system of a company, it's vital for running 24-7, but it doesn't not make any important decision making, particularly not the 24-7 support staff.

Don’t hold you breath. You will die first....
---
I got 1200 gunpowder im tryingto get rid of on xbox
---
There literaly dozens of threads here and on Beth forums with players stating it did indeed happen to them; even guys right from that video...
---
That is if you exit... if you force close a game, it didn't know it was about to close ;).
---
Hes not justifying. These are basement dwelling ass wipes just trying to ruin fun for other people.
---
It's real, lots of reports coming in of hackers emptying inventories, including things with atom skins.
---
I think this is good. I've hated Fallout 76 since a few days after the release and the people who keeps it on life support.
---
Everytime he steals something the screen "clips" like he's editing out people unequipping so they pop up as full nude when he reinitializes the camera. 
---
Fake.
---
You are absolutely right and i understand that but then,  in this particular context i cant help but being amused because you ignored the signs that lead to this moment at your own peril.
---
Right. So everything you read on the internet is true?
---
I like how people in the video comments were calling this guy a god and promoting it even more. I play console but this still sucks for PC and the people who play and actually enjoy the game.
---
We cant sue him, we don't own our characters or our data, Bethesda does. So technically, as far as the law sees it, he's stolen nothing from us.
---
Then perhaps they shouldn have released a product requiring it always be online if they couldn’t handle it.  They chose this.
---
The guys for doing this shit. It would be one thing if they did it to each other or something and showed it to Bethesda to let them know they need to fix it. But the fact that they are going around fucking with players just to grief them makes them the bigger assholes. Just cause you can do it doesn't excuse you from doing it. Kinda like how just cause some one left their door open doesn't mean you are any less responsible for going in and stealing their stuff.
---
"we all came out of the same vault "
---
Dude, I love this phrase. It's beautiful.
---
Didn't actually call you a hacker so not sure where you got from but you're right we should probably leave it there.
---
I'm toxic because I tried to enjoy an event that a lot of people went to a lot of time to put together, but because of one person (ahem you) acting the goat myself and others couldn't enjoy it.
---
But yeah you're right I'm toxic and hurting the community - some people just can't see the wood for the trees.
---
Edit - Ps, I didn't once shoot at you - maybe go check your recording though.
---
You genuinely believe a level 1 character can hold 5 inventories of maxed goodies??

I'm not justifying their decision, merely pointing out the practical reality of demanding immediate action is unlikely to be met until after the holidays.
---
I ended up getting companion mod where I could set their follow distance at further away. In decreased how often they would trap me behind a counter or something but sometimes it was still unavoidable indoors. I only really liked dogmeat and the Irish chick anyways. Piper and Preston were both annoying AF and I just wanted to shoot them in the face. I'm a completionist though so I would suffer through pipers irritating voice and Preston's self-righteous attitude just to complete their storylines.
---
You are a savage bro but I love it lmao
---
&gt; just thinking of canceling my sub
---
What?  You're subbed and not using a private server in the mean-time?  Not like it's costing you anything extra you aren't already paying for.
---
Getting a little star citizen in here
---
I just reported him, his also a notorious scammer on PC
---
I was just thinking the same thing.  Vely intelesting...
---
Its when I see this kinds of things that I understand why the Brotherhood of steel has been created lmao. I suggest posting that on r/fo76filthycasuals
---
Well, I'm a PS4 user so it doesn't impact me. I'm just disgusted by the moral rot of the people who are responsible for this, and disappointed by the people who are taking pleasure in it.
---
Events in the Mire have a chance.
---
I also think that using the photomode images for loading screens is one of the low-key best ideas/features in 76.
---
Bethesda is responsible for making this easy. But they are not responsible for people actually being assholes and using this loophole. Those  people were perfectly capaable of chosing not to be assholes and not do that to people. This is like blaming the victim because they were naive and made it easy for the person who did something bad to them while letting the person who did something bad off the hook for chosing to do bad stuff. WEll except for Bethesda really isn't a victim rather than the caretaker who was careless so they do deserve some blame for not doing a good job of caretaking (unlike some one who was a victim). But the biggest blame is still on the person who chose to do asshole things.
---
its not I am in there around the 3 minute mark on the big air ship.  [https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb](https://imgur.com/a/p9KKCTb)  I am garland td you can see me get stripped. my inventory was gutted. its not a fake its not a hoax. if you play PC avoid adventure for a bit or try and play with vanilla weaps. I adjusted my character a bit ( 380 something) and can easily solo the nuke launch and about 8 of us killed the queen using vanilla weapons, have the print screen ready if you get robbed take pics of all the players around you and also take a pic of the recents tab. report them to bethesda in your ticket. hopefully the hacker will be banned. as it is I am no longer quantum force commander I step down and now embrace the BOS faction. I will be destroying all legendaries I find in order to deny dupers, hackers and ebayers any chance of getting them. and it was pretty fun today figuring out how to do that too lol. the silo was tough the first time. much easier the second time. its actually more fun without god roll weapons.  I think we would be better off as a community if the entire legendary market was tanked. I am just one person so I doubt that will happen but I wont be selling 10 to 50 cheap legendaries daily any more.
---
I recall issues with other games.. Hacks and exploits. This game is getting this treatment because it cut out the modders. IMO
---
 Agreed, this is PC only crisis
---
Easier then scamming through trade I guess
---
Yeah, if I magically had the Stash space to contain every bit of gear on my character... 😋
---
...or just don't make an online game on outdated engine created for single player games so hacks like this won't be possible?
---
You are very lucky!
---
@7:25 a "victim" loses his invetory without the "hacker" even selecting him. 
---
This is so fake.
---
You are dumb and having read your dumb post now I'm more dumb.
---
The *public source code* for the hack pushes any items emptied off a player, who is treated as a container and thus allows removal of even atom shop items, to the individual using the hack's stash.
---
That's 800lbs + the hacker's max carry limit on that character.
---
&gt; Bethesda staff are away on Christmas break
---
Any company a TENTH the size of Bethesda will have a good 24/7 IT team riding heard over the servers.
---
For me the appeal is in “collect them all”.
---
Where do you see putting some one in the hospital? Just a wish to ban the person which is completely reasonable and should be done. People who abuse hacks like this to make the rest of the people playing the game miserable should not be allowed to play the game (because they already broke trust that they will "play nicely with others").
---
Wait for the jukebox town XD
---
Because one terrorist video isn't grounds to shut down the entire PC gaming communities servers.
---
Quite possibly may
---
Still click bait. Is it that hard to write a descriptive title? Lmao
---
I can say for a fact that they are, yes.
---
goto morgantown airport.  At the opposite end from the train station, look for the smoke plumes.  If present, then there's   
---
(one or more) cargo drops you should be able to loot.  The crates usually contain stimpaks, weapons, and some ammo, pre-war money.
---
If you walk past the gate and get an event marker, fire the flare.  It will start an event that sends lots of scorched and usually, at least one santa your way.  there are 5 waves in the event.  loot the dead bodies and enjoy the reward.
---
Head back to the train station, loot the hangars on the way.
---
At the train station, scrap what you need, sell the rest to the bot vendor.
---
Go inside the terminal, kill the scorched - usually 2 Sana scorched in there.  Again, loot everything.  Make sure you check the overseers chest for the small backpack plan.  Theres an armor bench in the room, so you should be able to craft it on the spot.  
---
Exit the building, go back to the train station and repeat the scrap sell.
---
Lol.. Not the guy that replied to you but i dont think he was confudlsed about the math behind repaying the stolen stuff (not that you'd work off the stolen stuff with hours the victim has used to get the stuff) but the fact u genuinelly sound like you think betheada actually has any authority over the guy other than maybe closing his acc.
---
And I carry about 380lbs of items everywhere I go. 
---
A level 1 can carry 120lbs. 
---
He empties full on 5 200+ players in a row without clipping out to a new area. 
---
Feels fake
---
Thanks
---
It’s absolutely criminal to steal digital assets, Bethesda needs to hit them with a huge fine and jail time for players’ loss. Then again since the criminals are in Russia probably little will be done.
---
Well said. 90% of negativity is coming from PC master race and existence of hackers attacking the PC version.  
---
I'm on Xbox and it runs overall very well. Even at release just dealt with occasional crashes. But no cheaters or hackers. 
---
It's sad how one toxic community (pc master race) has succeeded in spoiling reputation on a good game.
---

---
I also lost every item i had to this jerk on the video. 
---
 I lost:  
---
1\* Gatling plasma  
---
3\* Full scout armor  
---
Clothes, masks  
---
Upgraded Excavator Power Armor on highest lv 
---
Just randomly while i played event. I was not alone. There was many "naked" players around me, so i will tell ya. Until bethesda will not give me items i had, i wont play again. 
---
Friends its time where Bethesda really need to fix damn game. If so many players lost everything they had and has grind for it hundreds of hours like me, many will just quit. Its not a good business for Bethesda. They need to take it serious. So i am 50% sure we will get our items back. WE NEED TO MAKE A RIOT ABOUT IT. WE&gt;NEED&gt;OUR&gt;ITEMS&gt;BACK
---
My thought is *if* they are telling people this is what they should use right now, why should I? Feels like a money grab. 
---
Why should I have to make an additional payment purely to be safe? I already paid full price for the game and now the public servers are trashed. It’s one thing to pay cause I want to but because I *have* to?
---
I know I’m already paying it but I have no desire to continue if it’s going to be the only way for a while that I can play. 
---
I love running in to other players, selling and trading and things like that I don’t have anyone I play with to utilize private servers with to meet those same experiences. I have it purely to use when I want to say rebuild my camp or have something I just need to get done quickly. I’ve always preferred public servers and if those aren’t safe then I have no reason to play until they are. 
---
And if that’s the case why also pay the subscription charge?
---
Everywhere? Here, Facebook, YouTube..there are videos of it happening and many posts
---
The ones using the hack are assholes and Bethseda are idiots for allowing this to happen in the first place. Hackers are thieves who steal shit from a house whose door was open and Bethesda was the idiot who left the door open in first place especially in a bad neighborhood
---
Fallout 76, the gift that keeps on giving.
---
What kind of no life loser actually goes out of his way to be such a douche.  Trying to wreck another's person's attempt to have fun just because mom did not hug them enough when babies. 
---
Should be RL consequences for this crap.
---
Right. And I remember when scrap was lost to the box and 10 people I played with made false reports for free stuff. 
---
Hm
---
Why would they disappear?
---
I think people specifically find joy in hating this game because they feel betrayed by Bethesda. Nobody cares if some random guy is being an asshole, but if your best friend starts being an asshole you are more likely to have an opinion
---
Had to wall in mine yesterday from turds picking the lock on mine.
---
So true
---
You do realize paul apologized to me about that situation admitting you guys where in the wrong right so sit down and check your facts first before you go around on a witch hunt bud.
---
Idk, I like to hoard them. Ha.
---
I had over 300 legendaries before the purveyor, and it was like 2 weeks until the purveyor was put into the game.  I had no room on any charecters for them, so I sold almost all of them in Harper's Ferry.  I am back to around 300 now, with multiple charecters and 2 psn accounts.  They just sit there, some are good, most are "bad/scrip" as far as reddit standards go.  Yet, I keep them.  The market is so up and down, it's basically pointless to try to sell them.  The majority of people just want to buy and resell.  So they want cheap prices. 
---
I have a bunch of leve 1-5 stuff.  There is always time for a new charecter.  Ha.
---
That's not really how this works though, from what I understand.  This is code injection that occurs at runtime.   They don't go out and change a file, per se.  They listen for when a specific function or variable is being called and re-route it to their corrupted version.  That's what these hacking tools do - they listen to the game's memory usage and try to deduce what the game is trying to access, and then trick it into reading the wrong code.
---
Yeah. I was one of the people who lost all my stuff with the Fallout 1st scrap box problems. When compensations rolled out I didn't get any, which was weird. So, I contacted support. Their answer? Have you checked your stash box. Explained it was not in my stash box. They asked if I had tried relogging, this being almost a month after the original items were lost. I had relogged about thirty times since. When I then asked for a refund they closed the ticket. Very professional.
---
Both are assholes, it's not some mutually exclusive bullshit
---
Theft is theft regardless of it being in a game or not.
---
Alright chill out ok just saying many have a agenda towards this game to destroy it just wanted to see some proof directly
---
Nice! I am going to work on that now.
---
With the dll/script all you have to do is look at the person within your line of sight to obtain their "Pointer ID\*", then it transfers the inventory of that person to you.
---
Not a scandal.  It's an organized attack designed to spread hate  against Bethesda and ruin the game. And posts like this are exactly what the attackers want to see.
---
Just spend the money for a month instead of waiting on someone to give you something. Cancel the subscription. Get all the perks and when your PC servers no longer have shitheads exploiting it then you can go back to your normal gameplay. This sub is a bunch of crybabies and Bethesda doomsayers, yet they want more and more.
---
Haven't kept tack on the others, but two tomahawk and one grenade plan. If I had to guess, I opened 3-400 gifts or so. The drops have spread out evenly during the time.
---
Been a couple hours since I last checked, but everything went dark. Forums and twitter are silent
---
The witcher is really good! And hit at the perfect time.
---
I would definitely have to take a break, I carry way to much stuff on my character to begin with. I would lose probably 15 Bloodied weapons. Which would be a major set back. Plus my Unyielding armor. Lol
---
bonus: inert flux (raw flux that was not stabilized becomes inert) is an aid item, drinkable, and weights less than purified water.
---
I have weight reduction perks for aid items - purified water weights 0.35 per, inert flux weighs 0.2 per
---
How long does it take you guys to get Bethesda gives no or too little fucks about this game? If you enjoy it as a broken game that's okay. But man, what do you guys really expect after everything that's happened so far? If you really want Bethesda to make a better FO76. Go play something else until they do.
---
how about we tank the legendaries market and only play with vanilla weapons, trash all our god roll weapons and learn to play. if no one is buying ebayers hackers and dupers are just getting accounts banned for the sake of vanilla gear easily replaced. 
---
I am level 380 and I had to do some tweaking but I solo launched the nuke twice today first time was hard. second time was easy, we killed the queen as a server both times as well. almost everyone was using vanilla weapons. 
---
think about it. pvp imbalance is compounded by legendary effects. dupers and hackers are selling the crap on ebay. 
---
personally I dont have another game to go to. I look at them all and feel no urge to even try them. 76 is it for me. so I will keep playing and adjust my playstyle to npo longer support the legendary trade markets. I sure as shit dont think beth will be able to fix this easily or quickly. so brotherhood of steeel faction time for me. burn all that advanced tech and legendary weapon / armor crap.
---
I agree no contradiction intended.  My intent is to point out that their product requires constant maintenance so such practices are not appropriate.  They didn’t sell a self contained product.
---
Current protocol for lost weapons is immediate execution.  Well, immediate after you've finished the paperwork that is.
---
Literally nothing will come from this. They will probably patch it and we'll all forget and forgive them within a month. At this point who ever plays this is a cult member.
---
This is the real lesson.
---
there's a keurig machine with a ring doorbell taped to it in the lobby, that's about it until jan 2
---
Hacking is extremely illegal. Because of the massive paranoia of the 80s and 90s the laws are harder on hackers than murderers in some cases.
---
How is that infuriating?  I mean of course people are gonne talk shit about your game if you made a shit game.
---
Implying you were already lol.
---
Whatever, mate.
---
Not a terrible idea to give everyone private servers until it's resolved. Sorta like a quarentine.
---
That's probably because he is. If you look at his other posts he basically abdicates all responsibility from the hackers, and places it on Bethesda.
---
True.
---
Though let this be a lesson to the blowhards on this sub who were all "Yarr, it's a hoax, there be no proof, I'm not worried!"
---
Same to ya, chum.
---
Yeah the hackers most of all fall into this category
---
Harpers ferry and small one in Charleston.
---
THAT'S INTERDASTING!
---
They're giving you the opportunity to get more gear. You should be thankful.
---
Here’s a spreadsheet with some great data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p_2jw2yNRY8JIE7qTfUwXTgivFDcuy0Xltb4N8kct4o
---
ok
---
Tickets i have raised for other things are just being ignored. The others have all been closed as duplicates... Excellent customer service!
---
had a blast relearning to play my level 380 heavy guy today. vanilla ultracite armor vanilla .50 - went back to using stimpacks and radaway, and i kill scorch beasts almost as fast as I used to now. kinda shook things up for me and made it fun again.
---
You'd be surprised how popular this kind of thing is on YouTube, especially when it comes to 76, since these people actively cheer for its failure.
---
Or maybe you wouldn't.  Because people are horrible.
---
They can shutdown only Adventure mode on PC. Few months back I got downvoted for suggesting an offline mode. It would’ve been very useful in times like this.
---
If I remember correctly it’s cuz it’s double dips in the one handed melee perks as well.
---
scroll to the Ks in the Notes tab in the pipboy.
---
Do you see "Plan: Assaultron helmet" ?
---
If so, yea, you bought the plan, but still need to read it to learn it.   
---
Once read, it'll rename itself to (Known) Plan: Assaultron helmet.
---
Once it is known, you can craft it.
---
It's not the same hack, the person who made the original hack outright confirmed that it no longer works and the way to make it work was fixed by Bethesda with no work around.
---
This is an entirely NEW hack, going through a different method.
---
Also if someone is in a vendor you can take their stuff from the vendor since their inventory is connected.
---
Easy to do when you don't have any friends or morals.
---
Spot on...
---
They wont. They can't. They will probably give some kind of starter kit out like they did for the people who lost scrap in the FO1st scrap boxes but that is it.
---
That seems reasonable. But that leads to the question of why I’ve never heard of pipe revolver rifle builds.  Since that also double dips
---
To want them to spend the rest of their lives paying for this is insanity.  You are a crazy person.
---
It was legit hard to watch him suck people dry like that.
---
That carries water for maybe the first month or two after the game comes out. But then you move on. 
---
Like, for example. I loved the first two Final Fantasy Dissidia games on the PSP. Played them to death. When I heard they were making a third game in the series for PS4, I snapped it right up. It turned out to have nothing that I liked or wanted from the first two games. It had stripped away all of the elements of plot and story and worldbuilding and exploration that I had liked and just made it an "any three characters versus any three other characters fight for no reason and there's no plot" type of thing. 
---
I was terribly disappointed that they'd taken the series in a direction which was so lacking in what I wanted. I uninstalled it after the first couple of days. I've never played it again. 
---
You know what I didn't do? I didn't spend months and months endlessly trolling the Square Enix Twitter account. I didn't endlessly antagonize people who enjoyed the game. I didn't seek out or subscribe to people who kept telling me to hate the game. I didn't create hacking tools meant to punish people for liking a game which wasn't to my tastes. 
---
I moved on and just found some other game I liked more and never spent another moment thinking about it. That's the normal thing to do. 
---
What these people still railing on and on about a game that came out more than a year ago and which they don't play isn't normal and doesn't make sense outside of the context of the emotional reward they get for this endless, relentless obsession of theirs with their hatred of a game they didn't turn out to care for very much.
---
Exactly this! The base damage is really good too, but not as good as the deathclaw gauntlet. The massive damage numbers come from a well balanced bloodied build with plenty of buffs
---
Congrats!
---
&gt; The same hackers have bragged about being able to get into the private servers
---
Of course they did.  They would whether it was true or not, what better way to spread the fear?
---
&gt; Yeah lets kill this game, then bethesda can decide to never make another **online** fallout again and we all lose yeah, great idea man, i love when the bad guy wins
---
Fixed that.
---
Not on a witch hunt, just voicing my opinion as if your a community leader as you suggest maybe you should be holding yourself to higher standards.
---
So to jump straight to calling me toxic for the community when all I've seen of you is shenanigans is laughable.
---
So sit down and check my facts? OK buddy.
---
I'm glad Paul has apologised on my behalf for my part of standing around waiting and not attacking or provocing you, that's nice 🙂
---
The only way to guard against these kinds of hacks (which inject code into the process and dlls) is to enforce encryption of the process/DLL and have constant checking of the process
---
Well, for starters, they need to take reports of cheaters seriously.  It's been clear for a long time that either they don't, or their threshold for a ban is so high that most cheaters consider themselves safe.
---
That's what you get for buying shitty games.
---
I am and have never heard of it unless it
---
good catch, but tbh, maybe this dude had no reasons to enter here to complain before this hack got him.
---
Why would you buy all that and then not stash it before you left that camp..? The reason you cant rejoin a server is probably to keep people from griefing others. Engaging in pvp leaving the server to avoid getting killed, and rejoining to sneak attack.
---
I run a pipe revolver build on one character...
---
Probably 90% of their employees enjoy a nice vacation they don’t really deserve. Bethesda missed every opportunity to make FO76 a decent online experience. They divided the community multiple times and destroyed their public image, essentially becoming a meme.
---
If there was actual proof I might change my mind, but from the videos everything feels staged, fake and all for the updoots. 
---
You also seem like a fake to push the internet hysteria. 14 day old account with 3 posts, 1 comment and no other fallout background?
---
I killed three of these bastards trying to pick my lock prior to the hack going live.
---
The worst was the dude in BoS T-60, shame on you.
---
This should not be happening....feel really bad for the fallout 76 community right now. We just keep taking blows. PLEASE PC players be safe or just don’t play for right now if you can’t get in a private sever.
---
Good post.
---
You forgot the /sarc tag...
---
Is this hack only effecting current 76 players or everyone who has ever played? I stopped playing like half a year ago
---
I don't know. I heard people speculating this might happen because the event is over then and wanted to ask here what everyone has heard about.
---
It's Monday morning.  Monday the 23rd of December.  You posted at 5am EST.  Who do you think is available to communicate?
---
Found the hacker!
---
Nice one
---
Funny I never shot my weapon once either would you look at that and when I did walk away half of you guys followed me and threatened to nuke my base. Thats not professional of you guys so how about we end it here before you dig yourself a bigger hole bud.
---
I believe it. These same people are the ones selling 5* legendaries on eBay and don't even play the game. I enjoy the game and play it almost every day. Is it g.o.t.y.? No it has its issues but over ark and Conan I choose fallout.
---
The gift that keeps on giving. Thank you and Merry Christmas to Bethesda Game Studios. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3
---
I won't play until they fix this mess. Was visiting a camp next to the Whitesprings station until a level 3 comes near me and steals all my armor + the weapon I was carrying.
---
Firstly I don't live in America. If Bethesda wants to make profit then they should have 24/7 IT support. Which they don't
---
This is true. Under the current state of things though it just seemed odd. And OP hasn't replied to any of the comments on their own post. It raised my curiosity.
---
I'm chill.
---
You chill.
---
Merry Xmas
---
Because he's a troll, lapping up the pain of the people affected by this.
---
Yeah, and I don't think it's a matter of location checkpoints either.  I think whenever something changes about your inventory, it gets saved pretty quickly, if not the moment it changes.
---
Fearmongering post. OP has low karma, no other posts, and isn't responding.
---
Have an AA one. I dunno. I oneshot most things with it. But so did I with my bloodied sledge.
---
Quite meh at the moment. Waiting för a bloodied one.
---
&gt; Bethesda at this point release a FREE offline mode
---
I'd been hoping for this since day one, but what did we get?  A private server you have to pay for.
---
Thanks you very much, now give up and spend that time playing.
---
If the holiday santa legendaries count....That may be the fastest way.
---
If they don't....You get points for scorchbeasts, so line in the sand event. Or for something perhaps a bit less intense, then Fissure site just south of WS.
---
There's usually several legendaries in Whitespings cottages/golf clubhouse, and laundry room.
---
Who cares who made the hack, that fact is moot. There are multiple people using simple methods to hack an online game and Bethesda can’t get their shit together long enough to fix it. They’d rather try and drum up hype for Wastelanders which we all know will be buggy anyway, despite the delay. It’s is inevitable

~~Everything~~

Bodega upped his game, he's went from scamming gear to hacking stealing gear.
---
Ever since I joined in June of this year, I won at most 4 games, one of it being by pure luck. :(
---
If it causes them a big enough loss, you bet your bottom scrip that they will do something and hope they do. If they can make an example out of one criminal, the rest will be shaking in their granny’s basement and stay away from others’ assets for a while.
---
The "destroy" is done when you put something in a container, not when you take it out.
---
Right.  That's what I was saying.  It'll be a skeleton crew at best.  Which means they probably won't have the knowledge or man power to fix the hack until the main team gets back from holiday break.
---
Cool! How does that compare to a lever rifle build?
---
I got a faster respond complaining on reddit than i ever got sending in a ticket.
---
it was redone abut the same time Pioneer scouts came into being.
---
IIRC, they had to roll back 7-10 days for the players who lost their gear due to the Vault 94 bug. Can you confirm that they maintain daily backups?
---
I didn't say anything about the punishment, I simply said it wasn't insane to want justice. Maybe you should chill a bit before continuing your reddit psychiatrist career there bud.
---
Bethesda has been providing training materials to hackers since Morrowind.
---
Well we can't ignore the fact there is hackers , because they are there but it's nowhere as bad as its blown up to me
---
What a douche bag
---
A sorry and 20 Atoms should do it.
---
What from a community manager?
---
Terrorist claims he can attack anywhere!
---
Maybe he's right, maybe he's lying.  One thing you can be sure of he's going to *claim* he can.
---
almost a million people? There is barely 20 people left playing this game my guy.
---
Lower frame rates beat game breaking hacks any day.
---
If I worked for Bethesda, I would never, never, ever look at my phone on a day off.
---
That would mean they have to take responsibility. They would rather let it blow over and patch it once people are done playing.
---
Oof, but true.
---
People play FO76 in China?  Isn't that a little, how can I say it, ideologically suspect?
---
Tbh i take pleasure in your disgust
---
Just happened to me. I'm 100% sure it was a level 3 with "Bacon" on his name. Stripped all my armor + the weapon I was carrying. Kept the other weapons.
---
Lol. Most of these “hackers” are just kids who use simple hacks made possible by Bethesda’s lack of security. It is Bethesda’s fault for rushing the game in order to release it before RDR2. The result of their greed is what we see now.
---
Ok, for the last time, do all these threads look fake? All of them?  [https://bethesda.net/community/category/233/general-discussion?language%5B%5D=en](https://bethesda.net/community/category/233/general-discussion?language%5B%5D=en)   
---
Use the Occam's Razor - what is more probable - coordinated hoax perpetrated by dozens, with multiple fake videos and posts *or* a an exploit in already exploited game with an obsolete code?
---
Please, observe, read and anwer.
---
They will still find a way to disappoint us
---
Taking our time? I don't know. It's abuse. Own my copy and that's what they are fucking with. Maybe the law should be challenged. New times, new rules. These people deserved to be fined and punished.
---
The former c:
---
This probably will be their response if we get one at all.
---
I dont think they have the resources to offer that to everyone.  *not enough servers
---
i will try that next time
---
Not trying to be the grammar nut, but I believe it’s a “canned” response, not a “pre-canned.”
---
I agree tho. I’m only saying ^ because I like your descriptive voice.
---
This is what you got as a compensation for a crappy 200$ collector's with non-see-through visor, crappy plastic and a nylon canvas bag everyone went mad about as the latter was the only thing that smelled like lawsuit.
---
No you dont risk anything.
---
You just use cosmetic articles you buyed from the atom shop.
---
Nothing can be loosed atvany time.
---
This wouldn’t make any sense, especially since you can spend caps to craft your own. They aren’t going to strip something from our inventory that you paid for. You can’t get any new gifts after event is over is all.
---
Noice!
---
No, Nuclear Winter mode is different from Adventure Mode. There is not a risk to lose your items from playing, so have fun!
---
Also, whatever you do, don't go buy replacement stuff on ebay.
---
It’s just like basically every year when psn and Xbox live get ddos at Christmas, like every year, except this time it’s pc players. Why do they do it? Because they’re assholes who want to make sure no one has fun.
---
No you don’t. Personally i enjoyed actually decrypting one but it is a lot of work
---
"Dur hur doesn't affect console"
---
Can't wait till this community realizes that 1 console is next and 2 this is on Bethesda. I don't even blame the hackers, they're doing what they do lol it's Bethesda's responsibility to keep them from repeadately breaking this patchwork game
---
Fair comment. Ty, I’ve been saying it wrong for years then :)
---
At 08:00am EST on Monday the 23rd of December, yeah, probably not here, and even if they were I doubt they've been briefed yet.
---
No. People aren’t doing it to obtain good weapons. They are doing it to be garbage people.
---
Why? So many guys and gals love FO76.
---
I play it every day. Found so many friends and i really love the players.
---
Why are you complaining? You chose to buy THAT shit. Shut the hell up and "enjoy" your "game"!
---
No. A bethesda dev. Sent me an inbox message after i posted a complaint a out the scrap box. I sent in a ticket like a day prior and didnt get a respond. Made a Reddit post and less than 2 mins later i got a respond.
---
You can't?
---
I’m starting to think this more and more these days
---
This is one of those times where I'm genuinely sad to see posts like these. Fully understand why you're leaving, sorry that people are, legitimately, ruining the game now for our fellow PC players 😔
---
I’m starting to the More I see about it
---
I've been gone since the 2nd day of fallout 1st. Don't get me wrong, I really like the game and hope to someday come back when things are better (if). But it doesn't seem like it. Right now I'm feeling ok with the game being shut down for a year or 3.
---
And I'm still disappointed
---
I see… At this point, even we, the veterans, are rather confused… thinking myself to reinstall FO4, lol. Last thing I wanted for Xmash is drama and bad vibes in my personal leisure time...
---
Us versus them is deeply primitive, but immensely profitable.
---
\&gt; Guitar Sword - give me a guitar axe with the &gt;blades on the bottom not the neck. 
---
Spoken like a true Gene Simmons fan... :)
---
Does 76 have a discord server? Texting on phone whilst playing would work.
---
They don't have enough servers to give everyone their own private server.  Even if they are virtualised servers they don't just have enough hardware at the ready for that kind of thing.
---
It was proven to not be the case though. Back when the raid launched, there was a rare bug that actually emptied a character’s entire inventory. Someone eventually pushed with enough evidence (on this subreddit) to a point he was able to get a rollback. 
---
So they *can* restore, but I guess it’s just a last resort option. They’d rather be lazy and not do it for whatever reason lol
---
God damn, this is so upsetting.
---
I sincerely hope for his sake he is not "demonstrating", this level of hackery is illegal in most countries.
---
Cause spending money on an already obsolete console that performs worse than a custom built PC for the same cost is a great idea. Doesn't the fact that the next Xbox is essentially a PC without Windows tell you anything?
---
Well shit, I guess I'm not playing again till this is fixed.
---
I've seen /b/ coordinate shit like this
---
If the internets biggest hive of scum and villainy can rally the numbers I'm sure redditors can
---
I used to be loyal to 76, played it daily for months, as soon as 1st showed it's ugly head I knew they didn't care anymore.
---
This just cements my decision to take a break from the game till the expansion.
---
76 is really "The Room" of video games at this point. It's so bad - it's actually good.
---
I’ll probably be doing the same
---
It just works
---
I'm never logging in again lmao! WTF! Beth is like come on guys leave the game alone lol. Thank God I'm on PS4. I would freak out losing all my gear and weapons!
---
Even if that's the case and absolutely no one with authority can be reached (despite it not actually being the holidays yet), does that mean they can't put out a statement or a tweet? Something to warn players that aren't on reddit who don't know what's going on?
---
I don't have a fallout 1st subscription and I'm not vulnerable to these hackers.
---
I wouldn't be able to look people in the eye.
---
I changed my lever action build to pipe revolver build, it’s just as viable and the revolver has a nice wasteland look. I don’t know why not many are using it, maybe they prefer the rifle look of levers and handmades
---
I've only gotten 1 copy of the plasma grenade, tomahawk, and gorilla head. Everything else, I've got 3-10 copies.
---
Pretty sure I've opened 200+ gifts of varying size, and gotten every rare plan. Only missing a few of the armor pieces.
---
Beth said anything?  I suspect not, yet, eh?
---
Not that I'm a supporter of Fallout 1st, but I have to ask:
---
Has a Bethesda Rep actually said this, or are you tinfoil-hatting that this is all intended to drive subs? We all have those type of thoughts occasionally, but to say it as 'fact' is a bit silly until it occurs. Once it occurs I'd be happy to grab my pitchfork and join you.
---
Right? I personally knew 10 people that made false claims for free stuff during the scrapbox fiasco *and it worked.*
---
All these videos have overlaid music too so you can't tell via audio-wave-tracing that the clip has been split to make it look as if the "victims" automatically lose their gear.
---
For real? I don't suppose you can link this?
---
Wow. Hacking is bad but calling someone a pedo and telling them to get cancer is good?
---
Ready to get back to playing after a brief hiatus. Is this happening on all platforms our just the PC?
---
This guy games.
---
Because there's a fuck up literally every week. Not to mention they really don't care about their players lmao...
---
I'd be more than happy with that. The player base will be down anyway over Christmas, it'd be the easiest thing for Bethesda to turn off the public servers for a while until this is fixed.
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
I understand fully how players are hesitant to play. I've played since the beginning and play on console. Have a couple thousand hours in and I still enjoy it. I am able to not let the negativity affect my pleasure in the game. Others are not as fortunate.
---
What in r/fo76?
---
I wouldn’t count on it. It’s clear 76 was just a side inbetween thing for zenimax to rake in cash while starfield and ES6 are in development. A far more likely scenario is them just tossing out wastelanders then put the game on maintenance mode soon after.
---
&gt;Enjoy the holidays nonetheless.
---
Um. Ok.
---
Yeah i know but it would be funny to steal everyones crap, restart computer for updates (thanks windows 10) and have their computer bluescreen once it tried to load.
---
Yeah.
---
Read what I replied to and you will understand the reason I called him insane.  It had nothing to do with wanting justice, bud.
---
Not me.  But their names are public knowledge.
---
Yeah, he's a filthy liar.
---
Might have to try raising a ticket and and a post here too and see what happens :)
---
Seriously dude, put away some time over the holidays, stock up on snacks and get stuck into Fallout 3 or New Vegas. If you have enjoyed 76 then you absolutely won't regret it. Two of the best story driven rpg games going.
---
This game is becoming an abortion clinic dumpster fire. The game itself could be epic if it wasn’t for the blatant disregard, mismanagement, and incompetence of Bethesda/Zenimax, and a few assholes. 
---
Yeah, I said it. I truly wish it was different, I loved playing. But it’s just. So. Broken.
---
Stop playing shitty game?
---
How do you kill something that is already dead?
---
Nope.
---
Hackers/cheaters are a known thing. There's no surprise here. They exist in each and every game, at this point they're so common it's like a force of nature. It's completely on the developer to acknowledge that they exist, and build their  game in a way that AT LEAST has server-side checks for inventories &amp; transactions.
---
 There can be no good reason for handling this on the client-side. Even a junior dev. can tell you it's a horrible, horrible implementation. FO76 is not even a big target, yet they managed to screw up completely. There are many other big profile games and they manage to not break down like a house of cards, but somehow it's too much to ask from Bethesda.
---
It’s the way it can double dip on perks and the way food buffs multiply with said double dipping.
---
Here’s mine with just food buffs: https://imgur.com/a/tP876id
---
You can add some whiskey, fury, revenant and some adrenaline cards to get some really insane numbers.
---
And verification of what the client is spitting out too.
---
When are we gonna start posting their LinkedIn profiles
---
Oh yeah. They closed my ticket before fixing the problem to. I had to get the dev i was messaging on reddit to re open it.
---
I just did this. For one hour, I got 8 small and 1 medium gift. I took over every forest workshop save the power plant because I just hate power plants lol. So yeah it works.
---
Can confirm, had my level 10 pipe pistol and leather armor stolen (level 6 new spawn). Would not recommend logging in on anything but a fresh character. Still people can be so sweet, been given loads of stuff being a fresh character &lt;3.
---
Damn. Hopefully something works :/
---
m8 i get you're angry at hackers, cuz it is unfair 
---
but what you're asking would probably cost bethesda a lot more time, effort and money than these hackers lol 
---
it will take time, but bethesda wont ignore this
---
Yeah. They are hackers fiddling with the way the game works. If they can lift your entire inventory do you think carry weight will stop them? I mean you can't fucking fly in this game either but that didn't stop the NW hackers.
---
Same, and more social due to crafting. It really is a shame they added legendaries.
---
Private servers are released and suddenly not long after there's a hack in which the recommended way to circumvent it is to subscribe and go on a private server?
---
No way that's being looked at in a jiffy
---
Man... Now I want some ham
---
Everyone here has an absolute right to be frustrated but fuck flooding the sub with all these same posts.
---
Young fatter Michael Ironsides?
---
Awesome Brother, you are exactly the type of person that I want to run with.
---
Sa
---
XB and PS already have inherent text/voice chat, and there's mods available for PC. After it becomes avilable on Steam, it can take advantage of their text/voice chat. Why would they spend time adding it themselves?
---
Really? I'll definitely have to check them out then. Because I have absolutely loved playing 76. Thanks for recommending them.
---
Good idea, one month of 1st for all. Current subscribers should also receive the same grant as a free extension.
---
Which 2 programs would you like them to learn?
---
That actually sounds about right.
---
At L160, what I usually see :
---
Enemies at the BoS tech data turnin site are usually 23-32, sometimes lower depending on who else has been around, camden park is about the same.
---
WS proper is L48ish up to 62 for ghouls, 42-76 for Yogis, 68 for the radscorpion, and 91 for the glowing deathclaw.
---
Super mutants run L48-68.
---
Blackwater mole miners are either 14 or 40, depending on who's around.
---
Gutsies on the right side of the map start at L22, sometimes L50.
---
That is good use of that gif. Lol.
---
Because, for all the flaws, I do enjoy the game.
---
TBH, that sounds like the plot to a comedy. Despite what we believe, Bethesda likely makes enough from the Atomic shop to make agitating their player-base like this a no-no. If it was true though, I doubt the Ebay sellers are the ones propagating this exploit - the fear of losing your stuff would (temporarily) drive down sales. Further, if people get ticked and quit it means less potential future buyers.
---
The biggest psychopaths are Bethesda, selling this sort of a product the way they do and lying all along the way.
---
PC, yeah. I'm one of the odd ducks that use a controller on a PC, because I can't use mouse and keyboard.
---
What a complete asshole.
---
Fallout 76 had an EXTREMELY fucked first year but in the past month it's the worst it's ever been. First they break every piece of legendary armor in the game, now this.
---
You're not wrong, but neither does bethesda
---
Bethesda. Hackers do one thing, And that is hacking... They prod, poke and find exploits and share their findings in the spirit of their craft. then theres the people who use the hacks aka cheaters, don't give credit to these assholes like they have any skill, if they did they wouldn't be using the hackers tools. It's Bethesdas job to address both of them.
---
But that talks about mods on the client side that the software doesn't validate.  
---
Isn't player to player hacking done through the servers, or is there a direct connection set up?  
---
Is it really the same thing?
---
But why should people that put a lot of time into this game suffer the consequences?
---
&gt;Since there is no way of knowing what player is using the hack, the only way to avoid it, is to **not play on a public server**.
---
When I read the post about it a couple of days ago, I thought that some person was just boasting and trying to create a panic. 
---
If its real, well fuck Bethesda for being such a shite company. And adding that, you are safe on a private server, i.e. you pay $13+ per  month to be safe from those hackers, makes Bethesda double Shite in my eyes. There was warning about this exploit. They could have put resources into it to fix it but it seems like they'd rather players suffer and want to join the private servers if they want to enjoy the game. Fuck em.
---
Console *ISN'T* next because it's literally impossible to do any kind of hacks or mods on current-gen consoles (a fact which I have to say is pretty impressive considering we're reaching the end of this generation and are about to go onto the 8th Generation of game consoles)
---
Just PC as far as I know.
---
hold up
---
Changing the law to make taking away your recreational gaming time is going to be a hard sell.
---
This is a Bethesda issue, not a legal one
---
Just PC.
---
I lost all of my equipped items last night. Everything equipped: 5 armor pieces, weapon, backpack, under armor, jumpsuit. Was at a stash box transferring some items, heard footsteps, naked.
---
I thought it was a glitch and send in a support ticket. Now I read this, bummer.
---
There's scripts available to force enter private worlds, so you wouldn't be safe there either
---
Cars aren't permanently destroyed, you get a new one by calling mores mutual and paying a small fee. So yeah, I'd say having your stuff stolen right from your inventory with no realistic way of getting it back is significantly worse.
---
I've played more since Thanksgiving that in the previous 6 months.  But none of the legendary stuff affected me, and I'm on PS4.  
---
But Beth MUST act.  They must admit it's going on and state their action, or they're going to lose a leg of the triad.
---
How quickly people forget. GTA 5 was a shitshow when it first released, to a lesser degree it still has problems with the online side of things. 76 just makes an appealing target right now, eventually this will fixed and people will move on to something else.
---
Does the SBQ head drop for this event?
---
Was it your inventory, or jut what you had equipped?
---
Oh god Yong is going to wank himself unconscious with this one.
---
Tinfoil hat: great way to force people to buy Fallout 1st in time for the holidays!
---
Whenever I have a good amount of time I play this way on my private server. It takes a while to get all those workshops and defend them.
---
Oh I'm not.counting on it at all. I don't think Bethesda is competent enough to do it anyway, even if they want to.
---
I cannot recall ever hearing of a multiplayer game so broken that it allowed a player to directly steal items from another player’s inventory.  Sure, Diablo 2 had trade hacks where you could put fake items in tradescreen.  And there were ways to trick people out of their items.  But I’ve never heard of anything this direct.
---
You're way over analyzing. This is being done to #1 Give Bethesda the finger (guy who released the script) and #2 To make 76 players squeal (people using it). And yeah, *we're squealing.* But we also put faith into a company that made it easy for them to do so. So, yeah. **DEMERITS ALL AROUND.**
---
The mods on this sub had to put up a warning lol, they have no association with Bethesda.
---
It's just a visual glitch, I've seen it once before and went walk about
---
GTA 5 online at launch was nowhere even close to as bad as 76 at launch. And look how much GTAO improved during it's first year vs how little 76 has improved.
---
What items have been pay to win? The collection and fridge do not give any advantage over other players.
---
I thought they removed the exploit that allowed you to spawn in items and shit period
---
Nah, Alien: Colonial Marines is easily the worst game I’ve played by a AAA studio. It plays worse than an indie shooter game. FO76 definitely has its flaws, but ends up being a fun overall experience despite that.
---
No, why would people steal other people’s stuff? They’re assholes, that’s why.
---
Don't blame the engine. Plenty of developers use older engines that have just been updated. I honestly believe when people carry on about old game engines, they don't actually realise how it all works. Its on Bethesda for not staying on top of things.
---
Hard no. This will ruin the game completely. I dont want this to turn into a mindless and pointless looter shooter like Destiny or Division. The existence of the player to player economy is one reason this game is special and stands out from the other mainstream copy-paste "games as service".
---
hahahahhahahahah
---
When you get the the point where you are reasonably content with your armor/weapons, and have lots of materials on hand, then you equip excavator and start looting everything (with excavator, I can carry over 1700# and still run).  At the vendor, equip hard bargain 3, pop a grape mentats, drink alcohol that gives +1 CHR, and sell that junk back to the bot vendor.  You can hit the cap limit every play session.
---
For example, I run healing factor mutation, so I don't use many stimpacks.  But a run through WS may yield 15 or so.  I already have 50 on hand, so I sell all that I loot.  Ditto the radx, radaway, and diluted versions..
---
Go through the interior of WS and pick up all the phones, vases, plastic cups, ashtrays, coffee cups, clipboards....
---
Good selection of moderately prices stuff in your vendor also helps :)
---
So you're all out their fighting Her Majs and you're suddenly unarmed and naked.
---
What a scene.  Hope somebody has film.
---
It´s ok, just buy fallout 1st and play on private server, you will be fine and Bethesda will be happy.
---
It is sad because the core game mechanics are actually quite good.
---
Because a pipe revolver with each 1* perk of gunslinger, still only brings its dmg to that equal or only slightly more than a lever action. So, you could just have a lever action and instead put those points in adrenaline.
---
The meat hook is such an OP build, because the weapon itself isnt much less stronger than the strongest unarmed, then the perks dramatically increasing it to nearly double the dmg of any other unarmed. Mix that with unyielding, bloodied, nerd rage, adrenal reaction, radicool builds increase strength (which inturn increases dmg) and dmg like crazy
---
It’s really something they should have given for free to all players as compensation for having released such a borked game to begin with...
---
Great idea.
---
It’s been the holidays since Friday lol
---
Rest in Bethesda
---
Makes sense that they would want to hedge their bets. If a Bethesda employee sees the complaint has a bunch of downvotes and the response saying to not worry have upvotes, which will they believe
---
It was sarcasm. I would shit myself if they did.
---
Thank you for this. Very complete answer.
---
From what I've seen you're only at risk on a private server if the hacker is on your friends list. Have you seen different info?
---
Bethesda: WhAt aBouT ThE AtoMs?!
---
This is very worrying.
---
Not saying that this is necessarily what is happening (I have no way to know for sure), but technically, that kind of relaunch might already be in the works for FO76 as well, except without the "taking offline" bit. After all, it does not look like the first year of updates released to the public should have required that much manpower, and a lot of Wild Appalachia content and even a partly finished Vault 94 were found in the files already during the B.E.T.A.
---
They already made back their money no doubt about it.
---
There are people on this sub who pay a monthly subscription for this garbage, and have bought the game multiple times so they can have multiple characters.
---
We can only hope the game did worse than the expected.
---
I unloaded a big steaming mass of content this morning.  Usually happens after my first coffee.  Smells better than YongYea's stuff.
---
Can we just a start a witch hunt? Surely the mods can allow people to publicly name this guy? We could all mass report him then
---
Or they are hoping that after they steal your shit you will be so mad about the time you spent getting all the equipment you’ll just break down and buy replacement gear from eBay
---
Perhaps they are aware the game is satire.
---
I would argue only a fraction is on reddit. You all are just really good at screaming.
---
It can’t get over to consoles. But as for the community being dead over there that’s pretty much true. When I get on any world I join there is at least one or two people I know there by chance, and I don’t know that many people who play. NW only has a variety of about 100 different players. Every time I start up I can run the vault and count 25 people I’ve played NW with a dozen times. I would say less than 1000 people are still left playing on xb1
---
Unfortunately, in many customer service support roles, especially anything technical related, those agents are required to follow certain protocols. 
---
You could literally have the most adept, knowledgeable, experienced agent, and they would be constrained to following a specific procedure. 
---
If they don’t?  Well, if that call/account gets reviewed, they can get punished/cited for failing to follow the company rules. And it’s likely just as frustrating for them as it is for you. Because they may have to handle dozens of calls a day where they WANT to help, but they either cannot (because they don’t have the access or entitlements to DO anything), or have to choose not to help, because their job could be at risk if they did. 
---
They may have to deal with multiple (justifiably) angry customers each day, but given the choice between making a customer happy (who they interact with only once) and their boss happy (who they have to interact with every day), that’s really no choice at all. 
---
Just because John at Bethesda Support didn’t help you doesn’t mean they don’t want to help or don’t know how to help.
---
Tato
---
We haven't gotten past worrying at this point. A company this disconnected and incompetent isn't worrying anymore it is outright outrageous.
---
wait...
---
...there's ham?  WHERE?!
---
 🐷  nvm, found the ham  🐖
---
"We can't just give away our  virtual money, its not like these people didn't pay $60 for the game to begin with!"
---
Yeah. I saw that. I read about that a hacker is goin' around and it took me some time to find it out. It sucks an i see many people have the same problem like me. Even a ban of people doin' this will not getting much out of it. We need BattleEye. Let's see what Bethesda gonna do in Christmas. I see video is from 22 December and Bethesda did not made any post or anything about it. PERFECT how they treat us.
---
same bug here !
---
I lost my armor and equipped gun !
---
what a shame
---
Just quit now even if they give stuff back.
---
People are making comparisons to GTA hacks in this sub but what they forget is that most of those hack were advantageous to the players, even the malicious ones didn’t destroy hours of grinding. Rockstar has always been fairly good about restoring or crediting stolen items as well.
---
Bethesda was warned about hacks like these being possible for at least a year. They did nothing because at the end of the day, their response has always been reactionary - not preventative. Not blaming Bethesda can be compared to the classic “Cheaters” TV show, where, the distraught spouse blames/attacks the other woman rather than their significant other for the affair. 
---
I feel bad for those who have been stripped of their stuff, but let’s treat this like a symptom of a larger issue - not the cause.
---
So it’s just pc that’s in danger?
---
This is a spam post. Obviously there arent a million people playing. But there is a solid community and player base. This is just a shit post trying to aggravate the community and create content for "news" websites to spread more Bethesda hate. Dont feed into it.
---
Take a stand **buyMoreFallout76**
---
I wonder what made Bethesda think they could get away with releasing this shitty game.
---
And what is the problem that its my first comment? Maybe i'm not interesting into writing and sitting with my nose inside forums?
---
"staying quite".... The hack went live in the middle of the night, on a Sunday, on a Holiday week.... For fuck sakes, you guys need to calm down and give it some time. 
---
Yes, it sucks, but what also sucks is constant childish behavior being shown by a lot of you about this. Give it time, it will be fixed... Until then, either play on a private server if you can, or play another damn game... Cause in the end, it's a game, not your life, and if you can't find something better to do, that's on you.
---
Ummm, are you not paying attention? This is about hackers literally making the PC version unplayable. And it's about Bethesda allowing it to happen due to their incompetence. This has nothing to do with how good or bad the game is. What? Are you nuts?
---
Also I haven't played in a couple weeks due to this and other issues, if you care.
---
Kinda weird that you're spending so much time following what I'm doing, but hey, you do you.
---
They are silent now because they don't want anymore negative media attention. Or all of them are on Christmas break. Or both.
---
I’m on Xbox and am having this issue as well - no matter what we did, my husband couldn’t join my private server. We changed it to &amp; from team only, hard rebooted his console, reset our router &amp; modem, and had no luck. If anyone’s found a fix, please update!
---
Weeeeeeeeeeeelllllllllllllllllllll.....
---
Why would you want FO1st? That’s not going to restore the hundreds of people who lost their gear
---
You can also choose "invite only" when going on GTA Online, essentially making your own "private server" without having to pay for any additional service from Rockstar. Granted its a limited experience since you can't do certain missions or cargo runs.
---
This was my first thought. My second thought is this is why I moved from PC gaming to consoles...that and not having a ton of money to build high end gaming rigs anymore. Heh
---
I did not have anu business to come on the forum before i was hacked.
---
just pc as far as i know
---
This post isnt about theft, its about poor quality coding. Even if it were, the tone is over the top.
---
lucily my 2nd character, but still lost my armour,power armour and treasured fixer.....
---
It's free speech.
---
And profitable speech.  A lot of money to be made whipping people into a frenzy.  What's worse?  The charlatan?  Or the people who aren't smart enough to see through him?
---
No icicles plan for me.. did get Santa crash the other night finally though :P
---
Yes i do
---
The idea is not to bring the servers down. The goal is to get the issue fixed, which requires more than a bunch of SREs.
---
Nah, r/fo76 is constantly hating on them.  Now if the filthies turn on you, then you are in trouble.
---
I'm still waiting for a response to the Fallout 1st shitstorm so don't hold your breath
---
I first saw this back in the days of ole playing WoW, all the “Chinese gold farmers” selling gold and gear on eBay. Crazy what people will do to ruin a game for themselves.
---
What happened to “even with all the bugs and piss poor programming game is fine and still fun to play”
---
For the love of every kitten and tit pic on the internet don’t hold Bethesda accountable after 2 years of releasing an absolute abortion of a game
---
You do realize that the people working at Bethesda are real people, right? Not just computers that press a few buttons to solve your problems? It's Christmas time, are you seriously demanding that the employees be taken away from their families during holiday break so that they can work more?
---
It's fells great. Do it.
---
You'll be happy.
---
Yeah and  opportunity  to grind for more of hundreds of hours.
---
Which ‘jerk on the video’?  Are you talking about Juicehead’s video?
---
That was a warning video using actual proof of the hack. That’s not the guy/guys running around stealing players stuff. He didn’t just happen to come across a malevolent hacker. He arranged a test situation so the community can see it is possible and then gave advice on how to protect yourself.
---
There can't be that many players left lol. As much as I had hoped this game had a chance it's a dumpster fire and y'all just keep tossing more fuel on it.
---
That is true.
---
And to be honest, I am hoping the all the PC hacking issues will result in an extension.
---
ah .... much harder to combat. and the tools to do this are not hard to find.
---
I doubt it, could be easily abused.
---
Guy sobbed in court, and was "allowed to live with his mom" during the trial.  
---
This is the sort of person who does the hacking.  Losers.
---
Its a hacker we ve'been hit by...
---
I believe they ended back up in your inventory/storage. They’re not gone - just stored.
---
Pretty much yeah
---
&gt; Firstly I don't live in America.
---
But Bethesda do.  When you posted it was 5AM where Bethesda are.
---
&gt; If Bethesda wants to make profit then they should have 24/7 IT support.
---
IT support don't "communicate".  That's not their job.  Few companies have 24/7 high level decision makers and PR staff.
---
Disagree, it should happen. But it needed to be a running beta, 5-6 months of actual fixes once it went live.
---
It would have been a lot harder for the mud to stick if there was a big *"beta"* banner on it.   
---
The community is solid now, it would have been even stronger if we'd had a "genuine" input, not just "we've seen that you'll pay for this".
---
Go read the front page of this sub and think about how terribly coded the game is.
---
He could have had 10 years, judge only gave 3 months,  But he did have to oay $350,000 restitution to gambling websites.
---
Its the only way you're going to be able to avoid the hack that steals everything you have on you.
---
Right and I acknowledge that in my post.
---
No neither scorchbeast is in the drop pool
---
Can't wait when hackers will also loot my entire stash box...
---
Just 13 a month is enough. The benefits are 2 little to shell out a 100. Try it for a month, and if u find yourself not needing it (which trust me, you will), you can drop it anytime. If you find yourself still using it a lot down the line, then you may consider dropping the 100.
---
The power armour is because of a glitch when they updated the game that happened many months ago, everyone had their power armour come of their frames and placed in their inventory

No I totally get that it’s free speech.  I’m not like trying to advocate for limiting anyone’s free speech.  I just think it’s really stupid that this guy makes thousands for speaking about something that he *actually* has no clue about, because he doesn’t even play the game.  Someone commenting on the new Call of Duty game who doesn’t even play the damn thing would get looked at like they’re stupid, but because it’s Fallout 76 it’s totally okay.
---
I think they \*used\* to drop from Enclave events, the same as they \*used\* to be available from the MODUS vendors. They aren't any more, though, and haven't been for a few months at least.
---
I"'ll take if off you hands if you don't want it. I'm always making ammo for my 50 caps. I burn through it.
---
There is probably only CSR's in office. Anyone with the ability to do anything started Christmas last Wednesday.
---
Yeet’d into the ether
---
UHMMMM...Yeah, that Plasma Grenade plan was a 25k plan 2 weeks ago....I still get 10-15k for them...  I have characters with over 100k in caps....You need to work on your selling skills and know prices before selling stuff...Merry Xmas
---
Fix the hack and the bugs before yo I release new bugs with Wastelanders
---
People can say what they want. Stop being a baby.
---
Yeah, harping on every little bug like peoples entire inventories being deleted is just being nitpicky.
---
"Support" don't communicate?
---
Alright then 😂
---
I got hacked too, and not even Wastelanders can make me come back at this point.
---
And the Chinese Communist party is notably attuned to satire.
---
Not posting from Hong Kong I assume.
---
You should really rethink this, especially now...
---
'kay
---
I upvoted you.  Your experience isn't mine, but it's valid.  I'm back playing after leaving shortly after Fasnacht.  Loving it.  But I'm on PS4, and not in danger, yet.
---
Things are being stolen from people, some that have payed real money for those items. It is absolutely about theft in addition to your own points.
---
I've gotten the grenade 3x so far and I'd estimate I've opened about 400ish gifts or so. 
---
Got the tomahawk once. 
---
I've gotten 3 santa crashes, one icicle lights
---
And I've only gotten one gorilla, one mothman and one mirelurk king. 
---
I had to buy the glowing one and radtoad and one other plan I forget the name of as they've never dropped for me. 
---
The other animal heads I've gotten about 15x or more each
---
Script kiddies. They get high off of this, nothing more. I wouldn't call it a mental illness, being a sufferer of one myself.
---
Console gang here.. I oppose this.
---
I know they can, that’s why I’m saying what I want.  Stop being a baby.
---
Yes.
---
Slight thing, the core engine was originally for multiplayer games, then Bethesta modified it to be used it for singleplayer games, now its back to being a multiplayer game.
---
here is a good video about that https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jqymg_prARI
---
I thought it was gonna be the guy with the pizza coming back to the flaming apartment
---
What if that was Bethesda's plan all along?
---
I read it, someone is angry and wants justice.
---
"iT jUsT wOrKs"  --- Todd Howard
---
You made a dramapost on r/starbound, soooo...
---
I used to do the first one in Harper's Ferry for my 1400 a day, there is a vendor in the town so no travel while over encumbered.
---
Now I sell Serums for my 1400 a day on two characters when not capped.
---
\*Todd Howard laughs at your pitiful demands. He screams in thunderous raptures of laughter before collapsing into his overseer's chair (free from the Atom Shop). He reaches into his nylon bag and draws forth a small jar with a strange blue essence inside. It becomes apparent that this is the soul of a Fallout 1st user, now in Howard's possession. He brushes the dust from its label, before gently putting it back inside. Next, he draws forth another jar, one much cleaner and empty. He wipes the dust from its label- in comic sans, "you" is written on it, the next victim of Fallout 1st.\*
---
All power armor that was owned by players was stripped down and the parts were placed in inventory after patch 12 I think. Just be glad you didnt have 60 full chassis like me..
---
I scrip all legendaries except:
---
* stuff I can use on one of my characters
---
* stuff that sells well but I do not need (for example good melee, I don't use melee. or good semi-automatic rifles)
---
After a while you have a lot of legendaries that you think you can use. Important is then actually testing the weapons and armor. Some weapons might disappoint, others might be better. Then sell the stuff that is not good enough. This last step is crucial to keep free inventory space.  
---
What I also do: I have a fourth character that holds everything I'm still in doubt about. Once that character is full, I have a big sale event. I price them very low so they actually move. I start selling the cheapest stuff first and work my way up until I have enough space.
---
The most important advice I could give is not keeping stuff you don't use.
---
Well I for one won't be buying any Bethesda game any time soon. Already the 4th AAA developer that I'm not touching anymore.
---
Luckily the indie scene is thriving and there are some great not decrepit publishers out there.
---
No, learn to play using the bare minimum and without having to rely on ranged weaponry. Game is doable running around naked and punching things, with or without an unarmed weapon; death is temporary and highly inconsequential. Don't spoil the fun for rest of us actually treating FO76 like an actual survival game.
---
But they don’t have to care? Its news and they are gonna cover it. And try to be original lol.
---
Don't reward sloppy work. Apart from not (currently) being hacked there is no additional content other than quality of life improvements that should be in the base game.
---
Bethesda would you kindly get your shit together and fix this type of shit
---
Has this been proven outside of dubious youtube personalities? Just checking because I was thinking about coming back for holiday break, should I actually be worried?
---
My account was 4 years old before my first post...and it was regarding a bug in a game. Nobody called me out on it.
---
I feel like that’s the same way on PS4
---
What system?
---
Considering that the game on PC was already suffering from low population, I'd say scenario 3 is the most likely one to happen.
---
Yeah in reality I think Beth would want a redo if they had a crystal ball a year ago.
---
Yeah they have to follow their procedures or lose their job. A lot of people can’t afford to lose their job. I work in customer service for a pharmacy benefit manager and the amount of patients who call and scream because I’m not willing to lose my job to do what they want without following procedure is ridiculous- “of course I want to help you, but I can’t do that if you won’t even give me your NAME”
---
That real grassy knoll level shit.
---
What do you think? PC. Just a month after I switched from PS4. Should have stayed there.
---
Go to Recents on your social tab, then report him.
---
Nothing may happen, but it's all you can do right now.
---
Nintendo
---
So why not do 1 month? Why commit to 100$ right now? Try it for 1 month if you must get it.
---
Pro-tip:  You shouldn't use $ and the word "dollars" in the same instance.  "$100" is pronounced the same as "100 dollars," so if you say it "$100 dollars" out loud, it reads as *"One hundred dollars dollars."*  
---
And now I'll answer your query.
---
I am a Fallout 1st subscriber, and IMO it's not worth it yet.  Arguably it never will be, but so far they have not given any Atomic Shop discounts like they've advertised, they have not given persistent servers/workshops like they said were coming, and mods are not yet a thing either like they said they were going to do.  If and when those things materialize, it will be worth more than it is today.
---
My advice would be to wait until some of those features are implemented, then buy a year of it at the discounted rate.
---
But if you're in a good position financially and it's not that much money to you and you wanna support the game, go ahead.  It's your money.  Treat yourself.  Life is short.
---
Yeah I feel like there’s going to be a lot of trolls trying to get internet points for these posts or just trying to get featured in a YouTube video. I’m sure there will be some legit people as well but still.
---
They shouldn't. Both Bethesda and hackers should be held accountable. Hackers because they are taking advantage of the players, AND Bethesda for allowing the state of the game to be what it's in now and continuing to try and push microtransactions for a game that has too many issues to even be called a complete product.
---
You can be angry at both.
---
They can change the script so that it targets stashes instead of inventories, but then they can't take you have on you.
---
But then again, they only need to change it back...
---
Man I'm just loving these super salty downvotes.
---
Try the SBQ in non legendary gear and melee weapon without a stash of aid items :)
---
&gt;Also I haven't played in a couple weeks due to this and other issues, if you care.
---
Oh Anthony. You know people can see your posts, right?
---
From a few days ago:
---
&gt; Yesterday I logged on to dump my legendaries for scrip and sell other stuff for caps. Then I did one Uranium Fever, sold some more stuff for caps, then got off. No point in staying on, I hit my limit in less than an hour.
---
But yeah, okay man. You've not played for weeks. 
---
Sadfly I didn't purposefully come across your post, I was just reading up on the PC hacker bug and there you are, furiously posting away about how bad the game and calling for a boycott  while totally not playing it. 
---
You should log in, there's a Santatron going for free at the moment.
---
That's completely ridiculous
---
The players are to blame for that? Each of us paid money for the game. Higher level traders, me included, even bought multiple accounts to hold caps. And for the money paid we got a product that didn't reach acceptable quality level in a full year.
---
Think about how they released monthly sub before 2 step and proper restore system.
---
Because a lot of people post false stories to spread negativity
---
I'm just offering advice to keep you safe, if you want to take the risk go ahead!
---
Truthfully, their best bet is to just work with Steam to get the game off of Bethesda servers and get them onto Steam Servers. Not only would it give PC access to VAC but it would also allow them access to vastly superior server quality.
---
Likely wouldn't take much either. Maybe cut a deal where Steam gets 10% of all microtransaction sales (including Fallout First memberships) or some bullshit like that. Not only would something like this make A LOT of people happy, and therefore more likely to both return to the game AND be willing to drop more money into the game (thus making both Steam and Bethesda more money) but it would also take quite a bit of the workload off of Bethesda's back in fixing/maintaining the servers. PC servers all get transferred to Console use (increasing performance for consoles and solving that problem too), and all Bethesda has to do is strike a deal and then figure out how to make the server thing happen in the code.
---
Full disclaimer, although it doesn't SOUND like it would be hard to integrate I do understand I might be underestimating the full complexity of the idea. At the same time though, I do believe it would be easier than integrating their own anti cheat that they have zero experience in themselves. I mean, you're going to Steam. Might as well take advantage of the perks steam is capable of offering.
---
the fallout 76 shit show is growing i feel like. this is very bad, i really hope they fix this
---
You can tell that straight to the guy who made the video and hacked those players; he's here on reddit and possibly having blast.
---
Wait, what? Stashes are personalized. How would that even work?
---
I have to work during Christmas and can't afford the luxury of staying home with my family on a "holiday break". Why should a multi million dollar company be given a pass, especially when this is supposed to be a live service game?
---
What a joke. This game, is a joke. I'm so sad that the fallout name has come to this hot shit garbage.
---
Like, how much more money and time does Bethesda need to fix this trash fire? There is no point in waiting for that mythical future.
---
I dunno man, Fallout was a much bigger IP than final fantasy. At least around my part of the world. The scale makes the difference here I think.
---
If we're talking about personal feelings, I personally feel like Fallout/elder scrolls were my favorite IPs of all time before 76 and now I don't believe anything Bethesda makes in the future is going to be worth much. It's a pretty big let down you know? Left a bad feeling in my mouth that is still there
---
That being said, I don't really participate in the hate train. I just sympathize with those people who do
---
You see the absolute state of the game and this sub when people blame the hacker instead of Bethesda's shitty, slow security measures.
---
This just happened to me. What now?
---
Psychos love watching the world burn, and if they are to scared to watch the real world burn, they’ll settle for a virtual one.
---
Yup, same.
---
Your idea seems kind of dumb and feels like it is implying that the hate for 76 isn't well deserved. While I'm sure plenty of people hating the game haven't played it, I don't think they need to. The reputation Bethesda has given themselves and the game is giving a very terrible impression of Fallout 76. 
---
And since they keep fucking up every other update these days on a catastrophic level I don't see how anyone would buy the game just to stir up drama when Bethesda is doing a lovely job creating its own.
---
Submit a ticket and pray Bethesda actually does something about it
---
I've been recommending this tactic to people myself, but majority doesn't read reddits and are being fucked right now
---
i wish they would give us fallout 4 to play when things like this happen
---
Same here. I'm playing since from BETA, but I can't risk all the stuff what I gathered so far.
---
I was a die-hard F76  fan till this, but now I really don't know what to say.  I'm going to cancel my F1st membership. :(
---
F76 has been fucked up, OWR Radio Christmas Stream also cancelled... this Xmas is so fucked up
---
You do know the SBQ is't the only activity you can do in game, right? There's actually a good amount of players that have decided this would be a good time to play with an alt, instead of sticking with their overpowered main.
---
They added it for endgame content. If we didn't have legendaries, this game would be dead because nobody has anything to work for.

---
The only thing you will be doing is being irresponsible.
---
It killed me at first. I loved this series, and I didn't want to believe Bethesda would take such a half ass, insulting approach to managing it, but now I'm enjoying watching Bethesda pay for it. You go ahead burn my guy.
---
That's unfortunate. I hope that some day you'll find the desire to be a better, kinder version of yourself.
---
I want to feel sorry for you but I cant shake this feeling that you are just trying to take advantage of the current events going on.  Trying to get stuff you never had maybe. 
---
Just a thought.
---
New player here! Have about an hour into it and excited to jump in. 
---
The player to player economy and the fact you can build a vendor or visit other people’s shop, get on reddit and buy guns and shit is the entire reason i want to get involved.
---
Non FO76 here, is the game usually stutter like that? Or is it just this video
---
Also: what a peace of shit
---
I wish Bethesda all the best without me. Not buying any more games from them, unless they come up with the perfect solution.
---
fyi, In China, biggest game company is Tencent. This Tencent company can actually bring police to hackers home and sue them for money, hackers also go to jail for years as hacking behavior violates company's rights and causing money loss.
---
Can someone please confirm if this hack is specific to PC only or ALL platforms? Thanks and Merry Christmas to all!
---
send me a friend invite my ign is garlandtd I do not run in teams because I use lone wanderer perk and I know how pvp team use the team option to kill people. BUT my wife and I run silos all the time as a pair without being in a team. since I do not take workshops anymore there is no reason I cant start having an active friend list again.
---
All they gotta do is look at you to do it. 
---
OP is right, there is no hope.
---
They already said they werent gonne make another online fallout before this was even released
---
Ahhh I see them now thanks!
---
For the record and for what it's worth, would not agree.
---
The Stash as far as we can tell is safe, but I'd still stick to private worlds
---
Thank you!
---
Look at the last year of this game.
---
Do they even deserve $13 more from you? No.
---
Great. Just bought it and installed it last night. Was pretty excited to finally try it. Oh well at least I only paid $10 for it. 
---
Question, can $10 worth of fun be had with it at least?
---
Honestly this is what people who are still playing this deserve. Like seriously you all whined about Fallout 1st but the day it came out the subreddit was filled with posts from people who bought it and were complaining about it. "Maybe if I keep throwing money at this dumpster fire it will improve! It certainly won't validate how Bethesda has treated this game and encourage them to keep putting out the bare minimum!" 
---
This subreddit is quite the serious case of Stockholm syndrome. Stop playing and supporting this game and wait for the next real Fallout game to come out if you really want to give Bethesda your money.
---
If people are duping 'for business' this latest hack is indeed very bad for business.
---
Besides 'dupers' are still people; most people do not enjoy seeing fellow humans suffer.
---
That’s what assumed but want to make sure! If u come back to PS4 I’ll help ya out!
---
Good of you to warn those that are on PC. Such a shame people feel the need to pull crap like this...
---
On a side note... Merry Christmas/Happy Chanukah/joyous holidays!
---
Its ironic but most dupers weren't duping to be malicious.  They were duping to give people what they want, godrolls without 1000 hour grinds.
---
A couple of people have said they have seen hackers on xbox, but i cant varify either way
---
Self hosted servers would be awesome, but then we'd have the risk of people screwing their accounts up away from the "security" (haha!) of Bethesda servers.
---
Best money i spent on this game, well worth it.
---
I think Fallout 1st or the Atom Store getting non cosmetic items were the biggest fuckups.
---
Ugh I got this game as a gift a year ago for my birthday with my gifter paying full price. It’s not a bad game. This is absolutely ridiculous...
---
Nuclear winter I think
---
Wanna read my review on steam to?
---
You don't own your copy, you are licensed to use it.  
---
I know, it's BS.
---
Funny, I can’t controller which is why I mouse and keyboard :)
---
Exactly what you said. The players is in Nuclear Winter mode.
---
He's going to nuke your stash! Just a joke.
---
Oh cool so it's not on console
---
I'm not the biggest fan of the game, but wishing ill on someone else for playing it is just toxic and shitty. Thankfully most of the people playing are better than that.
---
Get it! If ur on pc you have probably heard about all this cheat stuff that’s going on but with first you can chill in a completely solo server farm all you want have no junk weight in your stash and a free fast travel point to anywhere u like. I’d start with the one month subscription to see if you like the benefits first tho and then move to the 12 months once your convinced
---
You have to get attention. Bethesda says they can't give items back, but I've seen people who got their story to the top get their items back.
---
I know most won't agree but I'm with you here. Sure these hackers are assholes but that's everywhere in PC gaming, the problem is that Bethesda had no fucking plan to deal with this kind of thing whatsoever.
---
The things that led to this hack being possible seem to have been issues for months, if Bethesda hadn't sat by and let them go unresolved then this wouldn't be possible. The fact that they have no way to recover an account after their stuff was lost is laughable. Their complete bungle of private servers means there's no safe space to get away from these hackers without giving Bethesda even MORE of your money. For fucks sake their service doesn't even have two-factor authentication yet.
---
Yup!  It's an active and breathing world because of it. Other games are lifeless with the same sweat stick grinding boss battles over and over. This game gives so many opportunities for player to player interactions. Less of a grind, more of a cycle.
---
The joys of China.
---
No, bgs is. You're the naive fool still trying to get your money out of this while bgs spoon feeds you their crap.
---
One of the possum badges requires crafting 3 of them.
---
They are both cheering and asking for that script... People never change.
---
Yeah, it would be like blaming the rapist when, heck, the woman wore a short skirt.
---
Yup, you know something is wrong when people start downvoting facts that they see as opinions. I guess in a way we brought this to ourselves.
---
Thanks a lot mate.
---
And for how long did he say they should be paying for their actions?  You’re almost there!
---
Seems unlikely based on how stashes work but that is based on my limited knowledge.
---
Nothing, except the few that get their story on the top.
---
Or griping that they had to wait ten minutes to get to a live person and their time is incredibly valuable and they are in a rush... but saying that over and over and spending literally *another 15 minutes** complaining before they even get to the point... and it’s something that the automated system could have handled or even the free website/mobile app.
---
Just buy a month, why spend 100 bucks? This issue is definitely solved within a month, otherwise it's time to find another game.
---
There are many different mental illness. It's not right to gatekeep the term just because you suffer one.  Most have their damage.  Few admit it.  Fewer treat it.
---
I’ve been playing this game since beta. Absolutely love it. Still love it. But can’t justify continuing playing it. Which makes me sad. 
---
It’s like having an SO that continues to drink or use drugs. I can’t keep going down this path with BGS
---
People are free to say what they want, all you can do is not watch his video's if you don't like them.
---
I did get the year subscription and dont regret it.
---
Condemned meat more than likely. Have less children or feed them with healthy home made food from ingredients.
---
I do not care. And spread of negativity? The game is broken already and Bethesda dont give a shoe about it. I am victim as many of the other playes. Do You need screenshots that i lost items? Do you need screenshots when i posted and made ticket for the support? Before i post anything here? Shit. You just a cancer complaing my account. I have life and i dont give a shit about forum. I post something when i need to. Dont post something like this shit again to other people.
---
The hack went live in the middle of the night, on a Sunday, on a Holiday week.... For fuck sakes, you guys need to calm down and give it some time.
---
This culture of immediate action is bullshit... Things take time, even when shit sucks, it takes time and sometimes there's extra exceptions/stipulations to that rule.
---
I’m safe in my private world, shop will be fully stocked when I’m able to go back to public.
---
Maybe it’s a stunt to make people buy fallout first? 😂
---
The law in the US on who owns digital goods is completely unsettled. The EULA created by Bethesda certainly says that, but similar EULAs have had limited success in court. They have yet to be directly challenged and settled, though some courts have hinted that they might be invalid in part.
---
If I had to guess as to how digital goods ownership would be settled in court, it would probably be in favor of the users owning the goods that they've invested real time, money, and effort into earning.
---
I enjoy fallout 1st and get my monies worth
---
The warm welcoming community that was left after the initial launch ruins has long withered away with each passing day as Bethesda loses more and more goodwill. 
---
It was a small playerbase of dedicated people that really enjoyed the game and the optimism for it to get fixed later was strong. Whoever is left is completely numb to shit like this and in denial that Fallout 76 is genuinely a pile of shit now full of broken promises and a company that clearly doesn't care.   
---
76 is nearing maintenance mode, Wastelanders will be an underwhelming mess and they will just not bother anymore.
---
What an absolute fuckstick.
---
It’s for Metal Armor bud 🙃
---
It is, people have been having problems, if you look on trending it's a guy saying how he found out about them
---
At this point im just waiting for F76 to somehow make our consoles or PCs literally explode. How this game continues to out do itself is really astonishing. I've never seen anything like this. Its just amazing that a game is this bad and poorly run by a company. The people working on this game shouldnt even be allowed to work at a gamestop.
---
You do realize the spawner was real, right? That was last week. The same guy made this one.
---
FO76's beta was just a bad way to sell pre-orders. The game was as broken on release as it was in the beta.
---
Honestly if a person lost an Atomic Shop item who cares?  They can literally just build it again.  They've lost virtually nothing.  The people who farmed for legendaries who lost it are the ones truly hurting.
---
Someone didn’t even read my post lol
---
Yes yes! I wrote this to get some items! You are very wise man! Thank You sir for supporting me with the issue!
---
If I recall correctly it's for Metal Armor.
---
Impressive thank you for sharing
---
I left and haven't come back since Fallout 1st introduced, I even left the subreddit but check back every now and then to see what the next big fuckup is.
---
Such hostility. I just found it odd that this is your only post or comment on ANYTHING on reddit. 
---
If you have a life and don't care about forums why did you even come here today to begin with? Why make a reddit account at all?
---
Its actually these moments I wish I had an empty character slot. Alas all are filled, with everyone at least above level 100. Ironically my highest level isn't my main, but is the one I'm using right now. No armor, relying on cannibalism and the odd pond scum to replenish health, hunger, and thirst. I don't pick up any item save for aid or legendary items for scriping, both which I can afford to loose. 
---
Only weapon I use is knuckles which can be easily rebuilt using  a few steel should I need to. And while I can't do SBQ or go into nuke zones I can stand toe to toe against regular scorch beast and most other enemies, so long as their numbers are in check.
---
For whatever little consolation it may be worth, I admire your resilience dude. Ad Victoriam.
---
Don't have to, it's a big rant of nothingness due to this. Find something else to do that's actually constructive with your life....
---
Oh yeah remember back when fortnite almost sued a kid for aimbot
---
Well, he appears to be banned from there.  Sounds like a nice guy:
---
&gt; Offense: RMT, Duping and continuous scamming reports throughout the Reddit/Discord community. Creates ''clean accounts'' to act nice on. Acts all sweet when they private message users.
---
&gt; Info: They scam majority of the time through item for item trades (trading items for 0caps etc) They will make up some kind of sob story about themselves being scammed, do not be fooled by this.
---
A real hero, sticking it to the man.
---
And P.S. get out of here with your racist name, no one wants your kind anywhere
---
personally I will be playing the game in vanilla only from this point forward. BOS all the way all looted legendaries will be scrapped. I already tweaked my guy to be pretty good at running the silos with a basic .50 and non enhanced power armor. dupers, ebay sellers, and now this. nope legendaries are the root source of everything broken in this game. the whole market needs to burn. the game is better without legendaries anyway. I have had more fun today trying to figure out the way forward with vanilla gear than I have in 200 levels (level 380) and I am there. not only are solo silo runs viable theyre actually pretty easy with vanilla gear, not only can you kill the queen with a bunch of guys using non legendaries it wasnt terribly difficult. the battles were tougher but far from unwinnable. I am just one person but I wont be selling or buying legendaries any further. I would love to see our community shut down the legendary racket completely and join me but fat chance of that ever happening.
---
Each ticket has to be processed individually, you will just prevent legitimate tickets from getting the attention they deserve by filling out multiples.
---
They can modify the dll script easily so it can target player inventories, stashes or ventors. Only one at a time though. Stay away from adventure mode guys.
---
I see a lot of negativity under my post that wont help me. Questioning about my items, if i had it or not - write it to hunderds of other people who got f\*cked by the hacker. THX EVERYONE FOR SUPPORTING me with the issue! Thats why i do not post anything and not active on forums. To avoid people who have shit in brain.
---
U mean stadia
---
IMHO, early levels are harder.  Once you get into the upper 30s, it gets a lot easier.  
---
If you are under about L15, roam around in the forest get some Santas. 20's, hit the toxic valley, and the ash heap in the 30's.
---
Remember not all high levels are out to get you.  Most will help you if we can figure out what help you want/need.  To that end, if you have a mic, use it.  its a lot easier than trying to figure out emotes.
---
Idk but it can. Shows how secure our stuff really is....
---
Why even still play this game? Nothing is gettung better, anyone who still plays is an ooga booga
---
Press F for respecs  八(＾□＾\*)
---
What am I missing ? I just bought 76 yesterday what is First?
---
Should have delayed release by a year or two. Then sold us a more stable game with a CANVAS BAG to start with, can’t lie though I still enjoy the game.
---
No, Android😋
---
Pipboy comes back whenever you enter a new server.
---
I have to imagine they at least have to be on your friends list (with you having the friend join option disabled).  How else are they going to know what server to connect to?
---
Awesome, thanks very much!!
---
&gt; "all-hands-on-deck"
---
Software engineering doesn't work that way. For one thing, artists and level designers don't have the technical skills to work on this sort of stuff. But even if they just reallocated engineering folks, it would still take them time to get up to speed with the project, and the increased communication overhead would slow them down.
---
As a crass analogy, one cannot obtain a baby in 1 month by making 9 women pregnant. See [the mythical man-month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month) for a more extensive discussion.
---
&gt; You can’t get sued for hacking something you own.
---
You can get charged with a crime in many places if you make unauthorised changes to the data held on a server.
---
Which is exactly what this hack is.
---
Wow, you’re so toxic for no reason. If you had bothered to read you would’ve saw counter points to everything you said. But you’re a petty garbage person. Happy holidays.
---
You just commented that they can do it easily, now you can't say how. Either you know, or you don't.
---
One might say that it was rigged from the start
---
Facts?
---
Link pls
---
"free"
---
lol
---
Ya finished?
---
I wish I would have any #foreveralone
---
definitley got your loot stolen by another player. there has been an outbreak of hackers on pc
---
An extra 15 bucks a month for weightless junk storage and temporary private servers.
---
Aw, go cry somewhere else, the flooding of this sub by everyone else is enough.
---
Because Im not good at the game
---
no the recent hacking bit was committed by complete scum of the earth, just because someone leaves their door unlocked does not give you moral right to just go rob the bastard. the hackers have 100% of my wrath at this point in time. they are poo poo. the root of all of this lies with the existance of legendaries. its why people dupe hack cheat and breaks the helll out of pvp. I am full tilt boogy BOS now I will be burning every legendary I get. the game and community are better off without them.
---
Three words: Five...Hundred...Atoms
---
Alternatively: Light...Wood..Laminate
---
Ps4 - mine seem to be ok, but since I'm mainly hunting santas right now, I'm not using them full time - been burning off the obscene amount of 45 I have accumulated.
---
Thanks man, but I think I'm done with F76 unless Wastelanders turns out to be the gaming miracle of the decade
---
Oooooh true!
---
If you have pics or vids that would help confirm these claims.
---
I REALLY liked smoking but I had to quit because it was bad.
---
I have fun
---
dongyea
---
I've seen the glass dome structures come back 2 or 3 times now. They were back in the shop just a week or 2 ago. I'm sure itll be back again some time soon
---
Explain how enjoying doing this is a mental illness, though? I fail to see how immaturity can be categorized as that, but feel free to enlighten me. 🙂
---
u/TonyQuark  
---
Maybe add a comment players effected should try and record the exact Date, time (including zone) for the ticket...  
---
I know from some of the bug hunting work I've done with the community managers Bethesda can examine a character down to that info.
---
I'd hope they don't actually do it, it would suck for anyone that wants to play over the holidays, I've been playing everynight this week not noticed any issues yet
---
I absolutely LOVE my scrapbox. I could never go back to a regular stash.   So nice to be able to mod, upgrade, repair without having to worry about if I have enough junk.
---
I made reddit account last year, but i do not use my account. If you are interesing in my private life, i use instagram and Whatsapp daily. I am not forum person. Is this answer satisfying enough for you? 
---
Why did i came here? Maybe to ask someone if he had the same issue like me? And then i found out about hacker? I am so new to reddit that i don't even know how to see other post then this on the first page. 
---
I can't even understand why are you questioning my account? You don't like my nickname od profile picture i have? Really... its weird...
---
Still going strong in Chicago. Or I hope we do.
---
Only 5 luck ;)
---
Was the time you took to type this worth it? No one gives a shit. If we want to to play the game we will. So kindly take your opinion and leave, if I wanted it I would've asked.
---
I like it. I use the monthly Atoms to get seasonal stuff (not everything, just the stuff I like). The Riot Gear outfit is awesome. Also, easier to farm and do workshops in a private world. 
---
And now - with the hacking thing on PC (although I’m on console) - only FO1st is safe.
---
Reinstall, make an alt, live your virtual life to the fullest.
---
Nope your game is.
---
I'd hope that the remaining 35 players would be close enough by now to not do this to each other
---
Hackers can reportedly get into private servers, too. Just shut it all down, I say.
---
Thanks for the write up! I learned a bit more from it. 
---
Even if the Playstation gets hacked, surely the upcoming one would be fine, what with all the new hardware and software involved. I suppose that's the big upside to consoles being non-upgradable.
---
It cant, just the 3 star or less items werent deleted.
---
I said that I can't imagine how that can work that easily because the stash is supposed to be server sided. I know that the code can be easily modified like a switch to basically steal your inventory, stash or ventors stuff.
---
Nit just the hacking. But every update fixes nothing and add new bugs every time. How can Bethesda not fix their game yet?
---
It has been proven. Do not come back. Well, unless you don't care about your gear, in which case feel free!
---
Totally agree with you. I got one of the free beta keys and a couple of sessions was enough for me to pre-order (£30).  
---
It needed a *proper* beta. Call it early access or whatever, but it needed to be worked on, a lot. They totally screwed the release with silence and a lack of bug fixes.
---
True, most people are reluctant to change anything untik something bad actually happens
---
I already explained why I questioned it.
---
Yes. I just found out. And hundreds of players also. Its sad cause i use so many hours. But i am not the only one person.
---
The Scum bags responsible for this horseshit need to be outed, stopped, and prosecuted. It makes me wish that I never left the programming side 20+ years ago to pursue other things. I know virtually next to nothing of programming now other that the logic. I know a few people who were hackers back in the day; but none now. I think if a group could be convinced to hunt them down and hack them it would be sweet.
---
For now I gave up on 76. A few weeks already. I still have hope for wastelanders but it's a very cautious hope.
---
I have always liked the brother hood anyway its about time I start flying their banner. ad victoriam elder.
---
WHY DO PEOPLE CARE IF THEY'RE NOT PLAYING THE GAME &amp; THINK IT'S BROKEN?
---
You chose to reply was your reply worth it?
---
Well It's not really my game. But the fact that you come here to sht on people that actually play is kinda hilarious. How sad can your life be to think that this is a fun thing to do? Gtfo of here with this sht.
---
Thanks for the reply. About the same with me on your plans minus the grenade plans lol.
---
I came back to Wow to play warcraft classic. My character from fifth-teen YEARS ago was still sitting where I left it with all of its stuff like a single had past. Just saying that players should expect better from games.
---
War, war never changes.
---
That is just paranoid. It hasn't been fixed because it was brought to light in the worst time possible, holiday season. Much harder to get a patch out promptly. ((Completely intentionally on the hacker's part.))
---
Despite this though, the preliminary hack problem was MOSTLY patched out without days. During this holiday time where far fewer people are in the office. Showing that they definitely do care.
---
From a different angle, as well, things like this likely wouldn't do much to boost sales of 1st at all. Since I believe they still don't release those metrics, it's all assumption that they're selling more. What is more likely is more people are deciding "fuck it, I'm just going to wait until they get their shit together and play again when wastelanders drops." Which is a VERY bad thing for Bethesda, especially given all the problems. People are prone to getting fed up over less, just look at 76 during other controversies. People getting fed up and leaving might not come back in the same capacity as when they left. Possibly finding a new game they like more. Which means even less of a player base who is willing to spend money in the shop.
---
To play on your concluding statement? It's a double edged sword. "People aren't going to stop playing because of the hack if they stuck around for everything else."
---
What makes you say that, when the reverse is extremely likely as well? (And this is assuming they haven't been victim to the hack) This could be the straw that breaks the camels back for many, as it's something that is inexcusable to be in the game in the first place.
---
Now, let's say you ARE victim to the hack. Or your friend you play constantly with is. The entire holidays, likely into next year. Odds are, your stuff won't be restored until they're back in the office full swing (if it gets restored at all). That would be INCREDIBLY demoralizing, compounded onto everything else that has happened and all the news surrounding it just bringing you down more. Pretty low odds you'd want to keep playing after that. Hell, depending on who you are? You might just break down and cry if it's been a stressful enough holiday season for you.
---
The point I'm trying to make I guess, is that the potential for irreparable damage is far too great to take the risk of expecting more 1st memberships to be a thing (or to even last for that matter, if they are a thing). Even if more people are using 1st currently, the damage this will have on their image (is currently having, even), will cause them FAR more bad than it would good the longer it goes unfixed.
---
As a closing statement, consider also, how much extra it is costing them on support agents to deal with the increased workload from angry customers? Or the amount of extra work developers and contracted programmers have to do on top of their wastelanders and genetic bug fixing duties? 1st is a MONTHLY fee. I can assure you, many of their employees are getting paid more per day than 1st nets them per month. Even if you consider the number of memberships, its unlikely that even 15% increase in its sales (I feel 15% might even be generous here), would make enough profit to justify delaying fixes and increasing workload/problems.
---
Not that I am aware of.. which sucks lol !
---
oh also you should know I have made a couple smooth silo runs and smooth queen fights. 100% vanilla 100% mutation free. its not only playable without godroll weps its actually more fun for me. a little tougher and more engaging.
---
FYI, you can build anywhere that’s not a marked location on the map and isn’t slated for future events. It’s def worth trying!
---
I, for one, say good on them. Hack this game to pieces. Maybe this will finally light the fire under these clowns. This whole game is a disaster zone. Fix. Our. Shit. Bethesda. Please and thank you.
---
        Signed - a fallout fan
---
The guy from the vid in one of the comments said pretty much that you can edit the dll to target whatever you want. Only one at a time though. If you want, you can search for it in the comments of the vid.
---
Ok. Thanks for the reply. Guess I will just keep on grinding it out until the 31st.
---
You're clearly angry calm down and read my post again.
---
Welp, this is disappointing.  I've been hoarding gifts from the event to give out at my and other's camps tomorrow night.  Now, even if I date to do that, the servers will be largely deserted.  
---
I'm tempted to give up on PC and buy FO76 on PS4, but it would be weird to reward Bethesda for this fiasco.
---
Fugeddaboutit.
---
If you change your mind, the offer stands.
---
Not a bug, welcome to hackfest. Im sad to say this but someone just took your entire inventory.
---
I gave you my answer. 
---
And if you still do no not trust me, i made a ticket 14:50 before i found out it was hacker and made a post about it. But really... i do not care about if you trust me or not. My job is to wait until Bethesda fix this damn thing and will give me items back. Closed
---
&gt;Nobody called me out on it
---
Must be because you didn't post it on the Nicest Community on the Internet™
---
Pc?
---
It's not a bug. You got hacked, like many of us. Checked the hot posts on this sub.
---
I’m pretty sure they’re on Christmas break. That’s why they said last weeks ITV was the last of the year. I doubt a dev would reply on Reddit to issues without discussing them with the FO76 team first.
---
Of course not, but just because something is on the internet doesn't mean it's *not* true.
---
Lmao yeah it was. Stop being a cynical negative piece of shit no one cares about your hate comments.
---
It's not a bug. Your items were stolen by a hacker. Submit a ticket with Bethesda support and avoid playing in public servers until the exploit gets patched
---
Do IT support have the authority to take the servers down?
---
I wouldnt have thought so, as far as im aware you have to be in render distance of a hacker for them to take your stuff
---
Juicehead youtube video said that they can take what you've picked up in NW, but that would only impact that one match...
---
?? That doesn’t make any sense
---
Here is the comment. https://imgur.com/gallery/BKM4NLu
---
May i know how to avoid to play in Public Sever?
---
You have the eggs that we dont have, we cant stop playing since we expect something from Bethesda.. sadly its not happening, no more.
---
Thanks for your step forward, and I feel really sorry about your stuff, hope you really find a better game.
---
Titles cant be edited, i mentioned it was PC in the descriotion but if people cant be bothered to read then theres not much more i can do
---
Yeah, I saw that but he could just be saying that, why didn't he showcase it then? This hack is causing mass hysteria and adding that on top of already stealing inventories could heighten the fear. I'm not saying he is wrong but if it's true...why hasn't it been shown yet? If I were the hackers, I'd be stealing the stashes, not the inventory.
---
They have fixed alot of things and broken things as well. completely not related to how bad the hackers are. I blame them for as much if not more than anything beth has ever done.
---
Thanks for the reply. The mounted heads are fairly easy to get for the most part. Only a few seem to be harder to get. Not a lot of people getting multiples of the gorilla head, frog, or moth man that I know of.
---
Bethesda should at least consider locking the door though.
---
Why do you come here being an asshole?
---
Different questions, same answer.
---
&gt; they just need to make them all private.
---
Thus multiplying Bethedsa's server bill by 24.  That would be unsustainable.
---
They could warn players that they are at risk using base game adventure mode. It's not too much to ask for a tweet or a blog post.
---
Fearmongering post. People, dont react to this.  No karma, no post history.  No op replies. 
---
If it happens to you please report it properly to Bethesda.  We all know its going on, but posts like this are trying to add to the pile and spread awareness on their anti-bethesda attack campaign.  Dont feed into it.
---
Yes
---
Him along with the 5 others who write hate posts on the subreddit each day. I’m almost convinced it’s the same person with multiple account seeing as they all sound the exact same. “Your game is dead” “Enjoy your shit game” lol get a life...
---
Pay for Fallout1st or search a friend with it, if not.. well. Play Tetris
---
Well apparently you do because you chose to reply again.
---
agreed totally. losing my stuff stung like a mofo.
---
I like that explosive SMG...
---
A lot of it depends on your build.  For example, by the numbers on the grognaks, I can tell you are not a melee build.  Any Gragnak gives me somewhere around 160 without chems or food.
---
The furious gatling is nice, and the AA stuff is good against both bots and things that fly, especially strategic vertibirds and cagrobots.  
---
If you don't have a troubleshooters (any weapon)....those are useful in a silo run :)
---
Very cool info. thanks will try that tonight when I get home from work.
---
Yeah have a long vacation from work, was hoping to grind for some Christmas plans. Now that's a bust. Got nothing from this event lol.
---
Care to elaborate?
---
I know loads of people who pkay without mods on this, myself included, but also no it wouldnt fix it as the hack can also be used in nuclear winter, only thats not much of an issue since your not attached to that gear
---
I can attest to this; you can do most things buck naked. Low level areas are highly doable bare knuckles, with higher level ones requiring at most the actual Knuckles weapon. Mod it for more damage, but even unmodded can take out most things. You'll run through its durability quickly, but instead of repair just make a new one since they only require 17 steel at level 50.
---
Ok thanks
---
Are you new to this sub? Hating on Bethesda counts for at least half the posts here. And every single Tuesday without fail it’s the vast majority of the posts. 
---
Most of them consist of people who have been playing longer than the game existed, and are uninstalling the game for the 200th time. Every time it’s “This is the last straw, I’m leaving this game!” And “This game is totally broken!”
---
Now this hack is bad, but I’ve only seen one video to date, and we don’t know if it’s even real. It could be and Bethesda should patch this right away if it is. But there’s been people saying it’s across all platforms, basically lying, and trying to stir the pot. 
---
So yeah a lot of misinformation is getting spread about this mostly from trolls who already have a boner against Bethesda.
---
So, taking the rage this sub is directing as a cue that Bethesda is in trouble is kinda nonsense. Because this sub loves to rage hate on this game.
---
I didn’t say action will be made. Just laws exists when a conflict arise between states and they are applied if needed
---
Just cancel the game. Rerelease it FF14 style as a Single Player with Co-op game.
---
When you guys post this stuff, can you please specifically add that its pc only thats getting screwed in the title somewhere? No need to start console hysteria over nothing.
---
there is footage of someone doing this or being the victim?
---
Dude this is a calculated anti-bethesda campaign by the hackers. It happens in other games. And its monday morning for crying out loud. They obviously know about it.
---
Please stop feeding into this propaganda. Put the game down till it's fixed and move on. This is an organized and targeted attack.  Not a shame-on-Bethesda situation.
---
I'm not angry. I just can't understand what's the reason of coming here with that attitude. No reason to sht on people that play something you don't like. It's their choice. And to answer your question, I play because its a fallout game, that I can play online with my friends, do events, kill stuff and get new gear. Yes it has issues. A LOT. But I still have fun playing. Nothing wrong with liking something that you dont like.
---
That's not "cold", that's just the limit between fun and toxicity. To me, the stealing hack was made to force dev' to rethink their work before ruining the game. Sometime blowing a bomb is the only way for some people to understand how at risk they are.
---
Can I have some recommendations on “good games?” I’m curious what qualifies as a good game to you. Or are you just here to be an ass?
---
I am just a new join of reddit for fallout76 only, this is the first time i face this kind of issue man
---
heaven forbid someone like a game you don't like am i right.
---
Sending Bethesda the list means they might be able to get the people stealing stuff.
---
As for the backups, they need to use them, but from the conversation I've had with CS reps, the backups aren't always up to date. Some are a week or two behind. But it's better than nothing.
---
Lol, the irony.
---
Tha I you I'm so dumb lmao
---
Not really no. Your logic is terrible. A reply doesn't meant something is wanted, it means I'm proving a point.
---
Its not my fault I had to resort to stealing other people's stuff. Bethesda have been screwing us since release and this is the most fun I've had with this game with this "feature".
---
Thank you!!
---
Complete waste of money, save it for a game that’s actually good.
---
That's possible. Truth is we will never know. I'm not about to download and check the code of this stuff. But my guess why he didn't use that was to get an instant reaction out of the people he rob. I have seen similar stuff in other games.
---
Then report it to Bethesda. It's a hack going around. This post does nothing but allow media to spread more of the hackers propaganda. 
---
Do the right thing, delete this post, and report it to Bethesda.
---
I played and enjoyed FO76 but I realize what a mess the game is. I’m not blindly buying Bethesda games going forward, they have to earn back trust and I believe a lot of people feel the same way.
---
Happy hacking day. If you were informing yourself, on discord and this reddit, everyone is talking about the inventory stealing hack that launch few days ago. Hackers don't need to be near you to do that.
---
The only safe way to play on pc is currently with gear you don't mind to loose, or on private server.
---
Maybe Bathesda should stop giving him so many excuses to make videos.
---
Makes me regret not holding onto any "You have been insulted!" papers, as those would definitely "spice" up your package. Cause its salt.
---
Nah I'm genuinely curious why do you still play this game. I don't wish this kind of game on anyone. Why do you think I'm trolling?
---
Well Bethesda did tell us other players would take the rolls of NPCS, guess we got quite a few raiders now stealing from the innocent.
---
because i give a shit about the thematic universe and story, and i want to enjoy the game but it's not possible in it's current state
---
The ebay sales on weapons will go up after this. Scum stealing from people to make money off of another version of scum.
---
What point exactly?
---
Not to mention half of his videos don’t come out until the problem has already been fixed by the devs 😂
---
Is this happening on Xbox as well? I’m afraid to play today. I’ve been a devoted player since it’s release but I can’t look past this. This is too much.
---
The next week or two are going to be pretty entertaining as well, I'd wager. Can you imagine what will happen when Bethesda finally chirps up and admits there is no way to get back anyone's gear? (I don't know if that will happen but given the game's track record I feel it is a solid bet.)
---
You're welcome
---
the way Bethesda does things is so utterly stupid! I've played many games where I get to pick the server I play on and almost always able to get back on the same server again even after a crash. Not to mention renting servers that I have full control over, not this stupid Fallout fist crap! With almost no control at all.
---
Glad I’m on PS4.
---
lol let me know if you find a lawyer that is dumb enough to take that case.
---
&gt;He has so many people on the Fallout hate train, so many of them who have never even touched the game. 
---
This is an odd complaint to be making at time like this. Maybe they should purchase the PC version and experience how "great" it is for themselves? 
---
I don't get why you care how he makes money anyway. The endless bugs and Bethesda's constant mishaps are factual and widely reported elsewhere, so it doesn't matter if he plays the game or not.
---
you dont realize that there are people that like the game? that don't spend a peny in the atom store?
---
is that hard? just because you don't like it deserves to burn in hell? 
---
who the fk are u? god?
---
let it be, if you dont like the game it's ok and if someone like the game it's ok too
---
don't come here everyday to say how much you dislike the game, do something better with ur time
---
Whaaaat
---
Theres a notable difference between this hack and all the previous ones, all other hacks have just been to get yourself some items or do some stupid stuff, this latest hack is the first one that actually negatively effects other players and seems to have been created for the sole purpose of being as irritating as possible
---
Now if only that'd get used when it comes to online video games.
---
&gt;..even if it is on 76.
---
Nice
---
Good looking out, thank you!
---
Uninstall
---
The
---
Game
---
If you're console, go for it.  Fun as hell and worth it in Atoms.
---
PC?  Don't. Game is top target for hackers cause they get off on anti-Bethesda news.
---
I was dubious too, but there's a post right above this one of a guy looting hundreds of characters, and pissed off people in the comments saying it was them.
---
Sure it could be a hoax.... But not likely at this point.
---
you are absolutely oblivious. it is happening as there is also a video of a guy doing it.

I’m a game design student fairly close to the studio location that works on fallout 76. A member of their team is the father of a close friend and I had a brief conversation with him about the state of fallout 76. They know it’s a mess, and they won’t do much to fix it.
---
Maybe Bethesda released the "hack" to encourage more to purchase Fallout 1st?   Hmmmmmm.......
---
Guess I'll be playing COD over the holidays.
---
That hate comments like this are nothing but dumb pathetic attempts at trying to grab upvotes. If you don't like the game don't play it but talking shit and being an idiot isn't needed
---
He may well blame women's dress for assault.
---
Not bethesdas fault. This was a planned and well organized attack to spread more negative Bethesda propaganda. This can (and has) happen to any game.
---
Funny part is the dupers were using a hack just two weeks ago that was created by the very same person who created this hack.  Dupers are a part of the problem with the overall hacking in the game and any way you slice it, duping is cheating.
---
I
---
Already
---
Did
---
Yeah dude, totally the same thing.
---
Always nice when the most challenging end game activity is to get Bethesda Customer Support to do its job.
---
I appreciate you. 
---
I haven’t been able to play since my wife and I moved, and all we have is satellite internet (can’t support online gaming), but there’s nothing enticing me to try.
---
It’s easy to tell who’s not a regular in this community... Lol
---
I didn’t go as far as uninstalling, but I haven’t fired it up since 1st went up and I don’t see anything in the near future bringing me back.
---
What I do see is a ton of little things pushing me still further away.
---
Yes, go ahead, support this joke of a company that literally attempted to scam everyone who preordered the collectors edition.
---
Just need to be in render distance and your character acts like a container. No need for trade. Sad.
---
A very simple solution in the interim is for Bethesda to lock adventure mode on PC and give a free 1-week trial of fallout 1st. That'll probably even make them money- once the dust settles and everything is fixed, people might miss that scrap box and tent. 
---
However, I think the appropriate action for us as a player base is to put the videogame down and spend time with family and friends. No matter what 'hack' is going on, the option to not log in and experience it is always there.
---
Always blaming the company and not the human ¥#€! stains that are perpetrating the crimes. Like blaming Remington for someone being shot. I can agree that Bethesda needs better security but I have to say I want the fallout franchise to succeed, I want Bethesda to succeed, technically they hackers need it to succeed for their venture to pay out for them. Unless they are working for the competition, which I wouldn’t put out of the realm of possibility either. 
---
Anyway you slice it though, these hackers are filth and donkey *#%¥ of the highest caliber. They want to power and will do whatever it takes, if innocent people are hurt in the process they consider that ok. They don’t give a #%£! about anyone but themselves.
---
Seems like it's only gear on your character. I'm half tempted to dump everything in stash and try to find and report some of these fuckers.
---
Hackers can get into private worlds.
---
They don't just want to cause chaos; they want to *destroy* the game. That's the plan. Hack everyone, get people to migrate to private servers, then hit the people on the private servers. That will be the final nail in the coffin.
---
Don't do it. There are plenty of other great games to play.
---
I am glad that you agree.
---
Why
---
Do
---
You
---
Care
---
So
---
Much ?
---
&gt; This is an organized and targeted attack. Not a shame-on-Bethesda situation. 
---
Why can't it be both?
---
Im pretty sure if the hackers were nice bethesda would lose their shit
---
I will try, but i dont know any of such ppl well. The hack can be used by any1...
---
Ok weeb
---
😂Indeed! +1
---
The amount of inexplicably bad behavior from Bethesda and the fans/player who keep feeding and allowing them to make mistakes and continue sketchy practices.
---
Sorry dude. I'm sorry you like this game, and for anybody else for that matter and the mistakes you're enduring. 
---
Honestly though, you reap what you sow.
---
I have a sneaky suspicion that the group responsible for this is the same group that was investigating dupe methods, and got banned by bethesda for their troubles.  It was probably a bad move to piss off the white hats.
---
bc multi million company have regular hours and breaks on festivities?
---
if you work in holidays, you are getting the big check or you don't have another way to earn money, your choice man
---
yea. after that they wrote a script that would give you your pipboy on login.
---
4. Stop moaning and treat Fallout 76 like an actual survival game. Play an alt you can afford to loose stuff from, or stuff your box with anything you wouldn't want taken and dump out or give away anything disposable.
---
5. Private server. Not my favorite approach, since you'll have to be Fallout 1st, but its still an option.
---
A game that isn't a cashgrab riddled with bugs. Meaning the complete opposite of fo76.
---
I agree.  The key takeaway from that reply is that *customer support* doesn't have the tools to restore lost items;  it doesn't say that other areas in the company can't.  I worked customer service for many, many years and this is a common method to keep upper level support from being overwhelmed.  The majority of people will be like "damn that really sucks" and move on; but when people really pushed the issue we would escalate it to the next level.
---
They’re on Christmas break ya asshat. Imagine if you were the dev in charge of posting on Reddit. Without communicating and troubleshooting with your team prior, how are you going to reply to people on Reddit with a direct answer? The best you could say is probably, “Thanks for letting us know”
---
They were never white hats...promise.
---
Servers will go down for 5 hours and the home screen will now feature a message.  “Please stop hacking.”
---
Hackers are a bitch
---
I'm not here just to be an ass I pity the people who bought this game expecting something good only to be betrayed again again and again.
---
Except if the hacker is on your friends list they can access your private server (am I right). And we have already established that they are human filth who would #€£% their own moms. 
---
Just wanted to get that off my chest... lol
---
You do know that there’s always been exploits to get free atom shop items from people right? A few have even been fixed by bethesda
---
Ok grey hats then. Nothing worse than a hacker scorned.
---
That
---
Also
---
Works
---
Consoles exist my dude. Still perfectly playable.
---
I don't blame you. It sounds like you've put a lot of work in, to lose it to a hacker is just plain wrong.
---
Same here, i love Bethesda games enough that I haven’t uninstalled 76 yet. I’m hoping a miracle happens and suddenly the games worthwhile again. However, they seem to be doing more for the opposite which is pretty disappointing.
---
They can hack your stash, too.
---
Do not log in. Your shit will get stolen.
---
Bethesda's probably weighing the pros and cons of fixing this... 
---
"Well, if people wanna avoid this, they're gonna have to buy a Fallout First subscription. Not sayin' we don't fix it eventually... but maybe we enjoy Christmas, have a happy New Year... and then come back with shocked pikachu face in January, when all of our hardcore players either lost everything or are safely paying us more money."
---
I quit playing about 6 months ago, and feel so glad for that now knowing all my hard work would have been for naught if I got grieved this way.
---
  PS4 - I have gotten multiples of all the more common mounted heads...about 20 prime receiver plans....
---
So far, only 1 each of 5 of the "rare" mounted heads, and neither of the two xmas plans.
---
Put your santatron behind walls and a roof - no doors/windows.
---
  Put on your excavator and loot everything while hunting santas.  Find a vendor, equip hard bargain3, grape mentats, and any booze that boosts charisma.  Sell everything, then buy large and medium wrapping paper.
---
BTW, a good percentage of the caps from buying wrapping paper goes back into the vendor cap pool, so you can get more than 1400 caps/day.  
---
Repeat the process.  Find a tinker bench, equip the chemist perk, and craft 2x presents for each paper you bought.
---
I guarantee you they have someone in office, every single company of that size has minimum manning coverage.
---
Ah ic. Yea sounds totally worth it lol. I just got the game yesterday and already am thinking it was a waste of money. Didn't play very much tho does it get better after the first hour or no? Was expecting it to be like FO4 but not so much so far...
---
He is angry and not thinking rationally. That does not make him insane. Anger, even extreme anger is normal in situations like this.
---
These options are fine ways to avoid the hackers. But will solve nothing and not be enjoyable in the least bit. I like to play games the way I want, not be forced to play in a way that keeps my account safe. Why even have my good weapons and armor if I can’t use them with peace of mind. Anybody who continues to play, is enabling BGS (like enabling a drug user)
---
It's cute how passionate you are for someone who claims they don't care.
---
That has nothing to do with rockstar or epic. That is due to DDOS and hacking GAMBLING sites. Nothing in that has anything to do with hacking games.
---
so are you gonna comment this under every post? 
---
or only the ones that have no karma? because apparently that determines whether someone is serious or not
---
Lol, made me snort!!! +1
---
We’re not disillusioned. We don’t need someone who doesn’t play the game to tell us about the state of the game lol. Why haven’t you given me a good game recommendation? I want a live service mmo FPS survival game. Please guide me in your knowledgeable gaming direction as to what would be a good game.
---
Absolutely Bethesdas fault, hacking and duping has been allowed to run rampant.
---
Place collectron in a walled 1 square room then edit to enter to get you items... works perfect
---
How can it be at this point?  It just started. Maybe if friday rolls along and it's still happening, then yeah.
---
I suppose if you unfriend everybody from your list, go to a private server and choose "Team only" option then you are safe to play.
---
Im in agreement with your overall sentiment. But 76 development started like 11 years ago so as far as choosing an outdated engine goes, it was the newest engine available at the time. I think the reason why they have so many issues with patches and updates stems from the fact that they scraped huge chunks of the code present in Fallout 4 and stitched in code from Quake in order to create a multiplayer version. Most people don't seem to know that 76 was developed in parallel with fallout 4 as its initial start was exploring what it would take to give Fallout 4 a co-op mode
---
You really think I'm a troll fishing for upvotes not seeing the state you're game is in. You're like a climate denier standing in a snowstorm during summer.
---
Would love to see Beth implement a Krampus that visits everyone who stole from another's Santatron... He could come in and sack you up, take you to some random location, stash your gear somewhere, and leave you naked but overweighted with coal, to suffer a journey of "redemption"... But that would be too much for this game at the moment, and they got bigger fish to fry once they get back from break.
---
Are you sure that you Would rater get threatened and robbed at knife or gunpoint irl instead of loosing some code in a game? 
---
I don’t really think so if you’ve ever been there...
---
Kay
---
You finally answered my question was it that hard?
---
Racist surname and slurs, reported
---
How does anyone still play this game? Are you brain damaged?
---
You know what also feels great? Proper grammar.
---
I disagree, it just changes the game. We could be striving to build communities that we tell collaborative stories in instead of aimlessly pulling the loot lever hoping for the perfect drop.
---
I mean eventually you get all the legendaries you are after and it's the same problem anyway.
---
GG kick 'em while they're down.
---
It's not loaded in. It doesn't exist until you're in. Why do you think it takes so long for your inventory to appear after first connecting to a server? Why does your pip boy freeze up as blank for so long? Why you hear your items being equipped/unequipped? To steal your items while you're offline, they would have to fake you being online, and while bethesda already did leak private info earlier this year, I don't think bethesda.net passwords were a part of it
---
Absolute U N I T 
---
How does he have the space for 500 inventories? Is there a space limit?
---
Sooo which game..? Probably not any live service game. Or online for that matter. You act like people are forced to spend money on stupid shit like atoms and private servers. Want to hear something crazy? If you don’t want to buy something, you don’t have to! It’s amazing.
---
Probably not but they can phone someone who can.
---
Or on a botched Wastelanders release they are done
---
Cheers mate, good advice, on it now. Happy Holidaymas to you and yours 👍🏻
---
&gt;not thinking rationally 
---
... you are a lost cause
---
I think he's still salty that he doesn't get invited to events from creators, or treated like the game journalist he thinks he is.
---
🙄
---
Someone is mad, really. Have you stepped back and watch what a literally shit show FO76 is? It is so bad that is funny. And having these crap happening makes it good. Basically this kind of crap is what makes it still relevant nowadays. Noone in their complete sense would play this game a year after its release and its actual state, if not for actual try to have some fn out of it, and it seems the only way to have fun is to fuck with the devs and players.
---
I mght get cancer, but at least im not playing the shitty game xD
---
Buy
---
Skyrim
---
Now
---
I think if the game came out this year we would be in a better place stability and content wise. But unless they literally did any of the basics to moderate the multiplayer. We would be in the same crash and burn next christmas. Their lack of communication and response time is really a spit to the face. We certainly should have expected it but it doesn't make it feel any better.  Even if they did its too late now. This one is enough to tank the game. Hundreds of people that don't browse the web or group are getting all their years work stripped. Unless we get a game wide roll back which probably isnt even possible. Its going to tank the economy and kill the drive of many of the people who will still play. Wastelanders use to be the string we grabbed our dear life for. But without the amazing community of the game bethesda cant keep squeezing the cash out of us. Its one thing to make your character headless for a month every time you come out of power armor. But to lose a years worth of work  with no help.  That will shatter whats left of the pc community. 
---
 Its amazing how they have time for twitch bundles but not even a tweet.
---
We need a FF Reborn kind of situation.
---
I'd suggest DayZ, but don't. 
---
Seriously, don't.
---
I love it, but it hurts so bad.
---
Sue him for what? Nothing he is doing is against the law, just their TOS.
---
If you're a new player you're pretty safe - you won't have any items/weapons that are worth taking or that aren't easily replaceable. It's only for people in the end game who have rare items that need be concerned.
---
Jim Sterling is that you ?
---
BGS should be investigated for releasing such a pos game.
---
Yeah I’ve seen tons of posts since your original one. That’s terrible. I hate the exploit potentials on PC. I bet it’s the same trolls on this subreddit.
---
Its ok if your playing with friends, but overall I am not the biggest 76 fan. Worst of the fallout games I have played yet. I was hoping Wastelanders would go some way to fixing that but it's still away off.
---
Where did you get that information stop putting words in my mouth. Do you seriously need help finding a good game?
---
If they were smart this would even be a good business move. Give folks "two free weeks of Fallout 1st" as a taste, I bet a good 10% of those folks will convert to paying customers.
---
I'm relatively new to FO76 and really don't get it. The PC code is just terrible; bad performance, massive bugs, insecure by design. Not sure why anyone would pay for something this shoddy. But folks here sincerely like the game and I have some friends who do too, so I keep looking for the silver lining. Not now though, now I can't play.
---
The game is a service with users on regardless of time zone, country, or culture. Any company worth their shit would have a community response saying that they were looking into it within hours.
---
I don't really care if you are. Majority of the hate is so why would you be any different. Have you ever played the game? I've personally encountered one glitch in almost 800 hours, re entering a workbench after leaving it.
---
While I am patiently waiting on a wastelanders release and do hope it's amazing and mind blowing, I won't be playing if hacks and cheats like this are available.
---
I will say this, someone I know, who knows these shady fucks showed me his correspondence with one of them, and how he told them off  and the dude said....
---
This is nothing. Just wait till you see what's coming pretty much.
---
This game is boned. I think we've officially hit a place where Internet Historian has enough material for a new video. I've pretty much played my fill of the game, the only thing I liked about it was the world design, honestly. Now that I've seen everything I'm happy to let this Frankenstein piece of crap die.
---
Imagine if this was on pc
---
Pretty sure 76's development started around 2010 in parallel with Fallout 4. I dont think they spent 9 years rushing to get out before RDR2
---
Mine got burgled before I chased the guy across 3 severs and shot him in the face followed by an Xbox message telling him he was the grinch
---
This is Bathesda and fallout 1st subscribers getting what they deserve. I feel sorry for the others though.
---
What part of that isn't true? People have been hacking the shit out of NW for months And dupings been in the game from day one.
---
Some people eat lead as children.  They grow up to buy every new Bethesda product.
---
A Santatron which is as safe as his other stuff. In other words it's not safe.
---
This guy looks like the biggest fucking loser I’ve ever seen... I feel awful to anybody who had their stuff stolen that’s not cool or in any way funny
---
Do you know how many burner accounts people have. Duppers buy them wholesale on internet sites for 5 bucks a pop. For the cost of a movie night with your gf you can get a dozen accounts. They can ban an ip but that is minimal. They need to address the hack. Stopping one guy is like farting in the wind of a fire.
---
&gt; I don't know why these people have such a vendetta against Fallout 76
---
Maybe they see BGS trying to half-ass their way into the online marked and are going to teach them a lesson.  Shame the players are the ones paying for it though.
---
The engine IS the problem here, though. Creation was never designed for an MMO. So much of the code is clientside that hacking like this is easy, which was warned by major modders when the game released. Now here we are.
---
Not may, they can 100% sue for damages if nothing else. I feel like an internal hack can potentially lead to some kind of a security charge too though
---
I dont agree. The moment people are able to hack in weapons and sell them the economy goes down the drain.
---
Why would anyone try to farm for nice legendaries when dudes create them in minutes.
---
Immaturity is a very liberally regurgitated term used to categorize bad behavior. You may may fail to see the difference because the difference is minimized. Anxiety and depression both can create strong experiences with schadenfreude. We're talking about schadenfreude here and when you have individual's who have frequent and sometimes voracious desires to experience it it's usually due to anxiety, depression, or antisocial personality disorder.
---
That’s some weirdness in your Xbox settings, if you have previously used headphones like turtle beach or something, your best bet is a quick google search to get you to the right settings menu
---
lmao "this is the worst gaming experience ive ever had" and spent 1000 hours farming. hyperbole much?
---
Ah fair enough.
---
Yep my guess is someone waited until Bethesda went on holiday break before starting this bs just to start a bad media buzz yet again because they wanted more views on YouTube.
---
If you guys have 1st grab friends who don't and take them into private worlds that's about all you can do for now
---
That's....not at ALL how situations like this are handled
---
Actually legally it does matter, one is breaking and entering, the other is simple trespassing. Say I am walking along and find your house and the door is missing or opened up and i go inside. At most I'd be charged with is misdemeanor trespassing. If I broke the door or window then it would be felony b and e.
---
So no, the security or complete lack of security absolutely matters morally and legally.
---
Maybe because I’m still waiting on a “good game” recommendation from you on your other hate post from 10 minutes ago. You still haven’t came up with any. All you said was any game that isn’t a cash grab. So maybe Bubsy 3D or what? I want a live service mmo FPS survival game. Please direct me. I’m waiting lol
---
You are different than the OP you're still trying by the sounds of it and I get that your frustrated. My comment was directed at people who gave up a long time ago and refuse to move on and try to persuade others to do the same.
---
It is, but some of them are going to be stupid enough to use their main accounts.
---
I don't know if Bethesda can do hardware bans, or not either. But anything is better than nothing.
---
So glad I stopped playing this on going trash fire.
---
The hack has been live for 8 hours on a live action game. The lack of response is pretty goddamn inexcusable.
---
Frankly I’ve always thought we should have a survival mode with no legendaries and no mutations.
---
My check ain't big at all, though I do agree with the choice component as I can always walk away or find another position. My point was the world just doesn't stop during the holidays, and neither should a company running a live service game meant to be on nearly 24/7.
---
No worries, you can pick both up real cheap now too. They don't look as pretty as modern fallout games but damn the stories, characters and factions are brilliant.
---
Remind me to never cross you! 🤣🤣🤣
---
When the same bugs, glitches and "features" have existed across 3 different games development, it's time to take a step back and reassess things.
---
That’s how I imagine it but double bladed
---
Only seen 1 person online today and he was in a private server that was unjoinable. Give a round of applause to bethesda everyone, for allowing this to happen. The griefers etc finally acheived what they wanted to
---
Hmm what about rust, ark and the already mentioned dayz. Well that was hard *sigh*
---
I didn't make it but you're welcome! Some where in there it's got the credit for the guy who made it lol
---
Way too many servers, not enough trusted people
---
Again I'm not hating
---
My point is that its really easy to prevent this. If you think that consoles are exception, you are a fool. Hacks and cheats have been possible in consoles since forever, and, even in this post, you have comments saying they've been affected on console.
---
"Thank you for bringing this to our attention. We are looking into the issue and will let you all know as soon as we have more information and potentially a fix." That is all it takes. Acknowledge they know about the bug and that they are looking into it. Better than sticking their heads in the sand and leaving the playerbase in the dark like always.
---
I commend the people who have continued to play this game well after I have stopped playing and uninstalled. They seemingly have a much greater love for the game than myself... they seem to have much greater patience for the bugs and glitches which have both come and gone and those which have persisted... they have a much stronger will to accept the pricing models and practices Bethesda has introduced than myself.
---
I am also bewildered by those that continue to insist on publicly berating the same said players for sticking with the game. I have difficulty understanding the emotional need to come on a FO76 reddit (or message board) and slam those who still play the game. It's one thing to have negative opinions about those who still play the game... it is much different (and socially worse) to follow through on feeling the need to lash out at them publicly and then, seemingly, exhibit glee at their misfortune. 
---
Although i can't identify it, this type of behavior strikes me as anti-normative and, possibly, tied to feelings of insecurity... but I only speculate.
---
No, but your friend who left his TV in your back seat can surely be pissed at you for not locking your damn car!
---
I think that's a very solid start, but it's not going to get at the root of the problem, it's solving a symptom. They need bug fixes, they need better QA testing, and they need to fix this on their end ASAP.
---
Now, all that said, I think having moderators is a great idea. Having a live person to contact when things go awry would cut down on a lot of tickets and can be immediately(ish) addressed. (Personally I'd also like to see more Event Managers too - implement more events for the holidays or special in-game/off-game dates.)
---
This is a Christmas gift to nobody.  Nobody benefits from not having a good game to play.  We all wish for game studios to succeed, not fail.  More studios succeeding = more good games for us, and vice versa.
---
Listen, MAYBE I could forgive the npc thing although it's still unexceptable, but the loss of inventory gear? That shit is simply malicious. I just can't get my head around it all, the aim bots and now this?
---
&gt; Why would you need to do that? It'd be far easier to just restore from backups from the day prior to the hack going live.
---
You know, I'm kind of wondering if they even keep proper backups to do a rollback. Like yeah, it's obvious to do so in an online game, but it's also Bethesda.
---
Alright, i will try that. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
Why punish the players for ‘supporting bethesda’? Many people have only paid for the base game, and that is it. Hardly supporting them.
---
Why?
---
Obviously, that’s why I’m asking you. According to you, it’s probably the only reason one would “Keep torturing themselves” with this game, right? You seem to have a wide plethora of good games to recommend, no?
---
No they won't. He isn't doing anything illegal. Just go look at the GTA online hacker who rockstar tried to sue. He walked on hacking it and fortnite without any issues.
---
The only thing he got hit for was DDOSing Which is illegal, and hacking gambling sites that handle real money. Hacking inside a game is completely legal.
---
&gt; "staying quiet".... The hack went live in the middle of the night, on a Sunday, on a Holiday week.... For fuck sakes, you guys need to calm down and give it some time. 
---
Bethesda's competition at the barest of minimums issue at least a heads-up when major issues happen and get investigated. 
---
If Bethesda isn't prepared to meet what their competition is offering, they shouldn't be in the business of competing.
---
It should be pretty easy for betheada to spot the hackers, no? I hope these guys get perma bannned
---
You've found someone who only posts when they encounter a decidedly huge problem, personalized it, and condescended to them. Well trolled.
---
Someone posted about this hack almost a week ago, but the mods took it down. Had they left it up, there’s a good chance someone on the Bethesda staff would have seen it and could have done something to prevent it. 
---
Don’t get me wrong, this many major issues, hacks, and exploits a year after release, combined with a lack of support, is inexcusable. But by taking the post down, the mods MAY very well deserve some blame.
---
PRAISE THE LOOORD AND PASS THE AMMUNITION!
---
Cute!
---
It’s against TOS (I think), but Bethesda isn’t going to do shit.
---
Sure you hope you dont work in PR or customer service. 
---
There is more bad than good that can come out of a premature response to something like this. It's still morning. On monday.  NOTHING like this can be fixed or properly assessed that fast. 
---
 Its information gathering time. Let them verify the issue, properly assess it, and get a plan of attack.  Were only 8 hours into it, and this is more than just a hack. Theres even evidence of fakers, so they need to dig through a lot of bullshit to get to the actual issue.
---
The fact people keep eating the shit that is Fallout 76 and act like it’ll get better.  It’s hilarious to see how brainwashed people are.  The game was fucked from the start and most sensible people got out early.
---
So fuck the rest of the playerbase right. Yeah I unfortunately gave it a try. After a friend of mine who's a fallout fan called it garbage.
---
You could always just be proactive and mute people yourself. 
---
As for hackers/cheaters...if bethesda just did their damn job we wouldn’t need server police.
---
Dont play into it. One quick look at this doucbebags history reveals he lives his entire life in this sad state or troll.
---
Xmas is a Christian holiday. Bethesda is not a Christian company.
---
Wait... did you say 8 hours?!?!?!?!???!???!??
---
Your Atom Shop and Fallout 1st money is only there to line the pockets of upper management. Stop giving them money so they can get their 2nd or 3rd multimillion dollar home.
---
Im going to have to strongly disagree, did you not play in the first 2 weeks? It will never be that bad. The armor bug never effected me, im on pc tho
---
It was released today.
---
The mans not wrong, seriously, why do you guys still play this game?
---
You rather get cancer than play a shitty game?
---
Get the 1 month and just junk as much as u can while i have it.   Then cancel after the month.    Running low on junk again buy another month and horde again.
---
Don’t feel used and discouraged. Those who paid you 2k will likely never be able to sell it at 10k for their dream profit. I run into camps with outrageous prices all the time and guess what, after months when I bump into the same camp it’s still the same items collecting dust and nobody ever bought from them. Just yesterday saw some camps with boatload of junk with insane prices, such as 300 caps per plastic scrap (not bulk). I don’t know if they’re just bad at math or the greed is too much it became stupid.
---
The hack is one player is able to loot another player like a container.
---
If you stay offline, until fixed (hah), you will be fine.
---
Option 1 would be a private server, but thanks to a lovely feature in the game that doesn't work for you.
---
Option 2 would be making burner accounts, which you probably won't enjoy since you won't be able to do much serious playing
---
Option 3 would be playing on a console until it's over, but again that's most likely not an option.
---
The only other choice would be just sitting back and waiting for bethesda to fix things. And we've kind of all been doing that for over a year now, and see the results
---
That’s really sucks it’s on metal armor. Who wears metal armor?
---
That was tried in ultima online, and a couple other ones. it always results in the one moderater out of twenty going apeshit with power and abusing the hell out of it followed by termination of the moderater role. you need a lot of moderators to have an impact and the more moderators you have the higher the likely hood of one being a douche. the only way a moderator type program would work is by having paid employees sit in a big room like a big help desk. no gaming company is going to foot that bill. good idea and sentiment though.
---
What genres do you like?
---
What platform(s) do you play on?
---
I get you wanna keep playing, but Bethesda doesn’t deserve a dime if they aren’t protecting its players. Bethesda has an issue, you’re simply paying them for a work around when in reality, as the customer, it’s not your job to pay for fixes. If Bethesda doesn’t fix it, it’s not worth giving them money, plain and simple
---
Poetic
---
Is stuff not safe on the PS4?
---
Dude if they had just one guy moderating the game on pc it would be leaps better than right now. You can watch a hacker play from sunrise to sunset and the account doesn't get wiped. Its essentially every weekend now. 5 dollars to ruin an entire days worth of games. Theres like 2-4 active nw matches going at best...how hard is it to kick him. Sure he can go through dozens of accounts.  That would be  100x better than how its currently handled.
---
Yeah definitely a risk if you don’t trust them.
---
Lock your stuff. You can’t complain if you don’t lock it. No different then leaving yer house unlocked. The accountability still falls on you. 
---
Yes house burglary and santatron are COMPLETELY different. 
---
Do you get mad if yer water purifiers are unlocked and people take the water? 
---
It’s a tough world, take what you can get.
---
The over exageration argument/falacy amazing job dude.
---
Common sense says anyone playing FO76 for more than 1 months does not have common sense. Have you thought about it?
---
FO76 is a meme game, it is so fucking bad. I love watching people getting mald about it.
---
I am in full agreement with you, but I'm approaching this from a realistic angle. Not everyone is gonna stop, and to stop is enabling the hackers as well. In addition, as a multiplayer experience Fallout 76 already forces us to play a certain way, mainly not allowing the hacks that would otherwise be par for the course, and acceptable, on a single player game. Now purchasing and utilizing Fallout 1st, that is something I would consider enabling BGS, which I don't condone. Its just an option, if a really crappy one.
---
So you think the beta was worse than now where people can literally strip your entire inventory???
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA THIS GUY JUST RECOMMENDED ARK IN REPLACEMENT OF FALLOUT 76. Those aren’t even close to the same game. Not to mention that absolute shit combat. Rust isn’t bad but it’s full of hackers. You might as well have recommended Atlas with all these shit games... Lol you’d rather sit there and click on someone once in the most boring combat ever rather than deal with a game that’s offers micro transactions and subscriptions? At least we have an option not to deal with the bullshit in Fallout 76. In those games boringness and bullshit is a feature.
---
You're too optimistic
---
ah yes, the fallout 76 subreddit. where the greatest legal minds of the century congregate.
---
Tbh that shouldn't have worked though. Most companies have at least a skeleton crew waiting in the office in case of emergencies. And the cheaters bragged about their plans to youtubers a week in advance. It was even covered by some of those gaming journalists before it went live. Even if they didn't have anybody working there, they had the opportunity to prepare and didn't
---
Very much doubt they will admit it's happening as that will open the flood gates in more ways then one. Also very much doubt with the time of year anything will be done about it till they go back into work it's not something that can be fixed so easily. It was one reason why I stopped playing the game so many bugs and they do release patches they fix one bug and produce 100's more. Let also not forget the state of nuclear winter with all the exploiters and cheats. But then again Tod did say it's 16x times the detail! Not sure what he was comparing to , to be honest for that claim. Best thing for everyone to do is to show Bethesda how they feel but not playing and even uninstalling the game so when they look at the data they will think twice. I did enjoy the game specially nuclear winter however I lost all hope on the game every being sorted to somewhat of a decent state.
---
Items, decorations, yes. 
---
But that skin on that sweet legendary you just picked up? Bye.
---
My experience over the last ... almost 40 years of gaming tells me
---
#*you ain't gettin shit*
---
500 atoms probably
---
I'm surprised by some of the responses here, I'm not calling for a witch hunt, I'm not even necessarily calling for Bethesda to do something, if they even can, I'm simply an observer, having not played fallout 76 for months, and seeing this happening, I'm just shocked we haven't seen anything from them at all. 
---
I've played games for 20+ years, and in more recent years where stuff like this can happen, there is usually a very quick solution to the problem, or at the very least, immediate acknowledgement from the developers in some form. I'm merely pointing out my complete surprise that there hasn't been anything, and I can see others feel the same.
---
Agreed. As an IT support at a financial company, 100% I work 24/7 and always have someone to phone in the respective department, a company like Bethesda with public servers and public website will have staff to the same effect
---
You also dont own it. You own the license to use it.
---
I like it over all but I am very dissappointed in bethesda and the hacking toxic portion of our playerbase right now. I wouldnt reccommend a whole year. try it for a month would be my advice. oh and I am sure you have read all the stuff about the hacking bit so make sure you dont use you're favorite stuff right now.
---
Wouldn't it be great if we had a simple offline mode to use in these kinds of circumstances?
---
You most likely are a very sad individual then.
---
lol keep an eye out! for the wife not the handmade 😂
---
My fav insult. Only reserved for wankstains like this one
---
I find these points of view fascinating. My group of 6 plays daily. Every day since release. Both on PS4 and PC. Why two plats you say? I mean. The game is super cheap it's not hard to create two accounts on two platforms and play whichever one isn't having issues that day. I sub to the Fallout 1st because it gives me static world loot all to myself and all the workshops belong to my friends and I. I'm not really sure what's happening outside of my bubble but the weather's just fine in here.
---
I always thought the story in Fallout 3 and 4 sucked. They were lame and tropey. My favorite is actually New Vegas. But the best thing for me about Fallout has always been exploring a real world region with a unique atomic apocalypse theme and the simple VATS combat. They took that and dropped it into WV which is my home state. That's literally all they had to do to please me.
---
It's not hard to reach executives this time of year. Not sure why you would think that.
---
9 years of development for this garbage? You clearly don't know what you are talking about. First of all, BGS Austin started working on FO76 in 2015. That makes it 4 years of development. The only way it can count as 9 years is if you make the argument that the engine is basically the same but with added "bloat". Then I can agree with you.
---
On Xbox I just open my PipBoy and come back every 15 mins or so to eat and drink.
---
Nah I'm just curious? What's with the armchair therapists these days lol
---
No, it doesn’t matter if you VPN, buy from a different market, etc. In fact, users are already saying that private servers are compromised as well. 
---
Why in the world would you invest in this game right now? Look at all the threads in this subreddit. If you want to play Fallout, go buy Fallout 4 or buy 76 for the console.
---
It is now my favorite as well. Fucking wankstain haha
---
Don't play at all until this gets fixed. Which might or might not.
---
Could you imagine the backlash if Bethesda replied with this as a solution.
---
Given sometime I'm pretty sure the hackers can take down the servers themselves. I wouldn't be surprised, since technically hackers were the first ones to introduce human npcs into the game.
---
Holy shit. A rational argument. That doesnt belong here. Lol.
---
Karma police, eh?
---
Yeah you’re probably right but I’m sure they want an answer before speaking out on it. I could already see the YouTube thumbnails. “Bethesda useless and game completely breaks” “Bethesda messes up AGAIN and there not fix!” “Bethesda doesn’t care about the Fallout community” “Bethesda forces players to buy FO1st”
---
Stop calling them hackers, you’re giving them more credit than they deserve. They’re just code tweakers with no lives.
---
It wasn't so much a glitch, they did it on purpose and announced it would happen ahead of time.  I can't remember exactly what issue with PA they were addressing at the time.  The update was supposed to spawn everyone outside of a train station the next time they logged in so that you would be near a stash box if you became over encumbered.
---
I mean, its your money. You can support waste it however you want. Like by rewarding Bethesda for their inability to stop hacks like this days before Christmas....
---
Already finished it! 2300/3500 xp.
---
&gt;*not enough servers
---
That's more or less a non-issue. There *are* no servers. At least, not in the old fashioned dedicated sense. They're more like individual sessions running on multiple servers where every client is also the host, sort of like GTAO.
---
Bethesda uses Amazon to host their servers, which are used to store and host sessions.
---
The reason private servers aren't private the way dedicated (rentable) servers used to be is because there are none.
---
Acknowledgement and a warning isn't a premature response. 
---
Quit being stupid. 
---
"We are aware of the ongoing issue concerning hackers and inventories being wiped. We are investigating this issue now, please be patient and avoid going online until this issue has been fixed. Thank you." 
---
Simple.
---
Will it leave you in game if your pipboy is left open?
---
Yeah I agree fo76 is anything but boring you get weekly bugs to spice the game up. Ahah
---
Or... OOOORRRRR... Just take FO76 offline forever and turn it into a SP experience that we all wanted in the first fucking place.
---
Todd is a little busy right now picking out the features for his new CyberTruck. I'm sure he will check in on everything in the first quarter of 2020.
---
That was was the original purpose of the hack if I understand correctly
---
Controversial opinion: hackers are doing the right thing by showing not only how broken the game is, but also revealing Bethesda's apathy towards problems with the game. People who pay money for anything related to FO76 are just enabling Bethesda's actions and imo are simply reaping what they've sowed.
---
Hackers are also the only people getting the true fallout experience by LARPing as raiders.
---
Please report this p.o.s.
---
The game might not last a year
---
The fact you think that they think things through this far in advance tickles me.
---
You just contradicted yourself
---
Bethesda is already aware. putting out a statement that doesn't say anything novel doesn't really do anything to help. they know, we know, everyone knows by now. the question is how long until a hotfix.
---
Uh, hey boss, just wanna let you know this is your fault... Ah im fired i see, cool
---
Do you use white knight when repairing?
---
I’ve put mine in a building with a shutter, which I’ve removed the power supply for, then a lvl3 locked door, before a level 3 lock on the santatron. 
---
Can’t be too safe on there lol
---
No-one is making you play the wading through mobs idiot ALL the time, probably the only change needs to be made is how YOU play! I fix my armor once a month tops and usually just a piece here and there...😉
---
"Quit being stupid" lol back atcha.
---
Avoid going online,  seriously?
---
It doesnt recoup from the loss, but from what im seeing on other threads, as soon as she logs into a new server, it will give at least her pip boy back. 
---
I know this does nothing for anything else she or anyone else lost. 
---
Im on xbox. So i dont have a full grasp on this. Its not a console issue.
---
they are aware of the hack. this will just make those channels useless for other issues.
---
Holy fuck, someone sounding like a reasonable and logical adult.
---
Sadly this could be true. I've already seen multiple posts on this sub from players who were on the fence about buying the membership but now they view it as a solution so they could play the game properly. It's not their fault though, they just lack better judgement and don't know any better, or just kids. Some are complete morons though and fall for it.
---
The funny thing is they keep blaming hackers, which is understandable, but they can't really think past their noses for a minute and realize that you will always have hackers, and the proper way to deal with them is to have a solid, bug-free, heavily server-sided engine instead of this crap, scraped together engine that heavily relies on the client to do most of its work. This hack was necessary evil, it will push them to implement fixes or maybe convince them to stop beating the dead body that is FO76, if enough players actually stop fucking the dead body.
---
It's gotten dramatically better over the course of the past year and change. How can you say it hasn't, given all of the new gameplay content that's been added in that time?
---
Haha awesome
---
Most actual players do.
---
Radio silence is the first approach from Bethesda, didn't you learn it?
---
You recommended Ark and DayZ in replacement of FO76 kid, nuff said. Rust isn’t a bad game. However, hacking is a headache in every single one of those games. I won’t even go on about how shit Ark’s combat system is. Not to mention they’re not even RPGs so I really don’t see how they relate besides the survival aspect.
---
I've done it a few times for an hour or two at a time and have yet to get kicked. Not sure if it'll work on PC but it does on Xbox.
---
Why did I kill them? Dude do you even America?
---
What's the hack?
---
No.... disconnects every 15 minutes and all the other nonsense are still not as bad as someone being able to steal your entire inventory or as bad as your armor set breaking every time you reload. People have put hundreds upon hundreds of overs into their inventories and armor sets. 
---
I've been on since beta on XBox so I've seen it all, like many of us. I don't downvote often on principle and won't here but yours is a bad comment.
---
Seeming as the issue is both public/private servers, yeah.
---
I know which one I'd prefer LOL
---
Because some people wanna play the game legit and dont farm stuff anyway?  
---
I know for a lot of people the hacks hurt their in game economy yada yada, but it never touched what they already had, its not like they actually robbed your shop, just crashed the market, this is an entirely different kettle of fish
---
If that were the case the GTA online and fortnite hacker they tried to sue would have lost. He didn't, no laws against hacking inside a game.
---
lol, I wasn't defending Bethesda. Bethesda's QA and security for PC have been terrible. The problem is that you seem to think it's completely Bethesda's fault, and you seem to think a unified boycott is actually possible, and neither of those things are true. 
---
Leave the game if you want, that's your call.
---
I fail to remember any other game with exploits of this magnitude.
---
You complain about hacking *facepalm* heheehe
---
If a family member is toxic enough to get you this game as a gift you need to cut them out of your life
---
Private servers are I'm the rotation of normal servers, so they just need access to the code to see the list of servers.
---
oh look the 50th post like this today.
---
Bethesda's first approach. It doesn't exist, lalalala.
---
I don't play F76 but half ass follow it's news just for the disaster it has been. Is this in regards to hacking being far too prevalent, or some specific hack?
---
Really lapping up that negative attention aren't we?
---
Are you doing melee with knuckles from the center of the hordes?
---
Let’s be honest if they do bother to fix it hackers will always find another way
---
Juicehead demonstrating it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7FtkkDhw\_I](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w7FtkkDhw_I) 
---
Someone running around doing it to lots of people: [https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk](https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk)
---
Well it's already blowing up, there's screenshots of some of these posts up on Facebook meme pages. Once again this game is the laughing stock of the internet.
---
Please do not the flood the ticket system.
---
Yeah buggy and filled with hackers and now charging subscription fees.  What an excellent concept.
---
I really hate that on reddit you have to put a disclaimer on comments like this
---
Yeah I guess. Pretty useless. Probably just gonna let the idiots bicker amongst eachother.
---
I need a live service mmo FPS RPG survival game. Not god damn Ark or DayZ. I play on both PC and Xbox. And don’t you dare recommend Minecraft or State of Decay lol
---
Nah, you guys keep getting consensually fucked by Bethesda and loving it.
---
For
---
Fridge
---
Just farm the queen for a while. Next thing you know you will have 100 repair kits.
---
Oh my god my hero! Pls don’t get your inventory stolen!!!! :( xD
---
I noticed one of these... :( 
---
 So here take this... :D
---
Totally ruined my whole day off now I'm scared to death to log on cuz I just hit 50 and just got all kinds of gear and weapons. I hope it doesn't take them forever to fix this.
---
So it's another thing Bugthesda "fixed" because of "reasons".
---
They broke the door with this hack, this isn't something you can do without inserting third party code. This would be the equivalent of opening a smartlock on a house door via hack.
---
time to go farm ballistic fiber then. make sure you use the 200% repair perk. do nuke runs to for improved repair kits.
---
Exactly.
---
Are these hacks publicly available or just for a small discord group? To me it seems like it takes less effort to hack this game than obscure F2P games with little funding.
---
Even perfectly sane people occasionally act irrationally.
---
Visit Fort Defiance and Camp McClintock for ballistic fiber, and join in on Scorched Earth events for the free repair kits
---
&gt;one day no one will be playing your game
---
Its so fascinating to me when people make comments and posts about 76 like this. The fact anyone is playing the game now is absurd. Bethesda pulls some stupid shite, this sub gets all up in arms (insert “everyone’s going to stop playing if you don’t wisen up!” here), a week passes and everything is back to normal. 
---
Here’s a hard to swallow pill, you guys should have been done playing this game months ago, could be going on a year now even. If for nothing else, do it out of respect for yourself and for the video game industry as a whole. I mean Jesus Christ people, don’t just say you’ve woken up to Bethesdas literal evil BS, actually wake up and stop supporting their game!
---
You can say that, but the endgame is all about trading.
---
Theres also the NW cheaters that make it unplayable.
---
i mean wtf is wrong with people,
---
i enjoy this game and i will still play it even after all this hack shit, 
---
if you don't like it just move one and play something else why do you feel the need to hate on a game that you do not play and try to ruin it for others
---
Rust?
---
I'm trying to, I have stayed in private servers. Lets hope the griefers dont make hacks to breach worlds...
---
Soooo..
---
Started a bit early on the  **eggnock** did we ?  😂🤣🤪
---
He has in the past, also has verbally harassed them too
---
It's as true as the other 49. Bethesda need to get on this asap.
---
i'm on pc and can go afk for hours with weight on w key
---
Imagine think that off-hours and weekends was a valid excuse when running an always online live service. Bethesda put their hat into this ring, stop defending a company that clearly doesn't understand the medium they are working in.
---
You were just talking about this being a toxic community and I responded to that, now you're talking about the hacking problem. Guess what, they're not the same thing, the hackers that troll people like this aren't part of the community... they're doing it to fuck with the community and they very likely hate this game. 
---
This problem is not equivalent to a toxic community, pick a lane.
---
Won't matter, bank accounts are properly secured unlike this game.
---
There's a difference between an asshole and a stupid.
---
It IS entirely Bethesda’s fault. The hackers are making a statement to Bethesda. If they had built the game with proper anti cheat to begin with, none of this would be an issue. The hackers don’t need our gear. They are sending a message to BGS. Hopefully they hear it loud and clear and make plans to add anti cheat to every multiplayer game they produce in the future (Starfield)
---
FYI this hack is live. I just got robbed. Thank God u was prepared so they didn't took much just what I can replace but damn. That was fast. Lvl 3 guy in another guy camp crouching, invisible. One sec I was standing and fixing my weapon next time I didn't have any weapon to fix. Nor any armor.
---
Started a bit early on the **eggnock** did we ? 😂🤣🤪
---
I broke into a guys house and stole his gifts but hey if you put santa behind a locked door and leave a workbench in front of a window AND still leave santa unlocked i mean cmon!
---
No matter how they respond, there are probably quite a few people at Bethesda who’s Christmas breaks were absolutely ruined over all this. This can get downvoted all it wants but it’s facts.
---
Yeah I mean, that’s not great either. It’s not just one issue is what I mean, Bethesda clearly lacks the capacity to handle this type of project in all ways.
---
I highly doubt it would be possible. Just don’t accept random team invites lmao
---
He’s a pedo then?
---
I assume you are one of the griefers?
---
Keep a melee weapon on you, and build turrets when you are at the ammo factory.
---
Dress up as Santa, and only carry gifts. Only thing left to do.
---
When I read about a major hack that might possibly be used against the playerbase to steal their items, I don't run around with my best gear. Basic sense dude. You know, you've been warned, so why would you run around with top gear?
---
You have mutated! You now have one giant ball.
---
Not trolling. Post like this from accounts with no prior activity can send up red flags in the community as people make posts like this quite often when there are bugs or issues in the game to try to take advantage of the situation.
---
only when the community is happy
---
If this is their answer to that act they were never white hats.
---
They tried and lost.
---
Just be happy you arent a fallout 1st subscriber, that requires an iq of less than 76 though.
---
He takes pleasure in making them cry
---
Santa crash, icicle lights, plasma mine, the various mirelurks, scorch beasts, raider armor, power armor...to name a few
---
This. Always have plan b. And by plan b i mean a really heavy mallet.
---
I agree with everything you said, but they are also deliberately ignoring parts of the text in a call and simply not responding to it...
---
Protocol or not that don’t excuse the behaviour forced upon them or if they choose to be that way...
---
That’s a perfect way to put it!
---
I had a bunch of ballistic fiber in my vendor and no one wanted it. I play a melee character and I’m always flush in fiber, dunno why you’re always out
---
You're sharing that like it somehow undermines my point. It doesn't. You would have to share information undermining the idea that many players are giving and kind, and you don't have that data.
---
Ok, Dr. Strangelove
---
Depends what you want / need, all plans have some value. There is a list of all available plans just search this sub, some of the rarer plans are the tomahawk, Santa crash, icicles, etc .. but depends if you want armor plans, camp plans etc ..  for workshops you only going to get regular plans anyway, just read them and get the next one you don't have.
---
Don't worry about it, it's only a problem on PC and doesn't affect us console players.
---
And not only that, they are trying to rebuild Nazi Germany... on the Moon!
---
Is this a question or a comment or something else entirely?
---
Shoulda left earlier...i can say at least i left on a positive note...people need to drop this game like the hot shit it is...
---
nah, don't think so, i am usually the player you can meat in game that gives you stuff and greats you when you visit my camp, but i had to react when you write bs dragging Nazi's into this...
---
 Bethesda is in vacation. Watching Reddit rage
---
It sounds like the point of this post is that it was the worst gaming experience they've had BECAUSE of the 1000 hours it took to farm the gear that was lost
---
*Reality:*
---
No one is in the office, everyone is off for holiday, enjoying the Christmas spirits with their friends and family. 
---
A janitor who works in the building walks by, and saw that the some of the computer monitors in the dimly lighted office is flashing like a rave party, almost as if they are receiving 100 urgent messages per second, but he shrugged, "not my problem." and walked away.
---
I was one yesterday who had my shit stolen fucking hacker bitch
---
A studio succeeding with a shit game means more shit games.
---
Wait it out. Maybe they'll roll back the whole thing a couple of days. If not they'll patch the thing and you get to start a new character :(
---
I'm not starting with my uppleveled character untill they fixed it. The other character that I have, have nothing so I really can't loose anything.
---
It is not "literally impossible". This is what I'm talking about, ill-informed people pretending like they know better
---
The community managers need to be shown the door. They have totally failed us for a year. This event even though the most extreme example is really just the topper on a giant cake of indifference shown to the community.
---
Thats not even remotely funny, you do know 50 million people died to Hitler
---
In a hardcore survival game where PvP is always a thing, a person having aimbot and seeing through terrain is a huge deal. Imagine losing everything you’re carrying to someone who shoots you with an assault rifle from across the map. It’s infuriating and a waste of time. Half of the complaint posts on Reddit don’t even apply to consoles. I play FO76 on Xbox where we don’t really deal with hacking besides duping. Even that’s pretty scarce.
---
The ultra-light armor mod plans are worth hanging onto if you get multiples as most of them are rare random world spawns or rare event rewards. Any of the dense armor mod plans would be worth having as well as the power armor plans and the armor plans for the heavy metal armor and raider armor as those are all hard to come by.
---
Well... Pretty much anything with a value p2p above 500 caps?
---
Weird. I get kicked every time.
---
GO TO SINSEER.COM YOU WILL SEE ALL OF THESE PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTING NAZI RACISTS, I BET YOUR A FUCKING PEDOPHILE
---
FO 1st...PC trading is abysmal (just a bunch of mental hoarders) and don't have the patience to hop camp to camp hoping I might find something I need (411)...so it's business as usual, getting the atoms, working on challenges, farming the fissures, taking pictures, etc...
---
Ya then my event could get hacked and I lose all my shit ho ho ho that would suck
---
I feel this is one of those "Don't hate the player, hate the game" type of moments. Pick up the pieces at a later, or give the game a rest. The guy is a scumbag for sure, but it was BGS's lack of competency and urgency that allowed this act in the first place. They own the game and the servers, and have shown they're capable of tracking actions and implementing fixes rather quickly.
---
They are doing it to fuck with a shady publisher.
---
You still repair shit from your bench? Ive gotten so many free repair kits ive not a chance to use them and i main heavy guns.
---
Hacks do happen frequently in other triple A titles. Really bad ones sometimes. You must be high.
---
Shut up pedophile nazi

The hack works on stashes.

You don’t leave a gun in a locked house in an unlocked safe...
---
Stay on yer toes peeps!
---
The Community Management team has rarely if ever answered or acknowledged anything of actual importance over the past year. 
---
But man they are all over a posts about people leaving toilet paper on someones bed or posts about players making kill camps to trap and kill other players within hours.
---
That was my first thought. Like serisly if you run out of stuff you either stoped gathering as you play or dont use the correct cards to help. Both of which making it your fault and noth bethesdas.
---
Morning. Monday. These are words that are irrelevant if you are running a 24/7 live service.
---
Source on that?!?  I have only seen statements contrary to that.  Stash is safe (for now).
---
F76 hacking is an inside job!
---
Lol...
---
Couldn’t have happened to a better company
---
I agree, been playing since beta too, but those bugs effected everyone. This shit most certainly sucks pretty hard, but what are the actual chances of running into one of these hackers? i haven't yet. Not saying it isn't a big deal, because it is, but its not effecting 100% of the player base
---
What I do for ammo is I do a run through of Lucky Hole Mine for lead ore, then smelt it for lead scrap. For steel I go do west tek and scrap all the weapons that the super mutants have. They will drop Caps, 5.56, and .308 as a bonus. For acid to make gunpowder/smelt I server hop dolly sods and kill the 2 bears that spawn outside. Make sure you have the ammo smith and super duper perk cards equipped when crafting ammo.
---
Currently a hack running rampant that allows hackers to steal items from people's inventories as if they were storage.
---
YongYea and LegacyKillaHD are the absolute worst of gaming YouTube. They seem to like to play themselves off as investigative reporters of the industry, but they are pretty much just bottomfeeders. Their disingenuous and clickbait-y coverage is why I've mostly given up on anything gaming related on YouTube. Hate trains and trashing games for clicks only serves themselves.
---
 It’s against TOS , you could get banned if you get caught
---
This hurts Beth’s profit tremendously, when people should be able to play more and make atom shop purchases. I hope they are able to punish the exploiters to the maximum extent.
---
I'm afraid it could be over for PC, NW hacks have been around for months and Bethesda hasn't been able to do anything about it so I don't know what they're going t do about this.
---
Again.. other than banning the person there is literally nothing they can do a bout it. The people lost virtual items that you can't even put a price on (since you know, trading items isn't permited to begin with) and other than claiming they lost hours of play time.. literally nothing can be proven especially how much they've lost in hours.. the gear that they lost
---
Sinseer, you have yet to provide any shred of evidence of me being a nazi, and a racist. You have talked out of your ass and every time in game chat when I ask how I am a nazi racist, you block me. You have your head so far up your ass it is unbelievable.
---
From what I can tell from following it, last night was the first time they went out and used it against a large segment of players (500ish).
---
The hackers are abusing the community for their own pleasure. If you don't understand that element of the problem then you are completely daft. If this was about 'sending a message to Bethesda' then they would have attacked the game itself and not the playerbase. There is clear contempt for the time players have spent getting these items.
---
You really need to address your inability to understand cause and effect. Just because a mall is understaffed for security doesn't make it any less the fault of the gunman who walks in and starts shooting people.
---
Jesus dude, I'd rather have a 100% percent chance of an inconvenient disconnect than a .1% chance of some Youtube shitbird coming along and stealing my inventory.
---
This is what ive been doing.  Even taking over the ammunition work shop with my melee and transfer to my rifle build. 
---
Just sucks when defend the workshop turns out to be 2+ scorchbeast.  Lol
---
wow, think you need to run down to the pharmacist and get your medicines before Christmas, lol
---
Btw, you know i live next door to you, and have a friend called Lucille, don't you ?
---
Running the game on a virtual machine circumvents hardware bans.
---
76 started out as Fallout 4 built in co-op mode. So it started during fallout 4 development maybe not day 1 but not after fallout 4's launch
---
Wrong idiots...I'm not going anywhere, I don't do my life based on punkass internet terrorists (or RL ones for that matter)😘
---
Easy tiger, I’m not complaining, just passing judgement on lowlife behaviour because, as a paragon of virtue myself, I can. Yep, it’s a tough world, nope not mad at people taking water, the purifiers are unlocked in case someone needs it. I drop aid to any noobs I can, because it is a tough world. I’m working to build a better one. If you are stung by my post that says more about you than me I’m afraid. Peace and love man, Happy Holidaymas to you and yours ❤️
---
I'll add my tip for acid, I server hop tanagra town. The cave has several crickets which drop 5-8 acid each usually. I can get around 300 acid an hour just server hopping this one place.
---
Thank you
---
One puts your life in danger, other one just wastes your time. Gamers will never stop surprising me.
---
I'm not malicious, but I sure do hope Beth gets a serious profit drop. It's clear they don't care about us enough and money is their goal. Maybe, just maybe this sets enough of a fire under their asses and they start doing something about it
---
Say what you want that first month was worth it. Sure i lost my scrap for half a month. But the atoms free clothes emotes and 4x the scrap i lost made it worth it. Fuck re subbing though.
---
I like him. Alot of his stuff is rage bait but it's entertaining to  watch these "dumpster fires", not gonna lie.
---
Know for a fact that the person who runs sinseer.com and is said player does not use reddit. While they do point out toxic fo76 players, they don’t do it on here, and whoever this is putting this post up ain’t them.
---
Come on. There’s enough bullshit already happening right now. Be just slightly mature.
---
I uninstalled at least 2 month$ agot; not too much longer than the raids has been out.
---
I get where he's coming from, but everyone perceives things and experiences differently. I put in 500 or so hours, and now I can't see anything but the broken stuff. But if someone else can get something else out of, it's on them.
---
I'd like everyone to have a better product, but I'll just abstain myself
---
Buck naked, punching things with my bare fists or with vanilla knuckles, while eating off the land via Lead Belly and Cannibal. Have played this way on this character since her inception and glad to finally see my diligence has paid off. She's also several levels higher than my main.
---
Now *this* is the content I was hoping for from this hack. I hope Bethesda’s feet get held to the fire on this one.
---
Your endgame is trading, people spawning in weapons didnt negatively effect me, if i had all my items stolen it would negatively effect me
---
So nothing interesting then?
---
So the guys serious about this would be safe but all the others doing plug-n-play would get hit.
---
I played FO76 at launch and was so disappointed i put it down after about 15 hours.  And I've just been hopefully watching the game to see if it ever gets to a good place (it seemed like the game almost got there before fallout first came out.  
---
And this is pretty hilarious - I assume they have to give everyone a ton of stuff.  How could they not?  This is actually full non-stop comedic awful.  I kinda want to login and run around until someone steals my terrible gear.
---
Hackers suck.  I'll be staying off of the servers until it is safe again...
---
Indeed. An unfortunate reality.
---
&gt; they're not on my friends list and can't be on my server.
---
Same bug for me (((     I'm told "team-only" servers are a solution
---
Fo76 has less cheat protection than games from last decade, Bethesda deserves at least little flak right?  We paid AAA prices for this.
---
Let's not forget that Bethesda has already let hackers return to the game after they apologized.
---
Fucking dumb.
---
Fair point
---
Watch out guys, we have a badass over here.
---
Ahahah, there's my bitter little pill no life of a stalker...bye felicia.😘
---
This will only lose them playerbase... not even Bethesda are that dumb.
---
I had someone steal whatever was in my Satantron last night. He picked the lock and became wanted. I was in my camp when it happened and shot him in the face for his trouble.
---
Only to see his name go wanted again a minute later. It seems by taking away his Wanted status, I actually helped him as he could see other camps again. So, everyone out there who can actually play the game, if someone is Wanted, let them be wanted. They can't fast travel to anyone's camp if they can't see them.
---
Show me where did it hurt you.
---
You do know the hackers can steal your Pipboy right? Want to ruin a main character if they don’t roll you back that’s how you do it. Their solution for a lost Pipboy is to normally wipe the characters in an account. Just an FYI.
---
Don't be salty, it's fine.
---
Bethesda needs some real anti cheat. Maybe a strict white list for dll files would have prevented this mich carnage. Someone still would have found a way, but it would have required more work.
---
Well you're not wrong there
---
Your reasoning is terrible. You're putting the blame for this almost entirely on Bethesda rather than the hackers, redirecting angst toward the wrong target. And that's EXACTLY what many of these hackers want, so you're basically just being a puppet.
---
Bethesda deserves plenty of criticism, and they need to get on this issue immediately. But stop trying to obscure the hackers' part in this and make it seem like this is really all about Bethesda. Making a game with poor security is neglectful and may even be tied to greed, but that in noway diminishes the reality that the hackers are the cause and are contemptuously stealing peoples' items.
---
This is a prime example of how broken the game actually is. This isn't an indie game. It's really not acceptable, especially when you have a cash shop.
---
Wish I still had my TSE Dragon. Was farming ghouls in Whitespring. I went to drop some one star legendaries and the menu lagged and without knowing it I dropped my TSE Dragon as well. Had my melee weapon out at the time so I wasn't using the damn thing.
---
Saw some dude come up an loot my bag. Didn't notice my substantial loss till after.
---
That fat twat
---
Lmao, stop assuming I'm defending a corporate entity and act like a damn adult. 
---
Its a video game. Not your life. Not someone dying. I get being upset over something you immensely enjoy but at some point you have to realize that you and everyone else commenting have no control of this shit show. Send your report to Bethesda support. Take a deep breath and go enjoy something else.
---
&gt; No different then leaving yer house unlocked.
---
&gt; Yes house burglary and santatron are COMPLETELY different.
---
These are conflicting statements, sir.
---
it makes me wonder what's the difference between my game and yours... or maybe those are some pc settings that are affecting it?
---
The comment section are all in support of him. It's disgusting.
---
I don't repair with materials anymore. Do SBQ runs until you're stocked with about 50 improves repair kits then just forget about that part of the game.
---
They’re gone. Holiday, and like last year, they won’t do anything until they’ve returned.
---
I considered FO 1st myself but what the hell? One has to play safe in the adventure mode. We payed real money for that. But here we are, not knowing what to do now. Adapt and stash our precious gear until there is a patch and wait for the next hack?  This is at least hilarious if you ask me.
---
Oh, yeah. That definitely sounds like a shutdown the servers type deal right there.
---
Yes, there are MANY other posts about it. I know some BGS employees check this Sub occasionally. I think if we as a community flood this Sub with posts about this hack, perhaps it will emphasize just how important this is.
---
Maybe it's not too late to spin it as a console exclusive!
---
Tbis comment is ass cheeks.
---
Ahahahah, see you deleted your post and to answer it...these are tears of laughter😹
---
Dupers have always been heroes. Every nice thing I have that I didn't pull myself, I assume to be duped. I will say, it would have been interesting to live in a game world where top tier stuff was as rare as it was intended to be, and the lesser effects had some value, but that's not the game we have.
---
Judging from the colors of their banner I'd say there're a military contingency force operating for Vault Tec, maybe even Enclave due to the presence of the flag.
---
You have nothing of value in nw and your inventory resets every round.
---
Everyone deserves the right to be pissed at the hackers. It ain't like they are Robinhood; stealing from the hardcore's to give to the casuals. Just because you CAN do something doesn't mean you should. Makes them douchebags. Everyone also deserves the right to be pissed at Bethesda for all the reason mentioned in the thread. But their failings don't make them the cause of the hackers, just...enablers?
---
Not to start a witch hunt or anything.
---
A comment disguised as a question
---
As others have mentioned, the white knight perk card. Are you using it fully maxed out? And when you repair your armor are you equipping the fix it good perk card fully maxed out? I only have to repair armor a few times a week and when I do it only uses a small amount of ballistic fiber. 
---
Ballistic fiber is easy to acquire if you know where to go for it. The asylum and camp mclintock are good places to look and the BoS  bases scattered around the cranberry bog region all usually have at least one ammo bag, some have more.
---
I agree yong was so late to the party when people  were spawning npcs and the prydwin. Hes just dick riding for views at this point. Leave the news to juice head or rifle gaming. People who actually play the fucking game.
---
It was removed, actually. Just like your edgy comments calling me a 'lying bitch'. Looks like you aren't mature enough to have a conversation on reddit without insulting people, judging by your post history. Oh well, blocking it is! 👋
---
I've been getting downvotes all month saying this.  They fail us over and over.
---

---
TL:DR 
---
😘 FO 1st monthly subscriber.😂
---
What you just did is called "shifting the goalposts." Rather than acknowledging my refutation of your original point, you raise a different point and present it as though it were the same point.
---
Thats what im saying hes so late to the party and half the shit he talks about ends up being wrong.
---
Large portion of hackers (not just fo76) are for nothing but money, essentially thieves and robbers behind a screen and keyboard. Then there’s those who just want to make people upset and take pleasure in it. They aren’t any different than kids who poop on public playgrounds and vandalize others’ properties and think it’s ‘fun’. Karma will eventually catch up with them and they have to pay dearly one way or another. But at the moment they feel fun and invincible.
---
Don't forget to take that fake raider flag off😂
---
Technically they do, it's just so small it's hard to complain about. The scrapbox, tent, and private servers are really bad though.
---
And yet, they don't skip a beat when it comes to posting on Twitter!
---
These guys are still defending Bethesda... The gaming community is crying today folks. Can't you see that you paid for a broken game? Can't you see all the videos of guys hacking? This is a SCAM! Wake up.
---
That makes sense I thought that xbox was riddled with hackers but I guess I was wrong about that.
---
If you sell your product worldwide  be prepared to handle customer support etc. worldwide on a 24/7 basis.
---
they already knew about this before the hack went public. all flooding the sub does its make it harder to identify any other issues. more posts isnt going to fix the hack any faster.
---
I appreciate your constructive criticism and profound use of eloquent language, but I'm gonna disagree on certain aspects of your statement.
---
That seems like a very small haul. Hopefully you'll have better luck next time!
---
I found only 1 afk in 25 levels. It's not much plsytime,but i expected many more
---
"im not listening lalalalala" *fingers in ears*
---
Epic shill moment 😎😎😎
---
jfc
---
My thinking is, what other tickets are being processed at all? Is anyone seriously still playing at this point?
---
I've been gone since 2 weeks after release. Love everything it could have been but fell way to short for me. Any desire I had to come back due to patches was immediately tossed out the window when 1st came out.
---
Your post makes no sense. You're so terrified of losing items (which you can put in stash so you don't lose them) that you're going to... abandon the game and all of those items? 
---
Guess what, that loser you spoke of just won. He pushed you out of the game and didn't have to do a thing to you.
---
I haven't played in a while and only follow the dumpster fire here on reddit, so I gotta ask: Has there actually been any major media attention to this? Any gaming websites or maybe even bigger outlets that reported on it?
---
Fair enough.
---
Thank you, thank you! 😘
---
So many apologists.
---
This is assuming a rollback is even possible. I am not convinced they have the tools in place to do this.
---
Haha. Have u even thought about the timing of this? Yes most of the hackers are doing it for their amusement. But they aren’t the ones who went into the code and created the hack. They’re just the scum that downloads the files from some hacker forum and then abuses. 
---
The people who wrote the code released it now, while the whole company is on holiday to do the most damage possible. They ARE attacking the game itself by forcing the player base to avoid the game. This could cause BGS millions of lost revenue. How else do you expect them to attack the game? 
---
You need to think bigger and not just what the individual hacker is doing. But the whole hacking community. 
---
Comparing mall security to a video game anti cheat mechanism is not even close. Nice try though.
---
This is sad and for a lot of the people in that video, it's a year of gaming and grinding down the drain.  Whilst some people might think that's not much of an achievement, or a waste of time, or whatever... I dunno... I feel bad for them :(
---
Amazon likely has plenty of resources now that Christmas shopping is coming to a close..
---
Not to this caliber it doesn't. Bethesda have got complacent with releasing a buggy game and letting fans fix it that they haven't seemed to learn anything as the bugs from old games are still present today.
---
That stuff is mostly automated and was likely set up weeks ago.
---
I do it's glorious
---
No, it just dilutes the posts. No one is reading every single one. It's going to normalize the issue and just be seen as spam.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure. Oh well. Maybe I can figure out something. I just want to be able to cook dinner or take a shower or work on a project while my vendor is up and running.
---
I love the game too. And i am happy even there are a lot of shit in. But i made a break bcs of the hack. I am not so much for running naked. I prefer my proper gear on ;)
---
Its like that scene when the Grinch accidentally catapulted himself towards Whoville
---
How does it work? Do they need to see you on their friend's list in order to break into your server?
---
One month free? Bethesda/Zenimax won't give you a drop of sweat off their balls for free. Get fucking real my dude.
---
As if fallout 76 itself hadn't already made clear that Bethesda only wants your money.
---
Check out /r/fo76FilthyCasuals/

Loving the indignant tea leaves “justifying” their questionable morals. Thankfully I am an upright citizen and will not succumb to the dark forces. Happy Holidays 76ers xxx
---
I disagree. The phrase, "the squeaky wheel gets the grease" comes to mind.
---
Instead of wanting free access to private servers you should want then to fix the whole fucking hacking thing once for all.
---
The servers should go offline until they got it right!
---
I work all week and only took Christmas off.  This has been the case for the last 6 years working for a softare company, we run limited staff during the week but it's not like everyone just shuts down for 2 weeks, that's insane.
---
This is what you get when you mess with us.
---
^it's ^a ^song ^in ^case ^anyone ^is ^wondering
---
Never work on PC, swap a video card or memory stick and it's a new config
---
Glad everyone downvoted this.  This post is from the kind of person that could have a dog actively pissing on their leg, and deny it as everyone stares at the dog.
---
Don't they have a conscious?
---
The admins need to make a mega thread. This happened, it is happening, it does suck, theres nothing more posts on reddit will do about it beyond make people looking for other information sift through the spam posts. Bethesda knows, the community knows (they were warned and believed someone willing to steal all their shit would honor their word of waiting until xmas day) so at this point it's just a waiting game.
---
I've been away from Fallout 76 for a few mo this now. What's this hack?
---
How are fallout 1st subscribers getting what they deserve? Aren't they the ones insulated with protection on private worlds?
---
You think 'muh weekend muh holiday season' is reasonable and logical. It ain't. And when called out on it you double down into 'it's only a game'.
---
An adult would go 'Holy shit we are providing a 24/7 service we need 24/7 support'. Instead Bethesda rely on useful idiots to wheel out the excuses for them.
---
YES because I believe in Bethesda
---
\^This. They stole what you earn with time from your RL.
---
That's why commando is FoTM and not META, come back to the dark side...
---
It
---
Just
---
Anybody who still believes in Bethesda after more than a year of this shit deserves it
---
No, it's not. And your suggestion is daft. The two games are not in comparable situations, as FF14 was rebuilt from the ground up largely due to design problems. This game's problems are not FF14's problems.
---
Thanks :)
---
I'm having fun
---
Because some of us are not turned off by the issues and bugs and still find enjoyment when we play. And post like these do not change that fact.
---
I'm not sure if this is true but I read they can change their hacked .dll to target your stash instead of your inventory, they can't take both at the same time though.
---
So if it is true no items are safe in public worlds at the moment.
---
If a product does not perform as advertised then you are allowed a refund, more or less. So basically you've been allowed to refund this game since day 1.
---
THEY knew about hack. Most of the community did not. Now we are spreading the word to other players as well as telling Bethesda that we are aware of the issue as well.
---
They need an anti-cheat. That’s it.
---
Nice interior, looks comfy. I was half expecting some roadrunner-esque trap, like someone was expecting there to be presents in the building that looks like one.
---
Enjoy man. seems like u could some cheering up. 
---
You sound pretty miserable person. Almost feel bad for you.  Hope u work out ur life some day
---
Gamebryo started as a MMO engine, Zero.
---
Like game, just can't play it for fear of being hacked.
---
Deserves what mate?
---
&gt;hacker is located in russia
---
This is a shocking development.
---
What happened? Im in xbox
---
People are literally having their entire inventory stolen. That's not an issue or a bug, it's just a downright hack enabled by Bethesdas laziness and sloppy work
---
They promised  Wall Street the release, so damn the quality, hitting the release date was more important.
---
There you go, an accurate post. Degree and context are important parts of analyzing a situation. Pretending no triple A game goes through hack hell is flat-out wrong.
---
Is this happening in both Pc and Console or just PC?
---
Denial. I refuse to believe Bethesda is a soulless husk with a bottom-line for money now. 
---
Fallout 4 wasn't the writing on the wall at all.
---
This is real. It happened to a friend I was in a team with last night before it blew up on Reddit. We had just left Vault 94 and I knew he had gone to check on his Converted Munitions workshop and I was standing in The Mire getting my rads on when I noticed he fast traveled to me. At the time I did not know what was going on. I was streaming; I regurgitate this fact too many times in the footage mostly because I think I was in shock. But just to let the people know who are doing this, it makes your victims feel terrible. At the time I thought it was two people responsible but now it looks like the level 80 guy who was traveling with the level 200 had also been hacked by him. In the footage you hear him say, “I want my stuff back.” And I’ll be damned if he almost didn’t get me. It felt honest to God that weird inability to process what’s happening  when you’re confronted with evil.

Anti hack plan 😆
---
the wheel is in a bucket of grease at this point.
---
Doesn’t effect me. I’m on console ass clown
---
Because some people have very low standards when it comes to games, they more or less accept anything regardless if they are getting screwed or not.
---
Trying? More like they kicking a dead horse.
---
1. Be ammo efficient by using every possible damage multipliers. 
---
2. Carry two weapons at the same time, different calibers. I carry a laser rifle and a 38 fixer (fusion cells / 38) or an SMG and a silenced handmade (10mm / 5.56). 
---
3. Equip the ammo scavenger perk, to find more and more ammo. 
---
If you do this, you don't need to buy or craft ammo. If you are still struggling,...
---
4. Craft using ammosmith and super duper.
---
If you like buying Atoms it's a good deal based on that alone. Don't pay $100 though. Do it monthly, at least the first month. If you hate it, you're only out a little bit. Then you can cancel that and resub for a year.
---
And, it is nice having 7k steel, 2k wood and 20k cloth in the scrapbox. I never have to take a break to farm anything (except lead maybe) because I just keep everything and scrap everything. Private servers are boring to me, but others like them... so if that's something you want (or are on PC now as it seems like that's the least shitty way to play now).
---
Look at the hot posts.
---
Theres literally dozens of posts about this. Read the subreddit for a second or two before you post and you'll answer your own question
---
Fair, I should have explained better for sure.
---
Because not eveyrone has a shitty experience with the game. And generally people who complain about it complain because of one off bugs and that accumulates a loud minority. Or people straight up dont play the game and just listen to the loud minority.  Personally I havent had a bad experience and have played most of my namy hours with a friend or two which makes bugs way better because it gives us a good laugh and ive barely experienced any game breaking bugs either. Ive basically got nothing better to play aswell Imo.
---
You got hacked brother.
---
Maybe, but it’s so much fun..
---
Go post on the bethesda forums then. This isnt their subreddit.
---
Well well sorry for the inconvenience
---
Ah shit
---
I hate it but #3.
---
Not sounding fun...
---
Oh the block option seems to be saying you’ll be gone from everyones life soon enough lmao
---
Wow thanks, now I can finally get the backpack I’ve had for almost 10 months.
---
False
---
👏
---
Is that supposed to mean that it's alright that it's happening?
---
Bethesda said... LMFAO. Bethesda is one giant lie factory.
---
2 scorchbeast’s and a 3 star legendary.. . Woohoo 1 star harpoon ..
---
Yes, i’ve read this to. It makes me extremely worried.
---
‘Good thieves’ only happen in fairytales. In real life they are only parasites.
---
This is also why the game license should never have been lower than $60. For $5 hackers buy up disposable accounts for this kinda shit.
---
Because it's 100% Bethesda's responsibility. Bethesda got warned countless of times by the community and modders. Everybody who had experience on the engine through modding and the creation club predicted this. People KNEW this was going to happen and tried to stop it. Modders with thousands of hours of work kept saying how unsecure using a poorly modified single-player engine with important aspects of the game running on CLIENT SIDE was going to be. It was never a matter of if, but when. 
---
And despite the warnings, Bethesda still went Leeroy Jenkins with this game and here we are. I feel terrible about the people that wanted to play an online game about their favorite IP without knowing any of this. 
---
And btw, the people you call "hackers" are just random people just running a script, which requires almost zero technical knowledge. Most hackers don't do this shit because they get off of other people's suffering. When you release a hack to the public you most certainly expect it to be fixed by the next couple of days. That's one of the cornerstones of ethical hacking and without it almost all web services including facebook would be unusable. 
---
The only thing a hack needs to fuck people over is negligence, and Bethesda is full of it.
---
Jesus, give guy some slack. Not everyone is on reddit/discord/forums...
---
Well hey, good thing the game is a fairy tale...maybe there's hope yet.
---
If it were in a bucket of grease, Bethesda would actually be doing something to fix it.
---
ok thanks
---
let just hope that they do in fact fix all the hotfixs before they roll it out, test it and test it some-more, it seems when ever they fix anything, something else breaks --
---
Or it's someone who actually pays attention to what's happening in the video.
---
I have seen another video that actually shows someone's inventory disappearing. This video does not.
---
Give it 24 hours, I'm sure there will be plenty.
---
No more Bethesda funding from me.
---
Bethesda was told a week in advance about the hack. If they didn't care then, what makes you think they were going to care now? Go do something with yourself kid. Its my weekend and I'm not about to argue with some entitled child.
---
Step 1 - Initiate conversation with authoritative figure, explain that you are needed elsewhere to kill irradiated giant bats that control hordes of undead humans. 
---
Step 2 - After release from mental institution you can return to Appalachia for as long as your pre-war money lasts.
---
Most people here are probably the same ones who would put thousands of hours on Anthem, they probably got the game for like $5 and stick with it
---
1st has rejuvenated my game play, I love it
---
Did I say that or are you putting words I’m my mouth ass clown?
---
Because the sub is full of masochist zealots that enjoy this sorta treatment.
---
this
---
Sorry but if there's a 'community of hackers' and this is the best way they could come up with to hit Bethesda-- by screwing directly with the playerbase at a time when little to no help is available-- then they are just cowards with no ingenuity or moral compass. You don't attack citizens to send a message to a government, and you don't attack players to send a message to a game publisher.
---
But then, you obviously don't understand what an analogy is, so there's no point in continuing this exchange. You just won't get it.
---
They're literally on reddit asking. You cant load it up without seeing a huge amount of posts regarding the same thing.
---
Someone posted on this thread that if your friend force closes their game and you send an invite they should be able to join and make sure you have your server set to all friends and not team only.That seemed to work for me.
---
Because I do sort of like the game, and it's trading community. Also it's an online game that doesn't require time investment close to being a second job, which is exactly why I left WoW and ESO.
---
I do not pay for 1st, don't buy atoms, and all 3 accounts that I own (for trading mules) costed me about 50$ together.
---
I'm not playing now, till the fix is out, obviously.
---
Oh. I guess I didn't understand the situation. Bethesda might look bad over a game-crippling hack, and dozens of karma could be at stake.
---
As unfortunate as it is it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the game. You can't hold Bethesda responsible for others wrong doing. That's like blaming the government when someone breaks a law and claiming the government allowed it to happen. If a person is smart enough with computers anything can be hacked, cracked, bypassed, jailbroken or whatever. Never underestimate the perseverance of a thief.
---
Got hacked twice today, first time they "only" took my silver PA and TSE pipe revolver rifle, and second time, few mins ago the POS festering fuck bag who got me took my not even great armor... 
---
This morning when it happened I was honestly dumb struck for few mins before I looked at my map, letting the asshole get away, but when it happened again this evening  I immediately looked at my map and yes Neoarazorg, this time I saw you were the only level 4 toon within miles of me you absolute goddamn piece of shit scumbag!!! 
---
I spent HOURS AND HOURS farming my gear, and now some of my best pieces are gone. I will not touch this game again before my items are restored and I am totally confident that this hack has been fully patched and the perps banned FOR LIFE.
---
I have now logged my 3rd ticket with Bethesda today. Honestly hope this gets fixed soon, else nobody will stay on in this game..
---
He may have a character from the early days where you could surpass your stash box limit with the artillery exploit.
---
I gave the game an honest chance and soldiered through the disconnects and the mundane quests until survival mode was cutout... And then came the griefers. I was done. After playing The Outer Worlds and starting a new character in FO4, I just can't force myself to go back. 
---
I do like keep up with this sub though as it never fails to validate my contempt for the game.
---
You make me laugh. But i agree this exchange is leading no where. Enjoy living is blissful ignorance
---
I want to know why anyone still plays this game. Like I get it some people are fans but like with all this dumpster fire game has wrong with it why do people still support them? I am generally curious.
---
I would but I'm playing on my naked subsistence character. At most any hacker would gain is a few aid items, whatever head gear I found off the ground, and knuckles. Okay, I lied, maybe some junk and ammo that I accidentally picked up while quick looting.
---
Looks like alot of atom shop stuff in pic. Atoms are pretty easy to get though, just playing devil advocate.
---
The most ardent supporters are probably Fallout 1st subscribers with private server and are therefore (somewhat) insulated from this inventory-stealing hack.
---
It was never really a necessary thing for this game plus they wouldn't have needed to nerf everything so hard if that's what they did to begin with.
---
I have a bloodied pipe rifle that I can get to do 3k damage which is nice, but I think the reason you dont hear about them as much is because its dps is much worse than what the meathook offers. There's a video of someone killing the SBQ in just a few hits with one and all the buffs
---
You can just buy fallout 1st then regret the purchase and dont spend the atoms (they will remove them but not your membership).
---
I love that people think a "new engine" would stop hackers.
---
What a joke. Maybe you're all fallout fans and don't play multiplayer games, but new engine, old, updated... A cardboard box..... 
---
Doesn't matter. Hackers will happen.
---
Well if you are leaving then why wouldn't you just play until it happens, then maybe you can help catch them.  If you are planning on coming back don't say you are leaving
---
And I will agree that a hack to steal inventory from other players isn't something I've seen before. It's a bad situation for sure, and Bethesda's reaction will have a significant impact on this game going forward.
---
If they had traditional RPG aspects it would be something I played more. The aimbots mixed with the punishment of losing everything on death are a hard deterrent though. I’ve been running at night with no light on and have been aimbotted. Fuck dat.
---
Stop playing the game. There's literally nothing you can do
---
people say that playing private server is “safe” but... I switched to TESO until it is repaired...it’s a pity that my sub is still going...Beth. listen the man and repair it and give us some shit for our troubles and never ending supp!
---
The story is a fairytale, playing video games is reality 😂
---
Just the video. The loser is probably playing on his parents 486.
---
I'm playing on Xbox so yeah this makes me glad I'm on console as well.
---
I don't know anything about hacking or stuff like that,but i saw somewhere that their anticheat was just a few lines of code. I've personally never seen a hack like this happen on other online games with player inventories before, so I'm gonna chalk it up to Bethesda being too lazy with the engine and the anticheat. They've been absolutely raking in money on this game,and this stuff is still possible
---
Woah... Conan is still a thing?
---
I remember a thread on this forum where ”it sec” guys claimed the same. Thats even better to read now.
---
Na man I only use reddit for this trade post. And if he's like me, then I didnt see anything till this guys post. Was scrolling for a little
---
This is PC only.
---
Other than that article from last year where they claimed it was impossible to hack the game, we have not.
---
RIP
---
People that make tihs suggestion don't understand why Square Enix took the fucking game down in the first place, they took it down because  they had to rebuild everything on the servers essentially from scratch and couldn't keep them up supporting a version of the game that was going to be 100% obsolete when they were finished.  When the new XIV went online there was barely any connection between it and it's old version aside from the plot.  The maps, ui, class and battle systems... EVERYTHING had been changed in the interim.  Bethesda wouldn't need to take that route when all they're really doing is taking the existing game and patching it to be more stable and secure.
---
Just ran into that the other day... was really neat.  Hope he stays.
---
So you're suggesting that the people abusing this have no fault? That's as preposterous as saying Bethesda is completely at fault. Life isn't that black and white.
---
Let me make this easier to understand: Two wrongs don't make a right.
---
"deal, but we're going to start charging you for old content in the mean time." -Bethesda
---
Me too!
---
Heard that the beanie is droppable in game
---
it should have been free from the start to make a private lobby and that was what they told everyone before it came out
---
This is a great time to have 0 friends I guess...
---
I agree. I would gladly buy the sub, if the game was in acceptable state, same as I did pay for the ESO+. But until then, Todd is not getting a cent from me.
---
It's not the money - it's the principle.
---
It's not about blind fanboyism. 
---
It's about your experience. I've been playing since Beta and have had minimal issues with bugs, and being on PS4 issues with hacks have been non existent for me. 
---
My 76 experience has been just fine, as it has been for many of my console playing friends. 
---
The game could have been better at launch, sure, but I've gotten good value/fun for my money.
---
I think that would be true if the intent was to steal stuff and not just grief and basically destroy the playerbase.   New Players may be targeted too.  Sad really.
---
Sometimes I notice it’s a lot slower than other times, sometimes there’s no lag. Because it changes I assume it has to do with internet connection or server stability.
---
Yeah that sucks
---
Yeah, I don’t need someone to tell me about bugs in the game who doesn’t even play the game. It’s kind of funny to see the domino effect though. Once you see one Youtuber post a bug video then coincidentally you happen to see every other Youtuber make a video on the same exact thing. As if they don’t have the same exact audiences lol
---
I enjoy the game. I'm not a hacker.
---
unfortunately nothing as of yet.
---
fallout 76 slaves SEETHING
---
I had thought about that but if they took the items from the artillery and put it in the vending machines wouldn’t that change the values?
---
OK, let's just agree you're a hardhead and move on😱
---
Sometimes if you’re glitching try playing as another character to see if the same glitch happens. Then you can at least narrow it down to being an issue with your character or the game itself.
---
No. Just for PC elitist snobs.
---
You've completely missed OPs point. they are fully aware people will be aware for Christmas, hence why he said to ***give everyone fallout 1st for a month*** so people can play private servers, since Bethesda won't be in the office. 
---
All you've done is proved OPs point by trying to go against OP.
---
agreed
---
Well contact Bethesda
---
😂🙏🏻
---
Yeah I'm also how should I say, a victim. A lvl 3 guy - I think he was - took all my clothes, Santa backpack and my weapon. I was kinda expecting that, I stashed all my stuff before but still. It feels shit.
---
One thing what I regret, I forgot to remove the pink sprinkles paint from my x01, so now someone will enjoy the fruit of my hard work.
---
Assholes.
---
Yeah, but they’ve learned that they can garner that revenue without doing an ounce of real work.
---
You can have one on me then mate, free of charge
---
It’s the holidays.
---
If people did come in on call the devs would spend more energy to cut the exploit off. 
---
Plus it’s not dev’s job to respond it’s CMs.
---
i am a sub, and i agree. now is a bad time to get 1st.
---
Why do people like you feel the need to seek us out to ask a bad faith question?  To make the effort to shit all over a game that obviously isn't your thing?
---
R/vault51
---
I support this game and have played since day one and enjoy it every time I play. I do not have fo1st and do not have intentions of getting it. I am just the type of person who feels it's pointless to dwell on negativity and look for the positive aspects in things and life.
---
Not a bug. And nobody is forcing anyone to buy F1st. You could just not play the game?
---
I am a very "trust, but verify" kind of person.  I'll put my nice stuff someplace where it won't see the light of day for a while just out of an overabundance of caution, but I'd really like some additional confirmation on that from the community as well.  I'll continue to keep an eye out for more reports from additional sources.
---
The Glory of Todd has spoken!
---
Contact bethesda. But looks like new character really
---
That's not the hacker btw. That's just a meme.
---
On top of that, the glass cavern has dead crickets in it and you can come away usually with 50-60+ acid
---
This game has bigger holes than the Titanic.
---
The last update did something with inventory. My game was blue screen crashing when I tried crafting because I had too many items with 0 weight value on me.
---
Thanks for getting that reference. :)
---
Subject to terms and conditions, applicable differently depending on where you live.
---
Also, if you've played the game for a year, then decide you want your money back, you're probably out of luck.
---
If you forget to lock your front door does that mean I get to steal all of your shit and you're not allowed to call the cops?
---
Presents are a NW reward, one of the easier ones. 
---
There is a thread with pics, maybe google it?
---
Yes is has a craft able beard and can be worn with glasses and hat
---
Conan just got a horse update and like fo76 has its diehards. I'd play it over ark which to me is a glorified dinosaur babysitting game that looks horrible.
---
Wait.  You're saying I could've been selling my ball sweat this whole time?
---
To be fair, if it meant that Bethesda had to get their shit together and fix the fucking game, the hackers will have given *most of us* exactly what *we* want.
---
“I saw somewhere”
---
Man listen, it’s shit but it’s Bethesda. The code wasn’t meant for online play and they just pushed it in way too hard, now we’ve got this buggy game. People enjoy what they want to enjoy, if it was THAT easy to fix then they’d do it by now, but I’m sure it’s probably pretty complicated.
---
So don't play it.
---
Silence when there’s a problem is a corporate standard these days. I wouldn’t hold your breath.
---
That's a whole tube of tin foil you're wearing on yer head, bud.  Be careful you don't scratch yourself.
---
Might or might not. And not going to do it AFTER losing items I've been looking FOR WEEKS. Also, why do I have to stop using my clothing and weapons?
---
I uninstalled the game. I stick to my words. Never said I was coming back. For now I've given up. 
---
Don't put words in others' mouths, look for a better hobby.
---
To put out a warning has to go through the higher ups
---
If they are away on vacation, I hope they have remote access to their work PCs.  I work in a small business and I have it too.  I don't have to be physically in my office.  I have remote access set up in the holidays just in case I need to access my office PC.  I could be sunbathing in the beach and still be able to look at my office PC on my smartphone if I need to.  A high-tech firm like they are must have something like this.
---
'I enjoy the thrill of driving without a seatbelt'
---
😁+1
---
Newest post is 6 days ago and none of the posts have responses. Love the idea though. Thanks.
---
Right, so you've seen another video showing that what you originally didn't believe was occurring actually is. So we all can agree that your primary post was woefully incorrect, and indirectly calling people that were hit by this hack liars even if that may not have been your intention.
---
they did cutout survival ? lol
---
He had the scrap box, so he’s kind of a hypocrite, but pretty funny.
---
I think it's about time to switch games for a bit.
---
Not because of the response from Bethesda... rather, for creating, publishing and releasing a game that is so easily able to be hacked (again and again.
---
So? They can't pick up a phone to talk about a major fuckup?
---
It's fun mostly.
---
I don't think Bethesda could be that stupid.......... oh wait
---
I suspect this is to sell fallout 1st memberships for Christmas
---
More than one party can be in the wrong for the same issue though. So it's fair to say the hackers and Bethesda are douchebags.
---
Agreed, I like commando more than rifle build. But for me they both are good on ammo. Rifle only ends up doing slightly less damage with hardened vs power auto receivers. But sneak and gently tap the triggers. Switch back to rifle cards while you get ammo again, that way you can try n save ammo again. I have a bloodied pipe auto that I have like 7k extra .38 and it is great for crap mobs. I'd say turn a good combat rifle into a .38 receiver and use that ammo
---
Yes and since it counts as a separate piece you can wear it with other outfits.
---
Like Silver shroud with Santa beard
---
Chill. I have a console, I’m good.
---
Wrong. He's not hacking something he owns, he is hacking something someone else owns. mischief to data. Illegal and certainly actionable in civil court as well.
---
&gt; I think it’d be nice if everyone on pc would get free private server usage until they fix this.
---
It would be the **bare minimum** to do that ASAP.
---
Is this just a problem on PC or is it console as well?
---
The real issue with the Bethesda community is that we always say "it's Bethesda". If it were EA or Activision there'd be much more hell. People have to stop letting stuff slide just because it's Bethesda or else it'll just get worse and potentially ruin TES6 and Fallout 5
---
What?
---
I just discovered a 3rd thing to do:  Go back through some older characters and find out how jacked up their builds are.  I really had no clue what I was doing when I started playing this game haha.  Now to strip their inventory and stash and go about fixing things.
---
You don’t think it’s odd that the only way to safely play the game over Christmas is to buy a fallout 1st memberships? Try thinking.
---
Oh WOW! This stinks, this really STINKS!!!
---
I hope Bethesda has a hot fix like yesterday for it! Some people are so scummy it ain't funny...
---
I'm sure the PvP Raider crowd is loving this one...
---
I wonder if Bethesda having second thoughts on live service game they created instead of what most fans asked for which was coop as an option for a single player experience lol.
---
PC. It doesn't make it any more acceptable though
---
Could you write a more idiotic unrealistic response? No wonder you believe it doesnt work that way. But yo do you
---
Bethesda will just tell you that they cant replace lost items. So you're better off just starting again unfortunately
---
Upvote for the title and positivity.
---
They should roll back all accounts or at least all people who lost their stuff.
---
It’s actually a genius business idea. Make it so the only way to safely play the game over Christmas break is to buy access to private servers.
---
I am aware not every crime is prosecuted, and there have been arrests in India, though as far as I know they still have a school for fraud in Nigeria. Does that mean give up?
---
Maybe hes doing this to get a refund? Destroy game for everyone thus be able to claim refund.
---
What if I have pictures of those items?
---
Trying to troll the trolls? I like it.
---
Yes I could,  
---
&gt;Jokerchyld 1 point 12 hours ago 
---
&gt;does where I work. You just have to make it happen.
---
My inventorys always filled with the wrong kind of scrap, and I can never get anything I need
---
So would I but with all the hours I've been able to play on it and have fun despite the bugs I definitely got my $60 worth out of it. If you compare it to other entertainment such as going to a movie it's a bargain at $60. I just play it now knowing it has its problems but still have fun with it most of the time.
---
i was thinking the same thing, keep the content coming for your real fans, not the asshats on pc
---
Maybe hire the modders and hackers to train the developers? Or better yet, replace the developers?
---
True hero indeed, helping community till NPCs come out by being a raider. Dam Bethesda going to regret the idea of allowing players to be the NPCs.
---
It's possible if you have proof but they are unlikely to replace them you will get a generic message saying they cannot replace lost items. Like with the stash box issue. They couldn't replace exactly what you had just an offering
---
Just lost all my stuff.  
---
GG Bethesda
---
Tried it (to get holiday wreath and gifts).  Still hate it.
---
Have at 'er.  Can't see how Battle Royales survive.  But each to their own.
---
No dude.  I dont think Bethesda intentionally broke their game during the biggest buying period of the year so they could sell a few more subscriptions while losing countless others.
---
Honestly, it;s not wroth argueing about with the people here. The only people left are apologists or apathetic, they don't care as long as it doesn't happen to them. My advice, just give up on the game. The people who still support this game will never back down, they have to much invested at this point and they'd rather sink with this ship than admit that they're wrong or that they wasted their time. You're in the minority here, switch to a game that is properly managed and it will save you a lot of head ache.
---
Im saying that literally every single one of their games were bug-ridden from the start, so a game of this magnitude would probably be 20x everything we’ve experienced. The latest hack is whack as fuck though, and Bethesda really has to clean up their act
---
Don’t buy them being able to pull from stashes, I think that part of it is a feat tactic, otherwise they would have already done it and we’d see creditable reports, not throw away accounts claiming it
---
The hackers are absolutely part of the community.
---
You might be able to cut the rot off an apple and call the whole fruit good but I can't.
---
That's not how it worked. When you stored items in the artillery box and then stored the artillery, all of those items got stored in your stash box. So all he has to do is price them. But I'm not sure that would be able to happen unless the game doesnt register your pricing items in the vendor as removing items from the stash. Because if it doesnt, then that's how this occurred. Otherwise I have no idea
---
I’m waiting for the comment “if you don’t like it don’t play the game!”. Even when you’re polite on here people are assholes.
---
I thought this was the season of giving gifts. Not locking barricading and hoarding gifts. Lol
---
They don’t care lol
---
I bet its Bethesda employees trying to get more people to buy fall out 1st. I'm on ps4 so I'm glad I can still play. I don't have fallout 1st but I do like playing the game.
---
I don't consider logging on to dump some items as playing. I was on for a total of about 20 minutes and I knew that's all I was gonna do and then I was logging off. But you think what you want.
---
Also logging on to grab a free item and then turning off the game, also, I don't consider playing.
---
If you want to keep going that's fine, it just feels like you're grasping at straws here. Which also is fine if that's what you wanna do.
---
What scrap at you having trouble getting? Make sure you scrap all junk
---
The truly bad optics will be when the Atomic Shop invariably updates tomorrow, and there will still be no update to address this exploit.
---
Automated or not, that's going to reflect terribly on them.  And maybe it should.
---
This is a mess like the diapering scrap from the scrap box fiasco, and can be fixed like they did for that headache.
---
Keep pushing, because they can, and should, give players something for this. It costs Bethesda nothing to give restitution to players that have been scammed.
---
This time of year a lot of people have time off.  I have been playing more than usual the last few days, I was on last night for several hours and at first it was me and one other person, then within 10 minutes the server was fully populated.  A lot of people who play this game are not on Reddit and know nothing about this new hack, at least until it happens to them.
---
Screws aluminum and gears
---
It doesn't matter, Bethesda should have been prepared for an attack like this at all times, not when it suits them. 
---
It is a globally available online game, there is a level of support that needs to be there at all times that we are just not seeing here.
---
Ok. It’s just that now the only way to play the game is to buy access to private servers. People who want to play the game probably will. This seems like a very calculated move imo.
---
Oh trust me, I'm sure this was the last straw for a good chunk of people. This is just so unacceptable, its ridiculous.  Wastelanders better be the bomb to make up for all the other shit.
---
How dare you be so rude! This raider is actually a hero! How many hours will it take for you to get all that stuff back? Well thats time your replaying the game so in other words a soft new game + so get hunting!
---
I don't know much about hacking but I can't help but wonder when Bethesda Gaming Studios creates quests that actually require data mining, they're kinda setting things/opening themselves up to get hacked.
---
Yikes, with that build, set everything to low and play on 720p. You need to upgrade your PC very badly. At least with your motherboard you can upgrade to a newer Ryzen CPU, you should also get a SSD and new GPU. Or just get a new PC
---
Lmao I did this yesterday myself, it was so funny seeing people start raging in game, it was hilarious, especially after I did it to a level 800 haha
---
No one said anything about 'allowed' but you did leave me 'able' to do so.
---
More like youtubers trying to get paid off of it.
---
Then selling the gear they stole on top of it
---
All these flavors, and you chose to be salty. Yong deserves his views and dosh; he's reporting on the incident and getting it out to the public. He doesn't have to play the game to report on it, that's not his job. Those would fall on BGS and their QC team. Its like arguing a news reporter covering an incident doesn't have the authority to, unless they themselves were part of it.
---
Would love Bethesda to make this game properly not their typical maximize profits by cutting corners but they always had modders doing it for them so they will be having trouble with it.
---
Has a guy play the grinch song when he did it to me the other day, when he found nothing, he proceeded to try and wreck my camp. 😆 first troll I’ve seen in months.
---
Sorry that wasn’t directed totally at you. People in general. Happy holidays to you and all of FO76 as well!!!
---
iF yOu DOnT lIKe ThE GAEM dunT PLAAAAY- Stockholm syndrome fallout players using ergo decedo logical fallacies to defend fallout 76.
---
Do a sensible thing and play another game meanwhile.
---
100% correct, hence why Bethesda made this a live service game and still doesn't have an in game chat for PC lol.
---
Hell yeah happy to help!
---
Idk about minimal effort and development cost. Making the engine multiplayer was no easy task.
---
What's the appeal of Wastelanders anyway? Unless they're rebuilding the game from the ground up, what's the use of friendly human NPCs?
---
That is such a bad analogy.  News reporters are investigative journalists.  All Yong does is read subreddit posts on his YouTube channel.  A news reporter would make sure to at least *actually play the game* before reporting on it and especially if they’re giving their opinion.
---
No, Bethesda, not any company would purposely Release an exploit where thousands of players lose their items and stop playing the game, so they can sell subscriptions. Plus there's the fact that it would be illegal to do that ..smh
---
Once a month? Are you only logging in once a month? This comment was not helpful
---
How do I explain this... the random people abusing the .ddl script don't have my respect, and they deserve the hate their cheeto smelling ass is getting. But they are a *consequence*. If they don't abuse it then some other neckbeard will. When you work in web development, exploiters are a given. Because of that I still think the fault of this happening is Bethesda's fault.
---
They made a random mothman post on IG an hour ago lol
---
(yes I know their IG is probably run by an intern or something but still feels like a slap in the face that they're posting on IG but not addressing this)
---
That's what we call a coincidence.  They didnt do this on purpose, it's going to cost them a lot of players both old and new.  Take a deep breath, go outside, and get some perspective.  You'll feel better.
---
Add me on Xbox. Cajoetm
---
Me and my wife play together and we’re getting fo1rst next week hopefully
---
Eso is definitely a grind to be competitive. Fallout, less grind great past time.
---
The actual exploit isn't necessarily Bethesda's fault, but failing to address the user-submitted reports of hackers and griefers is.  Op is right.  These people literally brag about what they do to other users.  They do it because they know they won't get caught, or if they do, they'll just buy another copy and keep at it.  There is something wrong with these people, mentally, that leads them to do this.  And the only proper reaction is to swing the ban hammer hard and without mercy.
---
So you never played ESO, huh? Lmao.
---
Yeah dude, have you seriously been letting that shit just drip down your leg?
---
Hey they are great deal! The cost of the box itself makes it all worth it or you could make a fort out of them!
---
Lol, no...daily thanks (1857 hrs) I just don't play like an idiot.
---
Honestly I wish Bethesda would just form a team with the 30 best Skyrim modders, give them full rights to the engine and games and just be like "go for it guys" the modders have always made better content (even expansions) than Bethesda.
---
The thing is, I judge the game as a whole, not just the issues I have personally experienced. It's not about my experience. Just because I haven't experienced issues, doesn't mean they aren't still issues. Just because it doesn't snow where I live, doesn't mean that snow doesn't exist. I never experienced the Raid glitch that deletes player characters, for example, but Bethesda is still shitty for allowing that to happen.
---
That's why I say blind fanboyism. Because people will judge the entire game based on only what they have experienced, even when other issues are well documented. That's the kind of situation where people should say something like 'well for me I haven't experienced many issues so it's an 8/10 for me, but I know that tons of other players are experiencing more issues than I am and so overall the game is a 3/10.' Something along those lines, but people don't do that.
---
At this point it's start a new character or just don't play. There is also roll the dice but we'll be frank here, that shit sounds terrible.
---
Signing up for 1st is like putting a bandaid on a wound that is already just profusely bleeding. Unverified claims say they're targeting the private servers best they can (grain of salt and all, but this shit keeps coming true so, err on the side of caution).
---
I've enjoyed this game. But just having a sit &amp; stink about it, in all the MMO I've played this was never an honest concern. SMH at the whole situation.
---
Sometimes.
---
This upvote is just for the Dr Strangelove
---
I made a post about this and apparently I’m dumb to think this is a calculated move to make it so that the only way to play the game over a holiday break is to buy access to private servers.
---
They also don’t have anymore info on Wastelanders to give out
---
Nah this community has always mostly consisted of, at its core, gate keeping super in denial fanboys.
---
Those are good prices and possible steady stream of stocked items. Visit that vendor often. Win win
---
The gameplay is generic MMO hotbar of skills, and a diablo style class system. I played a lot of the game, the dark brotherhood questline in Anvil is straight up amazing, but it;'s not a TES game in terms of gameplay. It's an elder scrolls story, but it feels more like a Fallout:Tactics level offshoot than a continuation of the series and progression of the gameplay mechanics. FO76 actually felt and played like a fallout game but without the fallout story we're used to.
---
That would make sense on a regular exit but it doesn't save on crash so would alt+f4 be any different?
---
too busy getting in twitter flame wars with actors
---
Sorry, the dev team in general, and those devs and testers involved in creating patches are probably not at work this week.  Its not like they sit around waiting for redditors or forum users to point something out so they can patch it right away.  They do what their managers tell them to do.  You need to get the attention of the game director, not Joe Dev if you want fast action.  Even then they have to sort out how its being done before they can attack the problem.  It going to take some time.  If that is a problem for you try NW or a private server or play something else.
---
just take a break and wait for a fix. or play NW i guess. start a new char and level them.
---
That true? Does that make my instigating the Dragon worth something?
---
They arent just putting NPC's on the map.  They are changing a lot of locations and adding new ones. There are gonna be factions and brand new weapons and such. Its going to take place in the future of the game as well.  Its going to feel similar to what we have now, but its going to be a brand new experience.
---
power armor and inert flux :)
---
Yea, I've notice my character seems thirsty way more than usual.
---
(no diseases etc that would affect it.  Unless class freak is no longer working....ah, I don't even want to go there....)
---
Thanks for the compliment, though I had made the character as is rather than as a way to troll. 
---
She was originally going to be a Mistress of Mystery themed character and I wanted to level her fast. I did several runs of the West Tek facility to the point where I had to pick up and use the sledge hammers off the dead super mutants due to my sword breaking. 
---
Later I realized the regalia provided negligible armor, relative to the perks and mutations I acquired to buff her defense. So I took it off (since it doesn't break) and came to the conclusion wearing armor didn't really matter that much. To offset the cost of weapon breaking I decided on using knuckles since it only needed 17 steel to make a new one.
---
The player base has shown they will tolerate issues like this, and this would be the perfect t time to introduce this issue. The only way to play the game is to buy something. That doesn’t send off red alarms to people?
---
My armor has to be repaired once a day for a sentinel 25 and a 35 something with all the right weight reduce perks, so I don’t want to stop using them. But all of a sudden I’m having to drink 4 purified Waters every 15 minutes it seems.
---
"my dad works at Microsoft and he'll ban you from the Internet"
---
The framework already existed. If amateur modders could do it for 8 people all the way back in Skyrim you better believe it wasn't that hard of a job. However the engine wasn't meant for that and as a result we ended up with this highly unstable thing.
---
The way I see it, Bethesda is going to let this continue to happen so they can sell more subscriptions to the hardcore fans. “The only true fix is a private server” line. Sure, they might fix one piece or another as they crop up, but they’ll allow the exploits/hacks to continue in general. 
---
Honestly, I think the only thing that would make them truly fix anything would be a total loss of players. Cancel subscriptions, uninstall the game, and play something else. They get away with the stupid small stuff over and over because there’s enough people that put up with it and keep playing.
---
that your friend is Da Bomb ? :)
---
As others have noted, part of the problem is that there's a culture of hate based around Fallout 76 that actively wants it to fail.  If one has no shame, as YongYea has repeatedly proven he doesn't, you can make bank exploiting those people.
---
Personally, I choose to blame YouTube's algorithms more than anything.  They prioritize outrage for the same reason YongYea does - it keeps people hooked and watching.  It makes me laugh when YouTube's "Year in Review" video starts off with something like "In times of uncertainty."  Yes, and how much of that were *you* responsible for, Google?
---
So you think Bethesda is behind the hack?
---
Fallout 76 is an interesting case because unlike other games, Fallout 76 has been getting spotlight over past year for a lot of their 'mishaps'. This essentially gives haters more fuel to further their hate and extending this problem.
---
Of course? But nothing this bad. If "hackers will happen no matter what" we'd be seeing this level of hacking on every single game out there.
---
4 characters with over 100k caps... this is the problem. This is what creates imbalance in the game for people who don't cheat and play as 1 character.
---
Supposed to be only on pc. Basically anyone withinin range of you can access your inventory and loot you like a dead body.
---
Hell is other people, as someone once said sometime All good this end matey, may Santa bring you all you wish for 🙏🏼
---
Honestly, it seems a little too good to be true. All for you if you're excited for it, but I'd keep my expectations grounded.
---
Bethesda released this hack so more people will buy fallout 1st to save their accounts. That's why they will wait till after Christmas break. I feel bad for pc players i'm on ps4.
---
I know. Have been considering trying it out on console again but didn’t want to if this is a thing. Was also considering getting a new gaming pc but with all the problems with this game and RDR2 I’m not sure it’s worth it right now
---
Ok thanks for the clear up thought I’d have to wait for the bug to be fixed.
---
I did smart ass
---
That guy must be a badass
---
PC only as far as I know. There are some YouTube videos which loosely describe it - I think JuiceHead posted one. It does not show how to do it, just proves it exists and the rough mechanics of what happens.
---
I guess Bethesda is just going to write off the pc version of the game lol.
---
I'm pretty sure that it's possible to just do a server rollback undoing everything and applying a patch. At least that is what I would think to do.
---
there is a hack that allows someone to steal items from someones inventory without having to initiate trade with them. its only on PC. you are on PS4 so no worries for you as of now.
---
I literally have no idea what you're trying to say here. Could you try again?
---
Bethesda will quickly get their ass in gear if they see the player count drastically drop, support tickets rise and atom shop sales fall.
---
Can you play with vanilla equipment? Think of it as a challenge.
---
I used to program when I was younger, so I do understand the nature of this particular exploit/abuse. Using the terminology 'hacker' is just easier when posting here.
---
I understand and even agree with most of your statements. I simply disagree that it can be blamed completely on Bethesda. Mostly? Sure thing, I would agree that they should have done better.
---
You really have to ask?
---
So it would be more like each player hosting themselves?
---
Contact support to receive 100 atoms compensation.
---
This.  I posted same,  should have just read on!
---
I would assume so they aren't knocked out
---
That is a relief but I feel bad for everyone on PC because anyone can just take all your hard earned gear.
---
I got a tin foil hat for sale cheap.
---
The type of people who do this don't care about their accounts and will get new ones in their place once banned. See: the NW hacks on PC for months
---
 Bethesda needs to implement countermeasures that require effort.  Or, maybe don't build an online addition to a major franchise using one of the most easily modifiable engines in PC gaming history.
---
&gt; No it has its issues but over ark and Conan I choose fallout.
---
Over a punch in the mouth and a kick in the balls, I choose punch in the mouth.
---
They actually took the servers down, removed unattainable items and released a fix for that exploit like 2 or 3 days after they learned of it.
---
Always a delight!
---
This is how I feel, too. When something is this “almost good”, it’s natural to be upset about the bullshit that’s holding it back. I think the concept and most of the story is very cool. It’s on par with all of the other Fallout experiences I’ve had. It’s mostly just the technical blunders that make this game bad, and that sucks! This game has so much potential, but it’s being handled by... I don’t know... a team of drunk pandas??
---
It’s very convenient for them. The only way to safely play the game over Christmas break is to buy a fallout1st membership. They’ve sold you he solution to the problem already...
---
"amateur modders" Yeah those modders weren't fucking amateurs and it took them years. To this day that mod isn't entirely done, partly do its complexity and partly to do set backs. Either way it is in no way an easy task. You are wrong. What you should be complaining about is no the engine having minimal effort (it didn't), but the minimal effort in security implementation and controls. Even simple shit like encrypting network data was not done at release lol. But yeah keep bitching about the engine.
---
I'm pretty jaded by it all, but that is a bit too tinfoil hat for me.
---
If BGS were behind it why leave consoles unscathed, for instance. Mass majority of player base is console derived. 
---
Some area 51 level shit your getting at, and it just doesn't fit.
---
Man I’d help you but I don’t play often. I accept anyone’s team invite.
---
Smart. A truly survivalist/minimalist feel, too. Plus not needing all the scrap leaves more time for exploration and playing instead of looting.
---
Well done, my friend.
---
The sad part is that the "professional" game news sites do this too.  They base entire articles on what people on Reddit are saying, with zero attempt to follow up or elaborate.
---
I don't know why.  It seems like all that does is perpetuate an exodus from their site to Reddit, because why should I care about a secondhand report if I can go straight to the source? 🤣
---
I can honestly say that the only time I’ve been griefed was early on, didn’t understand the implications of workshop/PvP and got thumped good and proper. This is my first venture into online community gaming since Dead Rising and I’m having a great time.
---
I got mounted heads from completing daily quests and stuff like that, never from the actual animal.
---
No. I think of it as an unfair annoyance
---
If you log in and do ANYTHING,  that's playing. Sry, bud.
---
maybe bethesda with be able to do rollbacks like they did for a few people that lost their inventories from that vault raid glitch
---
Hopefully that is what the hackers want yeah? Hopefully most of them are doing this to make a point and hopefully it finally gets through to Bethesda yeah. So? Sorry after all the shit thats happened with 76 I'm not going to put all the blame on some random taking advantage of Bethesda's incompetence. Bethesda needs a wake up call and if this works for that then thats fantastic.
---
Keep moving in a circle.  But unless youre on a private server, i wouldnt afk or even log in for PC right now.
---
Agreed. We all need to stop playing until BGS does something major to fix this. I’m not giving them any more money, and I know I’m not alone feeling this way. We won’t come back for Wastelanders either. So they will end up losing more money than they gain from the “hardcore fans” if they just let this continue or just put a band aid fix.
---
So best course would to just put all your stuff in your stash but then of course you would have nothing to fight with.
---
I mean putting them in your camp, the plans come off various quests and enemies.
---
&gt;The best you could say is probably, “Thanks for letting us know”
---
And you know what?  That's better than nothing.
---
Don't know why you're apologizing. I disagree with you anyway.
---
I also stored an item in my camp and it wasn’t there and I was looking at my remote to make sure I didn’t scrap it and pressed double x.
---
Even though your point is valid it does matter if they are sabotaging their own game to sell subscriptions.
---
Let’s just say there “stuffed”
---
Agreed, 100%. The game has all the elements to be the best in the franchise, but it’s being held back/pulled down by its creators.
---
Are PCs more vulnerable and easier to hack than consoles?
---
I'll definitely add you ... I've got 1st currently so feel free to join :)
---
&gt;help catch them
---
Are you an abortion survivor?
---
calling it a server is just common phrasing, we know what he meant.
---
each spooling up of a private instance takes resources, it takes more computer resources to give each player or small group their own private instance than it does to do it for groups of 20.
---
having exponentially more instances active would probably at least double the real-world computing resources of the game.  they are not going to do that.
---
Supposedly stashes aren’t entirely safe either but I’m no expert with this. I’m on PS4 a also and mostly staying on private with friends I actually know.
---
Can happen in NW on PC also - but aim assist and other problems galore there (so I’ve heard anyways)
---
I said it was frustrating for people who have been playing for over a year and there is no end in sight. It makes the game not fun (and this is the place people voice what's not working well in the game). Judging by your dismissiveness I assume you cheat and play with more than 1 character creating a larger cap pool than the game intended. That is the ultimate problem.
---
Sent you a message
---
I find a bunch of ballistic fiber but never pick it up so maybe you can even ask some players for it because I’d give you some.
---
Yeah. If you're level 380...
---
I have lost all hope for another fallout game from Bethesda.... have them step down, time for obsidian to take the rights!
---
A very profitable coincidence.
---
So this was a FO1 private server?
---
Don't play.
---
If it forces people to buy memberships to play why wouldn’t they?
---
I've seen posts around but no definitive proof.
---
It really does sound too good to be true, considering the past of this game, but they have been working on this dlc for quite a long time. So it better be good.
---
Theu cant steal caps or scrips the person who made it conformed that part. If its not true and theres proof please share.
---
So you are practically screwed if you play on PC unless you find a server with no hackers (which I suspect is pretty hard) or own fallout 1st. What the hell happened to this already broken game.
---
Yeah the initial post here said some of the Bethesda dev accounts messaged him for more info
---
I'd recommend NOT GIVING BETHESDA YOUR MONEY at all for FO 1st, quit enabling them to treat you like shit and deliver a pisspoor product. Vote with your wallet and time, plenty of other great games out there.
---
Why is upgrading not possible? Voids the warranty or smth?
---
This is bad but I feel the worst is yet to come, remember when everyone’s personal information was on display for anyone to grab. There will be a further breach and I will not be surprised when it happens... sorry for anyone who still likes the game, I left a long time ago
---
How scummy can you get? This scummy...
---
I see one of his other videos is a trader trap. Then I read the comments, and the Bethesda haters came out of the woodwork...
---
People really do ruin it for everyone by being little scummy criminals...
---
Yes they won.
---
I don't find enjoyment in playing a game vanilla-forced.
---
It's not about being terrified, don't be ridiculous
---
You don't find sense in my words? Well, look again.
---
Because it seems to me you don't want to find any in the first place.
---
I'm with you. Likely they notice but still want to karma farm.
---
It ain’t much but it’s honest work
---
I mean he only makes videos following popular opinions. Thats his entire channel. He sees a controversy and makes a video only if it gets popular enough so that his videos get enough views for the circlejerk. He doesn’t really do any investigating or anything he waits until someone from that community finds something like a flaw, sees it when it gets popular and makes a video regurtating the post he saw. Hes just fanning the flames of every hatetrain. His channel is a 10 min minumum circlejerk that ends in a YOOOOOONNNGGGGOOOUUUTTT.
---
That’s assuming everyone actually stays away. They’ve been lucky because so many people look past their blunders/failures and just keep plugging away. Even just uninstalling, staying off for a week, then coming back would give them a sign.
---
I go for the snallygasters at toxic larrys, cool to look at and fun to kill, plus they count for the cryptid challenges
---
Shoulda noped out at the $18 blue power armor, I feel terrible for everyone who lost their stuff.
---
Screen shot, screen shot, screen shot
---
Might be true, but there are also people making ten's of thousands of dollars on them as well :P
---
I haven't checked. Don't know how to feel about that if it's true.
---
It's what they deserve (Bethesda), tbh.
---
Losing players isnt profitable bud.  I dont know why you don't seem to understand this.  This is really bad for Bethesda, they aren't going to profit from this.
---
Yahoo, cyber attacks in-game, is this going to be Fallout 76's Y20k Bug!  Are cargo bots going to fall from the sky! are all the nukes going to continue to go off. Sound exciting it makes for an awesome DLC! lmao 
---
No, some idiots, are trying to make a point that they can ruin an already broken game. Don't get me wrong I love this broken game, yes the bugs do piss me off, but I still love it! 
---
I hate to say it, why are we even worried, why is this even our problem? If shit hits the fan, I am just going to laugh, check my bank accounts, and pick up the pieces and move on. This is Bethesdas problem, they need to address this issue, its something called  "due diligence" I know that Bethesda does not want any more controversies or maybe they do! It is all free advertising, good or bad. And in addition, If this was such a big issue why aren't they addressing this issue head-on, letting the community now this all under control!  Or even better we find out that these Badass Hackers are rogue employees from Bethesda. 
---
I apologize for being smarty pants, I appreciate the heads up! I just find this so comical at the end of the day, especially because of it being a game. Don't get me wrong I would feel bad if someone, got screwed by these douchebags.
---
None the less, I wish you and everyone the best, I hope everyone has a Happy Mutated Christmas, and Happy Scorched New Year!
---
The issues with GTAV happened because Rockstar half assed their game and then had to do massive over hauls to the game's back end and adjust its economy by wiping the cash in a shit ton of accounts.
---
lolol of course I played ESO, I got the achievement for doing all of the quests for Daggerfall Covenant. I enjoyed the game, but an Elder Scrolls game it is not. PvP was great though
---
Truee
---
Pointing out that losing digital goods is not akin to being physically robbed is not being "weirdly sympathetically to a bunch of scum bag low life hackers". If you've been actually robbed you know it's not as simple as "losing $20", it changes you forever. Get real.
---
PS4 is full of “features” but still fun with friends who play regularly.  There are many things to fix but this should be top priority right now - who knows if it is...
---
More chance of a lottery win, bud. Sorry.
---
If you are on console make sure that you are the only profile signed in. If you aren't this can happen.
---
Don't. For real, don't come.
---
Can confirm, I'd rather lose all my digital pixels than be actually robbed again.
---
It means go and play something else.
---
Do you SERIOUSLY think Bethesda is capable of running private servers at this point? Why have any faith left in them? Fool me once or something...
---
Yeah other people already corrected it my guy but thanks, on the discord someone was mistaken when I first heard the story
---
For a better reward let's just remove p2w
---
1.) they don’t care
---
2.) they’re doing this to force people to buy fallout 1st memberships. 
---
3.) They. Don’t. Care.
---
Because that's a really dumb theory.
---
Actually I wanted a multiplayer fallout. I like playing with my friends online. It was a great idea that was poorly executed.
---
Protest what? The hack? Meh, I'm console so i don't care and i like the game.
---
Yeah well my friends don’t wanna play as the game requires you to have the enough space for practically another fallout 76. For a damned 8 gb update.
---
Crazy how in 2019 some people are begging for Bethesda to allow them to play BY THEMSELVES in a FALLOUT GAME
---
Oh my bad I missed the fallout 4 part
---
&gt; dubious youtube personalities
---
triggered much ?
---
HOPEFULLY they're silently fixing the issue as not to alert the hackers. But there should be no less noise from the community over this issue.
---
I fling Grinchers off the side of the cliff I'm on 😬👋

I had to do a complete uninstall/reinstall recently. That’s a few hours even with fiber optic speeds.
---
I’ve heard it’s not 100% confirmed to be PCs only. I’d be careful.
---
Cheers adding you now :)
---
what about starfield?
---
Exactly this sentiment thanks for saying this and putting it into words lol
---
Need a better fix then buying a Membership
---
lmao you guys have said enough is enough a bunch of times yet you still play this game hahahhahahaha
---
I’m happy it was released tho so that it can be patched
---
Because it's stupid, illegal, thousands of players would quit playing due to the loss and frustration, people would be demanding refunds for the game and for their store purchases. People would sue Bethesda and Bethesda would lose a lot. 
---
No, nobody would do that to seek a sub for 14.99
---
STOP. No company would ever do this. Stop.
---
I haven't played either... I just remember some guys at work several jobs ago that were playing it when it came out.  It was interesting to me to see it survived enough to still be online.
---
I find that hard to believe when you first sentence opens with "The fact that there's rigid classes and skill trees for one " when ESO has one of the most flexible class systems in any MMO. Anyone class can use anyone weapon and armor and any combination of their related abilities and passives. The only thing locked behind classes are the 3 class specific skill lines. lol.
---
Also never forget that you chose to play a multiplayer game that was built on an INCREDIBLY outdated single player engine that had troubles running fo4 XD Also don’t forget how everybody in this sub still defends Bethesda LOL
---
Gonna have to refute you on that professor. News reporters gather and disseminate info from a number of sources, whether it be firsthand or secondhand sources. Like you stated Yong reads subreddit posts, which would be considered second hand sources. In addition he draws info from vids (going as far as showing them) of the incident, as well as browsing the forums of these hackers.
---
My solution 
---
Your on the better platform your good. Computer nerds are stealing people’s stuff and ruining the game on PC because their moms won’t let them stay up past 9.
---
Right. I grew up on Conan and prefer the fantasy elements.
---
I had to delete fallout 4 and skyrim but then I reinstalled skyrim only (fallout glitched and black-screened)
---
Fucking LOL 😂 your defense is they started 9 years ago???????? What a joke. Everybody downvoting me - just google “cognitive dissonance “
---
Mostly right now it's just equipped items
---
you too!
---
Sure, if you’re looking to fill the “fallout like” void outer worlds is the obvious answer. Minecraft, the forest, 7 days to die, for the survival/building plus many others these are just off the top of my head there are newer types of these games that probably look better. I highly recommend Outer Wilds(not worlds), Red Dead 2, Sekiro, Halo Reach, Resident Evil 2, Untitled goose game, any Nintendo game, many of the games on Apple Arcade, the list goes on. So many fantastic adventures are out there that don’t slap you in the face over and over for being a fan.
---
I do have 5 characters. Not one is higher than lvl 65. Maybe have a total of 10k-15k caps total. And I don’t cheat. I just don’t bitch about things “being unfair”. I’m also on PS4 so I doubt there isn’t too many ways to “cheat”.
---
Also I’m really sure you are being a voice for others...it’s all you bro that’s frustrated. I’m frustrated too, frustrated with cry babies who are mad they are not getting their “fair share”. Do more work and play more. 
---
If not...
---
Grow up and move on.
---
This guys name is BodegaTheKid get a hardware ban on him. He’s scammed me before he’s a total fuckbag
---
I wish that made a difference to me.
---
That is hilarious. Even more so as the standard answer of Bethesdas customer service is that they "don't have the tools" to replace lost items. Well it seems that hackers and dupers do have the tools so there is that
---
I mean this is kind of the prime weakness of the creation engine itself. It's very customizable which is awesome for single player where you can mod to your hearts content (no pun intended) but also very bad for online games where basically the same applies but now it hurts people
---
You too :)
---
Pretty sure the hackers created the problem
---
Are you insane? Okay, let me spell it out for ya: If a hacker, being the low-down god damn dirty #&amp;#$er that he is, steals my Light Wood Laminate and uses it as his own, he is not only getting a valuable item for FREE, but he has DEVALUED any other Light Wood Laminates I might build in the future. He was effectively robbed me IRL in real life through in-game inflation. Think before you post next time, my dude.
---
But the fact that there's classes at all along with stuff that was never in an Elder Scrolls game. Sure everyone can use any weapon skills, but the fact that abilities are locked in and also original to this game gives the credence to my argument. It plays like a generic MMO gameplay wise and not an Elder Scrolls game
---
'some random taking advantage of Bethesda's incompetence'
---
In reality, some anti-social personality stealing gear from players two days before Christmas so they can get a laugh. I love how you polished that turd though.
---
It's not a script, exactly.  It's code injection.  They use third-party tools to scan sections of memory accessed by the game and intercept those functions with their own, corrupted versions.
---
That’s the definition of blind fanboyism XD
---
No, but the amount of “oh my god this game is dead look at this lulz” shit has made me weary of literally anything anyone on YouTube says. It’s kind of the worst place to get your information in the world, so excuse me for being skeptical. But please, continue to gain your life experience and knowledge from people who talk into a camera their mom bought them for a living, I’ll continue to verify shit!
---
During a Holliday the most they have is security and the occasional cleaning crew. It’s very rare for a dev no matter what department yo be at work at this time of year. The studio does not have the budget set to pay at triple time to have a developer there.
---
On now drop me an invite

Fool me once shame on...shame on you? Fool me I cant be fooled again

A bloodied pipe revolver build can solo KO scorched queen in about 6 mins ish. Meat hook less than a minute. Lever action rifle not a contender. Pipe revolver hits harder and faster than the lever action.

1. Completely redundant. "Scripts" aka Console Commands, can unmark quest items.
---
2. The problem stems from the fact that it's an engine that's widely known for console commands. Using these scripts is about as hard as injecting a tiny bit of code in a .dll file.
---
Wow. 
---
Why did you ask me if you already knew the information?
---
Possibly not, your private server is still connected to the main servers. Frankly I would say any company would be able to keep them separate and safe... but I mean have you seen this game?
---
ThaiMiUpSukMiDown
---
Why not?  Bethesda is developing and selling a game that it clearly doesn’t play.
---
A roll back is the best fix right now,
---
Yes some will lose their progress for one day or two but it is nothing compared to someone losing all his gear.
---
What if the hackers are actually Bethesda trying to push up subs?
---
Most of the people using hacks like this aren't people who play 76; they're doing this to fuck with the game and its players, largely for fun and in many cases I'm sure because they hate the game. But you're going to include people like that as part of a community? That makes no sense at all. People outside of a community who attack the community are not part of the community. It's common sense.
---
The community itself does have shitty people I'm sure, people who actually play the game and are disrespectful. But being trolled by people like that, or just encountering jerks, is not a commonplace situation.
---
Good idea , I built an automatic pipe rifle yesterday when I was testing a build .. perfect mooching around the forest
---
So let me make sure I've got this right, because YouTube has had a lot of negative content about Fo76 you refuse to watch the few creators attempting to make positive content for the game?
---
speed deamon uses more food water etc and other health buffs
---
Fuck a free month of first.  
---
Give us our shit back or \_give us a full fucking refund\_.
---
I think it's awesome.  I own a PC that faster than my Xbox (1070 + Ryzen 2600) for VR, too.  Still don't use it for multiplayer.  On console, It's pretty much guaranteed to be fair.  That's why I do multiplayer on Xbox.
---
Yup the hackers are pretty shitty people sure, I don't think you'll find anyone who disagrees friend. However if these hacks finally wake Bethesda up and get them to take action and invest time and money into a new engine then I'd say that's worth it.
---
Yeah it's really sad to see. Even sadder in a way is all the people celebrating it just because some people enjoy a game they don't like that makes it okay to them.
---
The hit to their reputation and loss of sales going forward will far exceed any short term gain on FO1st subs.  People thought your idea was dumb because of the way it is.
---
Nope. Take the L.
---
Maybe this will be our own Christmas miracle! 😉
---
It doesn’t mean less people playing though, people can still play IF THEY BUY FALLOUT 1st. the solution IS FOR SALE.
---
Surely that requires Bethesda to care?
---
Yesterday I read "LOL no one would steal your crap gear, this is fake"
---
No, it's not in any way/shape/form a false equivalency. You feel you are free to comment on things you had no part in creating, and Yong feels he is free to comment on things he has no part in playing. Both of you are right though - you can give your opinions on anything you like, but Yong isn't going around telling YOU that you can't have your opinions. This is super simple stuff, if you don't like it don't watch it, but he absolutely has every right under the sun to make those videos. Plenty of stuff you likely give opinions on that you have no direct involvement in, so it's a weird thing to try and tell others not to. 
---
Terrible try though.
---
Thanks glad to see theres some sanity here!
---
Maybe I should play in my underwear and also strip my character down to his underwear to keep hackers away.
---
So when the stashbox issue with Fallout 1st happened, the support team publicly acknowledged that they had tracking measures in place to determine if junk items had accidentally been lost or hidden. 
---
Assuming that this tracks more than just junk storage and what we know they track like ammo, caps, etc then they likely will be able to show a log of exactly what was or wasn't stolen (to prevent the other shitty side of people lying claiming they lost some full set unyielding scout or whatever when they in fact lost nothing) .
---
Until it's fixed a number of people individually have been offering their private servers for people who want to keep playing without fear of hackers but while this is all pretty crazy right now I'm incredibly sure that anyone who actually loses anything like this will be able to get it back but I'd recommend not playing on an account that has lost anything in case roll back has limitations to number of previous last saved states.  (Similar to how their FO4 and Skyrim cloud saved games work)
---
I was looking forward to grinding out scorched kills for the experience and the gift drops. Now I'm afraid to go anywhere near the game so I don't get stripped of my inventory. So since we have had complete silence from Bethesda on this, are they planning on extending the Christmas event?
---
I see this happening, a huge roll back will most likely be what comes from this. People just need to be patient. This whole thing sucks, but so does the attitude around here...
---
Apparently more than you, bud.
---
But that's my argument why ESO isn't like other Elder Scrolls games. The fact that some things are locked out based on your class. That's your L to take my guy lol
---
They don't care. But the "they" is the financial office who doesn't care to let time and effort be spent on this issue. Short of a major drop in however this game is profitable for them, nothing is a priority for them to fix.
---
Surely they should
---
 think most of the dupers are shitting themselves and "helping" after one of theirs went rogue and started to take the steal inventory route, which is highly illegal btw since it can also steal atom items (which is RL currency based so its basically online fraud, theft and data theft) which means if bethesda do decide to do a full law sweep they could be dragged in if they dont help.
---
criminals will do all sorts of bad things till they know they could face being sued or prison in which case they start singing and backstabbing eachother for their own safety.
---
Who the hell is behind you. Lol, “Supermutant” EXHALES SLOWLY ON NECK.
---
Stop playing and give your time and money to someone better?
---
Cheat?  You are ALLOWED 5 characters in the game?  WTF do you mean by cheat?  It is part of the game....If you do not have at least 2 characters then you are 1 in 1000 or more that do not run at least 2.  It is not a problem as I have 4 characters...levels 411, 165, 45 and 10...the last one is strictly to hold caps and extra gear....It gets kind of boring once you get to level 150 or higher so you start new characters and play a different build....This is quite common and you are by far the minority if you are not doing so yourself.
---
Juice gains 1 level every 2 weeks
---
The solution to the problem is literally on sale and you’re saying I’m dumb basically. Lol ooook. They broke they game and are selling the fix!
---
I like what's happening right now.
---
Really shows how incompetent Bethesda is.
---
I wouldn't worry about getting your stuff stolen as Bethesda will just drop more than what you owned later.
---
Imagine paying a monthly sub for this to happen. 
---
Merry Christmas lmao.
---
Everyone stolen items.
---
Not stonks
---
Thats an incorrect analogy. Fallout 76 isn't the players window to leave open. Everyone here has paid and a lot continued to pay a company to ensure that window stays closed to they can have an enjoyable secure experience. 
---
That hasn't happened though and now the paying customers are suffering BECAUSE BETHESDA were the ones to happily leave the "window" open. 
---
Sorry but companies need to be held accountable when they're paid for a service or product. All there is to it. It's worse considering Bethesda was WARNED this might happen a year ago and dismissed the warnings in their arrogance.
---
Even in Morrowind/Oblivion, your skills didn't matter. A sorcerer could take skill points in ANYTHING and be sufficient. A warrior could take up Conjuration just fine. Also many abilities in ESO have never existed in ES before, like that little light spear Templars throw
---
Lol what, your original argument was that I can’t comment on Yong’s videos because I don’t create them.  That’s not at all equivalent to my original statement.  
---
Are you trolling?
---
On Xbox, NW has about 5-6+ fully populated servers (48-52 players) about 18 hours per day when the seasonal events are NOT active. It gets higher with seasonal events. About 10-25% of those players are hiding in a bush. As sneaky as they think they are, they're super easy to find.
---
Oh, that's Gram. He said something about meat-weak being over but he still has plenty of meat for me or something.
---
This shit is a pure, fiery, mass casualty train wreck. You don’t want to look, but you just gotta!
---
very fun, though i'd put some stuff in the way of the terminal slightly so they HAVE to pull around to the box and onto the flipper panel ;P
---
&gt; She just started a shaman on wow classic
---
WoW classic is an amazing game, hopefully she can find some enjoyment with it and not be too bummed about losing all her stuff.
---
As it doesn't look like anyone has tagged the CMs. u/Valseek u/Ladydevann u/BethesdaGameStudios_ u/CM_PipBoy
---
If any of you can give us an update on the situation it would be very helpful, even just a "we are aware of the situation and are working to resolve it quickly" would be very much appreciated.
---
Oh I know, it was originally used for some low tier MMO's back in 2008. However most of that was stripped out over the years and the big issue is the multiplayer in FO76 comes from the quake multiplayer engine being Frankenstein boot strapped onto the creation engine with duct tape is the real problem.
---
Umm, why does he look naked?
---
Gary
---
The ultimate stash.
---
It's not, because the same hackers have already cracked private worlds. That's coming next.
---
I’m sure their only thought is how to make FO77 (or whatever the next game is) subscription mandatory. I just hope there’s someone capable of hacking the game to allow it to run offline and with mods &amp; community bug fixes, after the wastelander’s update of course. It’s the only thing that would make me come back and play the game.
---
ITS A CONSPIRACY!!!! FALLOUT 1st ISNT THE ANSWER! TAKE OFF YOUR TIN FOIL HAT 🤪
---
Thanks for the hard work!
---
To serve me the meat...

---
Jimquission, Yong and Legacy (and probably 50 other creators) are bad mouthing this game but I am glad they do. If you draw enough criticism, maybe, JUST maybe they might try to fix it, instead of monitizing the shit out of it.
---
The dupersrus hackers apparently released other hacks as a joke to disrupt the market (they obviously profited off eBay sales). 
---
This new hack by whoever is purposely malicious and tries to punish players who play the game legit by stealing everything they earned. 
---
I stopped playing the game 6 months ago but I still follow the news because I have invested time in the fallout universe
---
Thanks for the laugh 😂
---
Console master race
---
your english is fine dont worry.
---
i know your pain, i bought this on day 1 (pre-order) and still feeling the sting from that cost before blackfridays insult reduction :/
---
Gary?
---
put the link into the "body" of the post and it should give a picture
---
Thanks for the positivity! 👍
---
Yeah, he's just a YouTube troll.
---
I think TES and any other projects will be ok - different studios, teams, and all that.
---
The Fallout franchise might be screwed though. I'm afraid it'll get the Mass Effect treatment and get shelved.
---
The ultimate treasure
---
Just because other developers use older engines and don't have issues doesn't stop this from being an engine issue. The Creation Engine is a frankenstein creation thats had the same issues for nearly a decade with nothing done about it. 
---
Even worse MODDERS have fixed issues with the game which Bethesda haven't incorporated themselves. 
---
Furthermore they were warned over a year ago this might happen and did nothing. 
---
Of course it's not 100% due to the engine but it plays a big part of it.
---
Gary clones. Hundreds of them.
---
Lol right 😂
---
I'm betting a huge bunch of treasure - probably a tonne of gold with the vault experiment being testing how the dwellers deal with the responsibility of sharing or hoarding it
---
Most likely literally fucking nothing. They owe us full refunds and/or our shit back. In practice? They probably won't even fix the exploit in a timely manner.  
---
Reality is...we're all idiots for giving this company our money. That's over for me, bethesda will never get another fucking cent from me.
---
Oh ok thanks 👍🏿
---
Go back to TOTW Rose
---
Someone pretty much dropped that something even bigger will happens on 24th and 25th, and I honestly can't imagine what's bigger than this, maybe they can just straight up take your character and walk away?
---
Respect 🤣💪🏿
---
...I would take a 2 week rollback. I'd still have 90% of the gear that got stolen, or lower quality but still decent alternatives.
---
I'de like to sa yes mainly cause the online architecture of consoles and pc's is different and alot of the time hacks have to be tailor made to work on consoles and some consoles have to be fucked with to work with mods while on pc the architecture is relatively the same but im a console user and don't know much about pc just my two sens and a small reason why i think the console community is restively unscathed at least for now
---
It is though and that is why it is your L to take.
---
THE thing you need to be taking away from this statement is the **CUSTOMER SUPPORT** part.  They're not saying that lost items can't be returned, they're saying THEY can't do it.  This is standard in any online game like this, customer support doesn't have access to or control over anything that actually effects the game, they're just a call center somewhere handling Bethesda's calls next to all of the other companies they're contracted to.  Any inventory rollbacks will have to be handled by the devs themselves.
---
Lol. That's right.
---
Consoles are locked down in a way PCs are not. They should NOT shut down consoles.
---
You probably play on a Switch Lite.
---
I played the shit out of this game Initially and successfully convinced my self it wasn't that bad. Havnt touched it in 7or 8 months and have no idea why anyone still trys convincing others it's not a dumpster fire
---
Prior to stopping playing on PS4 ~3 months ago I would rarely see a lot of people on a map.  Those that were there were doing 2 things: building/modifying their CAMP or sitting around waiting for players to use the vendors. 
---
It was just dead.  I really do not see a long-term survival of this game.
---
ANd skills don't matter in ESO... any class can take skills in any tree and be viable (technically although maybe not practically).
---
I can skip the first step: invitations have never worked at all for me or my one friend that plays. We have tried to add each other repeatedly and it never works. Well for once a broken Friends system works in my favor, haha!!
---
No, I mean you must NOT apologise for asking a more than legit question
---
The guy above telling you to "watch the news" is the prick
---
God I'm so sick of this community. This is why I left when this community even started supporting p2w. And before I get the people in here like I doubt you played. Check post history. Was active in here and market reddit for several months. 
---
Yong has every right. And no he did play just a couple months ago when everyone even the public thought the tide was turning in a positive way for 76.
---
Clearly everyone was wrong.
---
Game journalists have every right. Doesn't matter if you're salty about it. 
---
This game needs all the negative press. No slack. This game needs to be outed for how terrible it is. I think the only competing awful game is anthem. This game is like smoking cigarettes. Addictive. But in no way shape or form good. 
---
There is literally nothing positive about this game. I used to think the community was good to. Blind defenses are toxic. Down voting posts that'd criticize, having to walk on eggshells, anyone who's against it, ect. Awful.
---
technically thats not a fully populated nuclear winter :P
---
With all the nonsense on here, this makes me feel good about our community. 
---
Thanks for doing this.
---
What atom shop items can be stolen that you can't get back?
---
ha HA Gary
---
\^This\^ and learn how to better manage your trigger. A single trigger pull vs. holding usually fires a burst. Most enemies will go down with a single burst, particularly a head shot from stealth. Alternatively, there are weapons with really cheap to manufacture ammunition. I like to carry a legendary automatic railroad rifle and an explosive flechette harpoon gun. Steel is all you need to craft more ammunition for these two examples.
---
...you're insane dude.
---
Nighblades can learn Sorcerer abilities now?
---
Couldn't agree more lol
---
He didn't encourage shit btw.
---
I'm calling BS on this.  No offense, but there's no way the entire staff is gone for an online game during one of the busiest times of the year for gaming.  (while everyone is off work/school)
---
Even if they aren't physically in the office, the internet and laptops exist.  The idea that they are incommunicado until after the holiday is just not plausible, no company with a retail product would do this at xmas.
---
Prototype weapons buried by Vault-Tec
---
Yes it affects PC only. You lot on consoles are safe :)
---
Unforgivably, no, not a fucking word.
---
Awesome
---
He definitely does encourage people to do shit like this by celebrating with a smile every time it happens.
---
Maybe if you pay for fallout 1st you get hacker protection? It just works.
---
1. I didn't buy it a friend did for me. 2. If you dislike the game why would you be unhappy people are complaining about it??
---
That’s the whole fucking point. 
---
A GOOD company would have staff on 24/7 and have done something immediately to negate the threat.
---
This company... they’ll ignore it for weeks, refuse to acknowledge it, refuse to help people effected by it, then “fix” it (eventually) while also breaking the game in the same patch so another backdoor opens. 
---
It’s beyond incompetence.  We have a right to expect more.
---
Weapons probably...
---
I did but I'd give it another chance eventually
---
But does this hack **permanently** wipe / steal from your inventory? I could understand if it was only for your current session, but how can anyone else update *your* inventory unless they have access to *your* PC and pretend to be your client connecting to the Fo76 server?
---
Not for everyone, but the Bloodied/Comando build is pretty efficient on ammo. Mine also carries a bloodied combat knife (no gladiator perks) to save ammo here and there.  
---
Using the before mentioned methods of gathering resource, I manage to stay stocked up.
---
Hackers doing hacking on PC
---
This is sadly largely probably really accurate. What a sad timeline we live in.
---
How safe is our private server
---
actually the plans in FO4 came from a DLC and apon opening the game :P
---
but yes making it not require the specific enemy parts does nullify some of the challenge but i can see why they went this route.
---
imagine having to scroll down the menu an extra 30 times to get to the bottom since each head would require a different material so takes its own slot.
---
Yeah no you're not the only moron who thinks someone needs to play a game to report on shit that happens on it.   
---
But you're all fucking idiots.   
---
Should news reporters keep silent about gun violence because they've never murdered anyone? Jesus fucking christ dude.
---
While private servers for all would be nice the question is whether or not whatever setup they have running would be able to handle it.  Given the max server population they'd potentially be multiplying the number of active PC servers by up to twenty four times.
---
And you will get nothing.
---
I see
---
Could be wrong but I think it drops in the game. Head over to enclave med wing to see if they have it for sale.
---
Heya I'm a NW Melee main.  Recently i made a rather large post about the current bugs and issues with Melee.  
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/edf85f/in_nw_and_in_general_melee_has_so_many_issues/
---
There you can find video bug examples but also the meta of how i play melee.
---
But here's what you need to know.  Melee is very bad in Nuclear Winter.  But also very fun when it works.   You're perk card load out should have Clubber, incisor, Run For Your Knife, Marathoner, and bloody mess as absolute musts.   Now depending on you wanting to  make a One shot running attack build vs a skirmishers melee build that wants to swing a lot is when you decide to take martial artist or tenderizer.  
---
A good survivability perk is Pharma farma.  This will keep you stocked up on med x, stimpaks, and radaway.  The radaway will be important if you are trying to Mutate for twisted muscle for a more viable oneshot.  You can only mutate once per match so you're unlikely to get it, so don't bank on it as a crutch.  Grognak mag issue #1 will increase your melee damage  and so will the Melee bobble head. 
---
Your Special stats effect nothing and only exist as requirements for perk cost. 
---
Melee as a gameplay style in Nuclear Winter is not about skill. It's about experience in flanking and decision making. With Melee you always fight on your terms. Not theirs.  You go in when you see an opportunity. Otherwise you run and hide.  One of the things where Melee really shines is with a team that understands your pros and cons.  In a team you are a designated flanker.  Your team starts the fight and distracts them while you ambush them and break their flanks causing all kinds of chaos. 
---
If your solo Melee because incredibly harder. Hit and run tactics are you only real tool.  Down someone and finish them with an explosive as you run away before his buddies make you swiss cheese. 
---
You're gonna wanna play primarily on Flatwoods.  morgan town has terrible bushes, is laggy as all hell which has a real chance of hard freezing when playing in third person which is necessary for melee, and morgan town has a large emphasis on the high ground strategy with everyone running froglegs.  You physically cannot have enough agility points to run a viable melee build and froglegs at the same time so you will have absolutely no counter to deal with people on roofs, ledges, trees, ect. 
---
Frog leg spam is also the very first thing anyone does when they notice you approaching with melee. You cannot hit them in the air on their first jump, and likely to not hit on the second jump so frog legs will be the bane of your existence and your success will depend on hitting them while they are completely unaware of your presence. 
---
Even then you may encounter some of the various hit detection and invulnerability to melee bugs that i showed in that link. These on top of incredibly poor aiming design for melee will ruin your day. 
---
That's the most important thing to know. Melee is so god damn fucking awful with so many issues you have to be masochistic on some level to find  any enjoyment.
---
Damn straight.  24/7 online games need 24/7 support.  It’s 2020 not 1990.
---
I feel the same way. There were people actively trying to shut down any conversation about the hack yesterday. They're really quiet now, and I hope they stay that way. They are responsible for making people doubt the legitimacy of this issue when they had NO IDEA what they were talking about.
---
Speaking with authority from a place of ignorance is never OK.
---
We as players are now in a position where we have to ask if this bug isn't designed to sell more Fallout 1st subscriptions.
---
x) it takes a nuke to force a Queen to show herself, just saying.
---
Jokes aside, it's common to see hackers doing the worst they can just to make people realize how easy it is to break their thing. Because when you have a lot of money and you're a bit to confident, until a big issue is here, you think you're safe.
---
only dumb
---
You’re comment, when I saw, was 5 hours old.  I had known about it because of this sub almost a full 24 hours. I’m not a bro, sister.
---
Nomater what at this point they have to repay the community as a whole. I am afraid to even get on with this hack live.
---
You should be able to buy the recipe in the enclave bunker
---
The hackers modifies his files in order for his game to recognize other players as loot "chests" instead of entities.
---
So they come close to you open your inventory and take everything.
---
Yeah, I wonder if it has something to do with you continuing to support Bethesda the last 800,000 times they fucked you over.
---
Almost as if they know there's no consequences to their inaction.
---
Some hacker stole all his stuff?
---
Disappointment
---
Yeah theres also alot of people who stopped playing with plans to come back when things like wastelanders got added but then that got delayed and they added FO1st which  understandably caught alot of heat since the game feels unfinished as it is. Not to mention the weekly shit that happens from when they do their updates and then need to patch those updates. I had planned on coming back for wastelanders and hoping the game was alittle more stable by then as well but now I just feel that the best parts will be behind the pay wall probably and im not going to put more money into it
---
The way it works is that your inventory is treated like a box that they take stuff from. Just like when you have a dead npc.
---
So the only way to get stuff back would be if they put it back or if Bethesda does a rollback.
---
Once they clear your inventory, you're out all of that stuff.
---
Bethesda CREATED the problem, the hackers are only part of the problem. This game has been prone to serious hacking and exploits since development.
---
Sustainable servers
---
I am, 100%, blaming the hackers. 
---
It doesn't matter if a company leaves exploitable holes in their code if _soulless sacks of shit_ don't exploit them.
---
I mean it keeps on giving. Just a week ago there was the reload bug. Then there was the spawn-items exploit. Now people steal other players inventories. The reason why FO76 is still being talked about and mocked is because bethesda STILL fucks up. They deserve all of the hate they are getting and it also makes for great entertainment.
---
People want to see bethesda fail because they took a huge dump on one of their favorite franchises.
---
I'm sure fixing a hack that can only be avoided by playing on a private server is waaay up near the top of their priority list.
---
Bethesda is dead. It's only a matter of time before Todd gets on stage at E3 and tells us how excited he is that TES6 will be the first multiplayer Elder Scrolls.
---
Nah they can't do anything on consoles. No way to inject scripts to the game. Stop spreading lies.
---
none but the point is they can take it.
---
just because you can print more money at a mint doesnt devalue the money.
---
try steal from a money printing place and learn from that :P
---
Beth would be morons not to dive on a sue on this one, either they will gain a crap ton of money if the morons doing this have money or they will get them locked up.
---
From my personal experience I find it funny, having done similar in lots of games. 
---
I’m messed up I know
---
 but there something about destroying other people’s fun that I find amusing in online gaming
---
If you have any questions I’ll be happy to answer from my perspective
---
Unattainable items are still very much in the game I'm afraid, some of the fake legendaries were removed I believe, but certainly not all.
---
I've already seen multiple people creating new characters and throwing stuff on mule characters
---
To enjoy a vanilla playstyle so I wouldn't say that's the only solution.
---
No, a good company gives their employees the Holidays off.... Maybe when you run a business you'd understand. 
---
Is a megachain grocery store that closes on Christmas, with no one in it at all, a bad company because you are hungry with nothing to eat? No, it's a good company, just sometimes bad shit happens. Stop acting like a child.
---
No rights were violated in this, except by the hackers stealing stuff. Most of you are just too entitled and childish to understand, and are lashing out in the most absurd ways because you don't know how to handle disappointment with maturity or rational. Life's going to really suck for a lot of you if you don't get your emotions and reasonings under control.
---
I gave up on YongYea ages ago, and have literally blocked him on my end. He'll get no views from me.
---
They should take a few pointers from Valve. Although that may or may not be a dumb idea, as I have no clue on how programming for anything is done. Just my two cents.
---
They are in the game taking up spaces on servers and interacting with everyone else. They are part of the community.
---
Trying to paint them as outsiders is also a false narrative. Many of these people have been here since the begining. Hackers, dupers, and exploiters have been in the game since day one and very active within the community as a whole.
---
They absolutely are in the community.
---
As far as encountering these people I run into some every single day I am playing soo....
---
&gt; Nothing he is doing is against the law,
---
Not true, internet lawyer.
---
1. Bethesda undoubtedly has a clause in the user agreement that nobody reads stating something to the effect that you agree to not reverse compile the game and other words to that effect.  That opens you up to civil liability and damages.
---
2. The Computer Fraud and Abuse Act  and the Computer Crime Enforcement Act  both open you up to Federal prosecution for a variety of hacking activities.  Remember 911?   Yeah - it's derived from that.  People have been sent to club Fed for just hacking into some company's wifi - if Beth ever was able to get the Feds involved the Feds involved , the idiot in the video the video could very conceivably be charged with terrorism related activities.  I'm not saying this is right, I'm just saying this is just the way it is.
---
If this hack is real and out there (and frankly I'm still not completely convinced a lot of reports here are made up just for the karma)  then Beth needs to get it's act together and start *heavily* prosecuting, in bth civil and criminal arenas, the perps.
---
Considering Bethesda’s track record in the last year of the games launch I wouldn’t get my hopes up if I were you
---
Yeah it seems to be a common occurrence people not trying to defend camps but I guess not everyone can or *want* too. I will always try and defend fellow shop keepers camps if I can. I have moved mine now to a quieter area in the Forest region where there is an Acid extractor which is handy!
---
GT 1030, I wouldn't count on ever getting more than 30 FPS..
---
In the NVIDIA control panel, set all 3D settings to the lowest/fastest/performance setting
---
In game set all to low (sliders to the left side) and try 720p Fullscreen.
---
And if you need to change some .inis to hopefully get more fps check these out (no need to install Vortex for these):

Good luck and Merry X-mas
---
Lol. That's a spicey meme right there. This is xbox Gram though so I believe he had ulterior motives for having no clothes on.
---
Whoever did, assuming there is evidence that points to a particular person or group, has opened themselves to legal action.  It will be interesting to see how that pans out.
---
If you play fo76 your making gaming worse across the world by supporting this complete pile of dogshit of a game
---
Has breaking the law stopped Bethesda before?
---
This is my problem, I see the majority of this sub-reddit calling people like YongYea "Haters" and such but in reality this game is horrific and the laziness of Bethesda to focus on monitisation when the game clearly isn't ready is atrocious, they were warned about this, the hackers are horrible people but this shows how unstable this game is
---
This is pure speculation.
---
Cause right now it isn't?
---
I just don’t see how posting on Twitter or Reddit would help. You yourself said only a small percentage of players are checking FO76 social media.
---
There will always be ones that slip through the cracks. But the point is they acted in a relatively fast fashion to address the problem.
---
Actually lost two atomic shop items not happy about that. I'm not planning to play this until this is fixed
---
They also kill people they don’t like and sell their organs, make “supplement” pills out of aborted fetus and sell it unlabeled as such, beat and kill kids protesting peacefully, control every facet of your life by fear and torture... yeah man,China’s got this shit down.   I wonder why everyone doesn’t do like them?
---
Yeah very true,most people think of it as every man/woman for himself.
---
Support is little. And my camp is on top of an acid extractor as well
---
Absolute blasphemy that this issue even made it to the light of day. Its almost like the hack is trying to kill off what little playerbase it has left and Bethesda is just letting it happen. I beg this gets resolved soon and the culprit is brought to justice.
---
That sounds like a serious elf-sweatshop, nevertheless good job 👍
---
Why would you not cheer for its failure? It represents everything that's taken a wrong turn with gaming in the past couple of years. It's the incarnation of greed and laziness. FO76 being even remotely successful is legit harmful for gaming as a whole. Everyone who loves games as a hobby should wish for this abomination to fail and to stand as a memorial for what should never be.
---
I quit the game a day after it was announced and left this community. I still check back every now and again to see what the new bumblefu*** of the month is which seems to be the trend for Bethesda's continued incompetency.
---
I'd like to support this game but not if they are constantly going to crap this stuff down our throat while not even giving us a decent product and service in return.
---
They’re not losing players. They know they have their fans by the balls, they all have time off and money to spend. The only way to play is pay for fallout 1st. That doesn’t make sense to you? They’re not worried about losing players.
---
You've never been robbed, have you?
---
There's absolutely no comparison between a real life threat and losing a few virtual items.
---
If you do believe it's worse to lose items in game, believe me, you're having a very very very easy life.
---
Blueprint several different heights of double-wide stairs in Adventure and bring them into NW.
---
You already asked that question. Now you are just repeating yourself lol. How does that L feel?
---
I wonder if any of the victims have checked their stash yet.
---
Given the shitty way they implemented the mode, and the fucking _horrifically_ low XP rewards for kills, idle-RPGing it is the only smart way to play if your goal is to actually fucking level.
---
This whole circus is so bizarre. The funds rolling in must be saving whoever is accountable for the state of the game.
---
 I've always wondered what drives people to join online games only to ruin the experience for the other people. I do understand hackers wanting to demonstrate how badly the game has been made, but I'm sure there would have been less intrusive and damaging way to do just so. Is it the lack of empathy, or the thought that the end (wreck FO76) justifies the means?
---
Unfortunately, we do not live in the perfect world, and we need ensure some level of security to keep ourselves and our possessions safe. Bethesda has failed to provide a sufficient level of security against malicious players, and should be held responsible for the brunt of the damages. How would you feel if your bank kept your money in an unlocked wooden box that's just lying outside on the street? Stealing it would of course be illegal and any thieves should be caught and prosecuted, but the bank is not demonstrating a sufficient level of protection against thieves. We cannot magically turn people into law-abiding citizens, but we can make it extremely hard for them to cause any damage. Has Bethesda done this?
---
In Mudder Russia, computer hacks you.   Is no his fault.
---
I have to ask... How did you manage to amass that amount of caps!!!!
---
That's some insanely awesome work though. You should dress as Santa on the 25th and just roam the servers giving gifts... You have plenty to spare it seems :P
---
The irony of you message, when people were saying "It\`s impossible to dup, stop spreading lies". Then "It\`s impossible to spawn NPC\`s stop spreading lies"

B\*tch are you for real? You so dense you can\`t even google it? MMO work on packets, you don\`t need scripts.

 "**How to get around the Problems and to cheat on a PlayStation 4**  
---
  Packet editing for online games and multiplayer shooters get around the  problem of unsigned code by not requiring you to hack your actual  PlayStation. Instead a Packet editor will be connected between the PS4  and the Internet in order to change the data that is being sent from  your game client to the game server and vice versa, allowing you to send  fake data to the server and gain certain advantages. For example a  packet editing aimbot will send the server data that says that you are  aiming at an enemy when you truly aren’t doing that on the game client.  The main problem hereby is that a PC is required to set up packet  editing and it is multiple times more complicated than a conventional  hack using DLL injection or similar. " Literally 1st google search
---
I hate it but I have to agree with the OP. FO76 PC customers are being actively exploited and BGS hasn't even placed a warning banner on their desktop launcher or the logon mode selection screen. For me, a pretty reasonable person most of the time, this is beyond the pale. Their policy to-date has been to deny client restoration requests but I can't imagine how they can continue to allow players to connect knowing that active exploits are taking place. Crickets can kill if there are enough of them...
---
You also can't stack them like you can in adventure mode. Everything but the turrets are useless and even they are super weak and show up as red enemies even to your team which is wrong.
---
Tbh, you've got room to talk. Calling people "trolls" on your now deleted post from yesterday. When we were trying to be civil.
---
Not mine, the general endgame revolves around farming gear for trading.
---
It affects you the moment you wanna make money by selling them and can't compete with hacked in weapons.
---
If you're not taking part of the endgame, thats up to you, but it still affects you indirectly, the moment you wanna do it to earn extra caps, you're fucked.
---
O noes!!!   Russian guy can’t go to Canada anymore.  I bet that’s going to end him.  RUN Boris RUN!
---
Not necessarily. A few atomic shop items require different materials, but are in the same slot iIrc.
---
Yea if starting a new game is your idea of fixing the game, I guess you’re right
---
&gt;Why would you not cheer for its failure?
---
Because I'm not an asshole.
---
&gt;until they fix this crap
---
And that's the problem. They don't need to give a fuck because even when they are going for the world record in fuck-ups per month you still come back and play the game. You think it stops here? They fix this and the game will be fine? Next step they will accidentally doxx you. But you'll come back and keep playing after they apologized. Then they'll release a patch that bricks your HD but hey, they will fix it later so just buy a new HD and keep playing. Seriously, I can not fathom this mindset.
---
Your point?
---
Level 570 here, I couldn't imagine losing my gear I grinded out for 1000s of hours. On PS4 and still paranoid to hop on and enjoy the game as usual even though this seems limited to PC players at the moment. Condolences to anyone who has unfortunately bumped into these inventory stealing lowlifes. I dub this the "Grinch Hack".
---
Printing money inherently devalues the money...
---
That aside, you do understand that you own NOTHING in the game, nor do you own the game. You bought a license to play the game, and you bought a license to use atom shop items.
---
Bethesda could pursue legal action but I don't think you understand just how complex and unfeasible it would be for them... It would cost them more money than they have.
---
I'm gonna go offline until I know this issue has been 100% resolved just to be safe. Sad it's even gotten to this point.
---
Early Christmas present so it would be rude asf for me to return it :/
---
Yeah, any company taking its job responsibly that is. 
---
We're speaking about Bethesda Austin here.
---
PC master race, right!?
---
Muh framerates? What about muh inventory?
---
I don't believe that at all. This game has potential and people like you make it hard for Bethesda to take criticism and make the game better.
---
I feel bad for the people on here that really care for and enjoy the game. However, I think many people, myself included, felt outright ripped off by purchasing the game and feeling like they didn’t get what they paid for. Some people take it much further than my hatred for the game and they feel Bethesda owes them something and everyone should suffer for it. These people are just being assholes.
---
I’m all for Bethesda taking a financial and PR nosedive for their screw-ups, but I really hope it doesn’t come at the cost of the fans of the game (like it did in this case).
---
Well this  just keeps getting better and better.  Hey Bethesda  why don't you just  kill this game and  then kill yourselves. I will pay top dollar  to watch  "Tooooddd"    to immolate himself live on tv and net.
---
“It’s the Fallout you didn’t know you wanted”
---
It’s not, and I still don’t.

Give me Fallout 3/New Vegas remastered
---
Thanks so much I will try this see if it runs smoother
---
I already do exactly that.. but how is that a solution when placing a camp going into building mode and placing a blueprint takes even longer? Not to mention the times you can’t place a camp🤷‍♂️
---
Ah, that a laptop I assume?
---
The gameplay isn't, it actually plays like 3 or 4
---
I will say this. 
---
When they came at me, they took my armor. They took (I think) one of my guns. And not my BEST gun, by pure damage output. 
---
if they were being purely malicious, they would have snagged _everything_. 
---
They took everything with high sale value.
---
That's...beautiful.
---
and laughing
---
Every time a new gamebreaking bug surfaces someone types this exact line. Like...it should not take you 50 instances of ridiculous fuck-ups to realize they don't care about you. You guys have the patience of an ent. Unbelievable.
---
Putting the game in maintenance mode would be the first step.  The second step would be acknowledging the issue (and downtime) on social media.  Sure, anyone who doesn't know would be inconvenienced, but I'm sure they'd take that over losing their inventories.
---
Plus, this is the PC version we're talking about... you could put a message in the launcher.
---
They will ban someone else by accident and not apologize. Calling it.
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
Becasue I love Fallout series, I like this game, despite all the flaws - I've met great people here, I've had a great time playing 2200+ hours, I traded 1000+ trades and still hope it'll be better.
---
This. Pretty sure the hardworking party of this game is not the decision making instance.
---
Nope an actual desktop, imma try something that someone else put down and see if that works if not then I will just stick to playing fo76 in console tho it sucks that I wasted money on a game I can't even play :/
---
shit show, after shit show, after shit show, I'm surprised people still let themselves be taken advantage of. One thing we need to understand. Companies don't give a shit about you and me, how do you stick it to them, by not playing. 
---
Fallout has been my go to game and fallout 3 literally changed my life for the better, but sometimes you have to know when to say enough.
---
Agreed.
---
It's still fun.
---
I dont jump on the hate bandwagon like the under 25 crowd.
---
I grew up in a time where it was ok to be your own person (Gen X).  
---
Since I learned mostly before all the crybabies were born that individual decision makeing is what makes society prosper, I have not yet gotten the urge to hate a game that is lots of fun just because some overinflated egotistical youtube douchebag said it was bad.
---
Please stop talking, everything you say makes me cringe with embarrassment for you.
---
The real question is why are you guys still playing this garbage, it is not even a game at this point
---
Thats what i thought. Sry to hear man...
---
Pre order here too... And thanks btw :)
---
Saweet. Thanks.
---
No, It's so fun to watch hackers ruining the game
---
Message is, “let’s burn this shit game”.
---
I feel them.  Until fo76 dies, those of us who really TrueLy wanted and waited for a proper fallout title will not get it. 
---
Fo76 needs to burn but a few hundred idiots taking it in the rear and paying Bethesda for it are keeping it rolling on life support. 
---
It’s fucked from every angle you can imagine. 
---
I’m hoping bethesda gets burned enough that they let go of the rights to the IP. 
---
Let a good company take over and do this properly, then we can all actually enjoy playing in the Falloutverse again.
---
Lots of old world money
---
it's normal recipe you can get from events. The only non-existing is psychotats (no one knows why, especially if you have recipe for psychobuff).
---
Demonizing people for playing a game they like with toxic comments is definitely not making gaming, and its surrounding culture, or the gaming community at large, any better across the world, either.
---
No, he likes to make kids angry/cry. Did the same in Fornite.
---
Back in 2011-2012 there was a semi-popular hacker that used to make videos hacking on call of duty modern warfare 2 to make kids with microphones quit rage and then uploaded it to YouTube
---
That's sinseer lol
---
Bethesda...Bethesda never changes lol
---
Most people are largely unaffected by the problems that show up in this game, and Reddit/YouTube trolls tend to MASSIVELY blow issues out of proportion.
---
For example, when Fallout 1st came out, about 80% of the posts on Reddit were hating on it. From Reddit, you'd get the impression that everyone hated it. In game, however, about 20% of players openly had Fallout 1st. Others likely had it and didn't flaunt it. About 2-6% of in-game players showed open contempt for Fallout 1st players.
---
In other words, the public outrage wasn't reflected by actual players. Actual players were ignorantly enjoying Fallout 1st while Reddit was trying to scream at them to hate it.
---
Nice attitude, but are you 100% sure you're safe in your paid for environment? A few hours ago the hack only covered player inventories, now it seems displays and stashes are vulnerable too, seems likely its more widespread than we know.
---
Fuck that.  Big companies that are, AAA gaming companies,  running a game like this hire staff and rotate holidays. 
---
What kind of world do you live in?  Socialist it sounds like, but that doesn’t fly here.
---
Everything you said is complete garbage from a business stand point. 
---
I’d have to presume your another Bethesda shill.   You guys are out of control.
---
&gt;atom shop sales fall.
---
This bit, 100%
---
Gawd Damn.
---
Fuck them both. It's on both of them.
---
If you ain't first you're assetless
---
"the outside would cannot hurt me" vault tec poster comes to mind
---
I think both deserve ridicule for this hack. Bethesda should have anti-hacking/cheating systems in place for an online game, AND players shouldn’t be assholes to other players.
---
You can blame a drunk driver for crashing into your car all day long, but you still expect the manufacturer of your car to have built a vehicle to keep you as safe as possible in crashes.
---
Hear, hear...as a fellow GenX'er I resemble this statement and second this motion...😘
---
Cognitive dissonance?.. this isnt a defense of anything, im simply stating a fact. If your definition of rushing a game is taking up to 9 years then i guess they rushed this one
---
 I would have made a trip to Alpha, and nuked his base. 
---
He wants to be such a big shot, he can show his followers what happens when you are a douchebag in the wasteland.
---
What does American laws have to do with a Russian person there genius? Seems you're the internet lawyer who doesn't understand jurisdiction. Lol
---
Certain people enjoy getting milked by Todd over and over and over again
---
Just the way it is
---
I don't even know how to respond this to level of idiocy..... Just wow....
---
I got an SSD for my console to prevent this issue. It's not really the kind of solution you're looking for, but all of the serious NW players are making the move to SSDs.
---
The biggest issue here, which I haven't seen mentioned yet, is that the "hack" actually kinda benefits Bethesda.
---
The best way to avoid any issue is to pay a fallout 1st subscription and to go farm holiday gifts on your own private server.
---
Why would any of us expect Bethesda to do anything about this situation ?
---
They've been warned them a year ago.
---
They've been shown a month ago it was possible to spawn the motherfuckin prydwen in game.
---
We knew since day one they have no support and don't care about the community being impacted. 
---
The guy who made the maps? Gone after his tickets were ignored.
---
The vaults scrapping stuff? No reaction for weeks.
---
The scrapbox destroying stuff? Whatever, grab a bunch of component and be nice.
---
There won't be any reaction. In a few weeks, we'll have an ITV telling us that "an exploit has been patched" and the loudest complaint might even get rolled back to their previous version, with no consequences for the hackers.
---
And it will happen again. Because the people writing those scripts are way way more creative and motivated than the people deciding about this game.
---
If?  It's real?  Are you still doubting after seeing this?  What more proof could you possibly need?
---
Yeah its bad business though.
---
Kinda surprised you aren't getting in on the action here, this seems like it's right up your alley.  Being an unapologetic thief and all that.
---
Protest the fact that they're treating us like idiots and taking advantage of us. And especially not respecting us
---
Turrets are no longer super weak. They got a stealth buff and can absolutely destroy now.
---
Well if it's a desktop - there is no problem really. You open up the case, disconnect the GPU, yank it out and put a more powerful one in (2060 is good enough to run the game on ultra and shouldn't be expensive at this point). As for CPU - it's easy to replace as well, but since you have no experience - i'd advise asking/paying someone who knows how to. Whole thing takes like 20-30 minutes tops.
---
Wrong, they haven't injected any code into the servers. They are just sending packets to the server. Completely legal as long as not done in a DOS attack way.
---
Idk I thought it was funny. He went on and on about how good he is and that for him to bother with me I'd have to pay.
---
As a melee main this is something that frustrates me to no end.  Bethesda dropped the ball HARD for Melee in Nuclear Winter.   Not only does it have this issue,  a plethora of hit detection bugs but other builds are receiving support and buffs while the melee perk cards remain pretty garbage.
---
Take Run For Your Knife for example.  It was identical to Gun Runner which even then Gun runner as a means of mobility was better than Run For Your Knife because if you suddenly found yourself in a gun fight you had a ranged weapon to defend yourself  while also retaining the move speed and not needing to switch weapons.  A literal life saver in many situations. 
---
So default gun runner already had a leg up on run for your knife comparatively.  Now gun runner just straight up gives that bonus move speed to two freaking gun types. Shotguns and pistols.  Gun runner is now just undeniably superior. 
---
Worse they should have put the new gun runner effect on run for your knife. I know aesthetically it wouldn't make sense but build wise it would synergize brilliantly because melee is already well into shotgun range and vice versa.  Giving Melee builds something to hybridize into shotguns for skirmishes. Shotguns being perk card efficient with just one or 2 max cards would have been perfect. 
---
But instead pistol builds can hybrid into shotgun which is redundant as pistols being versatile as they are already have solutions to all problems at all ranges.
---
That this is probably not even remotely based in fact.
---
HOPEFULLY, they're quietly working on a fix as not to alert the hackers into a frenzy. But I imagine they're more like this:  [https://me.me/i/work-job-twitter-when-you-are-on-your-break-3927](https://me.me/i/work-job-twitter-when-you-are-on-your-break-3927)
---
Well fallout 1st comes with something that should be free I am of course talking about private servers and if I didn’t have to buy fallout 1st to use it I’d definitely play 76 again in my own private server
---
No but removing external assets/programs from the game would do pretty well though.
---
Problem being people still want mods
---
Mate, check the vid again. Check who posted it.
---
K. Hope it gets better on PC.
---
He’s saved on my list, he’s lucky his camp had no vendors lol
---
Were you in Adventure Mode? Are you on PC?
---
If the answer is “yes” to both questions, you are likely a victim of a new inventory hack. Anyone using the hack can take all your inventory items (except quest items), including Atomic Shop Items. 
---
Avoid Adventure mode. Stick to a Private World or NW.
---
Yeah there is no law being broken hacking a game. It is why Wow had to go with copyright infringement on wowglider. Because it wasn't breaking any hacking law.
---
yep, hackers can open you like a inventory box now and take anything on you or equipped.  
---
todd howard- it works! it just works!
---
I think if your part of the 1% effected then yeah its way worse. But lets not pretend everyone who logs in will absolutely have all their items taken. If you want to be cautious and wait, by all means do. Not looking to start any argument
---
You have been hacked my friend. Thousand of players are victims. Me too. You can't do anything until Bethesda gonna fix it, if they do lol
---
It has a lot of potential, I love the fallout universe, I have fun playing with and without others, it was steadily getting better for a while with updates and patches that didn’t break the game but actually improved it, nuclear winter injected new life into it. The game is fun, yea it’s buggy but what game isn’t? This game is an experiment using an engine that wasn’t designed for this. It’s frustrating that it doesn’t always work perfectly but I’m not a petulant child and I take the good and laugh at the bad because it’s a game. It seems like games aren’t fun for people any more and it’s more like an addiction, where it’s about accomplishing tasks and getting rewards instead of having fun. People don’t take time to enjoy things it seems like it’s all about getting it done and moving on to the next thing.
---
 I expect to see the following from Bethesda lol
---
# Bethesda Response: This is not real it all lies buy F1st
---
There is a hack on pc that people are using that allows them to take your stuff from about 200metres away it's really to the point that people are losing pipboys and atomic shop gear
---
I mean, yes?  But you can't exactly blow an inventory-stealing bug out of proportion, can you?  If anything, in lieu of an actual statement or action by Bethesda, you kind of have to, so the information gets to the players who might be victimized by such a thing.
---
That guy sounds like he is doing some next level roleplaying.
---
The atom shop team is larger than the development team for sure.
---
Wanting them to be free doesn't mean they should be free. Some games allow you to host your own "server" on your own computer at home. Bethesda is paying to lease server space from Amazon. Almost every company that has such a model charges players for private "servers." Bethesda is no different and should not be held to a different standard just because people want things to be free.
---
It's been over a day now and Bethesda remain silent, the longer these servers remain up the bigger headache Bethesda are going to have.
---
I dont even know if he knows what he is spreading. Hate. Not only hate against Fallout 76 or Bethesda, but also against the playerbase and the Bethesda employees. Some people have no shame in doing evil
---
Would be nice to even get a standard, "we have heard you, and are hard at work to fix the problem" announcement...
---
I get where you come from. The hackers are the ones who decided to make life harder for the other players. But do consider that in any given society there are those, who lack the empathy or the moral understanding to realize what they're doing is wrong (or perhaps they have come to the conclusion that their actions are not inherently immoral). There is nothing in the world that would convince every bad actor to cease doing bad things. That is why you need some kind of protection against them. Bethesda is arguably more at fault for the hacker outbreak for not having proper security in place. It is not exactly a secret that people are going to abuse the hell out of any vulnerabilities they come across for their own gain, and people should be trained to take that in consideration when making software, especially when dealing with user data and cash-shop goodies.
---
I mean i subbed for the month, i knew the tent skin was coming, but i'm due for a renewal on the 26th... yeah not happening. I shouldn't be surprised... but we were making progress and things seemed to be getting better. This is an outrage, but with an engine this well known, and this modable... with a dev team this inexperienced in online matters coupled with a company that just doesn't give a damn. Well that's where i have to dip back out again. See ya'll around Wastelanders, and if that's a mess, i'm not bothering to come back and check.
---
Those professions that take an oath, it's not their choice to help when off the clock.  The oath they take does not have a timeclock attached. 
---
Programmers, like construction and factory workers, they dont take an oath.  They make a product.   Do you think Ford line workers still make cars when they go home.   Hell no, they relax with their family.
---
If you are not an oathbound profession, do you work when you leave your job?  99% of people are going to say no.   
---
So why do you expect a much higher standard for employment than you yourself adhere to?
---
Alright I will look into that too, being a desktop it gives me the option to upgrade stuff in it so thanks for the input :)
---
Dude it was crazy, by the time I found my mic and asked who he was and why I should pay he left.
---
People who initially discovered this have reported the step by step to BGS **with** the solution, long before it was made public by Erectban. Yet here we are.
---
Exactly why playing in a private server becomes ever more important to this game's longevity.
---
Dude, thank you.
---
Oh Jesus Christ.  As someone who loves Fallout and ALMOST bought Fallout 76, it alternates between hilarious and tragic as FO76 keeps falling down the stairs, but this is literally takes the cake as the worst thing I've heard in a game, even worse than when GTA Online hackers could follow you to single player.  This is.. next level.  Like as bad as games like that are with modders, at least they can't steal your cars &amp; cash, and if they do nuke your weapons/inventory it comes back when you swap servers.  Because at least Rockstar was smart enough to track all Inventory stuff on a different server than the Peer 2 Peer lobby.    
---
Just.. holy shit.
---
Oath or not you should give a shit about your own work and standing by while someone destroys it is despicable.
---
Omg, glad I haven't played in a while, so many times I've just left my game on whilst I do something,  I'd have come back to nothing.
---
Todd has no handle on 76. As much as I’ve been hating on Bethesda, at least hold the company responsible not the PR dude
---
I have seen nothing to even suggest they can roll things back.
---
Have they ever done one before?
---
The One Piece
---
i made a bunch of friends playing this game, so i mean it can be buggy for get hacked but i still like to goof off with the the people i met on this game regardless.
---
They are also stealing atom shop items people bought with their money
---
Honestly, it's the only punishment that could fit the crime of bothering to even play this game.
---
Well, you'd think they'd roll back the databases to before the thefts began.  And extend the holiday gift duration since we can't safely play until it's fixed.
---
Bethesda won’t respond because it’s the holidays, they’re probably spending time with their families and no one’s at the office.
---
Perhaps Bethesda should hire the hackers who made the InvTheft tool, those folks seem to know more about this engine than Bethesda do.
---
Hear!Hear!
---
I thought losing my full ultracite armor set a few months back was bad.  Can’t imagine losing an entire inventory
---
I agree with that completely. This current hacking issue SHOULD be blown up everywhere. But some people have been acting as if every minor issue in the past has been just as bad as the current hacking issue. The OP has actually seen people crying wolf about this game so much that he can't even tell.
---
Excuse me sir but these are vegan stuffed heads
---
Don't be a twat.  It's nothing like theft of a NON REPLACEABLE legendary weapon.
---
Its one of Bethesdas main franchises I think you are looking at it wrong 
---
Fo4 was commercial success although some people feel eh about it it sold well. On top of that it's going to be around 9 years before we see a new fallout 76 was a outlier in the standard BGS Release schedule.  we might see the IP passed to another dev to break down the wait before another Bethesda studio fallout but the series isn't going anywhere any time soon.
---
You should maybe read up about that lawsuit
---
He said dont even play, not "dont even create". And if he is saying this there is a good chance that he watched these vids.
---
Sounds like sloth from the goonies wrote that lol.
---
The "hacker" only has to be in rendering distance. So he/she could be at +-200meters from your character.
---
Somebody is SEETHING
---
Yeah, everything depends on your budget. I'd recommend Ryzen 5 2600X cpu, Nvidia 2060 GPU, another 8 gig of ram and an SSD. That's the setup I have, and I run 76 and any current gen game on ultra with zero hiccups. And it shouldn't be too expensive either.
---
I subbed to Fallout 1st so i could play alone, the way a fallout game should be played and i 100% loved it.
---
The game was so much better to me that i started over from scratch. and no i'm not being facetious, i'm 100% serious i still logged on to adventure here and there but not much.
---
The game was so much better played alone, that i think that must be the way they test the game too.
---
Bethesda is thrash bro, are you mentally ill
---
I had hopes of coming back to play one day. Until this company pulls their head out of their asses, I think I will be done indefinitely.
---
I take that fixer 38 everywhere. It is my go-gun even for events like Scorched Earth. I cripple the queen and 2-3 bullets to the head kill all scorched around. 
---
If you are going to craft, 5.56 is the way to go, because it is the one that gives the best DPS and the cheapest to make (better than 45). So, craft only that type. 
---
If you buy, buy fusion cells, which are the most expensive.
---
Yall take this game WAAAAAY too seriously.
---
I bought a copy for me and my wife. I was excited that she would finally be able to experience a Fallout game by co-oping with me. What a terrible game to use to introduce someone to the franchise. Sadly, since launch the game is still not in a state that I feel comfortable asking her to try to play the game with me again. :(
---
Cross bow build i think is the best for bush wookies.  Pretty silent.  Instant fucking kill with the right build, somewhat reliably looting for it. 
---
Crossbow works off rifleman perks and tank killer. Quick hands is hilariously powerful with crossbow if you have the ammo. 
---
Speaking of ammo that's your biggest issue. keeping ammo for it.  you cannot run scrounger for ammo for it.  Which is a damn shame. 
---
Luckily cross bow is literally one of if not the most damaging weapon in the game mode you can keep your ammo afloat by killing people as they tend to loot everything they can ammo wise.  That's your mentality as a crossbow bush wookie. They are looting for you. They just don't know it yet.
---
I uninstalled it for two months or so, then I thought the holiday event looked nice and reinstalled. 
---
Not gonna lie, I don't think I'll come back before at least wastelanders.
---
Big thanks to u/axtedeath for the help - Think I got in over my head there! I owe you one!
---
Will need to try and do it again when at a higher level - oh and return the favour!
---
No I was asking if the game had changed to more align with previous Elder Scrolls games
---
ESO seems to be making decent revenue, at least on PC, according to [this list](https://store.steampowered.com/sale/winter2018bestof/) from 2018. Some of the smaller studios might be at risk of being closed or sold, though.
---
No shit, it cost money.
---
Maybe some there are. I've never saw them post saying they were or weren't. Why even make the statement lol.
---
Damn thanks for that
---
It's not uncommon for them to tuck tail and hide. Just be happy they aren't selling anti-cheat via fallout 1st.
---
Because business isnt conducted that way. 
---
Good business would not alienate half of their playerbase potentially causing a long term deprication of its playerbase just to win a few more subscriptions. 
---
A marketing Idea that purges 20% of your playerbase to aqcuire 5% more new business is not a good business model.
---
Bethesda did not do this.
---
No. I had nothing stolen from me, thankfully.
---
It was a joke, big brains.
---
I think it would be an easy assumption to make that most pc based fallout 76 players would prioritise not losing their entire inventory to hackers over the incredibly low level of cosmetic modification the game allows.
---
Sorry can I get an explanation? I’m out of the loop.
---
common sense on this board? gtfo
---
Lol you’re asking to be attacked for even questioning that!!! I think this is a calculated move to force people to buy fallout 1st. It’s a break, everyone’s on vacation, they will resist at first but eventually give in and buy fallout1st. This is a marketing strategy.
---
When I go home from work I stop thinking about it. It's my job, not my life. Why should game developers be any different?
---
wow ... Bug Thesda
---
He puts more effort into his videos than Bethesda did into this sorry excuse for a "Fallout" game made with 0 respect to the IP of Fallout, zero respect to the fans, and he doesn't charge a 100 dollar a year subscription service either.
---
You seriously think Fallout 76 needs youtubers to tell them the game is bad to hate it? You're seriously going to blame people reporting on the problems as the cause of people being negative about the game, instead of, you know, the existence of the problems themselves?
---
Do you not understand why a company notorious for making buggy—but single player— games, suddenly deciding to make a low effort online service multiplayer game may leave people upset? That serves as an icon for everything wrong with video games going forward? Here, pay full price for an unfinished game we may one day fix up into an acceptable state (hasn't happened yet...), and oh, also, it's filled with shady MtX crap taken straight out of a free to play, pay to win mobile game scheme. Because that's what we need big developers like Bethesda doing, right? We need them to normalize those predatory, shady practices in the mainstream of gaming. 
---
Everything Fallout 76 represents, is not just bad for Fallout, not just bad for Bethesda, or even Bethesda fans, it's bad for everyone, gaming as a whole. It's an example of the industry crossing several lines, and if they aren't pushed back on hard enough, this will become the new norm, and they'll be looking for new lines to cross.
---
Oh by the way: Bethesda blatantly lied about what kinds of microtransactions they'd put in the game. Generally, lying to your customers and getting them to buy a game under false pretenses, plants a lot of seeds of animosity that youtubers aren't required to inspire to grow. Fallout 76 is a game that is intentionally designed to be bad, and then they ask the players how can we make this better, they listen...and then try to sell you those solutions you asked for.
---
Don't blame a youtuber for calling out the BS for people complaining about the smell when Bethesda's the one that dropped this deuce on our faces.
---
Was it really. 
---
Or are you only saying that now because someone called you out on your utter bullshit.
---
Stop slinging mud.
---
Nah... 76 in this state (with the "on fire" state being severely exaggerated) is still better than no 76. For Bethesda reputation it may have been better to cancel it but for the enjoyment of the players definitely not...
---
Your logic goes right out the f'ing window when you look and INDIE devs doing a better job at virtually... everything.   
---
The only fantasy i can see lately, is the fantasy that this game is somehow going to shape up and turn into something we deserve... but despite a mostly stable experience the past few months, i see nothing getting done to combat the multiple hacking issues.   
---
Just the other week i had a guy come into my camp, walk through my locked doors, and kill me with a hacked weapon. Had this hack been around then, all of my inventory would have been lifted, every customer in my shop would have lost their shit, my wife, BYE BYE inventory... no fucking thanks fella. The REALITY is that this game has had over a year to get its shit together... it clearly hasn't done so.   
---
Wastelanders is the final shot, even then many won't come back from the absolute FOUL taste left int their mouths over the past year.
---
are you fucking serious!?!!??
---
Worse. It's sheduled posting likely.
---
Fuck Bethesda and fuck this game. Just deleted it out of my storage. I'll never buy a game from these dick heads again.
---
Submit a ticket to bethesda. That title though 😂.
---
Yes they are thieves they are taking items people bought with real world money directly from their inventories but I also see this as The hackers trying to teach Bethesda a lesson of sorts
---
what the fuck&gt;!!&gt;!&gt;"&gt;l2,z;
---
Yeah, it *was* a joke. I think the general tone is pretty not serious. Good try, champion.
---
I guess... if being slightly optimistic is the same thing as being mentally ill. But as I said, I still think scenario 3 is the most likely
---
I’m more worried about your mentality since you felt your comment was necessary
---
is there a way to get my stuff back??
---
it’s the crackhead santa we’ve seen lurking around...
---
Does it matter if he is saying Bethesda is bad just for clicks? He is providing updates on the game by going through sources from the community. If this subreddit is a source for his material then why don't you post the good things that happen with the game instead of the negative? He will then cover the new good stuff. Problem solved.
---
This reminds me of that South Park episode “love not Warcraft “ except it’s more sad than funny.
---
They probably have the knowledge. They probably don't have the permissions.
---
I've wanted an offline mode since the beginning and it would definitely bring me back to the game, but it doesn't make anyone any money so I'mma go ahead and guess it'll never happen.
---
Bethesda has a policy of no returning items back. Maybe they will do an exception this time, though. Who knows.
---
Are you comparing spreading missinformation about a video game with spreading actual news of difficult subjects by the biggest news sources ? Because if so, thats just ridiculous
---
You should step away from alllll video games and seek therapy.
---
COPE.
---
based af
---
I see from your post history that you are a troll. Probably one of the dirtbags using these criminal hacks, which is why you want to downplay their delirious effects. Don't worry, you've been reported, kid.
---
thx :)
---
Yes... let the hate flow through you...
---
They're too cheap to do it.
---
I enjoy playing it. I have fun playing it. I have played Bethesda games before, bugs are common. Nothing is earth shatteringly horrible. What I enjoy doesn't impact anyone else, and I'm beyond letting what some random person online thinks of Fallout 76 sway me. 
---
The way PC is getting dicked over pretty hard right now really does suck, but that is not the game's fault for being the game. No matter what people may cry about "how Bethesda could let this happen", they didn't let anything happen. A group of asshats decided to ruin the game for people for shits and giggles. It sucks, but play a different game and move on for Christ's sake.
---
This post wasn't aimed at the OP, but it's more of a general rant. Now that's over, I can't wait to get off work so I can play for a few hours and get some more mounted head plans for my camp.
---
Haha
---
no.
---
cope.
---
No thanks New Vegas had more bugs than this game
---
Amazon isn't the buyer in this situation though...
---
Welcome to Fallout 76.
---
Mirelurks, ghouls and hacker bosses.
---
While I agree with you and I thank the nameless duper who likely crafted most of my god roll gear. I think most people on here would say that duping is inherently malicious.
---
I remember when I was first hacked in World of Warcraft. Everything was stolen and sold off. It was heartbreaking.
---
After communicating with support. They had the situation handled in less than a day. Everything was replaced. Even the spare gold in my pockets, and some extra (I guess they didn't feel the need to restate the copper and silver and just rounded it up.)
---
Terrified to play my almost level 50 character in FO76 I started a new character. Wasn't long before I found a Holiday Scortched and got my first legendary.
---
Was only a good 30 minutes before someone appeared and stole it out of my inventory. He stole my lead pipe. I wanted to see if the rumors were true. I was even in stealth most of the time. And poof. There he was. A naked dude.
---
I emailed support. Nothing yet. Two days later.
---
I know my issue isn't big. Not as big as many others. So I disregarded it as I continued seeing people having so much more removed from their inventories. But it shows that these hackers aren't doing this for profit. They're doing this to watch the game descend into madness.
---
Imagine some poor bloke getting this game for the Holidays only to discover its unplayable.
---
I'd say, "At least its only on PC."
---
And I'm sure as Bethesda takes the Holidays off, they'll say the same. Because at least Xbox and Ps4 players aren't getting hacked. So its a damn good thing cross play was never a thing. Else they would be losing so much more.
---
I can draw conclusions and make assumptions. Such as: 
---
This is being left unaddressed so people subscribe to Fallout 1st.
---
This is being allowed to continue because its literally something you can do on FO4 through console commands. And its part of the engine.
---
Its a planned attack for the Holidays. DDoS attacks are often planned by multiple people or groups to sow chaos.
---
Its breaking my heart watching people still risk diving into the game. Some don't have any warning. Some are going in without knowing the threat. Hackers are akin to cancer. You think it won't happen to you, but it can and eventually will. So the PC is quarentined. Bethesda will leave this unaddressed and deal with it after December. Because two platforms are operating still. They're not losing much.
---
Until people break away on every platform.
---
Until we become a collective force to be heard.
---
Until all three platforms join together and voice our discontent for this brazen display of ignorance.
---
Events such as this will be paramount. It will be commonplace to see problems such as this.
---
I know there is no substitute. This game is wholly unique. Its our post apocalyptic, capitalist ruin in digital form. One where we can play with friends, make new ones, and find enemies.
---
Our enemy now is not the hackers, but the company which allows them to operate without contest. Without reacting and responding with any sense of urgency.
---
Knowing full well its impossible to ask the console players to join the PC community in showing any sympathy, especially when asking them to resist engaging with the game.
---
Yet its beginning to feel as if its the only way we'll receive any action.
---
TL;DR - Fever dream.
---
I mean VATS combat dude? You're going to stand on that hill? Listen i'm a LAR VATS build... and if you were into VATS before, 9/10 times you're going to hate the changes, and while i get that it was necessary... it's hardly a selling point for most of us. The world is great, exploring is fun, looting every damn thing not tied down and making use of it is ADDICTING AF... but VATS... no dude... no. VATS is terrible in 76.
---
“Everyone will get 10 atoms for the inconvenience. If you lost your items, hopefully tuts will make up for it.”
---
Oh I really care about your opinion I’ll stop now I’m so sorry 🖕🏻
---
You would think but again people will find anything and everything to bitch about
---
It's been overexaggerated. Recently someone posted that this hack is possible (without a recipe how to do it) and suddenly everyone and his pet dog is hacking other players... Thia reeks of another "tradesteal bug" - like attempt to tarnish the game...
---
Just... what can be said that hasn't been already.  Unbelievable, glad I'm not on the PC version.  Sorry to all that lost their stuff.  It's more than just stuff though, it's hours and hours of time spent playing something on your own time for recreational fun.  And assholes like the moron who made this video thinks this is ok.  And then there's Bethesda... just keeps getting worse and worse doesn't it?  Great job guys!  Keep it up!
---
Woah, calm down Satan.
---
Don't take that for an answer.  They have the ability to restore accounts.  You can cite the people who had their inventory eaten by Vault 94 in the past.  They protest because it's an inconvenience that seems to involve some manual work.  Well, someone's going to have to bite that bullet, because they have allowed this exploit to become widespread.
---
Teaching a lesson by fucking up everyone’s good time sorry no argument will make that logic ok they are human trash and I hope they die in pain from cancer
---
It's still okay to be your own person, as long as that person is what society deems okay amirite? 
---
I'm damn near 40 and love Fallout 76. Don't care what DongYeah or whatever other YouTube skidmark wants to say about it. Decry it all day long, but the game works fine for me and I have fun with it. If it stops working for me and it's not fun, there's literally thousands of other games to play, oh well.
---
I don't know I used to go through EA support a lot for various reasons and then you only ran during PST hours.
---
I mean, a lot of news reports are inaccurate. That shit happens.
---
I'm blaming management not individual programmers. I'm not sure why you are white knighting them.
---
"Trip me once, shame on you, trip me twice, I'M THE FOOL"
---
Cope?
---
So should we shut up and not tell them when they are ?
---
I find your lack of optimism... 
---
perfectly reasonable
---
They hated the OP because he told them the truth
---
Shut out down until it is fixed, Bethesda. This isn’t going to get any of those new people from free play week to buy now.
---
Jimmies: RUSTLED
---
Unfortunately it is; look up the reddit and forums (hint: they are on fire).
---
Bethesda isn’t ever going to stop making fallout games lol stop being dramatic.
---
"BETHESDA BAD BETHESDA BAD BETHESDA BAD"😠😠😠😠😠😠$,#.÷*#&amp;!,+/%$:=&amp;=&amp;:,
---
Delusional loser
---
Let me know how that goes for you, internet lawyers always come out on top.
---
Gamers: "Hey, someone has a hack to to steal assets on regular PC servers."
---
Bethesda: Rubs hands together imagining the revenue for Fallout 1st
---
Yeah, until someone decides to sink the damn thing lol.
---
No. The idea that hackers are doing this for any form of altruistic reason is just fucking insane. 
---
They're shitty fucking people who do this because making the game unplayable for others is fun for them, or profitable, or something. 
---
There is _zero_ "positive" reason to do evil shit like this.
---
I'm half convinced Bethesda is dragging their feet on this simply because it's going to drive some people to cough up for Fo1st.
---
A full server rollback would be the one and only solution.  At least knowing that was going to happen would reassure the masses.
---
Coincidentally I’ve only been playing private the last few days anyway as I’ve been farming Xmas scorched and taking workshops for the Santatrons. Wasn’t going to stop doing that, only dipping into adventure to check vendors but I can hold off till they fix this
---
“So, what do we do now?”
---
I got the info from a source with eyes inside of the hacking group creating and distributing these hacks.
---
"grind and work" - this is a video game, not a full time job. smh
---
Sloth was cool though
---
Thank you for the gold and silver and may Everyone have a Merry Christmas/Holiday and Happy New Year.
---
" Happy fucking holidays "
---
\-Bethesda 2019
---
&gt;At this point I would expect them to turn this into an opportunity to sell legendary drop rate boosters or something in the atom shop
---
With Fallout first you can go to a private server, where no one can steal from your inventory! Get your subscription NOW!
---
They had to role back every character
---
oof I'm not stepping online till this shit is fixed
---
New cheat that lets you yoink any players’ inventory within a 200 m radius.
---
No, but there's a fucking world between "Hey, you're wrong about this" and "Hey, if you don't do X thing, you're not allowed to talk about X thing". 
---
Informing people their information is wrong is great. 
---
Telling people they shouldn't talk about things they aren't involved with personally is just fucking stupid.
---
Haha so it was you.  Real nice.  Seems you're proud of your shitty behavior as always.
---
How does everyone know? As had been pointed out repeatedly, Reddit and game forums make up a small percentage of the worldwide player base, so what about the majority of players who don't know, just let them blindly carry on?
---
Craft it back?
---
Why would you stay on public knowing what's happening for any reason at all if you had access to a private server. Log off and wait until you can get back in your private server.
---
How do we start to address things like the Daily quests being basically broken?  My wife and I started new characters after about 9 months of not playing (we started at the BETA, and left as the game really wasn't where it needed to be), and these quests still don't work right.  Kudos on the stability, we have not had an issue with that really at all, this is a HUGE improvement!
---
What I mean specifically is that we both received the Daily Quest 'Ecological Balance'.  No problem, find the corpse, traipse around, and then find air-water-soil stations in the environment.  Here's the question: why do we have different quest markers?  My wife's 'soil' tape was not near where I had to pick up mine, and to add insult to injury, my machine didn't dispense a tape.  I had to disable the quest and play bodyguard (I do that anyway!) as this quest now couldn't be completed for my character.
---
1. Why couldn't we use the same machine?  We are in a team, doing the same quest.  Is one holotape not good enough for two people?
---
2. Why didn't "my" machine count the quest as being completed?  Again, I went to my marker for my quest, and nothing happened.  I tried fast traveling away, and even relogging into the game, and at no point did interacting with the soil test machine do anything.
---
3. Where was the reward?  My wife completed Ecological Balance.  We waited for the quest reward..... and nothing.  The quest left the tab, that was the reward?
---
This isn't the only quest that does this.  Big Game Hunt also splits the group into different objectives, where I had to kill an Angler (at level 10!!!) while my wife had to go kill a molerat.  I understand that these quests are to be 'radiant' and repeating.  But, can people on the same team PLEASE DO THE SAME THING OR HAVE THE SAME GOAL?  This is why we, ya know, group up!
---
I pre-order it to experience a fallout with my best friend, he just played the beta. 
---
After playing all the other games of the saga, I don't feel this one as a fallout. 
---
Well, I wish you luck to you and your wife!
---
You do understand that the issue has nothing to do with the engine itself and everything to do with the custom developed net code or whatever net code they modified.
---
Hopefully a bunch of kids are training in the forest getting loot and gear of squirrels.
---
He wouldn’t and doesn’t cover the “good stuff” because they don’t get clicks.  That’s the problem.  He’s only interested in creating a hate mob because it earns him money.
---
I see this sub is filled with people who have absolutely 0 input to contribute. Why am I not surprised. You all kill hope on the daily.
---
Why are people like this? What is wrong with them? Honestly man, this is weird.
---
inb4 dumb reddit karma is dumb and people downvote this because "muh opinionz are better"
---
CHOOSE THE DARK SIDE
---
No that's what you're doing with this bullshit comment. Good job
---
Thanks. I agree that this isn’t a true Fallout game. I’m afraid that I’ve ruined my wife’s perception of what a Fallout game is.
---
Of course he was. I just said he wrote it lol.
---
They should let people host their own servers off their own internet or whatever.
---
They're on AWS, all it takes to create more instances is more money. Given this issue is entirely their fault and is destroying peoples characters it seems right for them to spend some money to keep the game playable while they work on a fix.
---
AWS is not really "on-demand".
---
Of course it is if you are a small dev / company and you need a few dozens systems spawned ASAP.
---
If you need hundreds of instances with terabytes of ram, you still need to give them a heads up for provisioning. (to be fair their turn-around time is still much quicker that what you would get if you had your own datacenter, but that just means it takes weeks instead of months, not minutes)
---
While the hackers are the abusers, it was Bethesda's job to prevent such things from happening. In 2019-2020 releasing an online game with no anti-cheat, server-side sanity checks and other preventative measures always leads to rampant hacking. The hackers will always exists and the only way to stop them is to prevent them from being able to modify your code. How do you do that? By writing proper net-code. So yeah, Bethesda is mostly at fault here, especially considering they received ample warnings from modders almost a year ago that this could happen.
---
That's where Todd Howard has been hiding from reality. Lol
---
Please enjoy your 500 atom
---
Yes, because anyone who would ever disagree with you MUST be a cheater.  You haven't been on this site even a full month, you are the one clearly trolling.  Hope you do get your things stolen.
---
They're on Christmas break.
---
Tbh the simple solution: remove legendary effects from the game so that PvP is more exciting and skill based like it is in NW rather than a numbers game where the best rolled weapon always wins, then they wouldn’t even need the damage cap.
---
Something the Enclave value more than money.
---
These guys are the lowlifers, stealing from gamers. People with familys without jobs if Bethesda closes it down, nothing to be proud of at that point, scum is what they are, nothing else.
---

---
At this point a free month won't cut it, from what I've seen from that posted hack video alone would be enough for me to stop playing the game for good if I was one of the victims.
---
Todd is my mom and she gives me an allowance of of 1million caps a week. Thanks for the support, I've thought about doing exactly what you suggested. Not sure yet.
---
Sloth love Vault-Tec!
---
Yes, unfortunately. Sorry, dude.
---
Damn ok I’m on Xbox but good luck to you and stay safe out there
---
It's because these people love fallout, there is no other game like it, yes Bethesda are incompetent but the player base should not have to punish themselves by not playing.
---
Why would that person, or anyone, play Fallout 76?
---
Thank god. I am a musician, and my love for music extends into this game. I have all of the instruments at my camp that can be placed (no mouth harp or drum, and no theremin), and I found a trumpet and put it on display. I thought that maybe I was descending into a self-inflicted madness as I heard the guitar.
---
From where I can tell to have a very very small team working on this game due to low priority. This team is certainly overwhelmed but trying their best.
---
Cope
---
DUDE VERMACIDE!!!! THAT MFER! This is the guy who came into my base last week bro, he killed me, my girl, and walked through my walls like it was nothing... now i see this FUCKER stealing peoples shit!? BETHESDA!? I REPORTED HIM 2 FUCKING WEEK AGO! YOU ABSOLUTE DIPSHITS, SO DID MY WIFE!!!!!!

I run a similar build but because i refuse to condone using froglegs i base my build around pub stomping frogleg users. I call it duck hunting build.
---
Master Shotgunner
---
Skeet shooter
---
lifegiver
---
suppressor
---
Gun runner
---
quickhands
---
nerd rage. 
---
instead of tenderizer i run suppressor for that nice hip fire shotgun spread debuff. Life giver gives more room for nerd rage to procc. since this is a shotgun only build i loot safely for a long time as I'm going to need to do that anyway to likely find a good shotgun, so by then i have plenty of stims and don't need Pharma farma.  And nothing throws people for a loop more than when the shotgun spray just...keeps going which is why i run quick hands. 
---
This is one of the few builds I'll consider using power armor for because this isn't about subtlety. It's about being a beefy debuffing tank that fills frogleggers with bird shot. They wanna act like birds ima treat them like birds.
---
I feel awful for everyone who has been affected by this hack. I know getting Legendaries can take many hours of farming and to see them gone is extremely frustrating. I think the best thing we could all do though is just forget about the game until this is fixed and enjoy our Holidays. I doubt Bethesda can really do much during the Holidays. If you care about your items it's really not worth the risk of trying to play on public servers right now.
---
Yup, that was a mistake, but after about fifteen minutes of trying to get onto my private world I gave up.
---
I remember hearing about this weeks ago. And I experienced it before the NW rewards.
---
Duping is honestly like watching really fucked porn. We're all guilty of facilitating it at least once, but everyone publicly decries it.
---
This game is cursed, it will drive you away eventually. If not today then 6 months down the road when another game breaking bug hits.
---
It still doesn't compare to hellgate london accidentally deleting and being unable to recover every character in the game.
---
Fallout 76 is an abomination of a game and is the prime example of how far video game development has fallen. When Bethesda can literally screw players exactly like you from start to finish and yet you keep playing, supporting the game and now your attacking a youtuber for actually bringing attention to a relevant issue. OP you are literally a scourge to the progression of modern gaming yet he doesn't call you out for the damage you do to the quality control of the gaming industry.
---
I thought I heard guitar. Maybe I’m mistaken, I thought it sounded brighter than a bass.
---
Meat hook less than 10 seconds more like it...
---
How many people are seriously buying the weapons that they are selling?
---
There is also a world between "not being involved personally" and being fucking clueless of what you're talking about.
---
Bug's aren't the issue though, it's asshole hackers abusing those bugs to grief others. If they had offline mode at the start - this wouldn't be nearly as big of a deal.
---
But.. I haven’t felt screwed?  There are things that are minor annoyances but guess what
---
*gasp*
---
I think the game is fun
---
Not many problems on PS4...
---
Apology accepted btw
---
Make sure both you and your friend that you are in the same channel each game
---
Because for a lot of these people it's not about Bethesda being wrong, it's that they dont want to face that they themselves were wrong about Bethesda. And know they will have to face the embarrassment of acknowledging as such with their friends. So they double down and tell themselves things to convince themselves that it's not that bad. 
---
If I remember correctly there was a study done by a psychologist who started a cult claiming aliens were in contact with him and that if they follow him they will be taken away to paradise on a giant space ship. Well he actually convinced some people and had them full on believing in his crap. He proclaimed a date in which they would be taken from the Earth, well this date came and passed but instead of calling him out they came to the conclusion they didnt do it right and became twice as fervent and faithful.
---
Kinda similar to what is going on here.
---
Amazing!
---
I was gifted Red Dead Redemption 2 from a friend and while I loved the first one, I was hesitant to the 2nd because I heard the game mechanics were extensively tedious and it was poorly optimized.
---
At first it seems tedious but after you sink into the world it becomes second nature and while it isn't optimized well, there's a lot of options to get it running well for your PC specs, just takes some trial and error. 
---
I bring this up because Red Dead Online reminds me of Fallout 76 in many ways, the good things about 76. Much like 76 you need to eat, drink, take meds, but there's no cars, just horses so it's slower, heavy on exploring, collecting and playing roles and while I love the Fallout settings, Red Dead Online exceeds it in almost every way. Random encounters, bounties, story missions, I could go on and on. 
---
I highly recommend it if you like 76 collecting, exploring, killing loops. The downside, it's heavily geared towards spending real money to get things faster online just like GTA but unlike GTA you can actually (very slowly) earn this real world money purchasable gold in game. 
---
If you play 76 you're used to grinding and I spend no money in RDRO and I have been fine. I had just reinstalled 76 to a ssd now I uninstalled it because of all this BS going on. Red Dead was the game I didn't know I needed in 76's absence. The story is an excellant ride as well.
---
Why would someone who doesnt stalk the 76 reddit is a better question.
---
"Once again"? When has it stopped being a laughing stock?
---
Right because in 24 hours they will be putting up more atomic shop items to sell. Heres all the fun overpriced items we have been holding onto all month making sure you dumped all your daily quests on the previous christmas offers. You cant do anything with them though because somebody will come and strip you to your skivvies. But it's the thought that counts right? Just take pleasure in knowing someday we may get around to fixing the current hack/bug so you can look at it in game. Youtubers are gonna get fed.
---
Yes. I don't agree with it, but I also don't agree with Bethesda living with their heads buried in the sand for so long that it takes something like this to MAYBE get their attention.
---
Yes it is. Hacks are still hacks. But when you have someone who use hack because he's done with rng and want to spawn a 3* Fixer, and on the other hand someone who use hack to steal everything for no reason, you can clearly see a difference.
---
I'm not defending any for the initial use. But still, if the first can cancel the second it's not that bad, since you can't expect Bethesda support and their "lack of tool to add lost items"...
---
It just works.
---
Bethesda said the came wouldn't be hacked easily.
---
Are you seriously comparing this shitty game to an actual world war where millions of people died
---
Just yesterday, I was considering a year’s subscription, same as you, because of all the event items, but I talked myself into getting a month instead, and after experiencing the private server, I’m glad I didn’t go for a year yet. The private server is very lonely; I enjoy having other players around. I do like the option to run an event without competition, but it got old fast. As for the scrap box, I’ll fill it for a month, and still be able to take junk out even after the sub ends. I’ll probably resubscribe after two or three more months. I agree with others, before you spend $100, go for just a month first!
---
In this day and age the lack of a two factor auth for bethesda makes it their responsibility IMO. It's like their fucking AOL, as in dial up you got mail AOL.
---
So it just works?
---
Ah, the amateur troll returns.
---
What's the matter, your bridge collapse?
---
I’ve seen a few post a while back that people did get roll backs some didn’t get everything but they got most of it back and some youtuber had his hacked and got his back also this was months and months ago
---
You're insane and a shitty person dude. You're defending this bullshit, and that makes you trash.
---
Private worlds aren't safe either. They've been cracked, too. No hack is publicly available for that. Yet.
---
&gt; Why would someone who doesnt stalk the 76 reddit is a better question.
---
That's not even a question...
---
“what do you mean, now we can finally play the game!”
---
It's not a hack
---
It's a feature
---
with 14x the detail!
---
Most of the community are great people. But then you have the douchebags as well. But they are a minority.
---
Maybe someone else remembers, I should look up that article, but some are making like 70k off it (so yea people buy it..)
---
&gt; I DIDN'T have access to the service I paid (frankly way to much money) fo
---
Use this as a life lesson - don't give your money to companies like Bethesda. The $18 blue power armor color should have given their intentions away.
---
"While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected, we are taking this very seriously and resolving this is currently our top priority."
---
Hundreds between reddit and bethnet community. Hardly a "small number".
---
Anytime
---
I wish you the best
---
Just play another game in the meantime. Is it seriously that hard to not play for a couple of days whilst Bethesda fixes the issue?
---
As a melee user i have a [solution](https://streamable.com/d3459) to this and its pretty funny. 
---
Mines.  Run in spook the little birdies and drop a mine which they land back on like a mario on a goomba.  Hilarious.
---
Just because the war happened in 2077 doesn't make it any less real.
---
They are probably masochists that found a copy of the game inside a random trashcan and have been playing ever since. Pretty sure those are the same people that spent thousands of hours playing Anthem too.
---
Here comes the downvoting warriors.
---
Thanks let’s hope they get banned
---
Yep.  It's 90smemelord, the biggest piece of shit to ever curse the game with his existence
---
How will they sue a minor 10 years old player (see the usual F76 players age)?
---
Pretty sure all of the above had actual support tools to undo the damage too. Ive held my "tongue" on a lot of this but not being able to put an item in a players inventory is fucking ridiculous.
---
People in the game are mostly really nice, on here they are monsters who can’t handle truth or constructive criticism.
---
If people don't like the game they don't have to play it, so sad that they have to go out of their way to ruin it for those who do enjoy the game.
---
An offline mode wouldn’t make sense if the whole game is suppose to be an online fallout. The only way to stop the hackers is for Bethesda to fix there game. It would be nice if they take like 3 or more months to try and fix there game and they should also release a test server.
---
I'm responding to this bit of fucking stupidity from the post. "Am I the only one who feels like these content creators have no right to hate on a game that they don’t even play"
---
This is just fucking moronic.
---
Isnt there a video where a guy steals 500+ players on his own?
---
One youtuber claimed to have robbed over 500 people in one day. I'd hardly call that a few.
---
Bro it IS the 200+ he messed with me 2 weeks ago. I can't believe this shit. I'm taking it to video on youtube fuck it. I've had it.
---
Hopefully everyone gets their stuff back, this action is happening a little too late....
---
Why are you on the fallout 76 subreddit if you don't play the game?
---
&gt; It was a small playerbase of dedicated people that really enjoyed the game and the optimism for it to get fixed later was strong. 
---
That hit me hard. That was me back in March. When the sewer raid hit and was clunky and bad, I was peeved but figured they would fix it, then it was sheepsquatch stuff. new fun content, I was excited to play, but it was broken. I looked past it, scout stuff was on the way. Then my badge progress got bugged... and I sent a ticket, and got no support. I simply put it down at that point. Uninstalled the game completely. I said "maybe by the time wastelanders comes out the game will be in better shape, I'll start a new character and play like the game was intended to be played at launch." Sadly it looks like we will never get there. I stay subbed her to get the news on this game and jesus it's just been bad news after bad news. All set with that TYVM.
---
Thank you. Much appreciated!
---
I'm presuming that I am safe from this exploit by only using a Fallout 1st private mode server? Anyway thanks for working on a fix.
---
Some say there are reasons for them to be legally prosecuted.
---
This is going to blow
---
Ah yes, the classic downplaying the situation, nice.
---
It really comes across as scummy how often Bethesda insists on going "This RARE glitch that only affected a SMALL number of a FEW players"
---
Stop trying to downplay it.
---
Fix your game ffs
---
And you all defended them lol.
---
Lol, don't be so fucking naive...more than a few of those are from the jackholes doing it...to further get off on there pathetic attempt to hijack the game...
---
p.s. make sure you compensate all the "hackers" when they put in tickets claiming they lost something they themselves took...look up insurance fraud.
---
Legally? Damn that’s rough
---
If you aren’t a troll this is the endgame.
---
A small number? Its significantly North of 'Small'
---
You can only blame Bethesda.
---
Lvl 374 and still playing. I'm not gonna give up because of these scumbags. And yeah, i got robbed too, but i was smart enough not to carry any valuable.. 
---
I dont give a f... playin' since be'a, so they can f themselves. Sorry for the language, but im really pissed off. If you leave, you're doing what they want you to do. They want to ruin the game, and they doin' it just fine.
---
I don't know the community in game has been pretty fine for me other than the hackers in nuclear winter but I'm not going to risk playing adventure mode now if Hackers are running around doing this crap. The Reddit may not be particularly friendly and the game may not be great but I enjoy it for what it is although I would enjoy it more if I had a private server that I could mod out.
---
if 10,000 people were affected, that is still only about 1% of the playerbase.  
---
So small number is relative to how many people actually play.
---
For a multinational media corporation, small is much different than if they were a small family operated doughnut store.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk

Which drum?? The snare drum is craftable under acoustic instruments. Is there another drum I haven't seen?
---
Ps I too have all craft able instruments set up and want to hear them all playing together. I haven't found a proper video of that online.
---
There you go, I fixed it.
---
That you to whoever gave me a silver!!
---
Wild Appalachia
---
The hackers have to spend time to figure out how to hack the game in the first place. So that time translates. If the devs want to make it easy for the game to be hacked, then they deserve to have to spend more time fixing the issues. If the devs don't care about the security of the game and the consumers it affects then the hackers will make them care.
---
Same got hit last night as well
---
HAHAHAHA! I CANNOT BELIEVE WHAT I JUST READ!
---
Lol, i just got a visual of the finding nemo segulls all saying cope.
---
They can take my wood armor, but they will never take My FREEDOM!
---
Well ya I get that but an offline feature should be available for when I’m unable to get online. I’m not suggesting they remove online either🤷‍♂️
---
Will we ever get a status update on any anti-cheat or server side validation checks? Seems like the cheats keep scaling and getting worse
---
and honestly, this should 100% be enough for people to put this game up, but they won't. They will still suck the 76 teet.
---
Well, when it comes to the total size of the player base, it probably is a relatively small amount of users.  But yes, it does come across as downplaying an issue that really shouldn't be downplayed.
---
Uh... I doubt there's even 10.000 guys across all platforms. Two months ago someone did the math and it showed that the playercount was around 14k total.
---
Look at it this way, GTAV is one of the top games for several years and they still having hacking and cheating issues; 76 is not alone in their problems.
---
Me and some buddies have been doing this often during the holidays finding low levels and givig out weps n armor especially due to the current event and all the low level legendary this we aquire daily plus at our levels we have n done it all. All we do is collect now days so helping out is just a common thing many people do now.
---
We are, it just seems to work only if I switch between the chat modes
---
No, they downvote because you make a hate post with no evidence to your claims, all you did was shit on the game whenever you probably dont even play it, and if you want to help give some CONSTRUCTIVE CRITICISM. You are not helping are you are doing is spreading stuff this community hears all day and it gets on my nerves to hear the same stuff all day, so while you think we are just dumb bethesda fan-boy fucks, YOU are just ingnorant to the fact we actually play and give a shit about the game while you just talk. I'm going to kindly look through the community and count how many posts are exactly like yours.
---
You've ruined finding Nemo for me now lol
---
I saw the youtube video, the hacker has to focus on your character (and display the trade/invite UI to get access to your inventory), so it could be worse! Seriously though, Bethesda need to encrypt inventories as a starter.
---
Only a few players? What do you call this?  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk)
---
No one see it's a fake account with "\_" at the end of username?!?
---
add me, im gonna give it to you, that plan :) ign: pixelblondie /PC/
---
😆
---
Honestly business-as-usual doesn't bother me, not a great game but I'm getting my enjoyment out of it but if my computer literally explodes on me or something I think that I would change my mind.
---
YouTube always makes me feel better about spending too much time on Reddit
---
It’s not the snare drum. It’s a hand held drum. You can find it in a few places. Check the stage in the vault before NW.
---
There is also the mouth harp. Don’t know if you can get it.
---
I don’t think you can get either.
---
That is not hacking? That’s just what happens when you have an alt.
---
Why people who don't play this game hate it and the people who plays it are always hated? It's because of a simple reason. It's because of you people that MOST in the gaming industry now has this MASSIVE contempt towards their consumers. So what if I release a bug ridden game? People are that desperate to have something to entertain themselves enough that they will plough through any kind of crap just to be entertained.  
---
So what if I faked out a discount? So what if I finally made my game P2W? So what if it's still a messy game and I decided to make it premium? What can you do? Just shut up and play. Remember you desperately need us, but we don't need you.
---
It sucks, but there's no way I'd be on a public pc server right now. Or ever for that matter. There's always massive hacking on PC. I feel for you. If you ever come to ps4 I'll help you out.
---
Why can't both be shitty? The hackers could have just "shown" it was possible "hey guys this is some shit we figured you could do. We just want to raise awareness. We're not going to release it and we've let Bethesda know" then if Bethesda didn't do anything they could have said "Bethesda didn't do anything so we're going to release it to force their hand"
---
If we are talking about the people who are down in the trenches trying to plug holes with chewed bubblegum: sure. 
---
But the management over at Bethesda needs to be raked over the coals. 
---
I recall hearing somewhere that someone who codes at Bethesda said something along the lines of the company recently getting new managers who have no clue how the engine works, so new hires who jump aboard are not shown how to work with the tools they are given and instead are told to watch modding videos on Youtube to get answers to their questions.
---
Given everything going on, the above sounds about right and it wouldn't shock me one bit if it turns out to be true.
---
Yeah man, give us more screenshots of a dlc that will probably also be bad. They're hella bad at teasing dlcs it's so sad.
---
Downvoted for facts good ol reddit.
---
Call down? Huh?
---
Hard to prove that when the only stuff on this subreddit that is upvoted are the issues with this game now isn't it.
---
Yup. And since this game is not on Steam we can't get an accurate count, for PC at least.
---
I think you are, but with one important caveat - you need to be on a private server set to Team Only, and essentially be a team of 1.
---
Otherwise, anyone from your friends list can join at any time.  And unless you diligently curate your friends list, you probably have some randos in there who used you to fast travel at some point, who you might not trust.
---
It isn't.
---
I lost my X-01 and my stared Laser Gatling Ultracite  this morning... The evacuation should be until a fix is found...
---
A few?
---
Hahaha lmao you deserved it
---
so i guess this doesnt mean anything to you either?
---

---
you're playing this game while it's being completely ripped apart ever since it's release
---
you literally deserve this
---
C O P E, bethesda shill
---
They actually don't need the trade ui. They can open the inventory without it. As Juicehead said in his video, he just had the trade menu up to show what he lost.
---
As long as they're in render distance of your character, they can take stuff. There's a video of a guy using it to steal from players, he claims he stole from 532 in the video.
---
When I started playing back in march I feared something like this would happen
---
...a few players? 
---
...only a small number?
---
What alternate universe did you post this from?
---
Lmao, i hope people dont think its fishy when i log off my lvl 50 and onto my 300 guys! Mighty sketch lvling
---
The low level developers are 100% doing their best. 
---
What I'm talking about is Bethesda leadership who yeah deserve most of the blame.
---
BETHESDA just confirmed that it is PC only. Theyre releasing a hot fix today.
---
If only they were so efficient in fixing the issue. Still no official statement. Disgraceful.
---
*gasps*
---
And I don't suggest you looking up the one without underscore.
---
Thank you for looking into it. 
---
Reading is your friend. Exploits that affect a small number of players compared to the entire player base can still be treated seriously, as they said in the same sentence.
---
Dupers and exploiters are absolutely part of the community, they play the game to participate in gameplay mechanics. And while I don't approve of their methods to get power, I understand why they're doing it and that their motivations are not extraneous to the game.
---
However, a person who joins a game *just* to troll people by stealing their things, who has no further interest in actually playing the game, who does not care about the power accrued, and whose motivations are external (i.e. fuck Bethesda and all these dumb gamers who play)... that person is not part of the community. Plain and simple. A bankrobber is not a part of the financial community, they are thieves and predators, and these people are also thieves and predators.
---
If you still disagree then that's fine, it's your choice. But I have nothing more to say on this topic.
---
So are you
---
More like take it offline and remake it in the ESO engine
---
"Few players"? You know that one guy robbed over 500(!) people in one night? That's more than a few. And there are more hackers than just this one. More and more victims are showing up here.
---
I'm glad you took an action towards this issue but please note that hundreds or even thousands od players have been robbed, not just a few.
---
There’s more people playing on NW than on the pubic server. But for the pubic servers it was just that, a hand full of people actually running around doing stuff like helping new people out but other than that it’s pretty much level 200+ sitting at their camps waiting for people to buy stuff.
---
Are you stupid? The dupers arnt going to be dragged in because someone is stealing items. The hacker stealing shit isnt "one of them" because they arnt some organized group of people and they arnt backstabbing each other now.
---
No, that's the actual Bethesda account.  It's always had that.  Their post history also easily proves their authenticity.
---
Haha, I'm not a troll, I promise.
---
Stop lying, I personally counted dozens, there are possibly hundreds of victims, with numbers growing as we speak.
---
Also your mods on official forums just banned my account: [https://i.imgur.com/FytMIeF.png](https://i.imgur.com/FytMIeF.png), because I named the cheater (you can search him up). Well done.
---
I never said the exploit was fake, I said this video is fake.
---
Oh thank you. That released Alot of preasures. Should I delete the post?
---
that's still a small number compared to the player base. second half of the same sentence states they're treating it seriously.
---
My guess is that this is to deliberately really kill the game because a lot of people will be getting it for Christmas.
---
They just made one. Hot fix is being released later today.
---
Does Bethesda have the budget to implement a fix?
---
They've acknowledged it just now.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377441/an-update-on-the-current-pc-exploit?language%5B%5D=en
---
It is a legit BGS account (I think!)
---
Because other devs a have updated their engine to be on par with the technology needed or beyond and Bethesda been 10 years behind since oblivion.
---
The irony of putting it on the fridge though
---
Honestly it all on Bethesda at this point you have done noting wrong you should totally try and get a refund
---
Up to you.
---
" few players losing items " Are you fucking kidding me BGS!??? There's a video of a hacker stealing inventories of over 500 players, and that's just ONE PERSON DOING IT. The actual count is probably in the thousands who have lost their items. Fucking. Shame.
---
Typically a networking and infrastructure team is available 24/7. In an online game, keeping the game "online" does require people to work odd hours if hamsters fall off their wheels in the servers. This problem though, is a software engineering problem, and those types of teams are typically working on things you will not see for months on end. Even if the developer is on it ASAP, it takes time to fix without breaking everything else so the dev will probably do some basic dev testing. After that, it most likely is getting turned over to another team for testing (the team everyone hates), and once the testing team has blessed it, the code is now a release candidate, but there could still be a number of hoops the package of code might need to jump through before players seeing it, due to company policy. 
---
In other words, the process for deploying code to a production environment is usually not a fast turn around time. The only way I see us getting a patch very soon is if the devs have known about it for a while (to study it, reproduce it, and understand a proper fix), and if they and/or QA worked their butts off over the weekend and testing is going well, then we might possibly see something soon.
---
&gt; I always thought the story in Fallout 3 and 4 sucked. 
---
I'm glad that you appreciate the dead world that is Appalachia in game, I'll admit the atmosphere has grown on me too over time, but if you honestly think it was a decision done purely to get rid of 'cringe story and npcs (people) lol' and not mostly because they couldn't figure out how / it was too expensive and time-intensive to make a world where you could all talk to NPCs at one and it look/feel natural, give the usual choice and consequence, while also having changes to the world, and the servers not crapping, then I have a lovely piece of land to sell you.
---
You can see this being the issue in action with the Vault raid, and the lag and bugs with their first try at 'instancing' an area, it was largely unplayable. Now they have trickled out Grafton Pawnshop, where you can enter alone and it's stable and fast, but everything refreshing completely on a load means that larger areas might as well have signs labelled 'free unlimited scrap' if that's how they all work.
---
I firmly believe that in the early stages, even into development, Fallout 76 was intended as a vast single-player spinoff in the vein of New Vegas, and would have put the rest of the series to shape in scope and story. Then someone decided it was to be live-service and put two rounds in it's skull. Forcing it to be multiplayer has caused practically every none legacy issue in the game. Hell, just note how private servers are limited to 8 players and how much more stable they are than public; that alone is a backhanded concession that the public servers are majorly overloaded.
---
Thank you for the update. What a relief.
---
Why is it ironic? Isn’t the fridge an Atom Shop Item?
---
dude melee is fucking horrible.  120 ranks of it let me tell ya.  Not only do you have to have several stacking damage buffs on a large crate melee weapon, you also have to hit them with a notoriously buggy running attack that will do one of four things.  Fail to register a hit,  miss, make them literally [invulnerable](https://streamable.com/nc503) to further melee hits once they are downed,  or actually just work normally.  
---
Not to mention that a running attack takes nearly half your ap bar to even do. So if your are running literally more then 6 feet you can only ever get one, only one running attack off. Which means you can only fight one person at a time. 
---
No dude Melee is total garbage and it's very limited one shot potential that half the time doesn't even work because of bugs and poor aim design does not make it over powered in a game mode of super jumping automatic gunners.  
---
Especially when the scrap assaultron head can do even MORE oneshot damage, with no risk, no ap cost, and at a range! or at least it did until recently but now it's [bugged](https://streamable.com/ymu4c).
---
I'd made an edit.
---
Thanks very much.
---
You're delusional lmao you shouldn't have to play something to trash it for being trash. You guys somehow keep playing a garbage game after Bethesda has spit in your face so many times.
---
People like Yong put pressure on these companies by putting a big spotlight on the problems. You should be thanking them.
---
Now bring on the downvotes. The truth hurts.
---
I used to have the same opinion as you, but recently Bethesda deserves every bit of bad PR they get, Fo1st was the nail in the coffin.
---
I've even gone back and liked every hate video that i had disliked before.
---
I have doubts it's proportionally that small. From the video that was posted somewhere on this sub showing someone do it, it seems to be pretty fast, a single person could probably have affected like over a thousand people by now if they wanted to no-life it. So I guess it's a question of how many people can and are willing to do that.
---
In general I don't get why they even try to downplay it, it's like what, trying to save face I guess? Tbh, a single player having all their stuff stolen by a hacker is 1 too many, this kind of absurd exploit is that bad.
---
Sometime late last night or early this morning this happened to me. I didn't notice specifically when it occurred, or who might have been near me at the time, but every piece of armor and weaponry I had equipped simply vanished from my inventory... This is my only character and now suddenly all my build-enabling gear and my rare handmade rifle are \*\*GONE\*\* and to top it all off the head of my player model seems to be permanently invisible. I mean my character is completely destroyed because of this, I lost dozens of hours obtaining these. Totally ridiculous... How can they have a faux-MMO looter-shooter and have issues like these that eliminate your entire progression? I am beyond raged... Sent a support ticket but I am not feeling optimistic. I'm extra angry, also, because I gave Bethesda a chance with this game even after the horrible year they've had since the release. I have such a history with Bethesda and Fallout that even the overwhelmingly bad press couldn't keep me away, but this is a bridge too fucking far. I feel like such a goddamn fool to pay for Fallout 1st and for even buying it to begin with.
---
Yea minor Annoyances like how they sold people a bag that didnt exist  because they didnt wanna pay out the money until enough people complained. About how they pressed on a modding community just to come out with a subscription that does the same thing. You are screwing the rest of gamers by showing these AAA companies like Bethesda they can put out a subpar product and act in the most anti consumer way possible without directly saying screw you to your face and youll still support them unconditionally.
---
That's karma for supporting Bethesda killing the Fallout franchise
---
As long as you stay in a private server with invites off, you're most likely fine.
---
My friend found where someone had dumped a massive amount of highend items, like an entire inventory, so we are thinking they some of the hackers are just stripping people purely to F with people and then throwing away most of it ...
---
That’s not hacking, he just shot you with an automatic and drained your health before you had time to react
---
Go to enemy heavy places kill everything and loot everything a few times build on a junk resource and get a scraptron also get the scrapper card to get more from scrapping weapons
---
By OP's moronic logic, you should only comment on my stupidity if you, yourself, are stupid.
---
That same prick tried to add me to team yesterday.
---
What does it mean?
---
Playing this game and supporting Bethesda destroy Fallout should be criminal
---
That is apples and oranges. GTA online is p2p with no dedicated servers.
---
He says few players. Man, we reached ten thousand, or more.. i hope you guys just shut down the public servers 'til you get your solution.
---
". Bailing on a very tiny chance that you actually run into a hacker is your call but I'm not supportive of people posting asking the community to run away because fear &gt; facts"
---
Fact is quite a lot of people have been damaged by the hack. Murphy's law is a thing. If you're willing to risk it neat, but portraying people warning others it might be best to stay away as promoting an "irrational fear of possibility" is one of the goofiest things I've seen all year.
---
Do you think criminals are not part of your community IRL?
---
I am totally baffled at the total disregard for these people who are actively playing the game as part of the community..
---
There are absolutely hackers playing with groups, even outside of this particular hack, that are well known in the community. Like they live with us dude.
---
"Hi everyone,
---
We are investigating reports of a PC-only exploit that could be  abused by cheaters, which may have resulted in a few players losing  items that their characters had equipped. We have been actively working  toward a solution for this and have a fix that we are currently  evaluating for release today.
---
While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have  been negatively affected, we are taking this very seriously and  resolving this is currently our top priority.
---
We would like to apologize to those of you who were impacted by this  exploit. We want to make this right, and we are currently looking into  ways we may be able to compensate you. If you believe you have been  affected, please let us know by [submitting a ticket to our Customer Support team](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10).
---
As mentioned above, this issue only affects PC, and we are currently  planning to bring the PC version of the game offline today to release a  fix. We will let you know as soon as we are ready to begin maintenance.
---
Thank you very much."
---
No, on his logic, I should comment on your stupid logic if I see it by myself. I did.
---
This man will get down voted because fallout 76 doesn't have a fandom it has a cult.
---
           Or
---
Galatians 4:16
---
Y'all are sick and need help. Bethesda was a great company once. They would be again if the cult would hold them accountable.
---
Citation needed.
---
They are in damage control mode, every word they pick is probably being run by a lawyer before they post anything.
---
Seriously doesn't bother me.
---
Yeah, that is really shitty, employees shouldn't have precious time with their families taken away. They should just shut down the servers for now, except perhaps private and nuclear-winter since it does less damage there, send out a message that it will be dealt with, and then come back fresh and committed.
---
Aren't you just presupposing peoples' positions as a basis to excuse away the legitimate complaint that this game was released in an unsecure form?
---
Every game is hackable. But this is on a whole new level. No game has ever been this exploitable. Can you imagine if the WoW community started losing all their equipped gear? The only reason this isn’t a bigger deal is because the FO76 community was already dwindling to begin with. This will be the final nail in the coffin if BGS doesn’t do something major
---
Did it. Regret nothing.
---
Yes, Fallout 76 players are very nice. When I was like on 15th level, some 100+ guy came to me and dropped me a lot of ammo, just like that, and god bless him because I really did have a problem with ammo.
---
the current active player count shows 37,000 players online right now. 
---
So whoever did that math was wrong. 
---
If there are 37,000 people online in the middle of a workday, then logical deduction shows there are probably at least 10 times that number who are not online right now.
---
Id say its  more inherently selfish as people did profit off it but i dont think it was done to grief people or ruin peoples experience. Some people used it for grief but those are in the minority i believe.
---
Basically, there's a guy stealing the inventory of all the people of the server. Simple as that.
---
The only compensation I have ever seen was the scrapbox debacle where they gave out scrap kits to people who lost scrap in their boxes when fallout 1st came out.
---
Pre ordered, wife and I have 700 hrs total.  But if someone recreated this hack on PS4 tomorrow... ouch. 
---
Hope you'll come back after the fix when they decide the compensation.
---
Thanks I saw that posted! Do you work for Bethesda?
---
" [The270thGender](https://www.reddit.com/user/The270thGender/) " = Tood Howard confirmed.
---
At least a few thousand victims is "only a small number of characters have been negatively affected"...
---
Yes, you are...
---
I’ve done the same myself and I am a gamer girl. Matter of fact, I have a half dozen low level items I’m going to find a “victim” for next time I hop on. 😊
---
I never said why I thought they did it.  Also never said I cared.  Dead to you.  Not to me.  You put those words on the page.  Projecting your negativity onto others doesn't make you right.
---
Conspiracy theory: hack starts to happen as soon as fallout 1st is launched😂
---
Think so
---
But how did you go about naming the cheater? how vulgar was your post?
---
I have an i5 6600k 4,3 Ghz and a msi rtx 2060 oc mode and playing low or ultra don't change the fact that the fps stability of this game is garbage due to the crappy engine, i'm playing a 144hz capped at 120hz to use the 60fps cuz the monitor settings in game are very limited.
---
Yeah. The in-game community is super nice and friendly but the people on Reddit and other social medias are super toxic
---
Lol reason for ban: you’ve been perm banned...what kind of reason is that?! 😪
---
The tune in the ad is the same music used in the atom shop.
---
I dont think OP really understood meaning.
---
Basicly means dealing with something that is difficult. For example, you cope when your pet dies, you cope when you end a relationship.
---
" a few" ?? "small number" ?? nice try to diminish severity and negligence.
---
They will let it boil for a while longer, then give a 10% discount on private servers for a month. After a few more weeks they will cut some development staff so they can give themselves some fat bonuses for their skillful navigation through the crisis.
---
I doubt it, he would be risking a lawsuit
---
I did the same, few hours ago. Stashed everything and i was head out to adventure. 5 mins later i was standing butt naked with my pipboy.
---
Laughing.
---
:D
---
They took my shitty clothes and my no legendary handmade. Have fun a.ssholes. :D
---
A Christmas Miracle!  Literally, till the release of this game, I never thought I would be luckier as a console player then a PC player. This game is a dumpster fire on consoles but an utter cluster f**k on PC, from what I've read on forums and witnessed on YouTube etc.
---
Good ol reddit always defending Bethesda until it becomes undeniable.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eepvot/an\_update\_on\_the\_current\_pc\_exploit/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eepvot/an_update_on_the_current_pc_exploit/)
---
No he/she means that for most people the endgame is to help out new folks in addition to grinding events and such. Most folks had someone be nice to them as a low level so they tend to pay it forward
---
Give scrapbox to everyone!
---
The saddest part of this is that it would be way less of an issue if they didn't paywall private servers. The only people perfectly safe from literal fraud (since some items can be purchased via the atom shop and are not attainable through gameplay) are those who have access to "private" servers and don't invite others. Everyone else is fair game for hackers as long as they can't confront it, and the thing with this particular hack was that they had at least 24 hours notice it was coming.
---
How are they going to fix this???
---
NW has been broken for months
---
"A few".
---
Meanwhile, in one video it shows 570 some odd players losing all the items they're wearing/carrying.
---
And that's just one video.
---
Here's hoping you get another tin foil hat for Christmas!!
---
Good. Now can we talk about how you guys knew well in advance that this is coming, and did zilch to warn the players?
---
...that’s not hacking he’s on an alt, you don’t look very spected out, I could run through your whole camp locked or not if I fast traveled on it enough bc it lags it and makes the walls not load in for a bit...and you have no idea what the guy was wearing or the weapons he was using....odds are he’s not a hacker he’s a decently built mule and since pvp dmg is somewhat made fair regardless of level you died
---
Edit: the stealing inventories is hacking though but with everything you showed in the video none of that looks like hacking
---
When the best you can say is "Hey, at least we haven't unrecoverably deleted everybody's characters!" you know your game is in bad shape.
---
Holy shit and that's just one guy using a publicly available hack, so you can imagine how much damage has really been done. And Bethesda has the gall to say "a small number of players".
---
Hi Todd, hope you’re having a good holiday working on this hotfix ❤️
---
Middle of a work day? Dude in the US at least most people are off of work for the holiday and children all have the week off. If it is only 37,000 on a major holiday then that is not a good sign.
---
Yup, that's a lesson worth learning, I'm never buying a bethesda product at full price again, and multi-player content is out the window completely I think. I'll be honest, I kinda hate myself for giving them money for first, but on the other hand I had it and specific features are useful. 
---
Or, at least, should have been, if they fucking worked properly.
---
Don't worry too much about fps stability (just use the game settings and Nvidia control panel to set the 3D options from quality to performance) in some moments the game will lose fps stability using also a 2080 super due to the engine crap stability
---
Yeah that's what I was thinking
---
So the solution is to BUY a subscription? LOL
---
Yea so far I've only player a hour or so and only by myself and was disappointed so I started playing a.c Odyssey instead. Maybe I'll give it another chance later today if I get bored with A.C lol
---
It's not my problem or care that people misread me on the internet. I do it all the time myself. When this happens I step back, re-read, take my internal embarrassment and move on. 
---
Also, in response to WHY would anyone fake such a thing, free stuff. 
---
I knew 10+ people who did it for scrap and witnessed countless others who I didn't know abuse the ticket system to receive the hand outs. 
---
Rats will play the system to gain an advantage in any way, shape or form just so they don't have to work as hard as others. 
---
We may not see collecting junk or legendaries as hard work, rather the fun of the game, but others do and they will try to circumvent said routines for the wrongful, quick route.
---
this seems like some employee insider shit right here...
---
Juno extractor
---
An always online game available to purchase and play through even during the holidays would therefore require that at least some degree of people be ready and on call for when/if the need arises. It's part of fulfilling a working service. 
---
The issues gets more frustrating when you compound it with Bethesda knowing about this hack spawning the Prydwen and other objects/NPCs not in the game long before Christmas was even around the corner.
---
It's bad service regardless of the way you look at it really. Can't blame anyone for being upset that it's lasted this long given methods to fix this should have already been in place or close to.
---
Imagine the level of faith you must have believing submitting a ticket would do something.
---
Too little, too late.
---
Good on Beth....
---
yeah they posted it themselves 15 min ago....
---
Prolly make new characters and just left the vault
---
Question how do some guys jump like 50 feet ? Is that some cheating or what? Can’t even kill them on nuclear war.
---
You got the unforgettable part right, lol.
---
90smemelord, grushnak, vonwiclehofer, all the same guy.  hes the one in the video.
---
If he is working on 76, he likely already doing that.     (On UK side currently anyway)
---
I know. I just let you know. It happened 10 mins ago.
---
Bethesda doesnt need outside interference to ruin the game...they're managing that just fine on their own.
---
Completely don't agree with your approach, but props for your honesty. As a serious question, do you display sociopathic tenancies in any aspects of your real life?
---
A *few*players
---
I wasnt vulgar, but I did name the guy, which is against forum rules. I mean I kinda expected it, so... Justice is swift, unfortunately not for real perpetrators.
---
How do you set it to team only? I can't see it in the social menu, sorry I only signed up for a month today because of this hack.
---
Interesting they state 
---
&gt; which may have resulted in a few players **losing items that their characters had equipped** 
---
I thought the hackers could steal your entire inventory (save quest items), not just equipped items?
---
I guess the only one that matters.
---
After Fo1st fiasco, i am not buying any bethesda product in the future.  
---
They have failed me as a really big fan.
---
The dinosaurs went extinct hours ago.
---
Doesn't seem like NW is a safe option according to some in other posts so far...
---
Are you assuming that I am defending Bethesda? Because I'm not, I'm just saying that they didn't purposely Release an Exploit.
---
The exploit exists though due to hackers ripping apart their shitty recycled game engine.
---
Be realistic dude.
---
Bethesda finally comes out after all of a DAY of this hack being active and you fuckers are busy picking a fight with them over the use of the word "few"?
---
Jesus Fucking Christ people...
---
It’s not a bug. It’s code that hackers created and are inserting into the game. Hackers did this. Without bad actors, there would be no problem.
---
Yeah Bethesda should be ashamed of themselves
---
You're joking right?
---
Do they even care about NW any more? It's a hacker's paradise for months now.
---
Then that will get hacked and changed to "No."
---
Where do you view a player count?
---
What hack?
---
(Tinfoil hats on)
---
\- Make you risk losing all items in your inventory in public servers
---
\- Make "private" servers a perk of a paid premium service
---
\- Doesn't fix the hack
---
\- Force remaining players to pay to subscribe
---
\- Profit?!
---
Bethesda is also on the hook for not having proper safeguards to ensure the products they sell are safe. Server stability, security, access etc. is all on their end. Trying to push this off on the hackers is just trying to give Bethesda a pass. Yeah, people shouldn't do it but they do. If Bethesda were a bank they would most definitely be getting sued right now. The games been barely making it for a year now, there's no excuse for state of FO76. None.
---
I agree with the OP.
---
We should also buy an additional Fallout First subscription, as a sign of thanks to Bethesda for tirelessly keeping this game bug-free throughout the holidays.
---
Conan has literally no story whatsoever, while Ark is literally everything I like in a game, though I like FO76 as well.
---
It's global server-wide.  So you can talk to everyone in the Text Chat community, even if they're not in the same world with you
---
Thank you for looking into this.  More importantly thank you for letting us know you are looking into this.  It was frustrating not hearing anything.
---
Piss off back to Overwatch and Team Fortress 2 poser.
---
What level are you and what were you shooting with?
---
How much were you paid to post this?
---
I definitely had the $20 I spent on it in fun. It'll be playable again shortly. It has really been managed poorly but I'm still having an okay timr with it.  definitely enjoy it more than Fallout 4.
---
To them, this is actually ideal as most people will pay for a quick fix. They might actually drag their feet beyond their holiday break if it’s proving profitable
---
No one *deserves* criminal acts perpetrated against them.
---
That’s just semantics, my point still stands. Inserting code/bug, whatever does it matter when the game is like this?
---
Yup, if you watch the now widely known hack video ( [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk)), the owner of that channel (Grushnak) runs with several other players in other videos, one of them is Vermacide. They all have access to it and spread it, just like a disease...
---
They wont to many ppl gonna be affected before the the do something about.
---
They have the means and money to make this game a lot less buggy, crashy and shallow.
---
I'm sure if the game were to fail the people who work on fo76 won't be let go. 
---
So no thanks on taking it easy on them.
---
P.S. I love this ”beta" of a game.
---
I agree with most of what you you said. I'm just saying some things are more important. It's not power to your home, it's not a food or water source, it's a video that is down a few days. Also they just released news of a possible patch today, check the forums.
---
I saw it on their blog, not here, my Bad
---
Well, I can' say that I have any framerate issues. I don't have a high Hz display though, so might be that's the difference.
---
"... hits blunt"
---
Would be a good marketing move to push players to Fallout 1st.
---
Just sort it out, whilst you're at it, sort out the dickheads with aim bots.
---
Exactly where I stand right now.
---
Every week it's a new hack. Every week Zenimax Bethesda acts like nothing is happening and pushes a new paid skin to the store.
---
i haven't launched the game in 2 months or so, and now I'm as far as I can be of doing so, fearing I can lose what I've earned in this sandbox of a game.
---
You just seem like you REALLY want to prove a point to a stranger which is kind of weird
---
You said Bethesda created the problem... clearly they did not
---
But wait if you pre-order now you will get a power armor helmet with 99% mold protection *only while supplies last.
---
Very few industries have today off.
---
If you are in marketing, you are working today.

If you are in IT, you are working today.

If you are a banker, you are working today

If you work in food service, you are working today.

If you are a teacher, you probably have the day off, but are probably grading papers.

If you are a student, you are off.

If you are a top level auto exectutive,  you have the day off.
---
The holiday isnt until wednesday dude.   
---
Not everyone has a week off at christmas like overentittled UAW workers.  Most of us are actually on the job today.
---
It's just angry kids trying to stay enraged... It's getting fixed, hasn't even been 14 hours of it being live, and they have to throw their tantrum at something. Christmas break is giving a lot of kids with no friends a lot of nothing to do.
---
This community is normally great when most of these people aren't visiting this sub. This was a very shitty thing to happen, but their (the raging kids/manbabies) attitudes towards everyone isn't acceptable and should be frowned upon. 
---
I'll get downvoted to shit for saying this, because ration people aren't the ones here, because they just did something else with their day instead of trying to shit on everything. Slow as hell work day for me, so I've just been reading all of this go hour to hour lol.
---
CONSPIRACY!!!!!!
---
Honestly it sucks but I would say quit and play something else for awhile that's what I'm probably gonna do for awhile if this hack spreads to console here I come killing floor 2
---
well beth is gonna take the pc version down to do a fix today so lets see if they actually fix the hack
---
Oh, I understand what they meant now. Thanks for the clarification. I was definitely grateful, as those silenced weapons really helped me out. I will definitely be paying it forward if &amp; when I'm able.
---
Bethesda could have won back some of the regard I used to have for them if they'd offered temporary private server access on a first come - first served basis while they sorted this out. Their suggestion that you upgrade your sub as a fix makes me feel like the victim of a protection racket. 
---
"Nice little inventory ya' got there. Be a shame if something happened to it."
---
Lucky Ive tried for months to get one. Sigh what a pain in the ass.
---
Thanks for sharing.
---
Is it? There’s a major hack going around and instead of doing anything like you know, shutting down the servers, they leave it up and post two small warnings to beware of the hack?
---
basically  your flatmate left the door unlocked and house robbed of every item that wasn't bolted down... for the 15th time.. you- it's ok bro, you said you'll replace it all and lock the door  NEXT TIME. LOL
---
These situations happen when the server doesn't have any control over the common actions performed by the client and doesn't even raise any red flags over it. Thus why you probably can't fix it this quickly...it would have to be an architectural rework of the system, to implement at least SOME checks over what the client does
---
Relative to the entire player base, yes that's considered small.
---
This doesn't mean the severity is downplayed either.
---
Have fun being able to play the game. PC players have to buy first or gtfo
---
People only think this community is good still because some guy that is level 200 wanted to dump his extra junk onto a new player to free up his stash.
---
Oh no they have vaild points but i am saying it's a catch 22 for Bethesda if they secured it against mods rumors would have surfaced saying they lied about mod support
---
“ALIENS MY GUY”
---
I’m sorry but I think it’s hilarious
---
No they are on Vacation Dumbass. It's why this hack was released at this time, Bethesda can't do Jack Shit until January 2nd, and when they return to the game will be dead on PC, I love this game as much as I love so many others but, This Is EXTINCTION.
---
I deleted my entire friends list back when they could freely join my private world. Sort of glad now, because none of them can even tell if I'm online now if any of them are using this exploit.
---
Not terrible, not great ;)
---
"which may have resulted in a few players losing items that their characters had equipped" a few players hey? nice way to down play one of the biggest hacks in history by pretending it's only a "few" and a "small number" burn you bastards, BURN!
---
so this video is faked too?

at this point you would be best to just admit you were being overly cautious but stop defending your position like there isnt loads of proof to the contrary.
---
Private servers should of been free anyway. The other stuff like junk storage and other parts of the member ship should of been the subscription
---
I hope that you're not only able to take care of the problems that have affected over 500+ people to my knowledge, but to severely punish those (upto and including hardware bans) for who have been using said inventory exploit to do nothing but to be malicious towards others who have spent hundreds of hours in Appalachia. 
---
To rid these individual of these truly malicious individuals from Appalachia would be the greatest Christmas present of all.
---
Same. I only haven’t uninstalled in the hopes that Wastelanders saves this game, but as the days advance, that’s looking like more of a pipe dream
---
This is not true, I’ve been playing eso since launched and I’ve never seen anything like what’s going on in 76 where people were literally stealing other players items.
---
Why talk to anyone on the internet at all, then?
---
Meh
---
In the grad scale a 500 out of the thousands of players is a few
---
I thoroughly enjoyed playing Fo76 for a bit but I haven't played it in a while and from all that I've heard the game is just getting progressively worse, I don't see why people have any trust in Bethesda
---
this kind of bug affects the entire player base through terror, no one feels safe to play, and it’s christmas, not a good time for that
---
Good point. They deserve to have a vacation after all the work they've done. Anyone that says otherwise should have to work their ass off all year, then be denied all time with their family.
---
https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/
---
Please, don't pay for it! Stop playing until they've fixed the whole freakin thing and unveil a working anti-cheat mechanism or (at least) until they proofed that they care just enough about their players to get rid of that cheaters just in time.
---
I'm player from the beginning and always tried to be sympathetic for beths decisions about the game... and defend them. But at this point it seems to me, that I was totally wrong all the time... and that brings me down to a point a can't stand no more.
---
You guys who told us from the beginning this game is shit... you where right... and the only point that won't  make regret playing this bullshit is that I've met kindly people there (friends, meanwhile)... It's sad that we're now forced to play somwhere else.
---
The video game you are describing does not sound fun. I think you have been taken in by a cult.
---
🤞
---
All you guys getting multiple and I can’t even find one.
---
ESO absolutely does run on Hero. It's even credited.
---
You're wrong. Admit it and move on.
---
I'm up to 9 now in the event.  So if you're on PC once everyone feels it's safe to play again look me up.  I'm not extorting anyone.  :)
---
Was level 41, and actually gained a level while in the queen fight, was shooting with a level 40 hardened sniper rifle  using .308 ammo and a level 35 lever gun. I’ve used this as a level grind before on ps4 and never had an issue,  but that was at least 6 months ago and maybe things have changed.
---
Yet...
---
Darn xbox here lol.
---
Or not play or put everything in yours stash or be invited to someone else's private instance.
---
Sorry I just saw this! My user name is JessicaRabbit9. Merry Christmas!
---
Maybe not on the same level but people were definitely hacking, any game has a vulnerability, I linked to a blog post where a hacker addressed how and why he cheated in PvP, because hacking was already rampant and he decided to take advantage of it
---
unauthorized access
---
Yeah no not hacking... he's a lvl 17, he's just got a god tier weapon and can't be targeted in vats... you people are BLIND lol.   
---
Ok guys, lets pretend he's doing nothing here, but he's being accused by me... he's now also in another video... where someone lost their ENTIRE inventory, and he's lvl 270+... in less than 2 weeks... UM WHAT!?   
---
WAKE UP!
---
I , personally, would rather lose all the stuff I found yesterday, even the kind of good legendary I found, to make this right by the ones who got jacked.  They knew this was coming and it is sad that they waited till it blew up to fix it. A complete roll-back of the server would be the least they can do.
---
Oh you did? A guy that still plays fallout 76 will believe just about  anything in order to defend the game? Color me shocked
---
They’ll patch it eventually but there is no use it moaning about it. I can almost guarantee you won’t get your stuff back.
---
You can pay $13 and be safe.
---
They’re all on vacation I think
---
F'ing spare me dude. The guy is now in two different videos, from two different people doing dirty shit...
---
Bethesda is trash, banning players for picking up bags, but wont do shit about this... triple A dev my ass
---
Thank you for the update. Communication is *always* the way forward.
---
How is 500+ "small"? Bethesda, indenial as usual.
---
It sounds like you are trying to justify the actions of scumbag Bethesda. There is no reason for this.
---
If Bethesda listened after other hacks the hackers wouldn't need to punish the cult members
---
1.Everyone can have access to it as it is public 2. NO
---
Im sad for the people but i cant say im sad that they fucked it up AGAIN. Now i think even the most dedicate fan sees them for who they are and either they finally suit up and get their asses out of the fire or they just wither and die.
---
Either way, Bethesda is dead to me and that breaks my heard as someone with nearly 10k h playtime just between skyrim, fallout 3 and new vegas...
---
100% true.
---
Hallelujah!
---
Big shrug, I'm just sharing my view on things in the lens of what you too shared. Objectively dead in the sense that everyone is a corpse, every story ends with 'and then they died', and that a handful of players spread across the map means a generally introspective experience - which factually speaking is generally not what people go to online games for. I'm also not really being negative, I noted I developed an appreciation for the tone in my post, and Wastelanders may well help with a lot of the 'issues' someone might have with it.
---
There is such a thing as being discerning. A stance somewhere between whole hearted and arguably blind fandom and being a hater.
---
No feeling of "betrayed" can justify being asshole to the company and especially other players... Also, the Fallout community has been apparently feeling "betrayed" ever since Bethesda bought Fallout. So I wouldn't believe them playing the "betrayed" drama card. In general people simply love being assholes without consequences. Negativity allows them to channel their inner asshole and 76 is currently a big magnet for drama...
---
Or in excess of authorization.
---
It's both
---
Gold all of the gold
---
Big eye roll from over here cap'n.
---
I was saying this specific video on this post was faked, sorry to ruffle your jimmies so hard. 
---
I see what you mean I could have been clearer, but I wasn't. Oops.
---
So, no it would not be best if I admit anything? 
---
This whole strong-arm technique of trying to get someone to cede in absolutes doesn't seem to be working for you.
---
There's a difference between a warning with basic advice about the problem, and telling everyone they need to quit the game now or they'll be screwed over.
---
Even with reports now surfacing and the new video showing numerous people hacked, the chance is still incredibly low that any one person will be hacked. It's good to be cautious mind you-- I specifically encouraged that in my own post-- but there's a difference between caution and exaggerating your response out of fear. 
---
For example, we take risks every day and we assess those risks based on probability. If you have a 0.001% chance of slipping on ice when you walk outside in winter, you're obviously not going to avoid going outside. That's what I meant when I contrasted irrational fear of possibility with rational assessment of probability. You can't let the 'oh no this could happen' response overwhelm a reasonable look at how likely the thing is and how much damage it could really do to you.
---
Some people were being pragmatic, but plenty of posters were exaggerating the threat and suggesting an exaggerated response.
---
If you're still supporting Bethesda at this point...whatever you get from them, it's what you deserve.
---
Year* this isn’t the only problem. Incase you forgot the hack two weeks ago that ruined the games already garbage economy.
---
Is there any real danger of this hack spreading to console?
---
If you knew 76 like I know 76 you'd know he knew he was courting/grooming another guy...lol
---
It’s as if they WANT you to buy the FO1st
---
For educational purposes...that being, the educating of people who do play Fallout 76.
---
What about those with fallout 1st already?
---
Bro... he's in the video killing us both, we're both geared up, and high level... how does he have that gun? Looks a lot like the ones people have been reporting lately eh? Ok so now he's in not ONE but TWO different videos, from two different people complaining... wtf else do you need?   
---
FURTHERMORE. I reported him, she reported him... others have likely reported him and i tried to submit this very video as evidence and BIG SURPRISE... it didn't work... on 3 different browsers... get a grip.
---
Indeed
---
You seem very hostile, im not saying people dont do sketchy things, I am saying that part of your comment is just wrong. Another user called you out on it too... nobody hacks for levels, he simply logged onto another character with more levels. Dont get bent when you post somthing to an online forum and someone replies.
---
[No.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/232/114/e39.png)
---
Did you get the game on PC because you prefer the controls or don't have a console then?
---
It actually defaults to team only. So unless you changed it you're already in that mode.
---
Damn that is brutal.
---
They just need to roll the servers back then do their “hot fix”.
---
They have just now, 5 hours after you posted this.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eepvot/an_update_on_the_current_pc_exploit
---
Apparently people can steal your entire inventory
---
Spot in truth
---
So news shouldn't be posted about anything unless you doing it. Dumbest shit I've ever heard to bad you're probably not gonna have your stuff stolen.
---
You cant comment on football cause you're not s player.
---
They just announced a hotfix.
---
Hopefully they fix this mess and get items back to players without a roll-back.
---
Maybe that's their secret plan xD
---
I think it defaults to this, but when you hit Play on the title screen, and you see the options for Adventure, Private World, and Nuclear Winter, there's a toggle on the bottom of the screen for Private Worlds.  Same place where Fill Teams is for Nuclear Winter. I think it's bound to the V key by default.
---
They announced a hotfix.
---
This exploit has nothing to do with patches or updates but the internal coding. A rollback would do literally nothing
---
It’s literally pay for your safety
---
The hack didn't affect only those who lost their equipment, everyone else is playing on private servers if playing at all due to this hack. 
---
In my opinion, all pc players have been negatively affected.
---
And that statement from Bethesda, sounds like trying to minimize the fact so their actions sound bigger.
---
" While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been  negatively affected" 
---
Typical Bethesda..
---
Compared to the overall player base 500 is very likely a small number.
---
This. This should get tatooed on the forehead of every moron who insists the game is simply bad and deserves this. We live in the age of clickbait and people getting more and more estranged from each other. 76 became the lightning rod of a mass schadenfreude of this era. If Anthem released before 76,it would be that game that became this beacon for assholes...
---
Then.theyll throw the word "Starfield" into the discussion and fan boys will swoon because they haven't figured out yet that that is what Starfield really is: a distraction.
---
" we are currently looking into ways we may be able to **compensate** you " ... Oh that's gonna be interesting.... &gt;&lt;
---
You think so!? This guy has been RUINING peoples time for at least 2 f'ing weeks fella. yeah i'm not happy. Are you serious!? I reported him, TWO OF US DID, and i tried to submit video... i can't even deal with this community right now dude, i used to love this community... you've turned sour, you're defending this shit bro?
---
&gt;  removed unattainable items
---
Uhhh... no they didn't. Where did you get that impression?
---
In the Nederlands 1 website for  gaming  reviews  made an article on it. https://www.gamekings.tv/nieuws/nieuwe-hack-raakt-fallout-76-publieke-servers/
---
I just wish I hadn't been one of those ***FEW Players***! I lost over 30+ weapons and armor that took MONTHS to acquire. Not to mention the 2000+ hours I have invested into this game. I raged quit last night and even had a cigarette after being quit for almost 2 yrs. Submitted a ticket and hoping they can restore my items.
---
dude doesnt have a soul
---
Few players hahahah xdd
---
Sorry that you guys who play on PC got hacked. 
---
But really im not. 
---
This is the reason I stopped playing multiplayer PC games years ago. 
---
You cannot stop  hacking from happening on a PC based game platform.  Anyone with any programming know how and competency with Unix can bypass security protocols of an online host/client based game platform to take illicit action against honest players. \\
---
For years  you PC Master race asshats have been spewing your nonsense that you are better than console plebs.   Well, it sucks to suck doesnt it.
---
Yea less than a minute...
---
False equivalency.  Proper equivalent argument would be “you can’t comment on football because you don’t watch it,” which would seem pretty sensible to me.
---
By not actually addressing the problem?
---
Let me guess, Bethesda employee? You're just spreading misinformation....
---
It's thought that they're running private worlds on less cores (IIRC someone suspected they run on 2 cores vs 8 cores or something like that), so it's less than multiplying by 24.
---
They might be doing some type of server reset or fix to roll out whatever will hopefully stop the current hack going around.
---
Bethesda can't ban him for being a dick, but I hope they will ban him for the stealing hack (hardware ban please!)
---
i mean, im not the one denying the evidence to the point of being entirely drowned out by everyone else in the world being on the other side of the opinion.  so you do you.  if youre on PC, go play away and good luck to you.  if you arent on PC, then what do you care?  to me it seems like FAR more effort for someone to fake that video than to actually do it, given that the poster has proven time and again that they are certainly willing to hack and steal to the point of notoriety.  but hey man, it must be faked because theres music overlaid on the video.  makes total sense.  im sure in the end youll be vindicated and your absolute knowledge will be proven. 
---
plus, you definitely did deny the hack was real with this comment: "This whole video looks beyond fake and staged.
---
For a frame of reference, the chrome excavator armor can't be traded or dropped. Atom shop items can not transfer hands."
---
they definitely can steal atom shop items, so your initial position that this must be faked because they cant change hands, is clearly inaccurate and false.  all of your further conclusions are also likely incorrect.
---
I guess I get a second chance, someone just launched another nuke on FSP
---
I know bodega, he's actually a chill and cool dude
---
i was kinda thinking it would be fun to rp a little and pick some santatrons and steal some presents but the way things are it wouldnt just be a little fun if someone just had all their stuff stolen :(
---
Thanks for the long overdue update.  
---
a server rollback is, imo, appropriate.
---
I remember when the game first came out, Bethesda issued bans on several players for hurling incredibly racist slurs and harassing players for the sole intent of causing harm. I feel this situation stands on the same level as before, and I see no reason why a ban shouldn't be considered.
---
I was saying the same thing and these Bethesda hostages with Stockholm syndrome say I’m crazy. Someone reported they got banned for reporting the name of a cheater. What does that tell you? 
---
The cheater works there. Or maybe was fired and is doing this as a disgruntled employee. All the literal children on here don’t know how they real world works.
---
I work in tech and I have 2 weeks off. Not everyone lives in america.

Looks like Bethesda is allowing underage children to play this videogame. It's a pity people don't hold Todd Howard to account in situations like this.
---
Hahaha. Rekt.
---
VATS doesn’t work on players if they have a legendary cloaking, stealth boy, etc. and in the video he did. Seems like its just part of the game.
---
As for the lvl 17 to 270, maybe he has 2 different characters 🤷‍♂️
---
Okay, let's see how my dutch is. Probably bad, cause I never learned it. But, with german and english, maybe I can read a bit.
---
If not, I guess DeepL will do :)
---
But nice to know that some outlets are picking this up, as it really is a clusterfuck and Bethesda needs to get some flak for it.
---
\&gt; A few players lost items  
---
Youtube Video about 500+ players losing items  
---
Few is like under 50 players in this case, at least be honest and tell the truth.
---
For the most part, yes. But this is also on Bethesda, for taking the cheapest, laziest methods of prevention. Also their lax enforcement of previous hacking, combined with banning people for demonstrating exploits, makes Bethesda culpable.
---
To each their own.
---
It's not about the state... If this was on release then OK. But the hackers have apparently spend a lot of time creating this hack. No security is 100% and with enough effort everything can be broken. Well, the hackers have simply put in tons of effort...
---
When something else better comes out. I play out of sheer boredom.
---
H-h-how the actual FUCK do you think this was staged? The hack is as official as my My love for this game. YOU ARE THE WORST PLAGUE ON THIS SUBREDDIT.  ENJOY YOUR NEGATIVE KARMA!
---
$60
---
The reason I ask is, there's some kind of damage minimum that you must contribute to get on the Queen's loot table.  My first thought is you must have been under it.  Given what you've said above I think it's borderline?  I guess seeing as you didn't get loot, you just didn't do enough damage.  But I'd have thought it was at least close..
---
Exactly my feelings on the situation
---
Depends: Bloodied is higher damage with more health management (rads), Junkies offers slightly less damage with less health management. In PvP it seems Junkies is the answer, in PvE it’s personal preference.
---
I dunno, proving to a stranger that a shady gaming studio is innocent doesn’t seem fun
---
"only a few players were negatively affected"  
---
Try 540+ players :(
---
The community is solid?
---
It's just turned into people plugging their ears and screaming at people with genuine criticism of this pathetic excuse of a AAA release.
---
Yeah me too, even if it means I lose the civil war dress plan I found on the corpse.
---
You say 37k and I see 26k... 11k people stopped playing altogether in the span of 25 minutes?
---
I don't know, looks like that playercount is total BS.
---
&gt;they aren't selling anti-cheat via fallout 1st.
---
I mean they kind of indirectly are. You won't have to deal with cheaters on your private server unless you personally allow them in, so having a private server will make you safe from the cheat. I'm sure this wasn't their intention, but it's kinda true
---
They can. Perhaps by "equipped" they mean "located on a player".
---
Haven't seen any other articles about  it. Maybe tomorrow. Also I didn't dare to start the game since yesterday. When I logged off I had all my stuff so . 😜
---
Great idea on how to deal with this in the short term.  I agree.
---
Well maybe their working on it during the time they thought they were going to be spending time with family. And are pissed. And focusing on getting this fixed, so they can. Wait until Tuesday, to see if it's in update.
---
This guy gets it.  Well said,  have an updoot.
---
The core game mechanics that were copied from a different game?
---
Exactly this... But armchair developers want to have their day, so they downvote away...
---
Im not defending anything... im enlightening you on how alts work. I have a lvl 10 junk mule, and a lvl 300 main, are you going to call me a hacker jusy bc I logged from one to the other and look like i gained 290 lvls instantly? Take a breath man. Just bc someone hacks one way shouldnt make you think everything is hacking... thats why Bethesda takes 2 months on hacking tickets, they get 2000 a day from simple lvling or random pvp tickets.
---
Light wood laminate
---
How is it clear? Because it’s added code and not a bug? Who’s to say they didn’t add the code?
---
Now you've gone and given them the idea.
---
Oh wait, one can already hide in their private server to avoid this hack. Maybe it's Bethesda themselves doing it to drive up PC sales of FO1st?
---
THANK YOU. I just watched the video... now he's in not 1, not 2, but THREE videos where shady bs is going on... yeah guys... he's totally legit. Nothing to see here. I'm editing my post to include your link since some people are willfully blind around here.
---
If they are too lazy to investigate specific claims they will just go for the over compensation approach again. Bloodied FFR 25%LVC Fixers and Unyielding Powered Sentinel armor plus about 10 other god rolls for everyone regardless of what was lost.
---
The audacity to claim it's some small amount of players is ludicrous when a video shows hundreds getting wiped out by one guy.
---
Yeah, unfortunately if I collassly fucked up at my job, I would be called in to fix it over Christmas as well. That's the reality of being an adult with responsibilities....
---
Luckily, I didn't sign in last night or today. I heard the horror stories via YongYea, LegacyKiller, Juicehead and others about how over 500 (and growing) users were compromised. This is completely unacceptable and I would consider legal action against Bethesda, because this does technically constitute fraud by way of security exploits that have been well-documented since launch.
---
Fallout is one of my favorite game series ever, and I had to make myself uninstall this game. the incompetence from Bethesda for well over a year now is truly mind boggling 
---
luckily I play on console, so this hacking thing wouldn't effect me, but goddamn are they screwing over A LOT of people
---
Either they roll back your character or refund you. Neither of which Bethesda will say they can do.  
---
50 Atoms is all you can expect, if your lucky.
---
That player counter is a random number generator.
---
I have to ask the playerbase here. 
---
Why do you keep playing the game? What incentive do you have to continue?
---
Time after time Bethesda have added more and more ways to bleed you dry with an unpolished sometimes unplayable service and you ever expect it to get better? How many bugs, business practices and overall enjoyment does it take for you to simply stop playing.
---
We need to recognize this for what it is, a direct attack against the community to indirectly attack Fallout 76 and Bethesda itself.
---
I mean. Would it be too far fetched to believe that 11k people's game crashed? Right when you when looked?
---
I also question the wisdom of leaving the servers up until the fix is applied, but whatever.
---
That’s disgusting... Toxic gamers
---
If your intention was pure then I apologize as it did not come through in your post. It came through as a veiled insult to my intelligence over our differences in opinion. So there's that. It's difficult to be discerning in some cases - because people all too often are being subtle because it's easier to be passive aggressive rather than trying to draw delicate intellectual threads together into a coherent thought.
---
&gt;but then we'd have the risk of people screwing their (and other people's) accounts up away from the "security" (haha!) of Bethesda servers.
---
Yeah that would really suck if that was able to happen
---
yo mods took down my post lol wtf dude?
---
"Fred can we give them free private servers?"  
---
"Ooof... right in the pocket there steve... nah mate give  them 500 atoms and an "i'm sorry" email"
---
Federal employee here... I'm working today &amp; tomorrow lol
---
A full refund + a personalized apology letter from Todd Howard + Pete Hines.
---
Valve had fuckups in the early years, they actually gave a shit about their customer base and reacted accordingly. Bethesda doesn't seem to care.
---
Why do people keep claiming this 500 number?  He would have to roughly show 1 person per second being hacked in order for that many people to fit in that video...
---
You aren't enlightening JACK SHIT... here he is again. 
---
Ah I understand. Both weapons can take down the SBQ in 6 min or less.
---
Close fo76 then restart, it works for me on xbox
---
Thank you for a response, Bethesda. I understand you want to keep panick to a minimum by downplaying the destruction this causes but in the process you are trivializing those affected. 10,000 or a couple hundred...doesnt matter the number. Those are people behind those accounts and this is inexcusable.
---
This part of the fucking game bud?
---
People have been tagging the CMs on this topic since it broke.
---
I played today and always immediately logged off when I saw another player. That is some high level paranoia but yeah dont wanna loose my stuff.
---
If all you came here to do is post this, then why bother coming at all?
---
And depending on how deep in the engine the offending code is(I suspect it's very deep if a character, down at the basic level, is coded the same as a container of some sort), it might not even be repairable. The only fix might indeed be taking down the PC version, or granting the FO1st perks to all PC users.
---
Someone should sue him for harassment. That's the only thing these kinds of people understand, fucking with thier money.
---
And that was when Mr. Hoogles discovered the true meaning of Christmas... X)
---
Imagine downplaying an epidemic on their live servers as only a "handful" of players being affected.
---
Look at your boards, look at the subreddit.
---
Its not a minor problem.
---
You launched and have always been selling an unfinished product.
---
So you're saying you can only feel good about yourself by trying to debunk people on the interbutts?
---
These are all opinions, not facts. I'm applying my 2 cents and if they're wrong, they're wrong. 
---
I don't see the need for such hostility on such a topic, especially in the matter of thoughts and opinions.
---
If you need that kind of thing in your life, then I suppose the more power to you? Or something?
---
But what happened to the mantra of your last comment of "you do you" but then you assert yourself even further to try and make someone withdraw?
---
But I digress, I don't care about your opinion on my own. So. Shout into the void again or not, just know it's falling on deaf ears.
---
And you have anything to show as proof of this? Like some kind of picture proof? This is the first I have heard of this.
---
"few" lmaooooooooooooooooooooooo
---
If I were on PC and lost my inventory the only acceptable compensation for me would be:
---
1. What I lost given back
---
2. Additional compensation for the time lost/inconvenience payed in atoms or maybe something like a free month of 1st
---
Anything other than number 1 isn’t enough, even a refund for the game doesn’t pay back the thousands of hours of grinding people have lost
---
Because I’m still having fun.
---
If you’re not, why are you here.
---
What if you are just spreading a totally unbased conspiracy theory.
---
Lol, didn't we just have conversation on discord, xXdemolisher? Why do you keep defending those guys..? 
---
I actually did pvp with BodegaTheKid and some of his guys he called on few weeks ago; I definitely wouldn't call that infinite laser thingy of his legit. But whatever.
---
Ha. I will not confirm or deny how i feel about your analogy.
---
They’ll find some way to fix it I’m sure. Of course a real fix won’t be cheap, but their temp one will be
---
500 atomic shop points have been deposited into your account.
---
Ive lost hope long ago. I was going to come back for Wastelanders, although I'm not even sure about that at this point.
---
I'm unsure they can do a rollback as well, in the past for a few individuals involved in the vault raid issues had older saves of their characters added to their list. Not many got this treatment and if i remember correctly it was a month old save. They might have options, but likely still limited.
---
My gear wasn't stolen because I was too afraid to log in. But I wanted to spend some time today by farming event boxes, so I'd be happy if they could extend the Christmas event.
---
Honest interest. And while Im on Reddit anyway, its not a big chunk of work to switch the subreddit.
---
&gt;What's worse? The charlatan? Or the people who aren't smart enough to see through him?
---
There's also YouTube, the algorithm is insanely predisposed to this kind of "hate fluff" content. They could take a stronger position as it does tarnish their brand.
---
"The amateur troll".  So by speaking the truth, I'm a troll?  That's the sort of simplistic thinking I'd expect from a Bethesda fanboy.  If you're such an advocate of Fallout 76, why aren't you playing it right now?  Someone steal your inventory or are you here supporting the other 6 people still playing?
---
And your discord is a cesspool of racism and homophobia.
---
Oh I've seen the videos, doesnt make you right to call having an alt suspicious lol. But I suposed you cannot enlighten those with their head in the sand.
---
Whatever they are getting now, it's what Bethesda supporters deserve. They have had years of warning, and still they continue to reward mediocrity. 
---
Welcome to the decline. Enjoy the ride, Bethesda supporters. You deserve this.
---
Doesn't matter still the same thing saying ppl shouldn't report on something because they dont play/do thing is stupid he's a gaming news channel so he's gonna report on stupid stuff that happens in gaming.
---
?????
---
None of those quests require data mining. In other less lazy gaming communities people figure that shit out the hard way.
---
Ban hammer
---
I've played browser games better than 76...
---
How about you just let people enjoy things and stop harassing them for it?
---
Oh man, you actually play Starwars Battlefront? What a loser! Battlefield? How can you defend that game?!
---
You are not contributing anything and just starting shit to get a reaction.
---
That's what I thought the most recent hack effected. 
---
It seems to me to be quite disingenuous to publicly state that players are 
---
&gt;losing items that their characters had equipped
---
when the concept of "items" being "equipped" would be your the weapon currently in your character's hand and/or the armor/outfit currently on your character's body.
---
nothing short of total character item restoration should be accepted. I was not affected but if I was and they didn't do that I would quit.
---
Don't even try, it's deleted anyway, just like mine did today; I also got banned from beth forums for naming and shaming. But hey, at least the mods are vigilant, right..?
---
A lot of manufacturing plants are closed this week and a lot of people take this week off as PTO.
---
You fell harassed for someone asking you a question?
---
That part was totally dumb, they should have been permabanned instantly
---
...maybe it didn’t work bc he’s not actually hacking. At lv 15 you could potentially have a BE handmade and he’s 17 maybe your gear just sucks but either way there’s no proof of hacking in that video. Quit trying to start a witch hunt bc a lv 17 killed you
---
wow nice, thats my mule account with tons of stuff icant belive that a triple A gamedeveloper has no 2fa ingame name is account name, thats really a joke
---
If Bethesda keeps being incompetent, that will be half the playerbase in a month.
---
You don’t give up on things you love 🤷🏻‍♂️
---
He's showing how fast and easy it is for him to take the items, he doesn't need to show all 500+. The fact that he shows as many as he does and how quickly he does it, is the point. He also has other video where he shows exploits on weapons that never break, have unlimited ammo, and damage buffs to make them stronger than originally modded ones.
---
Well, for starters, Bethesda's reporting system is just terrible. Basically tells the player, "if you're still mad about it again within four days, report it again and we might do something... sometime."
---
I truelly laughed so loud at this.  TBH I have found guys get upset when a girl plays a male toon but does not bat an eye when reversed. ( it is not as bad as it used to be thou). I am only a lvl 70 and I go up to players all the time and give them stuff. Someone helped me out when I started so I pay it forward.
---
sound like a good way to end up in jail.
---
Because art and artist are separate.
---
"only dumb"
---
Because that comment was chocked full of intelligent and eloquence. Your diction and superfluous use of your advanced vocabulary is truly stunning.
---
I had FO76 on the back burner.  FO1 made me delete it altogether.  The months since have done nothing to show me I made the wrong choice :(
---
According to the cheater on youtube, they can steal items from your stash.
---
Brilliant
---
Maybe they are with their families and would like to be left alone. Not eveeything is about the office 24/7.
---
Add to that, in some industries like the one I'm in, we have more people working today than a regular day.
---
I think he'd post if the narrative was clearly a No Man's Sky comeback we could all feel good about but I do agree, videos that are all "Bethesda wtf are you doing" is FAR too lucrative to stop now.
---
God forbid youtubers that cover video games report on rampant issues within popular video games. This is like telling journalists not to cover politics because they weren't there or aren't directly involved in political proceedings
---
Oh yes, many things about this game are a joke. Hackers are stealing whole inventories from players now (including mine), and they only need to be in render distance from you to do so.
---
It just works!
---
If my jail time means the betterment of every other fallout player than I'm willing to sacrifice that
---
you don't see the bigger picture here, do you??
---
Other companies are seeing how people still enjoying fo76 and somehow believing bethesda is not guilty for any of this . Then they will copy bethesda to save $$. That is what the "sad little shits" are upset.
---
YOU GUYS ARE SETTING A NEW (LOW) STANDARD FOR VIDEO GAMES COMPANIES
---
Yes, but until now, i didnt hear anything like this.
---
Why are you even here?
---
So "compensate you" surely means that in addition to a roll back the affected parties are given something correct? If you do not off rollbacks there's no telling how much people could have lost in time for grinding out a certain legendary item or the trade items/ caps to aquire that from other players.
---
You arent just asking a question. You ask it to spark a reaction from people. Job well done, move along. Your choice of words tells me you dont actually care.
---
I mean, your loss for trusting Bethesda.
---
This is pc only
---
Nice! That looks like a fun build.
---
I mainly run in a 4 man squad, so they're engaging while I'm speeding full tilt into the middle, or getting the flank. I'm faster than most players, and with the extra damage, I've actually used it to run in, down/thirst one of their players, run away, and keep cycling for the team wipe. I love when players try to run, I can dog them into the ground.
---
I hate the pump action (fire rate is *tedious*), so double barrel or combat. With a small guns bobble added, I do 280 on the combat, and 300+ on the double.
---
I didn't like shotguns in the beginning, but they are a **lot** of fun. Bonus, with this build, I can swap put for melee anytime I'm feeling adventurous.
---
Well, they put out an incomplete product. Put flaws in the gameplay loop, charged the players for the fixes, and started a monthly subscription for something pretty much every game offers for free. They keep failing to fix the problem, refuse to set up test servers. They didn't implement any type of anti-cheat service into their game. So overall, I don't see why the players shouldn't hate Bethesda or it's devs, they are allowing this cycle to continue. I don't hate the playerbase but I do think they are doing very little by giving Bethesda a free pass when they do something like this.
---
It would be. But then again, this is Bugthesda so...
---
Yes because at first the cheat was to steal inventory items, they needed some kind of change to make it work for stash as well .
---
When they shut the servers down.
---
How so? 
---
Because if we're going to judge games based on their "greed", "money grabbing", and "appaling corporate practices"....
---
You better be playing indie games pretty much exclusively.
---
Fucking shocking... They acknowledge the problem and say they're working on fixing it and people get butthurt over the number of people they say are affected.
---
Holy fuck....
---
For instance?...
---
This video has inspired me to request a refund from Bethesda (knowing they won't do it).
---
May or may not have happened. We won’t say directly
---
Servers often go into forced shutdown after 8 hours or so.
---
No free private servers (like other games), a no mod support. This game is dying very quickly. I hopped on for the first time in forever (3+ months) to get the free Santatron (because the original is too expensive for my taste), and hopped off. The drama keeps me interested, the gameplay loop doesn't. Fallout 76, the best I game I don't play.
---
I'm confused....he's a good guy who just happens to practice shitty behaviour
---
Ban hammer, hmm cant say I remember that one, which game is that from or per chance is it a comment on the recent hack plaguing 76?
---
I think it was after just 4 hours
---
Same. Even without the hack I recognized the apathy from Bethesda.
---
Maybe they'll give them canvas bags!
---
Thats not a real site man..a bullshit number generator..refresh a few times and watch the number fluctuate by 10s of thousands in the space of a few clicks.
---
What happened? How did it happen? What level was your guy? Are they targeting high levels or what? Are they talking and being shits on the mic? Is it one dude or two or a group?
---
and if you accept this free "gift" then you legally waver all rights to further purse your claim.
---
I got the game on PC because i play all my games on PC, i actually use an xbox controller because bethesda hate lefties and dont let us map the keys to how we want
---
Yeah, before starting the game they can choose to target inventories or stashes. But not both, unless two different guys did it.
---
very low effort trollerino
---
I'm sure some people would love to talk to him face to face
---
Ah shit man, no game is worth the health of your lungs. As a fellow former smoker don't go back to that shit over this. I totally get it, but you are stronger than that if you can go two years without, pull up before it's too late friend!
---
They will if they lose loads of money when they make one, theyll decide its a dead franchise not worth persuing and just release elder scrolls and starfield
---
Why aren't you interested in Borderlands 3? Or Destiny 2? Destiny 2 is free to play. You get access to the base game and the first 2 expansions for free. It's a massive amount of content and you can get more expansions if you enjoy the game. Imo both of these games are objectively superior to FO76 because they don't have game breaking glitches that allow hackers to steal your stuff. It's confusing to hear someone say "when something better comes out" because from my perspective there's plenty of options that don't give you so much trouble. I'm genuinely curious.
---
I gotcha, haven’t had that kind of experience on FO76; I play on console. But... there will always be dirtbags who try to break the code and break the game. I can’t count the number of people who just don’t want to play he game as intended; they play to find the glitches, exploits and cheats.
---
My topic got deleted because " KEK THAT IS PHOTOSHOP HAHA"
---
Stay salty, fanboy.
---
Bethesda your PR game is weak AF, get it together
---
Your forgetting the rest of the world. Not justamercans play the game
---
... I think you're a little delusional as to how many people are actually still playing
---
Yeah because Bethesda is raising the kids and allowing them to play their game.
---
Why would i want to trade my end game gear away
---
That's your takeaway from that? LOL
---
Its probably easy enough for someone to spoof their way onto your "private" server.
---
Bloodied is only very useful in very specific scenarios (like killing the Queen in a few seconds).
---
But it requires you to take certain perks and build around it. Junkie doesnt, you can literally use it with every build and you can turn it off by just eating some addictol and the overall drawbacks are minimal (and can be countered with herd mentality).
---
It depends on what you define as "better". In 9/10 situations i would say that Junkies is better. There is a list of things Bloodied cannot do/suck at, even simple things like "run around in a nuke zone". But Junkies can do everything.
---
Maintenance has begun for PC, so there's a small step in the right direction!
---
The notificarion says there is a maintance coming. maybe a hotfix?
---
Yes, they brought the servers down as a result of the recently released hack.
---
They shut down the PC version to hot fix the current hack issue.
---
I like how the cheater is allowed to post and comment on the thread that showed his youtube video of him stealing stuff.
---
I feel you, bro. I played the beta, had tons of fun. Went trough a shitload of crap in this game, and i always kept believing. Fo1st drew the line for me. That was the last slap in my face from Bethesda. Instead of fixing their damn shit, they keep coming up with new ways to squeeze money out of us. And now, with people being able to literally strip you naked on sight, without immediate respons from Bethesda, I'm sure this is a sinking ship.
---
Anyone else think that crying kid sounded fake?
---
darkwood laminate
---
Bethesda, this should have not been able to happen 
---
DONT USE A SINGLEPLAYER ENGINE FOR A MULTI PLAYER GAME
---
&gt;o
---
No Bethesda just sits at the end of the slot machine collecting all the coins from microtransactions until they face any sort of backlash.
---
It's not like video games are nowadays deliberately designed to entrap younger audiences or anything.
---
It's not like huge corporations like Zenimax/Bethesda spend millions of dollars on advertising campaigns on promotional material for a video game that originally involved the possibility of killing children or anything. This is totally age appropriate material for mainstream media! Glad my Zenimax shares are fruiting up!
---
Yes they really need to enact HWID bans on all cheaters/dupers.
---
I thought maybe it was just the server I was on because I’ve gotten the message before. Clearly that’s not the case because I can’t get back into the game.
---
Hope you can play again soon
---
They taught the youngster an important lesson... TRUST NOONE, especially not a person who plays shit games.
---
https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377441/an-update-on-the-current-pc-exploit/14?language%5B%5D=pl
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaSupport/status/1209219483295985666
---
But I do? Im curious why and how people don't feel betrayed by Bethesda and keep supporting their game at this point.
---
As I understand it, Legendaries typically stop spawning after 4, and new players stop getting accepted unless they joined the server through someone else.
---
That's the thing. 
---
For many people like myself, they've had good experiences. Some people have had god awful experiences. 
---
The issue is that, I can fully understand people's frustrations with the game. Especially on PC. But those people display the exact opposite of blind fanboyism.... So the entire game is shit. Which is somehow a more valid opinion?
---
This thread is a perfect example of that. 76 is shit. Bethesda is trash. Because 1/3 of the platforms 76 is on has a hacking issue. While 2/3 of the platforms are hanging no such issues....
---
But again.... PC has a hacking issue, so the whole thing is shit.
---
The swing goes both ways. People with no issues have an 8/10 experience but those who had lots of issues (who are often the loudest) had a 3/10 experience ....
---
But the 3/10 experience is the only acceptable opinion?
---
Most likely prepping for it, yeah. Let's just hope it works and no one finds any work around for a long time. And hopefully after the break, Bethesda can get a little more serious about security on this game to avoid this in the future.
---
if only there was a site that told about upcoming maintenances and online status
---
https://bethesda.net/community/category/232/fallout-76?language%5B%5D=en
---
You  make a reasonable comment on the situation and get downvotes &gt;&lt; sadly typical.
---
is it down down? or can you connect still?  i havent seen that message in a long ass time but last time i saw it, it was the invidual server shutting down and you could get on a fresh one
---
if its a fix though, nice! i feel for you pc brethren
---
No thats only if u pay for stuff
---
a ride on the prydwen
---
Servers are down for maintenance
---
I think they allowed it so as to forced more people to buy first membership
---
14000 across all platforms.  If one guy hit 540 players, that's a huge part of the player base being affected. He affected more that 1/70th of the players By Himself, in one night.
---
By on the ball do you mean 250DRWR that took 16 patches and 1 year after launch to “fix” a day 1 bug that only made the game worse? On the ball isn’t what I’d call it. Also feel free to hope high, but be prepared for the worst. Hackers will find another way around unless Bethesda solves the existing code issue and implements decent anti-cheat finally. Also it’s been around for several days now. It gained traction when a post made a lot more info readily available, specifically where to get the tools to do it
---
Uh, you realize tiny 1 man team indie devs put out drastically better polished and supported games right? Like two of the highest rated games on Steam are Rimworld and Factorio and both are ran by extremely small indie teams that have polished and perfected their games to the point where bugs are basically non existent. 
---
Bethesda games are "larger" but are the definition of wide as ocean and deep as a puddle. With their money, they could absolutely crack down and improve the games far, far more than they do.
---
love has to be earned
---
it has been an abusive relationship so far
---
since launch i tried to defend Bethesda or at least tried to explain to ppl why things are like they are
---
but since Fallout 1st...i cant do it anymore
---
There's more chances that a meteor comes falling down to earth than this happening
---
I wish I could be mad at your defeatist attitude, and terrible solution, but I kind of get it.I’ve felt the same way about BF5 for a time.
---
But if you truly like a game/series, then don’t let hackers make you quite. They will always be prevalent and they always have. 
---
My advice, take some time from it and then come back.
---
At this point it's pretty obvious that Bethesda doesn't give a shit about the players and I'm hoping somebody starts finding and beating the shit out of employees irl.
---
Mister Vault Boy Puppet from Vault 77, works like a Power Fist, with new animations and maniacal giggling as he slays your foes.
---
I kind of understand this. I like the premise of the game, an online Fallout in the usual engine, myself. But personally I can't jump over my shadow to play it since 1st. Im honestly wondering, even as a fan who likes the game itself, don't you feel somewhat betrayed by Bethesda?
---
Another useless blamthesda post,
---
Probably the parents should be not buying the game for kids and keeping an eye on what they are playing.  Somehow I doubt it is Todd's job to do those things.
---
You just go from controversy to controversy.
---
So incompetent.
---
It's full on PC only.
---
😘 Less hope. Beth is an amateur sloppy shit show, don't ya know. Hax get fixed when interfering with microtransactions, no rush on exploited strength fixes. 😂 A hot fix for an exploit by Bethesda! 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
---
PC servers are down for maintenance right now.
---
They just posted on their twitter.
---
I started playing this game 2 months ago, I don't feel like leaving yet, I still have a lot of stuff to do and can't wait for Wastelanders.
---
This game has many problems and I'm facing them everyday (mostly bugs) but it didn't make me want to uninstall the game (yet).
---
Gta only had the one currency and u could slowly earn that
---
That just be the case, just did another queen run and wasn’t able to loot her again, but I do however get the rewards for completing scorched earth so it’s not total loss
---
Can someone explain what's going on? Making me afraid to log in.
---
I'm going to have to agree on this, a lot of people on this sub jumped to conclusions saying nothing would be fixed due to Christmas break. Yes, it would have been nice to hear something from them saying they are working on it but in the end this looks like the fix, hopefully this is the nail in the coffin for that type of hack.
---
This is going to be an unpopular statement but people just need to be patient, it takes time to implement the fix and then test to see if the fix actually worked. 
---
Either way, I'm happy the servers are down and I wish the best of luck to those that lost their things.
---
I’d like to see ammo variants like freezing , burning , poison , electrified , tracer ,or radiation
---
I'm on a Private World
---
Even if it was 5% or 10% of the pc player base, that is still a small number of players. Granted the fact that this happened to even one player is unacceptable. The fact still remains 500 is a small number of players in the grand scheme of things.
---
They are going to brake a game function with the hotfix, I'm calling it.
---
If artist and parent company decisions mattered you'd never be able to enjoy any music or movies
---
I'm a natural skeptic - obviously the hack is real.  :)  However I do suspect that a lot of reports on the internet of people getting their stuff stolen are not real either due to attention/karma seeking or just to badmouth the game.  So I really didn't express myself very well at all - obviously.
---
At any rate Beth is on it and is now in the process of doing a PC fox so Hurray!  Merry Fallout X-Mas !
---
Ok seeing as this hack only went live yesterday what was around before that was minor and rare. like only effected less then 10 people rare.   
---
As for the anti cheat, yeah the game does need it. I swear at the least they can get something like easy anti cheat. It ain't the best but it is something.
---
Love this! Great job exemplifying how great this community can be.
---
I think you misread. Cold day in hell just means it has gotten worse.
---
wow!!! neat!!
---
Ill have to check there!
---
great find!
---
let me know if you ever want to sell it!
---
I fear that this is going to escalate. I am anticipating new scripts being released throughout the holidays. It seems the inventory hack was an escalation after the spawn hack was fixed. I fear what they will do next.
---
Bloodied can also be turned off/on  really easy and does not have to play at 19% to be very effective.
---
now the question will be how effective this fix will be,. and how long until the next hack.
---
In a cave, with a box of scraps!
---
I mean... PC is an objectively better platform for video games in terms of performance, accessibility, and options. 
---
Experience my differ during online play. 
---
You're right though, put the blame on the player, not Bethesda or the hackers.
---
Not my intent at all, sorry if it seemed that way, I have over 400 hours in game and several 100+ characters. I certainly don't hate the game or have a bone to pick with other players. I just mourn what the game could have been as a single player title of the same scope with Wastelanders already integrated and designed to activate post-Scorched Earth. It would have been amazing.
---
Did you server hop to get him home?
---
The 3/10 experience is the only acceptable opinion, when talking about the game across all platforms, because most issues with this game present themselves across all platforms. Yes the hacking issue is only on PC and shouldn't be held against the console versions. But it should still be held against Bethesda just like any other issues. And the console versions have enough issues without the hacking to warrant the 3/10 anyway.
---
Lol, maybe he knew you were a Male using female character... Jokes aside, once a player has completed the main quest line there really isn't that much to do other than dailies and a lot of people just quit playing. But others, myself being lvl 193 included, take it upon themselves to help lower levels get a good start. I enjoy putting together a "welcome to the wasteland " kit and finding someone fresh out of the vault and making their day. Modded low lvl legendaries, ammo, food ,drink, medicine,armor and a shielded under armor really seems to surprise them when you I want nothing for it. I assure you that it probably made him just as happy to help someone as it made you to receive it. Just one of those "pay it forward" things.
---
He looks OK to me
---
I don’t know why you’re getting downvoted. If you lost a years worth of progress they might as well fucking refund it
---
Fearmongering post. Great profile.  You're spare parts, aren't ya bud?
---
Thanks Beth. That's a December 23 fix, kudos for that.
---
a stat tracker would be nice.
---
The game market will sort it out eventually.  Not really a concern for me as I have alternatives if it goes belly up.
---
No... but there's new plushy dolls to buy! That's what brought us all to Fallout in the first place, right? 🤮
---
Lol Brother Thomas is at it again 😂
---
They posted it here directly.

---
By a “few players” do you mean a ton of people?
---
What does this mean?
---
thank you
---
It is on the parents letting them play the game.
---
I've been busy playing heavily modded Fallout 4 instead. FO1st, Stash limitations (lies), now people with mods griefing players? Seriously? Give us mod support in true private servers and bug off. I want to play GRIM Alpha with friends and I can't. Least you can do Beth is make it to where I can mod in the comfort of my own server (for free) and have a *proper* Singleplayer experience like I wanted from Day 1. Fallout 1st is theft. Change my mind.
---
That's what it says, but in the video there are a couple of people he robs several times. Not sure their number is 100% accurate.
---
Lol everyone defending the game engine. I love people trying to fabricate points in favour for this absolute Frankenstein of a game engine.
---
Even when Oblivion came out the engine just felt off.
---
I don't know any other games currently that allow players to steal your items and the support crew not having the tools to recover lost items because the engine is such a pile of crap.
---
I love Fallout but not going to defend this engine for a second.
---
That's some sicko shit.
---
&gt;small number of characters
---
yeah, like that **one** guy who stole from over **500** people.
---
Fuckton of downvotes cause a vast majority of redittors never made a single fucking "hello world".
---
Fuckers paid 8$ for a product and crying like they paid millions.
---
Is the whole PC community 12 yos on allowance?
---
All games are subject to constant exploits but there are pretty standard detection, moderation and good communication that is just completely _absent_ in this game. It boggles my mind why someone would hold Bethesda to a lower standard here.
---
thx :) I'll check tomorrow when I'm back on my PC
---
Every game company ever with an M rated game has had underage kids play. This is completely irrelevant to the hacking issue.
---
Exactly, the best thing to do would have been to shut the servers down and then work out the fix, test it until you are positive it is a solid fix. I'd rather them push out quality updates than updates that just band aid the issue until another one pops up.
---
I had a friend in high school who ended up murdering his wife and children, but I've hung out and talked to him and he is actually pretty school, just does shitty things like causing suffering for others sometimes. Cool guy, and definitely excuses his behavior.
---
500/1,000,000 is .05% so that’s an acceptable loss for them. Also I don’t expect them to do THAT much to help people effected. I have hopes for good things, but given their track record I expect next to nothing
---
Brother Thomas will rob your for all you're worth.
---
If by trick you mean getting Bethesda to shut down the servers for a day then you’d love to see what else I’ve got up my sleeve.
---
hows the stealing going bodega?
---
Yeah, they are really "on the ball" when it comes to fixing things!
---
Like, remember that time when they fixed the 250DR bug and broke everything else in the process and had to roll back the fix?
---
Outstanding job!
---
As it's only 'a small number of characters' and you're taking it 'very seriously', it should be very easy to do a manual restore for those small number of specific accounts, and any duplication that results from restoring items that had been sold/given away can be considered additional compensation, on top of the inevitable atoms and free 1st period.
---
He is a fkin psychopath, a genuine ahole, we met him 2 months ago, he stole our weapons. He is a scumbag, a real piece of sh!t.
---
"Not sure why this hasn't been posted here"  
---
Proceeds to link a post from this subreddit...
---
Wheres the misinformation? And y'all wonder why we make fun of y'all.
---
wow, whats the point of this post, there's 10 other posts like this in new, browse hot and new before posting redundant already!
---
Wow thank you sooooo much lulz
---
Or 500 atoms!
---
okay, so what are you going to do to make it right for us, and not leaving us into the dark? i know that u have lot to do and coding, but in that giving time, please talk lot more or post more so we know that you are alive, 
---
Many of us thinks that the company does not think when comes to online gaming world, as well think that you have no idea to run it.. issue is, that when you patch a game up please make sure its 100% good to go.. don;t give us something that is brokin or something that wont get fix for another weeks later.. 
---
when you break something you need to have a road-map to let us know that what is being worked on.. also allow us to post a ticket into the road-map... so you can in fact see it.. 
---
another thing, its a bad idea to do pvt servers for charge, even if we been with you long time, i feel that we should have our own servers due to in fact we are sticking by ur side.. hope you understand
---
it may be faster, this ad hoc fix probably wont address the larger vulnerability that allowed this in the first place.

---
An initial test fix has been released for PC and if you're missing items Support can address returning items missing.
---
The hackers goal is to target private servers as well so if this isn’t patched first won’t be a solution. Don’t know how long it will take for them to get that far though. 
---
Won’t be touching the game till this blows over might even make me stop playing for longer than that.
---
Why would you take the word of people going around ruining peoples games, causing chaos and actual theft of things people bought with real money? You believe thieves?
---
I know Bodega. Can confirm. Is a dick
---
hw ban is nothing, swapping RAM and thats it, you changed your hw.
---
Only down for PC for a hotfix
---
Well thats a good sign if they are patching it. Yet to be seen what they do about lost item recovery...
---
Ok there is a big difference between that bug and the current one. the difference being who it effects and what it does.   
---
A hey a player can destroy your progress bug is more important then a DR one that I swear half the players don't even know is a thing or care about.
---
Exactly. Whereas this is how it really looks like:  [Hard to watch...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk)
---
chrome laminate
---
All of the recent hacks are being taken down same day. Just like other games. And your "absent communication" was just released saying it will be hot fixed today. 
---
Not a lower standard. Same standard. And they execute the same.
---
Well, he even did PM me. Looks like he's having a blast.
---
The link is from PKOA. Not FO76.  But yes, I didn't see it after scrolling for a bit, so this is a re-post, my bad.
---
I mean... seeing as you need to add the code that they posted in order to perform the exploit... yes
---
BGS just pulled the servers.  Let's see what happens.
---
Murdering someone compared to taking items in a video game is a far stretch
---
Come on, the guy spends his time checking posts on a game he supposedly hates. He’s got a lot going on without you bursting his bubble that most people don’t care about the bad press the game gets.
---
Or follow Gearbox and others, and go after them legally. They posted on Youtube, so just start the tracking process, and if possible, use legal means to deter this from them and future dipshits.
---
K bye
---
I'm not an expert and this is just my 2 cents but I think what we need more than an anti cheat is to actually fix the reason why people are allowed to cheat. Get down to the root cause of the problem. Anti cheat will detect the cheats after they are already in use right? So, for example, I use aimbot and kill someone, anti cheat will detect that I used it then ban me but the fact of the matter is I used it. IDK, I'm just throwing ideas out there.
---
True and I agree with that as a problem. The thing is their larger vulnerability is not one that can easily be fixed.  
---
It is called their engine, and the fact they have been using the same one for what 10 years now. Makes it easy to hack as a lot of people know its ins and outs.
---
They can roll player inventories back to the state they were in before the hack, then update the game.
---
Servers down for maintenance. Let's see what they do....
---
Exactly my point. It was a simple fix, and they managed to fuck it up - and they are now leaving it as it is for months because they *still* haven't figured how to solve it.
---
And you think that they can fix a much more complicated thing like hacking? Something that comes *directly from their faulty engine*? Yeah. You get your hopes up, I'm out.
---
500 canvas bags
---
I'll take things said that aren't true for 800.
---
Shill.
---
What about the people that got a year of FO1? How would you feel if you paid for something then 3 months later the company was like “we are going to release this feature you paid for, for free to everyone”?
---
Yeah - there's also a video on youtube showing the earth is flat.
---
On the internet seeing is mosdef *not* believing
---
I keep mentioning that this community isn't as nice as the usual narrative we see.
---
There are some extreme assholes in it that thrive on screwing people over emotionally or otherwise.
---
Bethesda's own community managers encourage this kind of behavior by cheering on people who participate in toxic behavior.
---
I have seen them comment more positively in posts about people leaving shit on the bed of other players and camps meant to trap and kill other players than any other types of posts.
---
They need to knock this BS off and start cleaning up the trash in community before that is all they have left in it.
---
PC dont must have more than 25.000 user per day, and 10% must be account mules
---
More then that remember that this started on a Sunday night after people had started their vacations.  The dev's deserve a big shout out for tackling this as quickly as they did given the circumstances.
---
Bethesda finally getting sick of the shit talk by millions who've been robbed. That's all. Put the money where the mouth is. FO76 is over a year old, can you not see how fucking pathetic that truly should be depicting the developers? +365 days of an entire team clocking in, and creating new content, microtransactions, and not putting a cage on the unfinished, rushed, incomplete, broken in one way or another since day 1, product we've all been victimized at buying. I mean if you see a pile of glass shards labeled vase on a shelf, but still has the price tag of a fully intact vase.....why the fuck didn't you get a refund? 🤬 Said millions....that spend over $60. Just 1m of the multiple millions that pre-ordered paying $60 pays for a professional development team. Get the fuck out with over a year and still exploitable.... Heads up, have less faith in Beth. They're all amateurs.
---
Ask for money back?
---
Folks don't play the game at all. Have a little self respect because you definitely won't get it from Bethesda and just take a break until Wastelanders. And if that sucks like so much else has sucks, then just stay gone.
---
Its just PC. These types of hacks are impossible on consoles.
---
How about 500 atoms, that should be pretty good right Lol
---
Bethesda, y'all are fucking idiots. You can't even give an update without lying. "resulted in a *few* players losing items" whatever world 500+ is a few, it isn't this one. This FO76 team as a whole has made me actively hate this game and bethesda. Good job, you lost 10 years of brand loyalty in one year of complete ineptitude.
---
im speechless after i  saw this video [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xehnhq38EHk)  i really hope there is a server rollback
---
I think *you're* the one who's delusional in how many people are actually playing the game
---
&gt; One youtuber claimed
---
OMG - It MUST be true if a youtuber claimed that !!
---
I logged in last night and moved all my legendaries to my stash.  I'll be going old school for awhile pretend I got ambushed and all my stuff was taken.  Now I have to survive only on what I can find that day.
---
Self loathing and some good people I play with mostly lol. If it wasn't for the group I run with I would've quit over 1000 hours ago.
---
You seem to forget that he isn't just "taking items in a video game" he is stealing items from another player, and continues to do so for the pleasure he derives from their mental stress. That is different. He is a sadist. And just because he is your friend does not excuse his behavior. So don't dumb down the situation to "just taking items." I get that you are trying to stick up for your shitty friends, but it just makes you look like a moron.
---
Bethesda can fuck themselves trying to downplay it. The fact this can even be done is ridiculous.
---
500+ aint small
---
500 "We're Sorry."s
---
You’re putting a lot of faith in Bethesda paying for the resources to save states like that. Remember that when you say you lost something they swear up and down they can’t help you, but do after people make loud enough noise
---
I always drop a modded weapon, ammo, diluted stimpacks, and sometimes even some pocketed armor for lower levels. My hope is that they pay it forward in the future. 
---
I'm a guy who also plays a girl toon, but nobody's ever commented when they hear my baritone voice over the mic. LOL
---
As long as I'm still having fun, I'll still play the game.
---
Lol are you the same guy who kept spawning on top of my teammates in NW last night?
---
Inability to separate game from life.   Hmmmm.
---
Well restoring items a d rolling. Back characters are two seperate actions
---
&gt;  I raged quit last night and even had a cigarette after being quit for almost 2 yrs.
---
I got ass cancer from the exploit.
---
I meant taking items by stealing items. I never said it excuses his behavior lmao.
---
Sure but if you through the comments in this post, everybody is claiming the same 500+ number. 
---
In the end the number could be less than 100 or more than 10.000 but since we don't know, throwing numbers like that, doesn't make any sense.
---
Based on the video its at least 512 characters in the single video..
---
Umm, they took the servers down 10 mins ago.
---
That would be true if they were the ones calling the shots, but odds are they’re just peons muttering “I told you so” under their breath as they worry about their jobs.
---
I just managed to loot the icicle lights. Any idea on price?
---
This guy thinks that one user affecting 500+ is a small number, and you're going to pretend it isn't?
---
Lol... ok?
---
It def impacted more than 10 people, there are videos online of a single person robbing tons of players (I think the numbers were up in the 500's, not sure though) it's a big issue and I'm grateful action was taken quickly. I have been following the conversation on the forums where this hack originated from and they are aware of it being patched.
---
In my Spanish group, five active users, and one lost his equiped equip in queen battle, the other four were asleep, when the Europeans we got up the error was everywhere and we have not connected or played in private worlds. that is not a small number
---
maybe he descaled to the level in the region?
---
Probably. And who knows what actually “gets done” after this hotfix anyway. I truly hope they can make things right here.
---
It is very much implied when you come into this thread saying, "he is a chill and cool dude" "but if you talk with him and stuff, he's actually pretty cool." That was your first comment. So don't try playing with words on me. But at least you are now learning to perhaps back off from defending him." :)
---
Sounds like a riot lol
---
What’s the hack?
---
How dare we enjoy something you dislike, right?
---
It’s small compared to the hundreds of thousands or so people who own the game probably
---
Brand new to the game here. After checking out this subreddit today you'd think this specific instance has gone unacknowledged for weeks.
---
Ummm, nope. The people writing code are the same people that are fixing this mess...
---
This isn't like the studio wouldn't pony up for AVG, it's a flaw in the design of the game. A game that was designed by the people that are back at work fixing what they should have done properly the first time.
---
Got deleted. Now i'm interested in the topic. What was it saying?/
---
They shut down the servers.  Thats why.
---
They have been around for months. People have been reporting it on NW since it launched. If it was so easy, they would have fixed it already - but they can't.
---
Omg I died.
---
Yep, all anti-cheat programs are reactionary in their use. they do not get the cheats until after they have been found.   
---
that said something is a lot better then nothing.
---
"only a small number infected"...
---
over 500 player are at least 50 percent. 😏
---
Wish it was that simple my dude. We’re on pc.
---
I’d take that deal, game only cost me 40 xD
---
Correct.  How much research and hack-prevention can this team do in less than 48 hours? Very minimal.  Hackers will have bigger plans in response.  Supposedly they will try to invade PRIVATE worlds and steal stuff there.  Private server security is crude and probably wanton to attack.
---
Psychologically the analogy comes much closer than people probably realize. The main difference is there's no real harm other than a bit of mild frustration here. I already play games to waste time anyway, there's hardly a difference what I waste it on as long as I end up satisfied
---
I think we can pull a community fundraiser if you feel like doxing.
---
the hack is cannon now
---
But that is exactly what they did.
---
This dude needs to come and visit my town. Your a true a piece of $hit to listen to a little kid cry because your stealing his things. I feel bad for all the players who had stuff stolen, but hearing that kid cry really broke my heart. How could you not give him his stuff back, the dude who stole his stuff is a absolute waste of human life.
---
"If I didn't treat people like shit I would be breaking their immersion"
---
I sit here now after reading many comments now thinking is it even safe to log onto a private server on P. C and if it is how long before the scumbags start hacking into them? It's sad that this is happening to players if the people doing this have a problem with Bethesda it's not the payers that need the punishment we just want to play and have some fun. So much greed in the World these days and bad people I'm glad I will only have to endure this for around 50 more years apart from that Merry Christmas all and let's hope Bethesda pull their thumbs outta there backside to do the right thing and fix this game so it's finally moving in the right direction.
---
Did you find any victims of this hack yet?
---
This is some supreme nerdy shade
---
The majority of kids who don't understand the released script can possibly get it to run only as "intended", to transfer raid armor - whatever the player has equipped.  The competent hackers ruining everyone's good time can edit the code and clear inventories, possibly stashes.
---
Bethesda gave you an option to play Robin Hood by taking the items from rich Fallout 1st members and give them to the poor who cannot afford it. Praise Bethesda.
---
At some point you’ve got to recognize how horrible Bethesda and F76 is... I mean come on.
---
Define "a few"
---
Hey, i know that guy
---
Before it went live it effected less then 100, after it went live I think over 1000 people have been effected.  
---
But yeah it is a good thing action has been taken quickly.
---
Time/progression lost is priceless, gonna to be hard to satisfy ppl affected by the grinches who have no life and always trying to make someone else's life hell because that's all they have in life, spreading grief to make themselves happy, worst kind of people to exist.
---
BGS is pure dumpster fire joke.  Unbelievable what this studio has become :(
---
You been hiding for over a year? FO76 isn't a new release, it's a 2018 release. As stated above your reply, that's not  proactive in any way. YES...the Bethesda reputation is on the line, as it has been for over a year when FO76 released. Developers are developers. Slitting them doesn't change their literal career. Part time amateurs have been hired at Bethesda. 🥱
---
I know.  It's a serious issue and I think we all get that.  I guess people are so used to getting things on demand that they forget the time it takes to actually get things done and fixed.  I would not be surprised if some of the dev's had been working on this since last night when it started.
---
Lol, a 500 word essay on why anti-cheat is important.
---
To be honest that wouldn’t do anything. He’ll just use another account, a vpn, etc. That and he does check reddit. Don’t ya BoBo
---
THANK YOU.

This kid got scammed 4 times in one day, can you blame any of us?
---
You could probably drop super duper for either tormentor or grim reapers sprint (works excellent with gunfu).
---
ummmm...wait...
---
so you are saying people who lost everything due to a hacker reporting the hacks are "angry kids trying to stay enraged"?
---
wow
---
you are a sad person mate, its right before xmas and you cant even sympathise with people who lost all their gear, damn.  A piece of coal where your heart should be i suspect.
---
Place your bets about what new bugs/ glitches will be introduced now
---
Sorry, can't help it. I've been around for more than one year, i KNOW something will happen.
---
I knew it was brother Thomas!
---
Game design at it's finest.
---
 "Support has stated that they will be able to return items missing. They have access to the save logs so they likely will be able to just roll back the character inventory save so this easily prevents issues of people claiming to have items that they never had. "
---
Summary- support something that supports you. Quit defending the sinking burning trash pile Bethesda. Egotistical incompetent brands needs less followers.
---
We all post around the same time oblivious to each other bud
---
I give the hackers another day until they code something to delete characters next
---
if 0.5% of the world population died over night do you think our governments would say "there have been a few deaths"?   It would be presented as a massive/major loss. Consider the 9/11 deaths, was that ever referred to as "a few"? yet it is a smaller ratio.
---
I’d say the real assholes are the ones giving Bethesda money when everyone knew how broken this game was.
---
Ok different types of hacks, NW aim bots are not script injectors. They are packet falsifiers basically telling the game you hit something you didn't.  
---
the inventory bug is a script injector designed to turn everyone into a chest on your end.   
---
Aim bots are surprisingly hard to deal with. As there are literally thousands of ways they can work, script injector based hacks like the NPC spawning and steal players stuff hacks are a bit easier all you need to know is how they work. And as the stealing peoples stuff hack was made public well bethesda just needs to download it, and directly patch out how it works.
---
It’s crazy if you think there’s some group of developers who are now going in on Christmas to work on their mistake. Most likely it’s a few higher up idiots who messed up and are now screaming at a bunch of under-paid developers for their own dumb decisions.
---
He winds me up with it. His character is like level 6 or something.
---
you people never learn, do you? the evidence is right there but you'll still go out of your way to mitigate the situation.
---
not even paid shills are that diligent. I sincerely hope you get what you deserve.
---
Maybe not all of them reported the issue... Idk how they even keep track of it. That being said, a server rollback is needed.
---
I don't know maybe we will have to just wait an see instead of rampant speculation
---
i cant find an option to enable 2FA, can you tell me where is this option? there is only a security question i found
---
I have a lot of fps drops from 60 to 50-40, the frame rate in the queen boss fight can't handle 60fps, in my experience my 2060 can handle ultra well, but i have the same fps drops as playing low, so definitely an engine problem. I have a lot of games and also using 3d mark and this is a probmem related to fallout 76 only. Fallout 4 also has some weird problems, but network + engine issue make fallout 76 nkt stable at all
---
 I dont know what are you talking, I just said what happen to me xD
---
 Literally
---
i lost my fixer i was holding, and all my PA pieces (was in PA at the time) but retained my armour so, literally what i was equipped with at the time
---
So after all this, doesn’t this prove that single item restore is not only possible but practical.
---
Maybe i can get my unyielding armour set restored along with my TSE lever....
---
They can't even fix things when they have time. It will be interesting to see what happens here.
---
Not talking about their Beth accounts. Talking about real world info. 
---
Anyone affected by the hacks can do joint civil suit or choose to deal with the person who stole from them more.... Directly.
---
Awesome comment.
---
I don't recommend anything :)
---
I completely understand the appeal the game itself has and yes, it can be a satisfying looter-shooter.
---
I like this idea lmao
---
You’re in the FO76 subreddit. The dale subreddit that was so delusional they defended everything Bethesda has done with this game. Now, the thing is, you knew this game was broken. It was broken when it was released. It’s still broken. 
---
And you paid “AAA prices” for it.
---
Well bethesda support has helped me a few times, and I have gotten actual support and bugs found and fixed so I will Support this game.   
---
Reminder not everyone is as biased towards hate.
---
I thought people said it was an isolated issue and only alarmists were upset about it in this subreddit. Why not make some more "I just had the best time ever partying up with some people who rped about a hat" posts, that should fix everything.
---
i fast travelled to glass cavern and hung out in there for like an hour farming xmas presents, when i finally got back home the megasloth was happy at home :)
---
I couldn't agree more.

I'm using this.

Good doggy is the best choice imo
---
charisma 5 so you can use tenderizer for 5% extra dmg.
---
Rest looks pretty identical
---
Wow, people actually saw my post. Didn't expect that.
---
If you can actually prove that it was actually lost, at least as things stand now they at least appear to have that capability now where they at least stated that they could not before.
---
Man I feel bad for the people that subscribed to First. I don't play this game anymore, but nobody deserves to have their hard earned gear and ammo and loot amassed over hours and hours taken away so close to Christmas. That's from the heart y'all. I don't like Bethesda or their business tactics, but I'm a gamer as well. I feel the pain. I'm sorry if you lost your inventory.
---
lol mine says he is a sluggish sloth heheh
---
The only answer anyone needs.
---
Did I miss something? 
---
That was not even close to 500+ players being robbed.
---
I would love to know how many caps I have earned, I know it is in the hundreds of thousands, certainly 1/2 million or more.
---
That doesn't really change anything. You don't wait until it's over to make an announcement. That is the absolute worst thing you can do in any PR department. Even if you have absolutely no idea what's going on or how it can be fixed, you say that you are investigating or addressing the issue and will provide an update to the people affected. It's been a few days since this went live, and there was already a warning about it happening a week in advance. Even if they didn't prepare for the possibility like any responsible studio would have, they have had enough time for a skeleton crew anywhere in the world to get their shit together enough for a brief announcement. This is already widespread news from many youtubers and gaming journalists, and they have surely received support tickets from the hundreds or maybe even thousands already affected. Not making any public announcements gives a clear message that they don't care, and that's the last thing they need on top of everything else they've done wrong already
---
Seems like Bethesda ruined the game by releasing a fundamentally broken game. But they got their money at least.
---
Hey, I guess we can only wait and see ~~how they fuck things up this time~~
---
You mean jumping to conclusions is bad?
---
I knew it and I forgot about it… but this morning, I lost my armor x-01 + laster gatling ultracite while trying to kill the SBQ. We were several to be robbed…   and to die because of the lack of protection in this area after the nuke… 
---
It's really sad, cause I do love Fallout since I discovered it years ago… I already rebuild my armor since I got the plans…  and well, it's not cool but it was kinda easy and quick… but I was so proud of my laster gatling and this, I cannot get it back :( I'm really sad of the way Fallout takes… :(
---
(oh, and btw… easy to say "Open a Ticket", but with all the options, it's not very clear which one to select…)
---
Likely better devs then you, as you just sling hate. but what ever.
---
I would have to think whoever is responsible for this would have the foresight not to do it on an account that could be traced back to them but there are some stupid criminals out there so who knows
---
could be, I tamed him in the cranberry bog, but my camp is in the forest
---
BL3 was like the best retelling of a joke I already heard twice.  Outer Worlds was too linear to be RP and too wordy to be FPS.  I liked them both but they were far from addictive.
---
If you love fallout you wouldnt support fo76. If you want better fo games in the future and are an actual fan you dont play fo76.
---
My question is this: whos gonna brave enough to go out and see whats happening in adventure? Im not. My friend just lost his ALL items from the STASHBOX, because of the hackers. Im not gonna risk my everything, just to see. 
---
So?
---
HE SAID '' A FEW '' 
---
AYYY LMAO
---
nevermind, im an idiot, and i was confusing this and Ubi. I got emails from both this morning. 
---
For Bethsda, i just reset the password and it was fine.
---
Some hardcore shilling there bro (y)
---
Awesome thank you !  :D   Also gotta love dog food, is Ironclad that great considering I'm wearing almost all Unyielding?
---
Good. This game needs a final nail in the coffin. Anyone else still supporting this game and Bethesda is delusional. Good riddance. Some of you need to have your shit taken, so you can wake tf up and play a different/better game. 
---
And yes. Any fucking game besides fo76 and anthem  is better
---
Agreed, friend. Upvotes to you, good sir!
---
You do know the difference between reporting news and reviewing a game, right?
---
You forget that he was a HUGE supporter/fan of Fallout and felt burned. He's not so much hating on the game as he is giving Beth major shit for being completely greedy and focusing on the MTX shop than actually fixing the game.
---
Look, who would report all the problems FO76 is having if everyone who does were actual players? The player base has been dropping like flies, and like it or not, FO76 is a dumpster fire that just keeps fucking over it's players and this needs to be reported on.
---
It may look like people are bashing your favorite game but what would happen if nobody talked about whats going on or only a small minority reported on the issues?
---
Do you honestly think that content creators who report on a game they don't play is much worse than what's going on with this hacker shit? Would it make you happier if everyone stayed silent and not pushed Beth to get their act together?
---
He's not celebrating it's failure, he throwing shit at Beth and rightfully so. Beth used to send him major swag because he was such a huge fan and was fully let down and felt ripped off and lied to.
---
People deserve to know how bad this is and how bad Beth is treating it's most die hard fans. 
---
Again, He's not hating 76, he's hating Bethesda bullshit on how they are treating their fans who still choose to play the game.
---
These people are massive morons for even getting this game in the 1st place. Bethesda shills deserved what they got.
---
I want to come back just to see the Prydwin, but that would mean wasting time patching this bastard.
---
Since you responded to a single line without keeping the context in mind I can only assume that you are being sarcastic and realize that's an asshole-ish thing to do.
---
Hear hear
---
I'd just recommend again, you'd likely at least need approximate dates and times.
---
To be fair, on their end there's a lot of liars that flood support every time there's an issue like this claiming they lost their legacy TSE and full set of unyielding scout so they obviously need some method of qualifying.
---
Sorry for your loss lol.
---
&gt;a few players losing items that their characters had equipped
---
Isn't it all items that are lootable on the player? Not even gonna get into the metrics of what is and isn't small.  
---
&gt;While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected
---
Everyone is affected when an exploit/hack like this happens, because it shows how vulnerable the game is. Let alone the fact that the "small number that has been affected" weren't just losing a couple caps. 
---
Way to downplay it.
---
exactly, 500 users must be the half of pc user in this 4 or 5 hours

"small number of players"

anti material rifle, service rifle, battle rifle, .45 pistol, laser rcw. 12.7mm weapons and cyberdog.

True dedicated servers we could run privately would bring so much to the table. I doubt that will ever happen though, atom shop and 1st would be meaningless then.
---
Pretty rude to kill them
---
My armour loss was caused by the combat paint issue....
---
I think they should have waited another couple of years. 
---
Spend the time between when they released and now bug fixing and implementing wastelanders. And then spend another year doing a beta phase. 
---
And whatever product that is should have been the base level. 
---
The thing that frustrates me with FO76 as a FO fan sitting on the sidelines watching is that the idea isn’t that bad.
---
It’s just their execution was so damn shoddy, it not only has changed my opinion of FO76 but them as a company as whole. 
---
I lost all trust for Bethesda with all of their games. 
---
Now someone could say “well it’s just one bad game” yeah that’s true. But that would be like saying “well my doctor is great because he has done good work in the past. Sure his most recent patient he cut up into a thousand pieces and threw him in the river.”
---
They didn’t just have a simple misstep. They completely blew their reputation up. If they looked at FO76 and thought “yep... this is fine enough to release”. Then that’s a company whose judgement I will question. 
---
And again it’s a bummer. I’ve been hoping that at some point the game would get to a stage where I could justify the purchase price. But that point might be years down the line. If ever.
---
Wait, does this count as "proof" ?
---
I was a 1st member back when the scrapbox bug was around and i didn't get anything from bethesda because i didn't cry enough. This time i'm doing my best
---
What.
---
This.  HWID bans on all hackers/cheaters.
---
oh my god shut up. the servers are already down for maintenance
---
you took what i said literal. im not a moron im a realist, cheaters will wanna try pass the buck to avoid the blame so by being "good willers" less people will point at them and point at others.
---
its a stupid as shit cycle that overall damages everyone because of one bad apple.
---
They would have to. No company of that size doesn't have a backup system in place and they also wouldn't be dumb enough to keep only a short window of backups. 
---
Storage is cheap nowadays. Also, it's unlikely that Bethesda directly manage the backups since they don't likely own the servers at all.
---
I think the only reason they don't do so and find alternate means to "make it right" is to save money on the time and effort required to pull specific backups than it is to do like they did with the Fallout 1st issue and just give a dump of select junk.
---
Please never stop making games. I won't buy them, but I will be there to watch the Fallout. Get it?
---
I know - you're pretty good at it !
---
Have you even seen videos of people spawning giant mechs into GTA V? They literally create their own objects and load them into public servers where everyone can see them.
---
I mean he admits to it on a post in fo76:                                                                                                                                              "I'm \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ this is what I do. I don't do it for the items I do it for  the fun of it, I've collected every outfit, I'm loaded with legacies,  dev room stuff, ideal weapons and armor sets (there's nothing that i  legitimately need and almost nothing that don't already have). The kid I  mentioned above was done the other night, he was number 257 of the  people I've done that to (I keep a list). If you have any doubt's or  concerns about the legitimacy of my claims feel free to look me up on M  76 or other trade sub reddits. So long as you are mindful and not a  pushover when it comes to trading there's nothing i can do to effect  you. If you have any questions about who else i've done this to, other  experiences, or feel like stopping by ingame feel free to (PC). "
---
Already at 67% 
---
Bethesda slaves at it again lol
---
Im gonna defend a game i truly enjoy playing. Why would i pretend to hate it?
---
this.. is.. fucking.. hilarious.. I used to revere bethesda... but recent years has not just killed any respect I ever had for bethesda and ES6 has been removed from my list of games I look forward to as I see NO SIGNS WHAT SO EVER that you intend to improve.. which means that ES6 is likely to rival EA's level of garbage and scummyness
---
Because General Mills just sits at the end of a slot machine while promoting sugary cereals that rots children's teeth! 
---
It's a dumb argument. and again it's up to the parents of children to make adult decisions for them. Because, you know... THEY ARE CHILDREN.
---
I would love an explanation of why gameplay is fundamentally broken. I've been progressing and leveling up and improving my character non stop.
---
I know!  Ass cancer is no joke.  Beth *must* compensate me for this !!
---
Dang, people are down voting me for warning about an upcoming hack. I don't do this for fun. I'm on console, these hacks don't affect me.
---
Its a video game , not a life support system.
---
How dare you!
---
LMAO. Bethesda compare how many people are affected to how many people actually still play this game (very low),
---
 if they has daily saves, logs, whatever, they can roll back your account.  if they want.
---
Damn I think you got me beat there good job.
---
Same, PS4, super glad console isn’t easy to hack
---
Seeing as the hack was only live for a short period maybe a complete rollback off the entire world is actually possible?
---
So how does Beth allow you to currently trade between your own characters in the game without adding anything else like another player or console? You literally just described cheating because you got bored with the game. There is a cap limit and a stash limit, just because you find a way to cheat around that doesn't mean you are still playing the same game as everyone else. And just because someone else cheats doesn't make it fair game for everyone
---
dont know why ur being down voted.  8min video definitely doesn't show anything close to 100 let alone 500.
---
doubt it's gonna restore anyone's saves, though.
---
What reputation?
---
You know what could be really satisfying ? An ability to burn down cheaters PC's the moment they try to steal from us .
---
The person who did this to me and my friend didn't care about levels. Granted I may have looked more inviting as my character is level 466 but my friend was only 160ish. I had gone to his camp to warn him about the hack and in the process we watched our stuff just disappear. We both lost some of our best stuff too, from legacies to forest/urban unyielding armor. Not to mention 100,000+ plus rounds of ammo. My IGN is WhiteRabbitTales and many know I have tons of weapons and armor for sale.. or I use too.
---
Here's a video [showing the earth is actually flat](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqNnUJVcVs)
---
That is just China in general lol
---
Yes - people will be trying to cash in on this..
---
&gt; Sending Bethesda the list means they might be able to get the people stealing stuff. 
---
For some other companies, I'd expect this to help but this is Bethesda. They're not going to put that kind of time and effort in to get to the hackers. They don't even put that kind of time and effort into their own game.
---
Lol. He's a "cool dude" despite the video evidence that he's absolutely trash.
---
I'm a moron but I have said from day one its trash.
---
Unlike some ppl "I hardly run into glitches."
---
People actually got butthurt over the number of people they say are affected? lol where’d u see that?
---
No, it didn't. There are still more gift givers than hackers and probability still applies. The chance of being hacked is incredibly low, and the servers are down for maintenance meaning the issue could be fixed in a matter of hours.
---
I'd not be surprised if they dont have backups to rollback considering how things roll in 76
---
And why are u here? Hating on a game u probably never even touched. Just a lemming following the trend of hating the game, just to make urself feel better about urself
---
Do not use ironclad, use scaly skin mutation instead. Considering you're almost always sneaking around ,armor does little for you.
---
arent you afraid of a lawsuit from bethesda or something? u think your just having fun but your costing bethesda tens of thousands of dollars, they will not let that go unpunished, you are stealing atom shop items, and breaking something called the EULA , wich is there terms of service agreement that you agreed upon. your other videos on your youtube channel all have your main account linked to it, wich is linked to the your bank account that u used for your first sub or buying atoms, they will find you and they will not go easy on you. fornite sued a kid for 350.000 for having an aimbot so good luck to you dear bodega.
---
Shillboy 2000 is at it again.
---
I myself enjoy taking junk from other players... but this hacking stuff is just not right at all.
---
You're getting downvoted, but I haven't seen waves of new players in a long time. Tbf I haven't played in a while though.
---
Ha here comes the nazi griefer hackers defending each other
---
Tl;dr were screwed.   :(
---
I'm digging it
---
F for the dev who has to work over the christmas holidays to fix this.
---
I’m half expecting a bandaid patch and to find tomorrow that people are stealing entire camps or something else instead!
---
It was only 1 cig and it tasted like butt...won't be going back for a 2nd one. but i just needed to calm down and that was the worst/best thing available besides throwing my keyboard and mouse. I appreciate the looking out and the love! I won't be smoking again, it just stressed me so much yesterday.
---
Lol what an expertly executed troll post, down to your username and complaining about crybabies.
---
No it isn't VATS is the best in the series because it isn't fucking easy mode as it is in other series.
---
Lol dummy, it's almost 2020...wake up!😘
---
Don't need to pretend it can be fun but its still  a dumpster fire.
---
Regardless of his motivation, I appreciate the end result of things like this though. The more I as a customer know about Bethesda's fuck ups, the better educated I can be about their future projects. I don't really care who's giving me this information as long as someone's doing it. If no one was, I may have stumbled into ES6 with a pre-order thinking that it would be perfectly fine. This almost constant stream of Bethesda Bad is good for at least one thing - making people a little bit more apprehensive about the games they buy.
---
Exploits and those that capitalize from them, will be what kills this game.  Short term gain, sure.  Long term, not so much ......
---
For money, it was never a question. They can sell those items on ebay or wherever. No news, sadly.
---
That’s always been my plan. The game has been defeated, which is why my attitude is the way it is. Trust me, I don’t WANT to feel this way. I still enjoy the game, but the risk vs reward is not worth it, imo.
---
Once the game has a proper anti cheat, I’ll be happy to come back. But continuing to play this travesty is enabling Bethesda to keep up the same business practices. Which does not bode well for Wastelanders or Starfield
---
Normally i don't say things like this, because i think it's hella petty, but idk this time. this is 100% be on you for trusting them enough to give them a year payment up front for services in a game that breaks every patch. I don't care a single iota if you personally feel slighted, maybe you'll learn your lesson and not piss a years subscription away to a game managed as poorly as this one.
---
&gt; What about the people that got a year of FO1? How would you feel if you paid for something then 3 months later the company was like “we are going to release this feature you paid for, for free to everyone”?
---
I would feel betrayed and learn my lesson, but I'm not that insecure with my money. There's a customer born every minute, and a rube soon after. Anyone who puts a year down on this game is betting against the house that this game will be worth playing in a years time. That is just not a smart bet.
---
&gt; a few players losing items   
---
&gt; we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected 
---
Whatever this guy is smoking, I would like some of it.
---
true but then you have 6 special points worth of perks that do nothing for you
---
I want to see this compensation. How do you give back hundreds of hours of gameplay to fans who have stayed loyal despite being abused again and again
---
question: when is the last time you played fo76?
---
im curious
---
I dont think it is
---
Are we all going to get 500 Atoms as compensation? 😒😒😒
---
but... I got my plasma grenade plan an hour ago!
---
Beautiful, I admire your work and consistency. I would place as much items (some looks like a little bit too much), but as a whole looks amazing.
---
how am I edgy?
---
&gt;Are you okay? It's absolutely bad code?? Do you even understand how hacking works? The reason these guys are able to do this is because FO76 is running on a decade old Frankenstein engine 
---
It's phrases like that (as well as pretty much every other word in your comment) that just screams that you have no technical knowledge on the matter either.
---
I am all up for separated development. Make dedicated servers for those who are willingly paying for low-quality broken garbage that is not even tested and cash-grabbing pay to win microtransactions and let them all play together on those servers. For those of us who do not support that, make the game good, bug and cheat-free, let us play on our own servers and we will pay for that, call it Fallout Works or something.
---
All I can think of doing is laughing at this shit,all you PC players do is talk shit about console users and how PC is the master race, look at you now 😂😂😂 us console players don't even have to worry about this shit.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/eejar2/this_is_for_everyone_who_was_calling_everybody/
---
I responded with the link from here in reference to the question.
---
Two jamokes in this thread.
---
And when shit like this happens I kind of laugh at people that rave about how much better PC is.  Yea I won't be getting 120 fps at 4k any time soon. But I also don't have to deal with anywhere near the level of hacking little fuck waffles as PC does.   
---
If I ever get a PC it will be only for single player games or maybe LAN games with friends.
---
How is hundreds of players losing all their stuff and constant game breaking bugs not a dumpster fire? Tell me I'll wait
---
So the people who actually enjoy the game, which allowed people to take advantage of them... are the real assholes?  Oooook.
---
no people should stop playing this game and sue bethesda for compensation, its solely bethesda's fault if they use an engine which can be modded to death for multiplayer. It worked in ESO with another engine without so many fuckups.
---
a few, there's a video of a guy doing 500+ people...... stop trying to blanket this as "only a few" to avoid financial liability.
---
It's not the fault of the people working on it, it's the fault of the higher ups - the people who tell the people working on it what to do. It's not the dev's fault they're forced to use an engine completely inappropriate for online games. It's not the dev's fault 76 had basically no at-launch content. This is the result of the higher ups wanting to spend the least amount of money to make the most amount of money.
---
Probably. I'm melee and I recognize the name intrepid. I was determined to get the beanie.
---
/r/ps4homebrew /r/xbonehacks/
---
lol like Beth is going to incur that expense. They know all you whales will keep playing even with a greased pole shoved up your bum so far it tickles your tonsils. Not a single one of you will quit over this, and you'll keep handing them your money. Why would they spend thousands to go after some script kiddies? L O L.
---
The play for fun aspect lost it's shine awhile back. Doing all the custom building and maintaining is fun. It is not Fallout though. I made it to level 142 before bailing. It's been a kick in the nuts after another. 76 just never came through on the additions and fixes, now it seems to be in the worst shape.
---
D2 has its fair share of hackers. Watched a vid the other day of a comp match where an opposing player spawned with heavy ammo and was literally teleporting to the opposing team and killing them. Was doing strikes about 2 weeks ago and a fella was literally flying all over the map shooting infinite amounts of rockets. There’s always glitches with exotic armor and weapons and mod combinations. First day of season of dawn they had to deactivate a mod because it was allow for infinite supers. Titans have a broken exotic right now that’s allowing for absurdly long supers. The list goes on and on. Lol. 
---
These may not be to the extreme of full inventory wipes but can be very frustrating none the less. And this is coming from someone that has been playing destiny 2 over fallout 76 since shadowkeep launched. I guess my point is, a lot of games have glitches and hacks going on. It’s all mostly just a matter of opinion. What are you enjoying? What will you put up with before it isn’t enjoyable anymore?
---
Lmao oh this is just getting more and more entertaining.
---
"the only way to play the game at all is via Fallout First"
---
Factually incorrect.
---
Your fear is warranted.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7cyaC8Q1f8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7cyaC8Q1f8)
---
&gt;give everyone at least a free month of Fallout 1st
---
Nice joke
---
&gt;	more negative Bethesda propaganda
---
This entire game has spread negative Bethesda propaganda since it released.
---
Servers have been down for almost an hour now for a hotfix.
---
So apparently all the people outraged by this are not familiar with GTA Online by Rockstar. Given script kiddies can do the exact same bullshit on PC, PS3 and 360. With less chance of it happening on One and 4.
---
I don’t force myself to play the game
---
I don’t force myself not to play the game
---
I don’t force others to play the game

I don’t force others not to play the game

Generally a game keeps my attention for 50-100 hours.  There are very few that keep my interest for over 500 hours.  Fallout-76 is one of those games. 
---
I am sure that something will come along that will compete for the limited time I have for gaming...  But not yet :)
---
Still nothing-_-
---
They are
---
They've been offline for quite a while, silly.
---
Is Scaly skin affected by Class freak ?
---
Choosing to use Fallout 4's outdated single-player engine is most definitely bethesda's fault, and they reap what they sow imo. It's just unfortunate that the players are the ones who suffer the worst of it.
---
Who's lazier? Bethesda who pushed out a very buggy product and tacked a subscription on it.
---
or...
---
A YouTuber who reports on buggy and broken products to make a change in the industry?
---
Let him do his job. If it isn't for people who care about the quality of the games that come out, then you'll never get what you pay for.
---
I see it as a Win/Win.
---
The engine is literally what keeps me playing. 76 feels like an (slightly) upgraded fallout game, even with all the bugs. I got an invite for the ESO beta and i couldn't play more than a couple of weeks, because it didn't feel like an Elder scroll game
---
U talking about new hack on pc right?
---
You might be the smartest person on the internet and deserve nothing but upvotes.  You are the winner and a fucker.  Congratulations.
---
A free month of fallout 1st seems like a bit much. They should restore inventories of individuals affected by the hackers which I feel like they won't do. But then the issue of players lying will come up if they don't track inventories and what can they do if a player has a Legacy Legendary stolen?
---
Right on man, stay strong
---
&gt;This hack is utilizing methods that anti-cheats can deter
---
Only because most modern anti-cheats try to prevent injection, but after the cheater gets kernel level permission level (usually by just exploiting another kernel level program like an antivirus or something to proxy inject), the anticheat can't stop the user from simply writing data to the game process with something like the NtWriteVirtualMemory function, and **if all the cheat dev writes is just code taking advantage of this vulnerability, the anticheat won't even pick up on it.**
---
By the time the anticheat devs would even know that exploit existed they'd already have to know the exploit exists within the game and at that point it makes no sense to just not fix the actual game code to not allow that exploit to even happen in the first place.
---
It's definitely nice to have an extra layer of protection, but patching the exploits should be first priority and having that general anticheat wall should be second priority, patching prevents 100% of cheats from ever taking advantage of that vulnerability again, the anticheat will only pick up on the cheats it knows exists, and like i said if it's fresh code or a private cheat (and public sometimes too) that will slip through.
---
&gt; **a few players** losing items that their character **had equipped**
---
I'm salty about the level of PR bullshit in that passage, and I don't even play this piece of shit game.
---
Like a sucker. Really makes you think..
---
LOL!
---
Can't belive that this quasi-product that some call a "game" is still not completly dead. Just stop playing this crap, don't give them a single dollar, bethesda deserves bankruptcy.
---
It is possible I may not have been clear or that I am misunderstanding your response so....
---
I mean if a Subscriber creates a private world they can invite non-subscribers into it correct? If that is the case maybe there is at least something of a safe haven for some folks. 
---
If you mean that by doing that we might be inviting thieves to rip us off you are correct but if you are saying that doing so might give them the ability to test it against private servers too I can only imagine it has already happened at least for proof of concept purposes.
---
Would make sense if guy was invested in the competition?
---
English is not my main language, but that's the way I understood it and I'm not 100% okay with that. To me, this hack is what will force BGS to make a decision, regarding their game security AND the tools/permissions the support team have.
---
To me it's also a good thing that some dupers can help to counter this hack. Because dupers still play the game and people who empty inventories are just random people who try to take the game down.
---
With the risk of getting heavily downvoted, my opinion is this : ZERO TOLERANCE to anyone modifying files, no matter the reason.
---
Lol no it’s not
---
[https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk](https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk)
---
That is a very cool build! Nice work!
---
From ONE person.
---
They do, they're just typically way out of date.
---
I haven't spent a dime on this game outside of buying it on preorder, and refuse to. But for the longevity of this game and anything they intend to produce similarly in the future, they absolutely should. They need to send a message &amp; drop the hammer. Spending some now sets a precedent and can be a great detterant for similar behavior in the future.
---
Just roll-back the entire player logs to the 22nd or whatever. It's the simplest fix.
---
I can honestly say I was a victim to this hack and this guy wasn't the one who did it to me. I have submitted a ticket to Bethesda along with the users name as there was no one else around when it happened to my friend and I. So even if he didn't hit 500 people, there are enough people using this hack to reach the 500+ or maybe more. I'm pretty sure everyone on my server got hacked as I saw lots of naked people in a very short time as we ran around warning people.
---
All I gotta say is karma's a bitch lol.
---
Honestly they dont owe them anything they made the choice and made the decision to stay around and play the game. With any online game especially on PC you run the risk of hackers. 
---
It suck yeah and the people who are doing it are pos but bethesda needs to fix the issue and beyond that anything given is just a gesture of apology. They dont have do do anything really.
---
Just for the sake of having a discussion I’ll ask the question: how do you explain the video linked earlier? It is fairly clear watching what happens and how people react that he is taking their inventory. In the original thread there are people who were in the video confirming what he was doing. What makes you skeptical of this?
---
Yes and vault raids etc I can make a whole list.
---
Given their track record of "fixing" bugs, do you have enough trust in them to put your inventory on the line?
---
If people say' y'all' does that mean they are a southerner rather than a yankee type person? 
---
Or do northerners say it also?
---
no, because the game is down for maintenance
---
&gt; Supposedly they will try to invade PRIVATE worlds and steal stuff there. 
---
..? Didn't think so. Stop pulling shit out of your ass.
---
Because of what? The game hacking? Rockstar and GTA Online has been like that for over 5 years at this point.  Bethesda is hardly treading new ground here.
---
They don't verify inis.  The worse that could happen is that they release an update that changes something in the ini, and then your game works weirdly until you fix yours.
---
It's only the second problem that affected me. (I wasn't hacked, but it scared me enough to not play until they fix it) the only other problem I had with this game was the NW hacking. And I'm talking about 1 year of playing this. 
---
Maybe that's why I'm not too distrustful yet.
---
This post is 24 hours late ;)
---
damn, so close, my hacker was nude...bummer B(
---
I was a Fallout 1st member, and I am not rich, just good with my money - and how someone spends the money they EARN is none of your business
---
Wait they can do the stash boxes I read that it was only inventory the player is carrying
---
LMAO
---
Oh I feel you. I would give almost anything to get Place Anywhere in this game... just being able to tilt and bury things would be a massive QOL upgrade and produce much more natural looking camps.
---
The budget is also a pain but I've been experimenting with ways to get around it for now. My hope is that Bethesda will increase it soon, ideally before Wastelanders.
---
Gotta love how everyone's saying hacker should be banned and prosecuted. Bethesda/Zenimax is who should be prosecuted for selling people the dumpsterfire that is FO76. And banned from making future FO games. Oh, what's that? They're already getting prosecuted in Australia? Good, good...
---
The entire internet*   
---
There, fixed it for ya.
---
LOL He believes that hackers stealing their inventory and in game gear breaking and glitching out are minor annoyances. All that time spent down the drain.
---
The Fallout 76 community in a nutshell, ladies and gents.
---
yes, you need to walk to the conclusions like everyone else
---
What are shark cards then? You buy with real money outside of game for in game currency. In RDRO it's gold bars, which like shark cards can be purchased but unlike shark cards can be slowly earned in game. Shark cards are a currency, they are not actually credit cards, more like pre-paid gift cards which is like currency, especially in made up game worlds. And while you can earn that money in GTA it's literally millions and millions of dollars for cars and property at high tiers, really hard to earn for an average player.
---
Won't know until servers get back up, but the issue at hand being fixed relied on DLL injection -- if anything is affected, it could be using SFE which is needed for the tex chat mod, full functionality of perk loadout manager, and a few other QoL type mods.
---
Edit: server is up, SFE is unaffected.
---
&gt;D2 has its fair share of hackers.
---
Bungie actually addresses these problems quickly. 
---
&gt;First day of season of dawn they had to deactivate a mod because it was allow for infinite supers
---
Yes. The Dynamo mod. And it was disabled within 2 hours of Launch and fixed in several days. There's nothing in Destiny that even comes close to allowing other players to Rob you of your entire inventory in seconds. That's inexcusable.
---
Are you in advertising, maybe from the company of one of those other games you mentioned? Do you think the internet has devolved marketing and advertising into an unethical shitshow?..I sure do.
---
Can you ban there ip?
---
Idk why the fuck they haven't taken it offline yet!
---
Both of these games shit on 76 when it comes to survival and mmorpg elements (especially on private servers). The good thing about 76 is that it has a story (a mediocre story) but a story nonetheless and some creative locations and narrative (but so do ark and conan).
---
uhhhhh
---
Fo76 is not worse than the initial release of NMS. 
---
However.. Bethesda's response to their community has been pathetic.
---
Fallout 1st is an absolute joke and a slap in the face to customers. The fact that anyone would spend any additional money on this train wreck is laughable. Nothing can repair the damage they've done to their brand. The game just feels (is) completely empty. 
---
Armor skins can't fix that.
---
PLANNING to take it offline? YOU HAVEN'T TAKEN IT OFFLINE YET? WHAT THE FUCK WE'RE YOU THINKING?
---
I lost all my laser rifles from my bloodied explosive one my anti armor explosive my junkies explosive those took tons of hours to get as well  as a ton of trading what am I supposed to do I submitted a ticket
---
No game ever can get 100% of hacks away from the fame. Hacker adept and find there way back. I never said the game didnt have problems. I just dont do the sruff that have issues
---
Can't help but laugh at the PC "master race" now
---
Call me naive but won't stating when and how remediation will be transacted take a lot of pressure off the situation? The official statement above is classic marketing/PR speak to avoid true disclosure or to admit fault. It goes off the rails with the "few players" statement followed quickly by "currently evaluating for release today." How on earth can BGS claim that "only a small number were impacted" if their only visibility is a notoriously difficult to use support ticketing system? Last time I used that tool a month ago I couldn't attach the darn error log required to submit a ticket. If you put a bucket over your head your shoes look really nice.

I actually enjoyed earning the GTA money. I printed money in that game gambling on races lol
---
You are not placing your blame correctly.  You are correct in saying people have a choice in their behavior.  However, the ultimate blame belongs with the company with the easily exploited coding - now the assholes taking advantage of that coding, yes they deserve every name you can think of to be thrown at them, but ultimately, the company released the game - which gave these assholes the ability to do it.
---
Bethesda is just as much a victim as the players getting robbed.  
---
The ONLY ones to blame are the hackers with so much of a hate on for Bethesda, or so much inbuilt anger and angst that they feel the need to express themselves through chaos.
---
Bethesda may have made the error to dress their product inappropriately in public, but blaming the violated, and saying they brought their own violation upon themselves, is the defence of the sociopath who lacks any and all sense of self control.
---
Bwaahahah!
---
Just like how Activision let's kids play Black Ops.
---
 Take a picture of your CAMP while having your inventory emptied by a hacker dressed in raider gear in a rad storm or nukezone workshop with graham and a tinfoil hat alien with 10 fermented alcoholic chems inside a vault 94 camera picture of  5 radroaches and preston garvey.
---
this would be more accurate
---
Hacks just a new issue vault raids. Getting stuck in PA for weeks, 8 months into the game being out. There's a reason ppl want a part 2 to internet historian vid.
---
to help my friend who just got it. I hit lvl 170 or something insane like that a long time ago (I honestly do not care or keep track) and the game stopped being fun. anyways, friend seems to like it so I help him along.
---
Nothing wrong with that play what you enjoy friend!
---
500+ people is NOT a FEW or a SMALL NUMBER Bethesda.
---
Bodega isnt the droid you are looking for srsly
---
His parents must if he's got that kinda free time.. Yeah, these people have wallets to hurt.
---
oh its you ...  :)
---
Bethesda just became the AIDS of gaming devs. I'm no longer looking forward to elder scrolls or any game with that logo on.
---
Also, do you remember what happened the last time someone reported a glitch and the steps to do it? Even if I would prefer reporting a security breach, I think it's as much effective to spread it, because the people in charge are forced to do something instead of being silent.
---
To be fair, FO76 is a worse holiday present than coal in the socks.
---
What’s the hack? I’ve been out of the loop for a while
---
WOW...people lost their weapons/PA/ armors they got during the past year and you would cry if they added the scrapbox to everyone ? geez
---
"Complete false equivalency. I go outside in the winter during snow because I have to in order to earn a living wage at my job, go to the store for food, or any number of reasons that I can't immediately dismiss to prevent a minority occurrence."
---
So you're telling me that if you just wanted to go out for a short walk to get fresh air, you wouldn't go because of that small chance to slip?
---
I see exactly where the false equivalency is. You're bending over backwards to prove me wrong and missing the point because of it. 
---
But let me agree with you: Fallout 76 is not real life. It's just a game. Therefore, a minor chance of something bad happening-- and particularly something that can be controlled/mitigated by the player, like putting away that 56,000+ rng weapon/armour-- is not worth freaking out about. And yes, I stand by my point that it's irrational to stop doing something you enjoy because of a very small chance that something bad could happen. Your disagreement is noted but not relevant for me.
---
you still know me?
---
LOL you missed the point. Not really surprising 🥱 I mean look at the game right now and tell me it’s not “rushed” and that it’s not a “complete shit show”.  (Spoiler alert: Fo76 is objectively a bad game and a rushed shit show)
---
But logic won’t work on cultists like you. So enjoy Fo76 and drink the Bethesda kool-aid.
---
I'd like to wait for them to fix the game but the human life span is only, like, 120 years tops. No way that is enough time for them to hammer this thing out.
---
I weep for the next Elder Scrolls.
---
I haven't played Fallout 76 in a while but check the subreddit pretty often. I know everyone has seen the video by now but has anyone noticed the thumbnail? Is that a picture of the actual hacker?
---
[https://imgur.com/a/RaJXaYS](https://imgur.com/a/RaJXaYS)
---
Yeah. Or rather the investment firm that wants returns on their big investment into ZeniMax, the parent company of Bethesda.
---
light wood laminate
---
This isn’t console land, you can’t do this on pc. There are dozens of ways to circumvent this.
---
yes
---
Oh you are one of those people
---
Got it. Thanks for clarifying for everyone.
---
Oh man, SO this.   Yesterday I fired up fo76 and noted I last played Nov 18th, *2018*, about 3onths after I prepaid for the $100 package.   I didn't play it.   I'm so disappointed in Bethesda for ruining the Fallout franchise apparently just to cash in on the "but me and my friendless friends want an online adventure in Fallout....with battle royale mode please because there aren't enough battle royale games out." crew.
---
Maybe Obsidian can save this trainwreck someday and get Fallout back to its former greatness.  Otherwise Fallout is dead to me.
---
Don't out me ;)
---
Got upset because of people in here knowing absolutely nothing about It security and downwoting a few posts where I explained how it works.
---
I really wish they would just let us download the server binary so we could host our own games. Fuck this paid private worlds bullshit. This could be one of the best games ever if they let us mod it and run the entire thing locally.
---
Servers are up? That was fast.
---
Stop playing the damn game, it was never an honest atempt of creating a proper fallout multiplayer experience for the fans, just reused assets fra FO4.
---
I like how I got downvoted for supporting the same idea x) Some people are too pure for this world.
---
\^THIS
---
A lot of the people running the hacks and scripts are more than happy to brag to anyone that will listen.
---
i dont have a slightest idea who are you, so.. :)
---
Im on Ps4 ,i got hacked for compensation"one pony please"
---
Light wood laminate finally mine
---
Fastest 10 atoms I ever earned!
---
Legal action is far more costly than banning en masse. Firstly, you have to track the hackers down. Then you have to ensure that you have proof of the hack. Third, you have to build a case that could hold water in the hacker's home country, which is likely the hardest part due to different legal systems in different countries. Fourth, you have to start up a legal procedure in the host country- all that costs a shitload of money, has dubious ROI, might not even succeed in winning the case, and at worst, brings the local press on you hard ("A local adolescent boy sued by game company and sentenced to two years of jail for playing their video game!")
---
You don't like it, but face it, legal action won't save the day. It can make you feel better though, but I doubt Todd would agree.
---
Nah. You guys can go play fortnite
---
It doesn't fucking matter whether it's 1% or 0.01% of the player base that's affected, Bethesda gains NOTHING by calling it "a small number of players". All this does is make it sound like they are trying to cover their ass, which they are. This is PR 101: when you've been caught with your pants down, bragging about size does not make things better. When you're making a public statement, the absolute WORST you can do is downplay things. What you do is you acknowledge that things are bad, you outline the steps you're taking to address them, you thank the players for being patient, maybe offer some sort of compensation, and then you sit the fuck down. No deflection, no minimzation, just get off the mic as quickly as possible and then work hard to make things better. THAT'S how it's done.
---
Then again, Bethesda's PR and Comms teams are about as competent as their QA department, so I really don't know why I'm even surprised anymore.
---
Im xXDemolisher
---
I've been defending this game forever but this has honestly gone too far, add some form of anti-cheat jesus christ.
---
"Few" i laugh if it wasnt so fucking pathetic.
---
Dude,
---
How can you say that when the whole first page on this sub is upvoted posts on all the horrible stuff that's going on?
---
I get where you're coming from but sometimes the most vocal complaints come from the old school die hard fans.
---
Not only did Beth send him huge amounts of free swag, he spent like 180$ on the game. He was the last person who wanted this game to fail.
---
Don't get it twisted, I'm not a huge fan but if it wasn't for his and MANY others reporting, I would have bought this game and would have felt burned. I LOVED Bethesda, but this is really, really bad and it keeps on happening. I just feel that Beth is more concerned with it's bottom line than their community at this point. It's like they are trying to get blood from a stone instead of doing whats right. I hope this game gets it right, I hope to play it at a better state. This is why I am always looking into the game. Huge fan since before Beth got involved and a huge fan of Beth since Elder Scrolls Morrowind 
---
I'm glad you still play and there is nothing wrong with that, but people deserve to know the dumpster fire that Beth keeps fueling. If there is no backlash, there's no fixing the game.
---
At the end of the day if these videos help get the fire under Beth's ass to do better, is it really that horrible?
---
I just can't get over how terribly he pronounces the word bethesda or as he calls it "BaTehhhhsda"
---
Exactly. I played it more then some other games I spent full price for, it's not a big deal to me. Hard not looking at all the drama this game stirs up though.
---
Amen to that.
---
Bethesda won't change and you all should know that by now its just been getting worse. This is the beginning of the end for them. Good riddance.
---
Right, easiest being masking your HWID but it's still more effective than an account ban.
---
Well yea, I'm assuming he's talking about earning GTA $ in the game. From missions, racing, etc. 
---
I haven't played GTA Online in at least 2 years, so I don't know if they've increased the grind level? I don't remember it being too much of a grind. I had tons of cars and multiple properties and never bought shark cards. If you wanted to buy EVERYTHING, put $500k of mods and pink tire smoke on every car, etc., then yea you'd probably be grinding for awhile if you didn't buy shark cards. 
---
But I just used the money I made doing events that I enjoyed anyways. Can't even tell you how much money I made gambling on races (or just winning them).
---
Now that's one way to kill a well respected company
---
a few??????
---
I feel sorry for all the developers and the players who've been caught in this flytrap of a game.  
---
My thoughts and prayers go with you, Merry Christmas and may the holidays soothe some of your woes.
---
QFT!
---
still doesnt ring a bell.. but hello:) merry xmas.
---
They won't do anything because you have created a system where there is enough fodder for the whales on a minimum effort.
---
It's unacceptable, but the moment you kept playing, you made it acceptable because you have shown that you will come back mess after mess.
---
We're not laughing with you, but at you. 
---
This hack is a necessary evil. It's about time you guys wake up from Tranquility Lane.
---
I play private so its like having a single player FO till FO5 comes out. Ive experienced a minimum of issues on PC and playing private since before the current hack came out makes it nothing I've had to worry about.
---
Lucked into a player selling for a couple hundred. Didn't realize it was so rare.  Eat the perception penalty for the killer look.
---
What would be really nice is if Bethesda obviously got this sorted including rollback on the players inventories and compensation but before that let us know they are going to do so on the launcher as I'm loosing hope for this game or any under their control fast, just give the loyal players something to look forward to for a change do a job and do it right.
---
Just make the game free to play it sucks anyways.
---
Forcing 4k resolution through .ini files is a bannable offense then, this is a very dangerous line to cross but you have a lot of guts to consider it given the spaghetti code of the Creation engine
---
Pretty sure the dude that posted the video of them running around stealing from a bunch of players revealed his face in the thumbnail:
---
all the ini changes available are ok because bethesda specifically left them unlocked, there are tons of other ini values that cant be changed because bethesda locked them, at launch there was even more ini freedom than there is now, dont worry about the changes, I use a ton on mine for my 240hz monitor setup.
---
Right, it may have happened before that, but I don't play NW much, so i only really started for the rewards. I can confirm that today, Hong straight into adventure, the sounds are normal.
---
&gt; the perps banned FOR LIFE.
---
The issue is they are just using dummy throw away accounts. There's no way for Bethesda to really stop them from just finding new exploits and coming back again on a new level 3 account. It's the same people doing the exploits every time
---
Time to wake up from Tranquility Lane and smell the coffee.
---
This is Fallout 76 in a nutshell.
---
Correct. The fact that they're not doing that makes me think that maybe they *CAN'T*, which... wow. Just wow.
---
Can't wait for the new hack to be released :)
---
I don't play this game, but I've played some very crappy games just because of the communities that gathered around them, so in that way I definitely feel for you guys. You took the barely playable mess Bethesda threw at you and had the most fun you could with it. You deserve better.
---
merry xmas. got the honor to grief you then and now, thats why i know ur name
---
Based on previous "fixes" it would remove items to all players
---
*I believe OP is referring to being stuck at work, doing tedious tasks, but would much rather be playing 76*
---
No. 
---
New Vegas is the best game I have ever played. I don't hate bethesda, but I don't love them either.
---
I rather spend 30 on Elite Dangerous. Frontier are far more noble than these wankstains
---
8. Play private and continue to farm holiday gifts.
---
well this is the opposit of what chrismase should be
---
It's all I've ever heard from PC players,master race this and master race that, meanwhile us console users are all over here safe and sound and laughing at the supposed master race
---
They suspended me for using a macro to not be auto logged out. But I have heard that playing the banjo will keep you from being logged out.
---
I'm seeing 500 players affected by one person come up a lot and people kinda vary between like 520 to like 580 people. I'm mostly out of the loop for that, where's the claim coming from?
---
I mean, in some sense, they already demonstrated stupidity by making it public.
---
Afaik they only backup the servers when they release a patch. So back to Dec. 10th
---
Spent ages crafting and scrapping lever actions to get around 300 ish damage with my silencer so it's hard to let go of it, but after finding a bloodied 1\* railway, I just carry both now haha.    Hard to find railway rifles to scrap though
---
Sorry for triggering you, snowflake, in a day or a week when your enrage falls down try re-reading my comment and figure out you have accused me wrong. Doing so now won't help, so yeah, you'll have to wait for your trigger to untrigger. Hope my upvote is going to make you feel better.
---
It's not about winning. It's about serving them with the lawsuit. That's really all that needs to be done. 
---
More importantly, people are uploading videos of it being done on YouTube. I've seen them. What more proof do you need? 
---
This wouldn't be a case of a "big bad Corp" going after some innocent teen. And the truth is that these issues cost them money regardless. The dev teams need to fix, PR needs to try and minimize the impact. You act like they don't have lawyers on retainer already.
---
i think you remember it wrong, i dont do pvp:)
---
Currently, I think it's a bit bugged, the last I read you could invite people to a team from the login screen and set the world to accept only those people (so 4 people total).  Or, set it to friends only, and anyone on your friend list could come and go as they want.  Not sure if there is an 'open to the public' setting, but I don't recall seeing that.
---
You don't get a 'server' per say, you get to create your own 'instance' of the game on Amazon servers (just like the public ones are), but you have control over who can join.  
---
So it's not like downloading the server software and running it on your local machine, or on a co-hosted server.  That's what I thought you were talking about, my apologies if that wasn't correct.
---
Alright be honest with me, how old are you kid?
---
no problem, i think they locked me out temporaily because someone tried to hack me with script login.
---
Hacking is out of control in this game
---
That's my favorite one, "Ha ha, Gary!"
---
issues aside it's still fallout with amazing world and with the same post apocalyptic vibes and dark humour, in the same time the only fallout you can play with friends
---
❄☃️❄☃️❄ I'm pretty and one of a kind; yay!
---
I was joking I agree with you.
---
He's not wrong tho.
---
Are you really saying it's a player's fault for being hacked?  What are you smoking?  There's people that don't even know this is going on, so it's their fault for getting fucked out of their gear?  This isn't something that happens with most other games, Bethesda simply put a very poor system in place to prevent hacking, and it doesn't work, so they need to update it.  At the end of the day, you blame the hackers first, and the company second, but not the players just trying to enjoy themselves.  (PS: Get off the corporate dick, this is a Triple-A game studio, not John Indiegame.)
---
No one will, because no one gives a shit about some random gamer getting his items stolen in a video game.
---
Get real...
---
Hey guys, if you don’t like it don’t play the game. What's wrong with you?
---
Because they already have your money.
---
My main character will not be appearing any time soon. I'll stick with my new L10 character until I know how safe the wasteland is from hackers!
---
Yeah. Seems to be the only reasonable workaround until they get this issue fixed. This isn't just a duping problem that might influence a few things, this can ruin players experiences. This might break the game for a lot of people.
---
That about sums it up right there.  It's the only thing that makes sense- why would so many find the time to hate on this game ...more than a year later?  It's personal to them because like so many of us ... we just liked Fallout.  Well... and then 76 came around... smh, and some of them just couldn't find the patience.  I still play it, still like it, but damn makes you wonder just how bad Wastelander bugs are going to be.
---
I have a suggestion!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
STEAM ANTI CHEAT!!!!
---
1 hr 50 min until it becomes available
---
Yeah, they have.
---
Right now they just implemented an insurance card at the Atom Shop for 2k Atoms a month for "Wasteland" Protection in case your items goes uh, missing or something...
---
Unfortunately the card weighs 75lbs for some weird reason...
---
Not it isint... it’s more convenient to circumvent. I can spoof my MAC address with software, two clicks and done. I can swap out a new Ethernet pcie card for less than $10 shipped from amazon. I can virtualize my router like I do now. Y’all can downvote me all you want but I’m right. Not my fault this sub became allergic to the truth since it’s a mod curated shill fest.
---
Apparently this is only the beginning of these hacks too, rumours of a character deletion script is being worked on..  I fear for this games future tbh..
---
So far just the PC, but given how utterly incompetent Bethesda are? I wouldn't be surprised if the hack arrives on console
---
I think it's a 1500 damage point minimum.  And the number that is listed as the damage for a particular weapon isn't what actually lands. My primed AA .50 cal is listed as 85 but I've got the numbers showing damage on target turned on and even on a headshot I'm only registering around 17-20. That's a lot of bullets to add up to 1500. Between 2-4K each battle.
---
Money.  They're pushing 'software as a service' that few people want, but it's better for their bottom line (or so they assume).  
---
Plus, the multiplayer aspect makes that somewhat problematic the way the game is currently designed.
---
I think I was playing with Khrill, Doctor D, and RuTHaK the other day, and we kept running into you. You definitely upset Khrill because he couldn't thirst you one round lol. The servers were completely borked that day. We also were hunting for you yesterday, but you managed to dip out, which is pretty impressive. Usually we can follow the invisible players around until the kill window opens.
---
WOW. That's a wonderful build.
---
It will be tested by non-evil hackers once the servers are back up.
---
ok sorry if you weren't trying to be a smart ass. DIdn't check but just assumed you were .. but yeah I did try google, to avoid these types of comments, so apologies
---
It's probably not an automated process therefore it takes manpower/resources to restore an inventory. If hundreds of players now need this service they will have to write a (player inventory rollback) script to pull the necessary data from their database.
---
What does it say in the ToS about refunds?
---
(No, really, I didn't read them any more than most people)
---
There is nothing that can be done. A LOT of people already paid $100 in advance for a year's subscription.
---
the servers are online. im playing. and got back nothing. so it wasnt a roll back afterall.
---
1 hr 49 mins
---
100% true. And yes, it should be more valuable now.
---
Absolutely, something definitely needs to be implemented.
---
LOL wait a second, did Fallout 76 player just try to laugh at some other game? For real, dude, for real? A fallout 1st member? Seriously? Bwahahahaha!
---
Do a rollback.  Its not fair for ANYONE to be this badly impacted.  24 hours will be enough to take it back.  It will not effect too many people too negatively and will remove the ill gotten gains from those cheating as well as return items to those who had their stuff stolen.
---
&gt;compensation
---
Level 200 and I lost everything. 500 caps should do the trick!
---
Thanks for looking into it during the Christmas time. I'm sure the timing of the hach reveal was deliberate. I hope this gets resolved soon. I'm quite sceptical about ANY alleged hack in 76, but this sounds serious enough that I'm staying away from the game for the time being. Godspeed, Bethesda!
---
Totally rumors, and probably completely made up.
---
I dont understand anything anymore.  If itnis really that bad I dont get why I have issues against the mele builds.
---
Not going to log in for a while. Waiting on reddit reports first. Word on discord is that on 24-25 the hackers plan on deleting other people's characters. I don't think it's possible but i guess we'll see.
---
What happened, what did I miss ?
---
It ain't a few when your player base is so low. I'm staying off until it's fixed.
---
See you mid 2020 I guess 🤦‍♂️
---
PC, Adventure, No 1st. A few more "regular" bugs:
---
1. **\[New\]** Flying/stuck Scorchbeast in the Glassed Cavern, supposedly fixed a year ago. [https://youtu.be/V7e9hKlrGtw](https://youtu.be/V7e9hKlrGtw)
---
2. **\[New\]** Orphaned Santatron. [https://youtu.be/cg\_t7NgtK0c](https://youtu.be/cg_t7NgtK0c)
---
3. **\[Old\]** Crafting 1 Bufftats and 1 Psychobuff completes the "Craft drugs 0/5" challenge on their own.
---
4. **\[Old\]** Craft-scrap loop with free steel and no resource loss. With SD, unlimited cloth, leather &amp; steel. Unlimited XP.
---
5. **\[Old\]** Collected all Grognak magazines but the overall challenge is still stuck at 9/10. Must have glitched out a long time ago.
---
6. **\[Old\]** I have an undroppable, non-quest V94 Interlock Key (0.5 pounds) in my inventory.
---
It’s a link... do with it what you want... info is info... take it or leave it.
---
i dont own the game just here for shits and giggles but lol do u seriously think bathesda gives a shit?
---
the game getting hacked by a malicious 3rd party are not grounds for you to get a refund after playing for a year. and how have people who bought items on the atom shop lost items? the outfits and such can just be made again at a workbench. spamming them with tickets demanding refunds is pointless.
---
Cant imagine what kind of people they are in real life
---
"So you're telling me that if you just wanted to go out for a short walk to get fresh air, you wouldn't go because of that small chance to slip?"
---
No I wouldn't because there's ice over the ground? Lmao
---
"You're bending over backwards to prove me wrong and missing the point because of it."
---
Says the one that made a thread to attack playing something as safe as possible as irrational. This just feels like projection at this point 
---
Again, if you think it's worth playing when there's a statistically tiny chance for your stuff in your inventory to get taken sure, but don't sit there and call the better safe than sorry approach irrational just because you think it's worth the risk. This has been my entire point and considering you've already stated your opinion and dismissed what I've said you're not worth my time anymore.
---
I just mentioned 2 games I personally enjoy. I'm genuinely trying to understand why anyone still plays FO76 because all I've seen since launch is game breaking glitches, unethical monetization schemes and security breaches. Why would you continue to play a game that's so obviously broken? I'm genuinely trying to understand.
---
Hopefully, tho with this many flaws in both the game and it's engine, anything seems possible at this point..
---
Same I've been doing the NW grind. Going to finish up the last holiday reward.
---
"Few" players, didn't these guys see that cunt that wiped 500+ people clean?
---
The only place you would have any legal grounds for refunds would be Australia.
---
I thought there was a "refund" movement at the very start. I was under the impression that there was only a limited time to obtain refunds from that moment. 
---
At that time I didn't want to get a refund because I didn't think I would have been able to... (I was dumb enough to have gotten the collector's edition and a download version so $250 in all?? If not more)
---
Great work.
---
Not all landed of course.
---
Fake news😘
---
i dont want a refund..
---
I've been banned on GTA Online because I got money from hackers, so I wouldn't really say it was advantageous.
---
Not to mention the ones that would just break things or permanently keep you locked in a box until you just quit out of the game.
---
Yeah, I think our government probably would since they won't even admit windmills don't cause cancer.
---
The fact that you absolute virgin sadists still play this piece of crap game befuddles the living shit out of me.
---
Ifnyoure on ps4 i could sell you some if youd like.  I normally dont sell reasources but if youre in need Ill help you.
---
I mean Public Workshops, Public Events, Nuking etc.
---
Acting ? Could be.
---
Junkie’s you will receive a +50% Damage boost when addicted to 5 Chems, which is good, especially as you are at full health. My Junkie’s Explosive Handmade does 182 Damage, which isn’t too bad, but compared to a Bloodied Explosive Handmade, which will do over 400 Damage. Bloodied is the best for damage output, but is pretty difficult. Junkie’s is an all-round good build, as you get decent damage, and full health. In my opinion, Junkie’s! :)
---
Players have the ability to sue Bethesda?  For what?
---
Have you read the terms of service?
---
I've used to play this game and I am happy to see it falling apart with all the hate around it because this game deserves it and I have 100% right to say that because I've wasted my money on this crap. The only fun I can get from this game is to see tons of game breaking bugs appearing on daily basis and laugh at it.
---
PC servers are back online but I can't find any information about whether their fix has been deployed. I'm not logging on though.
---
Obviously you can spend your money however you want and power to you. But people also have the right to laugh at you whilst you're helping support what's wrong blatantly wrong with the games industry. I'm not saying that's the right response, but that's how we humans work.
---
If I go and buy a bag of pink floppy dildos then someone's gonna make fun of how I bought a bag of pink floppy dildos. If you really don't care with how people perceive your buying habits then you would just ignore them.
---
how would you get a standard backpack in a single player mode...
---
Oh
---
I hear you. I feel like this game isn't going to survive much longer, which sucks. I really like 76 and would like to be able to play it as long as I've been playing FO4.
---
I mean, that’s a statement literally too stupid to be seriously believed by anyone but okay.
---
Why do people still play this game and support a company that keeps on sucking you dry?
---
Well it's Bethesda... they say a lot of stuff that they don't really mean.
---
I know you probably won't feel like it but I've found the best thing to do when really stressed instead of smoking is 1. Listen to really good angry rock for about 30 minutes and then 2. Go watch the funniest shit I can find on YouTube. Works every time. Good luck buddy!
---
Why are you buying junk?  Just curious. It’s so readily available. Pick up everything, scrap it. Keep what you want, drop or sell rest.   Make sure you tag item you need.
---
The people still playing and supporting this are the reason this has happened. You and you alone have allowed this company to take advantage of not only you but casual players to the point that the company and all hopes for it realizing its flaws have been lost. There laughing all the way to the bank at your expense. Lol keep mods free... fallout first...... makes me sick
---
Got a source for 14000 across all platforms?
---
I gave both games (destiny 2 and borderlands 3) a try and got as far as the endgame but found I was unable to really sink myself into the grind the way I could with diablo, division 2, the rejuvenated anthem, and even fallout 76. The “loop” wasn’t as appealing to me. But I really want to enjoy them. Can you help me?
---
For Destiny, my issue was that the combat felt stale. I’m not a huge fan of first person shooters (or at least they’re not my first choice of gameplay types), and I didn’t feel that any of the weapons I used changed the gameplay overmuch. It always seemed to be variations on how much damage the gun did and how often it shot.
---
For borderlands there was enough variability in the guns to keep me entertained, but as far as I could tell the endgame loop was just fully replaying the entire game, without the ability to go to specific areas or farm specific bosses or anything like that. As far as I could tell, if you beat a boss and want to do it again, you have to start the entire plot over. Did I miss something or is that how it works?  
---
Again, I really want to like those games because it seems like lots of people do. I just don’t understand.
---
Hopefully theyll be able to roll back everyone that was affected, and ban whose who used it, though i guess we'll see
---
Geez, i'm laughing so hard right now. I know it's mean but LMAO
---
Fuck that, if the devs leave an exploit in, it becomes part of the game and its up to the devs to fix it. People shouldn't be punished for the devs laziness. Actual nodding though, is totally hardware ban worthy.
---
Hopefully antisocial basement dwellers.
---
And I mean that in the most sincere way possible.
---
Massively agree, least they can do and to be honest it makes most financial sense for them as it’s either people log off completely and disengage from atom store, or people continue to play with their friends and still purchase the odd cosmetic.  
---
Although please don’t be lulled into the false sense of security that PC or console hackers won’t find their way into your world. Especially those openly posting IGN’s. 
---
It is absolutely possible, as is doing this hack on consoles, albeit with a new set of challenges.
---
Some.youtube video of a hacker saying he did it to 500 people in one day.
---
Says the guy still taking time to reply to a thread about the game....
---
Without a doubt!
---
Ok since you have so much experience hacking and getting around bans, what would you suggest?
---
A few 'whales' will keep it going a while.  But yeah, they way they've structured things, I have a strong feeling it's not going to be around terribly long.
---
This game is one of the biggest disasters of all time. Why do I love playing it so much lol
---
Oh I know they won't.
---
Fat, ugly 40 year old guys living in parents basement? 🤔
---
We have video evidence of ~500 cases.
---
Because we like this game? It's like asking a football player why he still plays after they see thee evidence of long term brain damage to players. Some people really enjoy this game for all the good, they ignore the bad.
---
Remember 24/7 TF2 servers that were free and moddable?
---
It would be cool if Fallout could be like that.
---
If my character gets deleted and supports tells me "oopsie daisy we can't help you." I'm fucking out.
---
How many people still play?
---
Fantastic work! 
---
And I’ll bet somewhere there’s a bathroom with a broken toilet, and you grit your teeth every time you have to look at it.
---
&gt; What makes you skeptical of this?
---
1. math
---
2. the numbers claimed
---
3. the short length of the video
---
4. the fact that I'm not an idiot
---
We need some true hand cannons to make pistol builds viable. Something like a 50cal Desert Eagle would be a good start.
---
It wasn't just a few players affected by this.
---
That is actually terrible and very, very discomforting.
---
Also, @[BeatdownHxC](https://www.reddit.com/user/BeatdownHxC) , is that some kind of other Bodega? BodegaTheKid, his evil twin? I don't even...
---
Apparently you've never heard of Parents getting sued because of their shitty children.
---
stop spamming redundant info...please with sugar on top
---
Im sure you can get karma some other way
---
Yeah he is lol, here he is again, oh and again, and again... and again... spare me pal. I'm exposing this all now on youtube lol, i'm going to enjoy it too. Oh btw, thanks for adding to the video. 
---
What expense? You realize these sized companies have lawyers on their payroll, right? The cost of having a legal department is the same whether you use it or not, so it will costs them nothing extra to go after them, but they will pay their lawyers without using them if they don't.
---
**I am on of those "only a small number of characters have been negatively affected "**. I was at Berkeley station, where i encountered a level 2 player and suddenly everything i had equipped was removed. I might be lucky to get the rest of my inventory , because i carry a shit ton of legendarys to scrip them, so i assume that's why the hacker don't go through my whole inventory, and i didn't lost everything (it's actually also a pain in the butt for me to go through my whole inventory).
---
I think i encountered pretty much every bug in the game since beta and also everyone was annoying, no one interfered with my character progression or inventory. So after an annoying restart of the game, i could continue. Not after this encounter. This is a really new experience to me, it is really game breaking for me and it is really the first time i considering to quit this game. But your comment, with writing a ticket...
---
**You want me to write a ticket to the support? I certainly won't.** I expect you to sort this situation out. If you have to reroll to 22 december and give a hefty compensation and an apology (you fucked up), i will be fine with that. Otherwise i'm going to drop this game and reuse that diskspace on my harddrive for something better.
---
If I see a low level 90% of the time I will give them low level legendaries,ammo, chems what ever i have they can use becouse I assume they are new and I like to help... I have played since beta and a couple months in i still didnt have much until a guy dropped me alot of stuff and that's when i fell in love with this game. So i try to pass that shit on... looking back on it the guy may have been a duper but it didnt matter to me becouse he helped me figure it all out
---
BETHESDA POSTED ABOUT IT IS THIS ENOUGH EVIDENCE FOR YOUR RADRAT BRAIN
---
Wow, the game’s down to 1000 players?
---
The percentage is very low.
---
Fuck these mods, they're all about to get exposed on youtube. Hope they had fun.
---
" a few players losing items that their characters had equipped. "
---
A few they say...
---
Ya I'm sure that's falls under the bullying category and a kid of that age  wouldn't know any better. 
---
If this is legit... That guy has some real life issues and to continue doing it to the same person and posting it is pretty messed up.
---
It's one thing to be a raider, but to exploit and use and abuse  a kid for entertainment value is unacceptable behavior.
---
I'm good with every dime I've spent... Thanks for the concern though
---
Lies. Pip boy returns on reload of a server.
---
Yeah no... doesn't implicate or give any credit to my claims at all... please, NEVER, EVER sit on a jury lol. Get out of my face.
---
Everyone still playing/encouraging that game deserves it.
---
I can't express how stupid it was to make this game use open multiplayer lobbies.
---
Very likely that they have nothing else to do so they ruin others free time
---
He's not accurate.
---
Dear Bethesda:  At least give us better underwear.
---
"That could be abused" they ...
---
And are we just going to ignore that Bethesda was warned about this days ago and didn't do anything?
---
I do wonder how you people get joy following this sub despite clearly hating the game just using it to post random trash comments out of context. 
---
Please explain it to me I am genuinely curious. Is it that you keep subbed in the hope that it looks good enough to jump in, that you just get bored sometimes realise “oh shit I’m still subbed to that” and post your immediate thought, or what? I’m in a curious mood.
---
You'd be surprised. Even large companies usually have most of the senior staff take vacation around Christmas. The poor flunkies that are low on the totem pole are the ones who can't get days off for Christmas, and also can't actually do anything about a situation of this level.
---
Sometimes it easier to go get 10 if you just need a few for something. Saves time and no grind!
---
No, I still blame the tossers who deliberatley set out to ruin the game for a lot pf people regardless of the crappy platform Bethesda has, does not give them the right to ruin the game even more and furthermore to target players who have done nothing wrong and have spent hundereds of hours grinding for the gear they have to see it go in a matter of seconds.
---
No.  That's your client side preferences.
---
Why I hope they are antisocial pariahs IRL.
---
I would feel bad for the physical/emotional assault they'd receive from people IRL
---
No, the .ini files are basically just your ingame options in text form, but you can heavily modify them to your liking, im running different Pipboy, Power Armor Hud and Quickboy colors for over half a year now. Anything you do in the .ini files is save. (if you manage to kill your pc thats on you though, ife been there)
---
Edit: i even played with rendering distances (which does NOT work for NW), its stunning what you can do, but turning anything grafik related over the set maximum will kill your performance relatively quick.
---
u/enseminator evidence since you’re so adamant it doesn’t exist
---
Says its down now, im on ps4 but the thing at main menu says pc is down for maintenance
---
Bethesda is working harder to downplay this and downvote people in this thread than they are on fixing the problem lol
---
They literally just shut the servers down
---
The entire staff won't be gone, it's just all the higher ups with the seniority to snag all the good vacation time windows like Christmas that are gone. The newbies who weren't allowed to take off are still there, but they don't have the power to actually make a huge call like taking the servers down
---
Also, the Invader (alien baton) and the Imposter assaultron head aren't skins, they're new weapons. They have the same base damage of the weapons they're based on, but that's not the issue. The implication of them being separate weapons is that you can't put them on existing (legendary) weapons, so nobody will use them.
---
I wouldn't say this bit is scummy, so much as it was misleading because the alien bundle said nothing about the invader being a *separate* weapon. 
---
However, the other thing that came in that alien bundle, the Captain Cosmos suit, looked NOTHING like it does on the atomic shop. The glass looked so nice and clean that it must have been rendered in a separate program. In game it looked so foggy you couldn't even see your head. To their credit, I think it looks better lately, but it still looks nothing like [this](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/c/c3/FO76_Captain_Cosmos_Suit.png/revision/latest?cb=20190827001459).
---
Then of course there's Fallout 1st, which adds new gameplay features to the game, only available to those who pay.
---
Maybe Bethesda shouldn't have made the game run on the client side :D Without any server side checking, players can do anything. Bethesda's incompetence is caught up with them again.
---
Yea and the bethesda cocksuckers Are downvoteing your comment, 😂
---
same person
---
so much damage an old im sorry it'll be fixed soon
---
I don't think they do. Last I heard, they spent all their money creating Santa hats for the Atom Shop. Man, if only they had the clairvoyance to see this coming.
---
SMH :while wearing a Santa Hat:
---
Yeah, no. My surprise and question was not aimed at you, merely at the video itself. Sure, he can do and does hack, but then people seem to think he is such a honest hacker (after robbing people blind) they take his words for how many times he done it.
---
Its just weird.
---
The changes actually fixed most of the major issues with vats.  VATS was terrible in the previous fallout games because it was an easy near god mode.
---
Idk I like noobz to give stuff to
---
The player base is small, this is a significant portion of the pc player base.
---
Thank you for taking this seriously Bethesda, I know all you guys were suppose to be enjoying the break with your families, it is nice to see that you care about your player base. Just hoping there is some more anti-cheat software you can put into 76 to prevent anything like this happening again, or atleast something to make it harder for the hackers.
---
Wish it was means less stupid people who continue to play after constant abuse from Bethesda
---
Or too powerless.
---
Only on the weak pc on xbox still going strong
---
what are we at now "last nail in the coffin" #163?
---
Pretty sure that hacking is a direct violation of the T&amp;C agreed at download of the game. Violation of a binding T&amp;C can be prosecuted. 
---
And once again, it's not about winning. Just serve the lawsuits and let it play out. Zeni or Beth can afford to put the hackers under the financial distress of fighting against the lawsuit. And this would not be the first case of a videogame company suing someone.
---
The game engine has been in use since 2003, some people know it inside out and mod the game any way they want.
---
Actually your wrong and they can already invade private worlds no citation needed, go watch some YouTube videos and listen! EraticBan the guy that released the script also said private worlds won't keep you safe, NW mode and your stash box is up for grabs!
---
Are you selling any of the extra plans?
---
E.T.
---
So do I 😂🤣😂 but I feel lost when it comes to team related dungeons if you will. I don’t have any friends that play so I can’t do those events/dungeons.
---
They didn't underestimate it. They straight up ignored it.
---
I don't know, 500 players out of a game that has maybe 700 players seems like a lot to me.
---
No, I never played TF2 like that. Lol
---
As someone who uninstalled when it became apparent they would never put their best guys on this game, I have 2 words for you:   
---
HA   
---
HA.
---
More power to you for breaking free of the brainwashing from this sub.
---
Their mothers must be so proud
---
Laugh away! I don't care. May I add, I said I WAS a  a 1st Member. Had it for a month and played it twice in that time. 🤣❄
---
Jesus, mate, your post just got sniped in 15 minutes, that must be a new record. Who is modding this, anyway?
---
Right, being able to see correlation does not imply causation would be not useful at all... Youre blind bud. You see one hack done a couple times, so you call out 4 more. The caps, the get out of my face, why are you so rustled over a game. Its almost like if I told you that Ive been playing the game with the guy since beta and his alt is that level, and his main is the higher level, you wouldnt believe me.
---
When it was just material they gave out materials, which are easily retrievable anyway. Here you have 3 stars legendaries and they cannot just hand out packs of legendaries at random. Escpecially since many got the scrap pack even if they didn't lose anything(like my friend).
---
The gear is gone and i'm not sure they can track what you had.
---
So you want people to stop playing games they like including myself
---
Small pps they have, anger they feel, on children they prey
---
&gt; While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been  negatively affected, we are taking this very seriously and resolving  this is currently our top priority. 
---
Someone send me help I can't fukn break lmao
---
&gt; that's still a small number compared to the player base
---
Uh . . .how many people do you think are still playing? That's a VERY sizable percentage of the current player base. There's at most a few thousand people still playing, one video from one douche alone was over 500 people which would be 10-20+% of the player base that's still active on PC.  
---
The forums are on fire from all the people who had their gear stolen, it's far from a small number (even percent wise)
---
The game won't die. Whales are a thing but there are also people willingly supporting bethesda bullshit by paying more and more for this broken mess. Whatever happens, they will just continue to pay, no matter how low bethesda falls. I did not understand that on F76 launch and i thought game is going to die, but it had been a long year that has proven me so damn wrong. People will not stop paying bethesda for creating more of this mess.
---
People would have to be stupid to reward Bethesda now for their incompetence.
---
I have no doubt that many in this sub have done it.
---
they can steal everything, even from your stashbox.
---
Your not going to get a lot of kudos from the community but thank you for addressing this as soon as possible.
---
&gt; EraticBan the guy that released the script also said
---
Ooh he said, he said. A troll typed some words and you got scared. Good lord stop being such a coward.
---
**16 times the detail!**
---
Yeah, people said the same about this hack. And it was true.
---
i have an alt thats only purpose is holding plans, food, water, and ammo and stuff for new players. im going to be busy when wastelanders drops i guess
---
If you don't care what I think then why are you responding?
---
I've had this happen 3 times twice yesterday and once today it's really annoying. I also had all the workshops so it's definitely to do with having them all because I've spent 5+ hours on a private server before and never has it shut down but when i start doing workshops to farm santatrons i get shut down imminent with a 20 minute timer.
---
&gt;A few players...
---
Few: a small number
---
[I think it's more than a few.](https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk)
---
Dunno what you are going on about.
---
I play both. Whenever I feel like playing one or the other.
---
Once you lose your virginity, you will also reach this point of mindfullness when you start doing shit you enjoy. Rather than complaining about your 8 dollars.
---
how likely is it that those guys were bethesda shills trying to cover up their fuckup?
---
I am polite
---
Crap, I think I just saw a hacker steal this OP's post.
---
This is just one single exploit. It's not going to be the last one. This is what happens when a lazy/cheap developer decides to use an inappropriate, antiquated in-house single player engine and make it multiplayer on a rushed schedule. It's not enough to slap some netcode into it and call it a day. This game is dead, because Bethesda have become lazy, greedy hacks as a company.
---
None of that is an answer.
---
1. Math is math(insert Mr. Incredible meme here). Video games are video games. There’s no math involved here as far as I can see. Please explain how you are using math to refute this video.
---
2. Did you watch the video? I will confess that I didn’t go through and count every single player, but he’s hitting a lot of groups at events or camps. Maybe 532 is a little high, but it’s still a huge number of players to lose everything on their character.
---
3. Again, did you watch the video? It’s literally maybe 15-30 sec clips of him walking up to players and taking their stuff. The video length has nothing to do with it, I can edit a full movie into a 10 min summary if I really want to. You may not see the boring stuff in between, but you will still get the important part.
---
4. I would argue that you being an idiot is not a fact, but rather just your opinion of yourself. And even if it is true that you aren’t an idiot, that has no bearing on this discussion.
---
Did not play that one I’m a newcomer honestly , but I feel it would be a good way to keep things fresh with old weapons and would be a good way to say let us be able to grind an ammo type plan that would essentially add another star to less than desirable rolls , make it a quest line or faction specific function with faults etc
---
"No I wouldn't because there's ice over the ground? Lmao"
---
And I would call that irrational fear.
---
"Says the one that made a thread to attack playing something as safe as possible as irrational."
---
Again, you demonstrate your lack of comprehension. My thread was made to encourage playing something as safe as possible--  "be practical, protect yourself, stay informed". I as discouraging not playing at all, if the reason is because you're fearful of something that is very unlikely to happen (particularly if you, again, are practical and protect yourself).
---
You're way too happy to oversimplify and misunderstand a short post with a clear message. I'm done with this one.
---
If your idea of a game is to constantly try to nickel and dime you, while not addressing all of the issues of the game that they themselves created, then have fun.
---
I think the dude is in Russia. Not much they can really do.
---
"First time considering quitting the game" I'm sorry but I just don't understand how can this be the first time you considered quitting the game after constant abuse from hackers and Bethesda I'm not trying to be rude I'm just what to know why? Why do you stick with this crap game and even crapper developers?
---
Good I'm glad.
---
Only on pc
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.
---
You are assuming certain things.. this could be a paid team on an advertising / marketing hit job.
---
I don't play this game, I just watch videos on it from YongYea and in his [video](https://youtu.be/0PDh4IL1rmM?t=212) he said Bethesda is aware of it.
---
Cooler than getting shit stolen.
---
Idk man, I used to agree with this. Then I got back into gta right before Thanksgiving. With a sensible business setup, I have played casually and made 25 million without spending a dime.
---
I'm still going to buy there stuff on xbox
---
You expect Bethesda to do something and show any sort of integrity??
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
No lol since day one all platforms. The game was never even completed lol I have not even played it cause I refuse to even buy an online only game and this game has entertained me since day one.
---
Probably get you banned for participating in a hack
---
Bethesda: “we’ve done all we can.”
---
Uhh for you know delivering a BROKEN product you cannot denie this game is not functionally broken
---
It's the holidays my dude, ain't nobody working. Why aren't we talking any shit about the hackers releasing this stuff, _clearly_ when it's going to take the longest to fix.
---
Spamming huh? Ok... report post to admin then and stop harassment which does violate group rules. 
---
You can also scroll on but here you are once again... go figure...
---
Even if they fix this hack, there will be more. The fact that this game is so exploitable by anyone with a bit of modding or coding know how is disturbing.
---
Haha, I didn't bother with a true bathroom. The broken toilet wouldn't have matched the rustic feel so I threw down one of those camping style poop seats outside and left it at that. xD
---
Or his hands so he cant do this shit (or use a computer) anymore.
---
Alternative: 
---
Step 1; find the nearest mellee or ranged weapon, preferably silenced, and destroy said authorativ figure and workers (they could be scorched) 
---
Step 2: run away from mental institute and return to Appalachia to destroy said irradiated bats and undead humans.
---
That has been going on from the very launch of the game, there is no reason really to expect it to stop.
---
Hold up... can’t you just craft a replacement atomic shop item at a workbench if the one you had on you got stolen?
---
These are alt-accounts just letting you guys know, they aren't stupid to use they're main account to get caught. At the same time, it's easy to say its the hackers fault for doing this but they got in it so easily since well, bethesda used a decade old launcher made for singleplayer games and tried to make Fallout 76 with it. Plus the people supporting bethesda to act like this, they deserve this punishment for supporting a scummy company.
---
This should absolutely be a crime.  I'd rather someone steal a $100 out of my pocket than steal hundreds of hours of grinding.
---
There is nothing morally wrong with what he is doing. He is not hating on the game just for the sake of it, he is hating on it based on verifiable information. "He has no actual clue what he’s talking about" is a total misrepresentation. There is nothing inherently wrong with making money off trends either.
---
Would be completely fine if they actually knew what they were talking about. Gonna name drop here, most of the time angry joe reviews anything fallout 76 related, he uses footage from beta/launch and they don't seem to actually know much about the game. Pretty sure they said some rather inaccurate things about the latest few scandals but it's been a while so I don't remember specifics. Don't watch yongyea, but if it's the same scenario, definitely should just stick to talking about things you actually know about
---
Exterminatus.
---
\&gt;be practical
---
\&gt;protect yourself
---
The only way you can do this is by either playing in private servers only or not playing adventure mode at all. One of which is an option not available to most. But then you call it irrational to take the only sure fire method to protect yourself for most people which is to not play adventure at all. At least next time put at least 2 in your intelligence stat before projecting.
---
Fisto's.....100s and 100s of Fisto's.
---
Wastelanders will never drop - don’t you get that by now?
---
Why? I still agree with OP 100%. A faster reaction and an official warning / better communication from bethesda would have spared many players a lot of inconveniences and frustration.
---
the video released earlier proves that it isn't a small amount of players...
---
I dont have to eat shit to know that it will not taste good.
---
Neither does someone have to play the game to recognize that Bethesda is fucking up massively.
---
I for one enjoy this latest entry into the saga that is the failure of 76.
---
People around here are something else for sure. Normal people don't do that.
---
the catch 22 is not that, the catch 22 is: you either have a open source engine or you have a multyplayer game, you can't have both if you don't have a good anti cheat engine, this game does not check if you mod any thing thing in the code it just assumes that what you have is 100% legit, in a multiplayer game that is a big no
---
Goddamn free range quest and having to switch from the shepherds crook back to my actual weapon only to find I’m unarmed or using some random legendary instead.
---
 Can't wait for the new hack to be released :)
---
It's as safe as it has always been lol. I will be sticking to private servers for a while.
---
That is fucking stupid and doesn't work
---
I’m not sure how trustworthy player counter is, but they claim, at the moment I’m posting this, that 32,000 people are playing fallout 76 across all platforms.
---
Not use a faulty single player engine that’s vulnerable in the first place.
---
Shut the stable door before the horse gets stolen,
---
I’m no script wizard but I modded games in the 90s and learned how things are done server side vs client.  The big games like UT, Quake, Doom, Helen, etc. reserved important decisions like movement, hit determination all done by the server. When I saw the coding on fo76 it was shocking to see what they let the client determine.  I can’t fathom why unless it’s less of a server load e.g. the server requirements are much less doing it their way thus making them cheaper.
---
Victim shaming. Have we stooped this low? _You shouldn't have been wearing that._
---
Interesting question - be good if a single player was released and you could roll your stuff over into it.
---
Though BGS have a single player now and get to charge people a monthly sub so they won;t give that up.
---
I have First myself and it's ok - though you wonder how long the game will go on for.
---
You are right. Everything is perfect in Fallout 76! No issues, no controversies, certainly not hacking or exploiting!
---
It truly is the game of the decade.
---
For certain items, when I want to stock up, I’m willing to drop some caps. Especially if I’m near max caps. 
---
Ballistic Fiber I’m willing to pay 5-8c per. 
---
Steel?  I’ve got 10k+. I’m good on that.
---
It all depends.
---
It's also illegal in the united states. Unlawful acces to another computer. The way the mod target your direct system, allows for removal and deletion on the victims client side is what makes it illegal. 
---
It's a federal crime. It's pound-me-in-the-ass-prison levels of time someone will end up doing.
---
"A few players" 
---
Yeah just a few...
---
Both at the same time :-)
---
Try it. It can be great fun.
---
I play it together with my 9yo daughter and we always have a blast :)
---
Have you even thought that despite how messy the game is at times, that we enjoy the world of Appalachia?  
---
Have you thought that over the time spent in game, we've forged friendships and camaraderie along the way?  
---
Judging by the nature of your response, it seems that you haven't. If anything, you are merely 'stirring the pot', as it were. If you don't like it the game, that's fine. But you have no right to tell people what is right and what is wrong.
---
Well, believe it or not, they have laws in Russia too.
---
If there are five people in a single area you can rob five people in less than a minute. Getting to 500 in a day is not out of the question.
---
Why because people have fun still
---
Oh cool so you're his buddy in the video then? Why didn't you just say that? It makes perfect sense you would shitpost on his behalf lol, tf out of my face. LOL, well played.
---
And the funny thing is that their servers are pure crap anyway.
---
Game is utter shit. It looks and play like a 2006 game and its full of bugs. Without fanboy glasses you can't judge that game as fun/good.
---
I’m not familiar with the website, but they say 32,000 people are playing fallout 76 at the time I posted this.
---
No, not after a full year.
---
Mirror?
---
A troll lol EB is the hacker that's been supping the code for months now... You need to spend some time researching before opening your pie hole!
---
Getting that sweet holiday overtime pay tho. Can't speak for whoever it is, but I have nothing to do, I'd love to have some work this week instead of spending 14 hours a day on pokemon
---
I have not ment that the game is not broken and has issues. I mean that most of them are only blaming bethesda. Is bethesda a hacker or exploiter? No
---
They love to complain.....
---
Pure and simple. What makes it worse is they are complaining about a friggin video game.
---
Nothing says you have your priorities straight more than raging about a game.
---
Bingo. 
---
When I was working in a certain industry (not video game related in any way) I was named on a lawsuit as part of my company. Big company X was suing us over something frivolous that they would never have won. But we were in their market segment, and we were a small company who was gaining steam and eating into their potential stranglehold on the market. So they sued us (and about 10 other companies right around the same time). Why you ask?  To slow us down. They tied up large portions of our working capital in legal expenses because  they could. They didn't win the lawsuit, hell it didn't even make it to court. 
---
But it still slowed us down a bit (admittedly less than they were hoping for)
---
I mean... i like seeing shit die really slow in video games... Blame the Matrix.
---
But here's the question: what would they sue them for? Violation of TOS?
---
&gt;Why is everyone blaming bethesda while it is not them who try so hard to find new bugs and exploits.
---
yeah, that's kinda the issue now, isn't it?
---
I know of a certain group that are certainly having fun!
---
Deleting other players' inventories, yes, but having fun!
---
Sooo judging by votes most players side with the frikking liberators.
---
Nice meeting you outside of combat 😂 but I hate running into your group in NW.
---
I like the game a lot, what can I say? I've never had as much fun with a game as I do playing 76 with my squad.
---
Lol. 2 karma.
---
I mean, I play every day and it’s definitely got a lot of problems. They just need to keep fixing it often
---
Nah, that aint me. But I do know them. And like I said, I didnt defend the hacking, I defended you claiming the level difference was fishy.
---
Considering they are already working on a fix? Calm down, and give them a bit of time.
---
It's what was said, but not what was shown. And by Bethesda's statement, it looks like, as I said, it was only equipped items.
---
Maybe they'd planned to release the hacking tool in multiple parts?
---
Both Bethesda and the hackers are to blame.
---
But a billionaire company shouldn't be this sloppy.
---
They could do that and it would do nothing, the hackers don't care and some might consider it a challenge to develop a script to bypass the anti-cheat system, just look at fortnite, has a anti cheat system aka battle eye, still had hacker problems
---
&gt;Why is everyone blaming bethesda while it is not them who try so hard to find new bugs and exploits. 
---
...Yeah that's kind of one of the problems. Bethesda should be trying very hard to find these issues themselves so they can be proactive, instead of just sitting back to rake in MtXs and let the community bug test for them, while paying for the privilege to do so.
---
Also please forgive the people who may not be actively playing this game but still feel bothered by it, it's maybe a bit disconcerting to them is all to watch the hollowed corpse of a once-loved IP paraded around and jabbed with sticks while charging onlookers high prices to gawk at it, is all.
---
Lots of people seem to want others to stop playing the game they enjoy.
---
They need another hobby.
---
lmao the absolute state of f76 hackers , even if they weren’t chatting complete shit , they’re the ones sperging out over a game on Christmas Day .
---
If you consider corruption apart of their laws, Yes.
---
Nice work!
---
If that's the case, then maybe not in that specific instance. But he isn't the only one and they aren't all in one of those locations.
---
I come back every now and then for new content, hell I do that for a lot of games out there. Don’t matter if the games bad or extremely generic, just gives me something to do. I actually quite enjoy fo76, really hurts that it did so badly.
---
Dam.. how much sleep have you lost over this?
---
Nah, the hacks use other software to hijack messages sent to the game or modify running values. The .ini uses preapproved parameters for the game, the worst that will happen is you get janky graphics or framerate issues
---
Average age in here is 11.
---
My daily smokes costs more than the game. But for most people here it is a fortune ssince they bought a 8$ game with their monthly allowance
---
Only a small number of players have been affected? No. The entire community has been affected! 
---
 What about the video of ONE GUY doing this to 500+ players? Only a small number of players have been affected though I’m sure. 
---
 What about the vast number of other people too scared to play the damn game out of fear of getting targeted? Only a small number of players though I’m sure.
---
Stop with these bullshit copy and paste answers where you downplay the exploited vulnerabilities that YOU refused to invest in the countermeasures to prevent.
---
 Hold your hands up, stop these things happening every week and COMPENSATE YOUR EVER DWINDLING CASH COWS. Everyone in that studio and especially the higher ups should be mortified that something like this has happened YET AGAIN. And you should be BEGGING what’s left of the community to give you a millionth chance.
---
 Pathetic excuses and incompetence = the foundations of a lasting game.
---
This takes away one of the most popular endgame activities.   
---
Hanging out in Flatwoods, Overseers Camp, or 76 entrance to give goodies to newbies fresh out of the vault. 
---
At lvl 265, I wont help a mid 100s, or even someone 70+.  They have the ability to help themselves.    Lvl 2-10 though, they get stims, armor, weapons and food/drink.
---
If you experience based balancing for server populations, then this endgame endevor becomes extinct, and we cant help the newbies anymore.
---
Once you get a girlfriend you will also reach this point of mindfulness when you stop bragging about losing virginity.   
---
As for your money or your games, I do not care what you play or what you pay for, as long as you do not try to laugh at some other games while playing one of the silliest ones. I am not fond of you paying Bethesda so they would not have to improve their game nor their service or attitude since that goes against my desire to see the game improve, but you are free to do so, you are also free to play whatever you want to play, I could recommend you to play something else instead, but no, I am not the one to command you.
---
Okay but I can understand why playing Football would be enjoyable so that's maybe not the best analogy but that's really beside the point because my initial question was directed at the dude that said he's waiting for something better to come out and he plays out of sheer boredom. I asked why he wasn't interested in other games and I named 2 examples.
---
Yeah let’s impeach these sons of bitches!
---
Let me say this first, the bugs in fo76 are awful. I think that the amount of them and lack of content / fixes agaisnt hackers has been terrible. But I also think that if they are still working on Wastelanders I feel that it really will be more than just npcs. I think this game gets a lot of harrassment when I can point out games like athem or ect. That go under the radar. Bethesda is a pretty small team for triple A titles and so the efficiency that they have on patching things compared to lets say activison who has a team of just under 10k is a LOT less. I also believe people don't understand the difficulties of patching games and coding in general.
---
Bethesda, please just rework your game. Just scrap it, make an actual functioning FUCKING MULTIPLAYER GAME, and then maybe, JUST MAYBE, we'll forgive you.
---
I agree with you it's the dumb ass hackers that have want to ruin other people's fun. That's why I would say they need cross play only for xbox and ps
---
For the thrill....
---
I play daily and get a lot out of it. I appreciate your concern for others though.
---
Once you get enough levels swap them out or don't  run them on a slightly bloodied build, or as damage is taken they will kick.  Like any build you don't have to run a full min max meta build all the time.
---
What category under support are we picking. Wtf
---
Bethesda Goodwill has been drained completely.
---
It is one mess up after another....
---
In a span one year, YongYea has made 35 Videos on FO76.
---
Where did he spawn exactly? I've been hopping looking for a new pet and want to make sure I know all the high level random spawn locations. Thanks.
---
The fact that clients even have access to the item data of other players and can just tell the server the item is in a new spot is astounding. The lack of security for what is supposed to be an MMO is incredible. This isn't just a back door someone forgot to close; this (along with the spawning hack) shows that the security measures for FO76 are borderline nonexistant.
---
There's talk of the next step being hackers jumping into private worlds. But if you ask me, I'd be afraid of them discovering a way to force other clients to execute arbitrary code. Losing in-game items is bad, but getting malware from an insecured MMO is worse.
---
Hmm. They are? The hackers are? I see users here saying it and I see some attacking Beth and promoting other companies games.. I see a shit ton of those. Chewlys Gum motherfuckers.
---
Yeah I *do* know this. I just love having my camp near Whitesprings station, people pop in and out and use it like an actual store and I don’t see that anywhere else. Upgraded to some turrets like suggested and boxed in my generators. Let’s see if I can get rid of these pesky house gets. Thanks for the response dude.
---
"The only way you can do this is by either playing in private servers only or not playing adventure mode at all."
---
Incorrect. The majority of players continue to play unaffected by this, and I've seen posts from people saying they were hacked but lost nothing important because they put away the good stuff. It is factually possible to play the game, be practical, protect yourself, and either not be hacked or lose nothing important.
---
To clarify my position,I don't think everyone who chooses not to play right now is irrational. It really depends on the context, but bottom line my message stands: Don't let irrational fear of possibility override rational awareness of probability. If one person looks at the situation while keeping a clear mind and then chooses to stop playing, that doesn't mean they were automatically irrational about it. You're just assuming that my advice about how to approach the problem is black/white in its outcomes, and I can't help you with that.
---
Its not their servers, its Amazons.
---
Take a picture of yourself naked without a pipboy.
---
We warned you. But you chose to support the broken game anyways. These are the consequences.
---
Because if this type of behavior increases a company's profit, then other companies will begin to emulate the same type of behavior because they know that can make tons of money.
---
Damn right I'll keep playing. It's had a rocky history, sure... but I wouldn't give it up for a lot of the great people I've met playing this game. The game as well as the community is what keeps me playing this game even through all of this.   
---
As for ***what I do with my own money***, why should you care? I'm not telling you how to deal with your finances...
---
red dead 2 has performed great on high settings on my getting older 4770k and 980
---
Agreed, I think BattlEye tries to combat kernel level exploits, but patching should be the primary goal.
---
Cannot do that atm with my arm broken, and also, not a big fan of battle royale, maybe one day with my own 9yo daughter, or with my niece in a couple of years ;)
---
Cheap Amazon servers, you are correct.
---
Could you please explain your point here?
---
Thats a cute thought, bud HWID is easily spoofed, and anyone who does this regularly, has access to these tools, or designed these tools, will be able to counter an HWID ban fairly easily. Just saying.
---
LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.
---
I find this hilarious. I hope this kills the game.
---
So basically if it's not happening to you it's not happening at all? Other players having their game ruined does not reduce your trust in the company that causes this simply because you got lucky?
---
Bethesda would have to prove some type of monetary loss I would assume. Which probably isn't easy to prove.
---
Gunsmith?? what a waste.
---
"Fuck all my items!" "Yeah, fuck all my items!"
---
Bethesda isn't the victims the players are. You shouldn't have been playing that game.
---
Doesn’t surprise me, unfortunately players left alone to long and bored cause all types of mischief. Bring back on Survival mode so they can all go back and grief all they want there *LOL*
---
Because money, this game was meant to be a Fallout cash cow like ESO and they plan to milk as much cash as they can from it. They can't do that with single player as it dosnt work well.
---
And even if they did the game would not be good, this is a multiplayer game with challenges meant only for groups. They can't and won't change the game to fit a single player experience.
---
" which may have resulted in a few players losing items that their characters had equipped "   
---
\*\*Looks at over 500 reported affected players with some having their entire inventories stripped not just "equipped" items\*\*   
---
Uh huh... Nice job downplaying the situation. 500 individuals is a lot more than a "Small number".    
---
Ah well, at least Fallout1 and 2 will keep me busy till they figure this out.
---
Tbh I'd wager that not a single Bethesda employee has *not* heard about this problem now.
---
1-3 months of fallout 1st free, maybe an additional atom compensation, and some in-game scrip/cap packs. Either an extension of the holiday event or just give everybody a bunch of holiday gifts. That's of course on top of restoring items to the best of their abilities. Oh, and actual consequences this time. Ban everybody cheating instead of giving a handful of people slaps on the wrist. Making it a #1 priority to ensure something like this doesn't happen again would also help
---
&gt; Dude, are you seriously claiming that YouTubers made those hacks in order to make videos about them and stir up drama?
---
That's a common claim around here.
---
All this to have them just try and sweep it all under the rug "try and compensate"  Watch them offer 10-50 atoms... get F$cked bethesda you are truly the worst.  Ive lost hundreds of hours of work
---
Prove to me that whenever he makes a video about FO76's broken bullshit that he's clueless, ill informed and is spreading misinformation?
---
Prove to me that the Power Armor helmet that Bethesda included within the Collector's edition has no risk of molding and being hazardous to your health?
---
Prove to me that Bethesda does not focus more on the MTX rather on the game itself?
---
Prove to me that the players that bethesda banned aren't actually banned?
---
Prove to me that the current exploitation of player inventories isn't going on at all and that it is all just a hoax created in order to make the game die out cause of lack of support?
---
I have many more questions, but you will probably not be able to answer them all because you seem more clueless than Yong.
---
***&gt;inb4 resorting to calling me just a hater and telling me I'm just bandwagoning the hate train***
---
These people aren't using an exploit left in by Bethesda, they've actively \*hacked\* the game to deliberately hurt the player base. They hold the majority of the blame.
---
appalling incompetence is all the same whether it's running a company or a country. my reaction will be no different: gawk in sheer anger at how bad they let things get.
---
and judging by your logic I'm guessing Bethesda could just delete everyone's saves and leak their credit card info because "it's just a game bro lol"
---
Jesus christ man. Are you being a dummy or just dishonest?
---
Heres some reasons:
---
- You have a better version of the item.
---
- It doesn't fit your build.
---
- You have a surplus of an item.
---
- You already have the plan/recipe.
---
1 hr 14 mins
---
ok thanks for letting me know.
---
Im always at max caps...I buy lead, acid even steel at times ....I need to spend caps to make room for more caps lol
---
It would require completely reworking the game from the ground up. 
---
Also... talk about boring.
---
They buy a thing KNOWING it is broken. No complains!!!!!!!
---
and please u/bethesdagamestudios_, make sure IGN: grushnak ( u/Bodega177013 )or IGN:bodegathekid  ( u/90smemelord )  suffer for what they did to the community, thats the guy that did this video

So because I give Bethesda *my money* in order to play a game ***I*** ***enjoy***... I deserve to be punished?  
---
... Are you even *hearing* yourself?
---
Yeah so destroy other people having fun because:
---
1. Its easy
---
2. They have a personal vendetta against a company.
---
3. They are obvious assholes.
---
Which one sounds like the correct reason for the active FO76 community???
---
"A small number of characters."
---
.... youtubes video of over 512 players being hit by just one hacker
---
Send me a request when you get on
---
No, because the first I heard about these hacks was the place they were having discussions about them being created.  The *only* place I've heard about deleting characters is on reddit.
---
If you watched the video it shows that it takes about five seconds to rob someone, which is a far cry from a minute.
---
They can't do any.  Peer to peer networking is the devil.
---
The only reason modders can't permanently steal your inventory or vehicles in GTA Online is they were smart enough to keep the inventory / cash server separate and that game is a modder cesspool.
---
There's no way they can be smart or fast enough to write a whole new server code to manage inventory stuff in Fallout 76.  Welcome to the end of the game.
---
if you let a company step all over you then you send it (and others) the message that it's OK to treat customers as cattle.
---
Nobody should ever maliciously harm your personal enjoyment. 
---
But if it's someone's job to report or make videos about gaming news, then that's not necessarily "hating", that's simply stating facts about the next screwup. Think about the non-stop chain of fuckups, lies, hacks, bugs, or the monetization, and tell me this isn't worth making videos about? 76 is a benchmark of how much shit a gaming company can do and still get away with it.
---
Be careful where you draw the line, because some of the arguments you make empower the "them vs. us" mentality which breeds the exact toxicity you disparage. Worse, you'll also start discarding legitimate criticism of the game and its place in the ecosystem.
---
Well said.
---
Problem is one can easily spoof hardware IDs such as MAC addresses.
---
The majority of people I have encountered have been nice. I also always try to help out lower level characters but sometimes they run away. xD
---
Bethesda's incompetence beat them to it.
---
Bethesda could I please get my character transferred from PC to PS4. I want to start playing on PS4 but I don't want to lose all my progress.
---
[https://imgur.com/a/B4zBYdB](https://imgur.com/a/B4zBYdB) thats him
---
it's almost like non-dedicated servers should be free to avoid this.
---
Whilst I don't appreciate other peoples fun being ruined, I can kinda understand why they're doing it. They're frustrated that this what their favourite franchise has boiled down too. Fallout 76 is addictive/fun, but also a blatant cash grab that demonstrates typical greed in the games industry with players lowering their standards for quality by willing to support it.
---
Hundreds of thousands who "OWN" the game.   
---
\*\*Checks various sites for updated active player count\*\* Lows: 22,000 - Highs: 34,000 Estimated.\*\*

---
no, he lives on the eastcoast, heres his username  [https://imgur.com/a/B4zBYdB](https://imgur.com/a/B4zBYdB)
---
Because Bethesda is equally or more to blame in the situation. Other games also get hackers, it's inevitable, but exploits are so incredibly rampant due to the games incredibly old and basic engine with no anti-cheat measures and often go unfixed  for long periods of time, such as Nuclear Winter basically being unplayable with the amount of hackers, that's been going for months and Bethesda doesn't react and apply anti-cheat.
---
The hackers are shitty people - yes, but Bethesda are definitely not the victim, the player base is. If anything, Bethesda are the bad guys, because they were payed to give a service, part of that service is security and protection, and they have failed incredibly again and again, due to them trying to save money by cutting corners in coding the game (just porting all of fallout 4) and having in adequate amount of people working on the game (updates are far between and leave many bugs, exploits often take weeks to fix, and don't get started with their non-existent customer help and pr team)
---
Its like a broken record.....
---
Look. Bethesda is not doing this on purpouse. And they try to fix all of this mess.
---
Let them go at it.
---
Need to get rid of the leechers.
---
All companies get hacked.  Because Hackers tend to be ahead of the game tech wise.  
---
Companies have an entire cyber security department for just this reason. 
---
Good coding, top end tech, and a good cyber security team didnt stop Amazon, IBM, Verizon, Comcast, AT%T, ect from getting hacked and losing billions of accounts worth of information.
---
You guys dont rage about that like you do this game.  And they are much more integral to a working society than some pixelated weapons and food.
---
As far as I can tell, folks were enjoying the game for over  year before the hackers showed up...
---
Well you are not normal either. You obviously don't like the game, but have been commenting a lot on it in the past few days.
---
Well, yeah. If you purchase something, and someone just takes it from you, it's theft. It doesn't matter if it's tangible.
---
I see people are divided on where the fault lies, and most people make good points, but I don't understand why it can't be both at fault. 
---
People suck. They will always suck. If there's ever an opportunity, there will be someone there to exploit it. We should all know this by now. They're douchebags, and I agree that if you steal something, you shouldn't be able to justify it by saying "well they made it too easy to steal". That wouldn't cut it in a court of law for anything else, so I don't know why it would cut it here.
---
However, Bethesda has an obligation to do their best to prevent these things from happening. It's happening with their products, within their product. It's not like if you withdrawal money, got it stolen while you were out and about, and started blaming the bank for it.
---
It's up to them to defend against hackers. We should expect quality security from any company. The game has been out for little over a year, so I see this as a ridiculous oversight, and they should get some of the blame. 
---
As a player, it is not your job to be paranoid about getting shit stolen from you within the game. That's what I call a "bad experience".
---
So now that you're factually wrong, what are you going to do about it?
---
Can't wait to never claim my free 500 atoms because I'm never playing this game again
---
Just google ”fallout 76 cheats”, some forums could be found before the mediastorm about the subject. I’ve been reading stuff for months just to know what to stay away from lol
---
We haven't tried anything and we are all out of ideas!
---
Or here is an idea. Take a sec to calm down read Bethesda's response and let them fix the issue. Bethesda didn't take your items an asshole hacker did and for whatever reason people leaving the game is what those hackers seem to want.
---
HAHAHAHA now you can actually spend your time getting a job!
---
Yeah I almost hate to be that guy but until this is costing them money, they'll only do the minimum to put out PR fires and that's that. 
---
Quite frankly if I paid real money for something online and it had shoddy security resulting in the loss of my item due to hackers I would be wondering about legal action I can take. 
---
Seriously, if you want any corporation to change it needs to affect their profits.
---
First you will need to submit an essay describing the event in detail and what was taken.
---
Yep I dont even play 76 but I come to see this fire that wont stop. I do feel bad for its players though
---
🤡🤡🤡
---
So, wait a minute... I've enjoyed the game since Beta. So am I a liar? 🤔
---
1. The video did not show anywhere near 500 people getting robbed.
---
2. Estimated amount of people playing right now is [around 28,200](https://playercounter.com/fallout-76/). While not a huge number, if they got reports that 500 people got robbed, that's only 1.8% of people potentially playing. Of course, not everyone who got robbed is playing *right now* and not everyone who plays the game is playing *right now* either. But, you get the gist. More than "a few thousand" still play and a report of 500 people, hell even 1000 people is still, statistically a small number of people.
---
The echo chamber of forums concerning the game make it seem like a more rampant issue was taking place. Even if it affected everyone on PC, that's only around 30% of the player base, which it did not.
---
I am in no way downplaying the severity of what happened, but let's be real, everything about Fallout 76 is blown up to huge proportions. Remember when everyone was losing their shit about one friggin' guy losing his stuff in the Vault raid? I hope everyone who lost even one item gets reimbursed and compensated for this. It's a trivial move by Bethesda that they have shown that they can do, at least in a limited capacity.
---
Pointing out the obvious, systemic flaws in a corporation's product isn't victim-shaming, and i'd argue it cheapens the very idea of victim shaming in the first place. That's like saying we can't blame Equifax for the massive breach of customer data that they caused, because it'd be victim blaming.
---
It was likely just edited to slice out all the scrubs with nothing on them robbed.
---
First off, it's hard as hell to implement anti-cheat software in games running on an engine designed for multiplayer. Take the ancient(by computer definition) engine 76 is running on, which was most definitely NOT designed for multiplayer, and it adds a few orders of magnitude to that.
---
they're not being incompetent on purpose? doubtful, considering a skilled professional is more expensive than an intern.
---
and they're not fixing anything. bugs from the beta (and Fo4) linger to this day. they're simply reacting to bad PR.
---
I don't know. I hope people that got affected by any major problem will get their games fixed. And that the hacker's get sued. I don't feel like doing what the criminals wants me to do.
---
I'd stop playing the game if it wasn't fun for me anymore.
---
How can we strive to build communities?  We can barely put camps close together
---
And yes, you may get the legendaries you want with enough time. But then you can change build, or become a merchant and start selling.
---
I'm not blaming the players I'm simply saying bethesda owes them nothing. You have the choice to play this or any other game.
---
Happens the most to me in scorched earth and with all that is going on all at once, the last thing you want to do is pull out an empty heavy weapon that takes forever to reload while the queen, a death claw, and a yao guai attack you from all sides. Damn, shoulda stayed in the vault this morning...
---
That was \*ONE HACKER\*.  There are hundreds if not thousands of hackers using the exploit.  YOU do the math.
---
You sure about that?  I am almost certain I can make it ..
---

Right! Such a good community overall, pretty much everyone who I run into is kind and generous in their own right. Was hoping to get in on the caroling, I fuckin love caroling. Maybe next year!

Imagine trying to compare losing virtual toys in a video game to sexual assault and rape. As a survivor of both, you should be ashamed of yourself, you giant manchild. lmao

They are most definitely doing it on purpose. They started to focus more on profits than on customer service. They are only fixing things that they know hurts their bottom line.
---
Bethesda: Here's an idea.  
---
Base Game = Singleplayer Worlds.  
---
Secondary = Multiplayer Worlds both Public and Private.  
---
You SP world is not affected by the MP worlds.   
---
MP worlds have separate character slots from SP world.   
---
You can host your SP world for up to 12 friends via Friends Only ALLOWED drop-in or Invite.  
---
Since you'll never implement Anti-Cheat that works properly you may as well go this route so people can actually enjoy the game with their friends or solo without the risk of a hacker fucking up everything.
---
Bethesda can neglect Fallout 76 and still get money from it - player criticism and changes are ignored, or patched up with a small band-aid. That's why people make fun of people that bought this game, because FO76 players can lick unwashed boots until they're polished to shine. It's unbelievable that any of you still pay money for this game, despite its practices.
---
I still haven't seen any work done to fix or compensate any of the players that have been hacked. It's the holidays, sure, but it doesn't mean anything because the game should've had protection from these types of exploits from day one.
---
Bethesda you deserve this, I hate that it comes at the expense of players but I really genuinely hope that you suffer tremendous financial harm and layoffs for willingly being the despicable money grubbing scum that you are, I hate all of you for what you did to the Fallout universe, and I hate all of you for not handling anything that you do with the slightest bit of professionalism, \*\*\*\* all of you right in the eyesockets, die in a fire \*\*\*holes
---
And why should I "stop fanboying"? I've enjoyed the game since Beta, and met some great people. What exactly is wrong with that? 🤔
---
The naked festivus
---
Honestly it would be best for Fallout and the world if they'd put the game out of it's misery and stop embarrassing themselves.
---
Sorry the remaining die hard fans are down voting you.  Here, have an upvote.
---
There's a lot more nuance to it than what you are saying. I think it's a pretty fair assessment of FO76 compared to what other AAA games offer that Bethesda fucked up big time with the Fallout series. From the lack of content/NPCs at launch, the multitude of bugs/exploits and micro-transactions for items that were *free mods* in older Bethesda games, the nylon bag controversy, and with Wasterlanders/FO1st asking for even more money, you have been getting charged more for less.
---
Nobody cares that you're having fun with the game. The problem people have is that supporting this game sends the wrong message to Bethesda and the rest of the gaming industry. The publishers only want to make money, so when FO76 had a really bad launch and Bethesda starts charging for features that were free before, they're going "Oh, since we have enough people like shoe\_owner still playing and buying FO1st subscriptions and Atomic Shop items, we can still turn a nice profit while improving very little". It continuously validates Bethesda to be less consumer friendly with their games in the future.
---
Let's talk about YongYea. I think his videos are definitely biased, but he's not targeting the FO76 community and he's not wrong about the game's problems. It's very obvious that he's trying to hold Bethesda accountable for what they did wrong with this game so they don't ruin the next one. The majority of people don't like FO76 with good reason, plain and simple. It's fair enough if you like it, but there should be no reason for the next Elder Scrolls/Fallout game to end up like this one.
---
No but ill check there for you whenever i go back. And you can just have it if i find it and you are on xbox
---
Man, I can't wait to watch the world burn when someone figures out how to pull this off on a modded console.
---
I'll admit it's intimidating being around a super high level player.
---
the difference is that they didn't make it easier for the hackers.
---
&gt;Companies have an entire cyber security department for just this reason.
---
bold of you to assume Fo76 has a department like that considering, well, everything.
---
Fuckin edge ass cringe dude
---
Wait they're giving us 3 weeks? Wow
---
Just like inventory steal hack, right?
---
Feel like the compensation is gonna be atoms, flux, or vault steel. Maybe presents but I don't think anyone would actually hope for that one lol. How many atoms did you get? If it was 1650 exactly it's probably your F1st
---
Yeah I was talking to someone who was selling explosive legacies on an app for 20 bucks each.
---
I legitimately don't understand why people still play this game at all. Its so broken.
---
A few my ass
---
Look how they massacred my boys..
---
As J. Peterman once said - "hmmmmm nahhhh..."
---
Let's make this an airing of grievances post
---
Nah, I'm good
---
I can only speak for myself but in this instance, I feel they really do deserve it. I had a quick look at the code used the exploit and while I don't know what all of it is for, I can make some reasonable guesses and tldr; looks like there is no server side validation being done...like at all! 
---
It's like if you left the keys in your unlocked car. Yes the thief is at fault but your insurance is not going to pay out on that! And if it was your friends car - I imagine they would be pretty pissed at you too.
---
How do I get to level 2?
---
It was a bunch so I assume 1st.
---
But I can't remember what I had exactly.
---
I will be when I have room for the caps. 👍
---
Username checks out?
---
I play almost entirely solo, but really enjoy the occasional interaction and group events.  I would not have put in nearly as many hours in an offline single player game.
---
Fuck no. Let them have their 60fps porn party.
---
Meanwhile, I'll jerk of to the items in my inventory
---
maybe hundreds of thousands own the game but actually play it? I'm plying it for a week now and tbh I already see so many familiar names and there are always like max 10ppl on the map at all times it really makes it feel so empty..
---
Just keep it short and brief.
---
Nope, that wasn't even new.  And pretty much all one hack (versions of the same injection).  
---
Deleting someone's character or getting into private games has nothing to do with that code, those are more than just a variation of container hacks.
---
Today is the 23rd, so probably Fallout 1st atoms if you bought on day one.
---
GT InfamousTube013, I'll add you later
---
They made a game with no anti-cheat go for full price, they lied about the atomic shop, they lied about the bag, they made that nuke-dark thing (that got delayed), they delayed just about every added content the game has to offer, they ruined PvP, they haven’t done anything to stop NW hackers, they “fixed” several with a solution that made the game buggier, they promised more communication and never delivered past the first few months, they keep making bugged events/quests and do nothing to fix the existing ones, they lied about a canvas shortage, they made a subscription service that broke their last few promises and made the game ptw which was fully based off user suggested features, they keep doing maintenance with no communication until the day of, they don’t give support basic dev tools in the case of things like this hack or the scrapbox glitch, they made an item that gives you every resource in the game (even vault steel) if you bought their subscription before a certain time, they keep making limited time offers in the atomic shop to milk more money out of people, they only release the best stuff in the atomic shop at the last minute, their support staff takes days, if not weeks to respond to your tickets, and that’s all just off the top of my head. But no, Bethesda is the victim, they didn’t do anything.
---
Oh I used to like the game. Back in Wild Appalachia I thought that Bethesda had finally started to make things right. But boy, was I wrong. 
---
Sorry that a little bit of deserved criticism about your precious vidya makes you uncomfortable!
---
I sent in a $2,000 invoice for 30 min of work. 30 min of work. I am way more important.
---
Impacted? My wife and I are afraid to log in because we don't want to lose all our hard-collected stuff.
---
How about just dropping the price for FO1st? Seems like that's the 'fix'.
---
I saw one video of like two dudes who claim they did this to over 500 people in one night...
---
On which legal grounds though? Maybe it's possible in America but I don't think many countries have legislation that prevents this type of action.
---
Can you not accept that not everyone plays the game like you?  
---
I dont have a "build", end game items dont have a better version, hense the "end game" bit of it, if its surplus it goes to a friend and plans and recipes get sold by me for pittence or given away.  
---
We dont all play this game with the intention of rogueing people out of money, some of us are more than happy to just give things away to help other players.  
---
Doesnt make me a "dummy" because I dont extort money from other players, and im not dishonest since for 1 example of this is a few months back I had a few tenderizers (which could sell for thousands) and I made a post here on reddit to just give them away, I actually braught a lot of those tenderizers too from player vendors just to give out.  
---
I do not focus on money
---
The PC players who take ever opportunity to bash consoles? I feel bad for them, but they already drew the line of separation.
---
People downvoting simply would like to put their head in the dirt and pretend that Bethesda isn't the greedy lying and manipulative it truly is.
---
Weird kink, but ok
---
A better FFXIV route would be for ya'll to stop giving this company money and come play FFXIV instead :)
---
I know that and do it regularly to stay updated and safe, but this isn't how it supposed to work.
---
Huh?
---
I don't play this game at all, I just watch the videos from YongYea, and boy what an absolute mess. Not only if Bethesda aware of this, but they don't even shut down the servers??   
---
They need to shut down servers asap, and do load up backs ups before this hack went live. Also, I really hope they compensate you guys. At this point, as an outsider looking into this game, it's been an absolute train wreck... 
---
I can't help but think, "*Bethesda, stop already. pull the damn plug."* However, for the sake of everyone who enjoys it, I hope things turn out better.
---
I don't know......
---
You are right, Bethesda is perfect and *everyone else* is to blame!
---
Thank you, sir, I have finally opened my eyes to the undeniable truth.
---
Good point.
---
just laughed so hard lol
---
I know folks that play NW daily, and they say the number of hackers is vastly blown out of proportion and seems to be "fear-mongering". I don't play NW (don't like PvP), but I trust their opinion. What "unfair advantages" are you talking about? Survival tents? Scrap boxes? Unique outfits and two dances?
---
Also... If you dislike or even hate the game so much... Why "waste" time by posting in here?
---
Patch has dropped and servers are back but is it really safe?
---
Must've been one hell of a blow job
---
Yeah what?
---
Stealing people inventories in a game you can't even kill and loot people, that's a major fuckup they literally added a hardcore rust mode to this garbage game.
---
Agree with that lol
---
Thanks all, I’ll double check I can xraft heavy varient then off to try my luck... appreciated..! 👍🏻
---
People are expecting premium support while no one is playing for it.
---
Aside from shutting the game down for good and rebuilding it from scratch on another engine, there's not much that can be done. If Bethesda doesn't do something radical to the game, worse exploits will follow. Just you wait until someone hacks in Fallout 4-style VATS, with time slowing down and whatnot.
---
I legitimately don't understand why you care what other people play. It's so pointless, and just so trivial.
---
Thx, I’ll give it a go...
---
Stockholm syndrome is a hell of a mental disorder. How many will still find a way to defend this? I hope that many will break free from their captor FO76.
---
GAHAHAHA now get a job ya filthy animal!
---
Trading. Trading. Trading. 
---
I’m addicted.
---
I’m so jealous, this is fuckin gorgeous
---
Yep, I’ll check plans and give it a try... thanks.
---
And that's not counting the people, like me, that stopped playing before anything happened to them. We've also lost potential atoms and hours of fun...
---
Paragraphs.
---
Cheers..!
---
It's a circus at this point everyone knows this is a sloppy garbage game and no one is surprised this is possible, just another nail in the coffin of a dead shit game, another nail among thousands.
---
I were one of those people, when they announced Fallout 76, that knew, this was a big mistake by Bethesda. They have no previous experience making online games, and even their offline games still riddled with bugs and glitches(Skyrim for example).
---
&gt; No Witchhunting. Do not ask users to go after other players in game. Do not accuse players of cheating, use Bethesda's official support here. Do not name in shame in general.
---
Hmm...
---
You're lying!  Everybody else on the whole freaking internet knew about this two days in advance!  There is literally no excuse for waiting this long.  Any reasonable person would have taken the servers offline as soon as that first forum post went live.  Or the first youtube video went live.  This isn't explainable as incompetence anymore.  Bethesda chose to let this happen.  There's literally **no possible way** that they're so out-of-touch that they missed ALL the warning signs.
---
Ah ok sorry :P
---
Elite is great though. Just compare them to Beth: they are giving away "atoms" everyday until Christmas, for like two weeks, in crescendo.
---
Today I got 400 'atoms' in their game just by logging in.
---
I know I'll never see Beth doing that.
---
For the record: I've tried to like 76 for what it is. And I made it.. 
---
But even though they erased the karma system, Karma is all that's happening to them.
---
Saddens me, but I go and make some popcorns at the same time
---
;)
---
or just shut the servers until this was fixed. Tbh I think they just crossed their fingers in hope that it was just a joke or something
---
The underwear fetishists are getting very creative !
---
Nothing you are saying makes any sense. Your saying you have a job and made 1k today? What does that have to do with fallout?
---
I’ll make sure I can craft heavy then try it... cheers..!
---
**One** hour doesn't seem like enough time to fix multiple issues along with this major/ glaring issue and the fact that bans have been given to people recognizing cheats but not to people who use exploits (multiple youtube videos of proof exists). You promised to be more transparent yet aren't at all.
---
Good luck going after them if they are outside Western Europe &amp; North America.
---
 "While we’ve determined that only a small number of characters have been negatively affected" 
---
I was one of those "small number of characters". I lost my whole equipped gear and some weapons in my inventory. I honestly didn't reall mind the duping stuff, but this time affecting directly my stuff and inventory. This isn't something i can shake off easily. After getting rid of this situation, there has to be a really hefty compensation. For me, my inventory is a sacred haven, that is something which belongs to me. After someone did meddle with my stuff in game, i feel someone broken in my house and i can't have that feeling.  Right now the trust in the game is gone and for me it really needs some big steps and a compensation, to rebuild that trust.
---
doing pvp and get griefed are 2 different things
---
I see the point and it is a very interesting one. But thats very expensive and an extreme calculation. Furthermore it is still a bit apples and bananas compared. 
---
For me. Fallout 76 (2 account, 1 tricenntenial) 120 chf. 200 hours played. (0.6 per hour) 
---
 I share netflix and amazon with my girlfriend. Thats a total of 320 per year. Lets say also 200 hours (1.6 per hour). Ok, point still made...
---
And now it gets interesting. Fallout 4 (goty) 69.00, 840 hours played (0.082 per hour)
---
Time to try the blindfold shotgun approach again!
---
...just saying maybe you shouldn't have banned that exploit finder
---
They did, it was Fallout 4. This sub is for the online, multiplayer one.
---
It costs, in sweden (can't run any other example cause it is the only market I am familiar with) roughly three first subscriptions to get one hour of work put down.
---
I don't think anyone would hate that idea
---
I'm not calling you sad, but that's sad that Bethesda has basically gotten you addicted to the video game equivalent of heroine.
---
Ah yes. The ever-convincing "you disagree with me so you must be DUMB" retort. You sure got me thar, nyuk-nyuk. I'll just go back to courtin' my cousin and makin' sure my family tree doesn't branch... 🙄
---
&gt; put a lot of time into this game suffer 
---
Obviously not the devs but the management that decided that rather than spend money making a decent product and finishing it they kick it out the door and hope normies gobble it up without too much fuss.
---
Bethesda stole people money and lied to them.
---
Well I guess we cant all be a "distinguished engineer" can we, most people on this planet follow the chain of command and the chain of command dictates that shit flows downstream
---
&gt; "A few"
---
So that was a fucking lie.
---
okay, whatever, i dont know you, but as far as i see, it gonna stays like this. :) Bye.
---
Why are you saying like me? Its the only thing that keeps people in the game after they've done everything. Its still a part of the endgame, even if you take no part in it.
---
Trading is now extorting money according to you, lol. I'm done here, you've proven your dishonesty.
---
For any sensible human being, that's a lot of players.
---
For Bethesda, it's a few.
---
Bethesda is not perfect, but to blame them for a malicious attempt to destroy their game.
---
This episode falls squarely on the hackers that have broken the rules, violated federal law (hacking is a federal crime as it uses federal infrastructures to commit), and completed malicous acts just for the sake of being mean and ruining someones experience. 
---
When a psychopath shoots up walmart, walmart doesnt get blamed.   When a drunkard causes a wreck on a populated highway, the road is not blamed. 
---
Why are we blaming the medium instead of the criminal who commited the act?
---
This is a statement post. Not an English exam quiz
---
No
---
No probs. Stay safe out there. BGS claims to have patched the inventory hack until it’s proven hackers can’t steal your stuff I’d stay on private servers. 
---
Steel be with you my friend!
---
It might die if Wastlanders is a bust. I played for a while but left, had a good group of friends I played with that still play today. The are waiting for Wastlanders and if it sucks and is buggy, ifnits not the magic wand that will fix all the problem like Bethesda claims it will then they will quit and so will other.
---
Wasterlander is the turning point were we see if this game can be salvaged or if it was empty promises .
---
This is a statement. Not an English exam
---
That makes no sense whatsoever. How exactly does this help? Hooray solidarity but it's not a problem on consoles.
---
Why in god's name is this post getting gold and silver and elf awards or whatever when Bethesda did NOTHING TO STOP THE PROBLEM IN THE FIRST PLACE??????
---
Like I said, both are to blame.
---
With all the bugs/glitches hacks and whatnot it’s still a fallout game, I’ve spent countless hours in fallout 3, fallout nv and fallout 4, loved all of them and fallout 76 is still a fallout game from its SPECIAL system and weapons to its vats I just love the game and there isn’t anything else that can give you the same feel
---
It’s more for me than it is the game
---
Better than taking drugs and drinking my life away. This was I have a clear head for my family 🤙
---
It's fun.
---
Here another honestly concerned question for the O.P. - Why do you continue to hang out in fallout 76 subs if you dislike the game so much.
---
I'm also an Outsider but my guess is they either already put so much time into the game that they think they need to justify the time by playing a more of it or their fallout superfans, and are the kind of people who even played Brotherhood Of Steel.
---
You have your opinion, other people have theirs. I enjoyed the shit out of fallout 76. Dumped loads of hours. Even with the glitches and exploits, still had loads of fun. To each their own my dude. 
---
Oh. Don’t forget all the destiny glitches that are currently unaddressed. And the ones that took a whole season to fix. Pocket finishers took an entire season to fix. Just gonna yeet this raid boss clean off the map. Lol. Wishender is still doing absurd amounts of damage. People are still getting practically infinite amounts of special ammo (couple this one with with a tractor cannon and it applies to heavy as well) Doomfang pauldrons are giving back far more super energy than intended (allowing for absurdly long supers in crucible in the right hands and outrageously long supers in pve activities) And it may be semi rare, but people are still using hacks in crucible activities. I’m sure the fella that lost a shit ton of glory to a teleporty boi with tractor cannon ammo at the beginning of a survival game thought that was inexcusable. 
---
Games have flaws. And people with find ways to exploit those flaws. Just the way it is. Just all about what you enjoy and what you’re willing to put up with while enjoying it.
---
Whatever, you the one proudly flying a "raider" tag so it speaks for itself i guess
---
i'm in no rush to get back online just to find out it's [not](https://i.imgflip.com/20744h.jpg)
---
Im not defending them.  Im asking you why you are blaming the victim for someone elses crime. 
---
Bethesda is just as much a victim in this issue as we are.
---
Just checked and I did get my monthly atoms.
---
Far as they're probably concerned, this will probably inspire more people to invest in Fallout 1st and make them more money.
---
You're wrong though. The 50% reduced durability loss on automatic builds is def not wasted.
---
I highly doubt there are only 700 players for an international game. I believe the player base to be 25000-50000 across all platforms.
---
That gave me a good laugh I thank you good sir
---
Though it had a rocky start, the game, as it is today, is far from a "buggy mess". It's STILL fun to play, barring hackers that mar pretty well most titles out today. But there will ALWAYS be hackers...
---
Not the United States I'm sure that everyone had to sign in an EULA before signing in that you cannot sue them.
---
It's... funny. Simple answer. I log on and play. check what to do: a queen? Project paradise? Someone launched a nuke on Whitesprings, let's go to destroy some ghouls. There are no problems big enough in 76 to keep me from having fun (except the current hacker problem)
---
This is my first post here.
---
Haha, refunds. This is funny. Should I ask a refund from Nintendo because my Legend of Zelda battery died and my saves from when I was 12 got erased? Or should I get a refund from Microsoft because the name I used for Xbox Live in 2003 isn't recoverable since they updated they whole system when Xbox 360 came out and I didn't play Xbox then? No, because that's all dumb. You bought a game a year ago, a month ago - whenever. You paid for the game. Nowhere on earth would you be entitled to a refund because the game got hacked. You clearly don't understand the definition of the word fraud.
---
And how did people who bought things from the Atom shop lose money? They bought items, they still have access to said items... I don't understand that.
---
Suddenly the “Raider role players” don’t seem so bad huh. Now yall got a real fuckin problem to deal with. F
---
We dont need no water, let tje motherfucker burn. Burn motjerfucker, burn. - bloodhound gang
---
I am saying that the costs an actual business has, are crazy compared to the average a customer pays.
---
In the end, a customer pays 3$ to travel with the vehicle, meanwhile, I have to pay for employes extra cause it is the day before christmas, and on top of that, our customer has to pay for it all.
---
Jusy wanted to point out how ridicilous it is to demand anything out of a 8$ game.
---
I honestly love the franchise and I want to see it grow. The game itself is fun in my opinion. If you're looking for a more traditional Fallout experience you're likely to be disappointed, but I'm hoping wastelanders changes that fact. I have my own issues in this game but I also see the potential in what it could be which is why I still play this game.
---
The bombs dropped... now let's wait for the dust to settle. Let's others out outside first.
---
You can do exactly what you are describing without legendaries as well. As far as building communities goes, I don't mean camps, I mean actual player communities, in your instance, a trade cartel as an example.   
---
Any MMORPG is eventually going to end up thin on content because players devour it at such an insane pace, all that is left at the end is player developed content.
---
Considering how long they've known how easily corrupted the Creator Engine is and how often people have taken advantage of that engine over the last year, you'd think they would have addressed it more aggressively before now (Assuming they're actually addressing it aggressively at the moment at all). 
---
Guessing there's some fool at Bethesda thinking that this will give them a great boost in Fallout 1st sales.
---
Yea because NPCs have feelings right. Im such a bad person for having the raider flair.
---
Even if we can’t use characters on custom servers. We should be able to make custom servers we can mod and stuff. Basically like ARK: Survival Evolved. Have the dedicated servers hosted by Bethesda and let us make our own that we make new characters on and we can mod to our content.
---
Fellow wasteland era, do not turn your backs to those that mocked us, they are still our brothers. Alone cold,naked out in the wastes. Now is the time to embrace them with warm hearts. We all travel the same country roads do we not? Let he who is without rads throw the first stone.
---
You sure are. Then you realize why demanding instant support for a 8$ game is ridicilous?
---
$90 game at time of purchase.
---
When a post has more comments than upvotes you know its spicy
---
No. I know for a fact that they were provided with full description and a fix before the public hack release.
---
I dunno, targeting Bethesda for being lazy and stirring up THIS much of a shitstorm is probably great way to punish them for their greed and hubris. I paid fill price for this horrible mess of a game, they illegally refused my refund. This might be the closest to justice I can get. :D
---
"Stealers of Appalachia"
---
Only problem I've heard with this argument is not everyone is in the know how about this hack. So they might load up into public servers instead of private worlds and still get their items stolen.
---
This sub is for the fallout game that sucks and is full of shills that accept a fundamentally broken game. 
---
I.E the people who support BGS through all this bullshit are morons
---
You didn't present any criticism, just plain negative ccomments.
---
And it is not my precious "vidya", when the fun stops I'll jump shiip and never look back. Same way I did with other games in the past, unlike you.
---
It’s all relative. 
---
500 out of 500,000 players would be 0.1%. 
---
Is 500 a lot?  If you’re talking about raindrops falling on your car, no. Bricks falling on your car?  Yes. 
---
They’re using standard corporate diplomatic language. Out of everything they said, that one word isn’t what I’d focus on.
---
So some 500+ people is a few people?
---
It is just criticism. Which is not bad, since outside of fallout there is criticism in most things. Everything needs criticism in order to make improvements. I love fallout but this game hasn’t been great (at all), and it is really damaging the series. And I know most people see it that way too. 
---
Fallout/Bethesda has made lots of terrible decisions in the past year (which doesn’t need to be explained since we all have seen consumer protection bureaus after them from screwing fans over), and they have not taken into account a lot of the criticisms, but they expect different results to suddenly pop up. The only real improvement they have made is adding human npc which has not even happened yet. But their real focus seems to be on the atomic shop and not fixing errors in the game, which makes customers frustrated and feel like they are being scammed. And people do get frustrated with active players since it feels like they are enabling Bethesda’s behaviour.
---
People would just ignore the game if they didn’t love this series. Many fans like me love the series but hate this game. It lately seems like they want to make a quick buck, and don’t care about fallout at all. Which is really disheartening, since many of us grew up playing this. We just want to see improvements, and it is frustrating since that might never happen. We want to see fallout succeed, but it should be because they made a great game.
---
This is more for me than it is for the game. However tonight I can guarantee multiple players getting cool shit instead of losing it. That seems to be a good counter balance in my view
---
Have you actually seen the video. Did you actually count 500 people losing their items or did you just read and comment and run with it.
---
go fuck yourselves LMAO
---
....what?
---
Yeah, but those people suck in their own right.
---
Jim and Yong are a blight, Legacy is okay, he means well but repeats himself a lot.
---
Mine need washed. Been wearing them since the war started.
---
Just don’t play and you can’t drop your stuff, that’s how we did it lol
---
Bye Felicia
---
Who's th bigger morons? The people who just play a game, or the people who come into a forum dedicated to the game and complain about the people just playing a game?
---
Sounds pretty stupid to me.
---
Never did I think there would be a game company with shittier customer service and stinginess than Jagex. What a time to be alive
---
Need to remember that as the day haha thank you
---
Don't get surprised how quickly they figure out games though once you try.
---
Almost like it is more intuitiv for the Younger crowd.
---
You honestly think that only 5000 worldwide (with 7.6 billion people) play Fallout 76 on PC?
---
well again what they should have done was either shut down the servers completely until fix was implemented or give everyone access to private server for the time and shut down only adventure to prevent any damage but yeah.. I'm glad I'm not at home this week or it could have hit me too..
---
At the end of the vid he put text over the screen saying he stole from 531 people in one night.
---
I will still play. Even if it’s with benchmade gear
---
Always does
---
Fuck them, we should be allowed to name and shame cheaters. Especially after all this bullshit.
---
Exactly. 
---
You just made my point. People who experienced enough issues to have them rate at a 3/10 are some how more justified than the people who experienced less problems and rate it higher......
---
And what issues do the console versions have?
---
Make sure to compensate people that lost paid for items with 500 atoms.
---
Someone give this man 500 atoms, STAT!
---
I play this game once or twice a month. I have never paid a penny toward it beyond the initial cost of purchase. Can you please explain how I'm "enabling" by intermittently using something I already paid for?
---
And even that is is in bethesdas favor. Bethesdas game simulations are generations old. Some indy games have more complex and stable mechanics in the background. Fallout is very static.
---
It's a love-hate relationship. It's one of my favorite games but I also completely agree with most of the trash people talk about it. The game really does have potential, if bethesda would get their head out of their ass. But unfortunately I've watched, and played along, as every "improvement " made gameplay worse. That being said, I enjoy the fallout concept and 76 is the first online multiplayer game that I've really gotten into.
---
I feel so bad for the people that lost their stuff... that said..
---
They aren't going to upload the video of the whole night of them stealing 500+ times. They made their point on how easy it is and just summed it up. All they are doing is running up and using the hack. How many people can you visit in a few hours of playing a game? It's not hard to see its possible.
---
Do you really need to see the guy steal 500 times to believe it? smh
---
So, wait, are you intending to insult PC Users, Fallout 76 players, or some odd Venn diagram subsection?
---
Why do people play any game? Because they have fun playing it. I don't understand why would anyone have to justify why they have fun.
---
why are you hear just to make a shitpost
---
Oh so now you talentless fucks are fixing this. Maybe you should just stick to making singleplayer games and not money milking machines that stupid people can just ruin with hacking.
---
Lmao you are fucking scum. Wasting time just to spread hate like a real dick head.
---
Why isn’t this dude banned?
---
Still nothing. Divide it with the hours you played. Then go drive a go cart for 12 minutes playing 50$
---
Yes. Games must require a beast of a PC that pushes performance standards visually to be "fun"
---
how do you find out about such things?
---
This is one group doing it for jollies, and then some cool kids wannabes will join in which is a problem but not thousands.
---
I came from YouTube video holy shit I've never seen this kinda of stuff happened to any game, actually robbing people without them being able to do anything damn.
---
Bet ya this user isn't a console player.. bunch of Chewlys Gum reps in this bitch.
---
There is a huge difference between financial fraud and losing some items in a game.
---
Unless of course its paid items.
---
I smell a synth
---
If I'm not mistaken, isn't it a federal crime what these guys are doing?  They are stealing paid items from other players.
---
wat
---
A big part is because it is Fallout.
---
I have always loved the series, and played Fallout 4 for more time than I have been alive. However, until I get a PC, I can only play 4, though I have no desire to go back (until I can mod it with PC). I love the late game, but all of my saves on PS4 have lots of mods, and I wanna play vanilla. I don’t feel like playing through the whole game again.
---
I actually love Fallout’s images and world more than the games themselves. I have a bobblehead collection IRL, and a Nuka Cola lunchbox. Even when I’m not playing Fallout, I’m often thinking about it. That keeps me with the series.
---
I often don’t play 76 for long stretches of time. I completed the main quest, and don’t like grinding for legendaries. If I get a two-shot explosive, great. I’m not searching for it though. When I do play, I have a blast. I’m building my CAMP, or playing Nuclear Winter.
---
A big part of Fallout 76 is its world, and it’s my way of playing Fallout until I have the full series on PC. Mostly, I’m just holding out until Wastelanders. I had taken a long break, expecting it to come out a couple of months ago, but seeing as it has been delayed, I’m just hopping in once in a while for the free rewards, the limited time events, and to visit my post-apocalyptic, cozy, small cabin in the Appalachian mountains.
---
Curious how  you went from one of the most lauded companies ever to one of the most disappointing and mediocre ones. It took you DAYS to respond to this, to even give help to those of us who still believed in you.  
---
Never had I ever felt so betrayed about buying something from you all -- and yet here we are. But never again. Not even for Elder Scrolls VI.   
---
Goodbye, Bethesda. For good and forever.
---
500 atoms and MAAAAYBE one month of fallout first
---
So, easy answer. Do not play.
---
there are better was to show your dislike of the game instead of stealing from players that are having fun
---
The game is fun. If you compare fo76 to others fo, you have more activities and loot to farm. If you compare fo76 to others survival games (like ark, rust or Conan exile), the game (seriously) is more stable and the community is more healthy.
---
Some people just like the game.
---
I've met some.
---
Send nudes PLZ
---
But what'a fun about it?
---
Fallout 76 is a joke. Just....stop. You're making it way too easy. Please, Bethesda.
---
Fallout 76 is the "gift" that keeps on giving.
---
If you go through the trouble of making a statement you could try to make it less intimidating to read he’s sayin
---
I don't think there is a proper way to have compensation for a hack of this kind (and I haven't been robbed by anyone as I quit the game as soon as it was known and/or just played NW). I mean, they can give us all the scrapbox and I don't think they actually can clean the stain this hack is. Just saying.
---
Just shut the game down, refund everyone, and start development over. its the only way this train wreck of a game will ever be good. It worked for ff14, and there's maybe a 1% chance it will work here.
---
I think this might be the best answer I've received; series passion can go a long way towards helping you enjoy an otherwise very flawed game, speaking as someone who loves Dark Souls 2 besides its... MANY many flaws and justified criticisms.
---
When they finally start losing money which will never happen so long as some people stay in this abusive relationship sadly.

I play for a week and already recognize few names which I see over and over again which is kinda strange providing I'm not friends with them and there are multiple servers, right?
---
It's a good game, I play it for a year but I don't play as much as most people (I'm at university and I have a lot of other games to play as well, so not much free time)
---
b-but it's just a game. there are more pressing matters in the world, like climate change.
---
we should never care for anything other than the absolute top priority. I mean, screw Earth, it's a lost cause anyway. let's focus on Mars.
---
I wish
---
I wonder if y'all still consider pc the elite master race lol
---
Instead,  craft good gear for new players.
---
Trust me I regret buying this game, but considering I only spent $2 to buy it I’m not regretting it that much, plus the stuff I got is a buddy’s who wanted to stop playing as well lmao
---
Exactly it is the principle, and how it feels like they are scamming the consumers (which is why there have been lawsuits filed and consumer protection bureaus after them). I just want to have a good fallout game be released again. And this game was not it. I love fallout, but this game was not good and we should be criticized so we can see improvements in future games. 
---
Also I know it is just a game, but I grew up playing fallout. My mom died when I was a kid, and playing video games was the only consistent thing in my life. I want fallout to succeed but I want it to be based on merit.
---
Yes. If there are 30,000 people online at once out of a pool of 500,000, then 500 is a small number. 
---
Assuming 500k still play.
---
No, I will replicate the hack
---
Correct if you assholes wouldn’t buy this shit off of eBay their wouldn’t be a market for the hackers to sell so blame your self go earn your shit
---
This guy is absolute scum, but the comments on the video really angers me. There are people supporting this-- It's so frustrating and terrible.
---
And the conclusion is that a man that steals from others is so trustworthy we should take his word for it? Really? 
---
I just might be damaged from working 20 years in a jail, but thieves are not the paragons of truth people who watch this video seems to think.
---
Oooh you can really feel the salt in this one, I dare not waste a minute to upset a salty fanboy
---
But that already happened...? bethesda was warned over a year ago by devs and modders fo76 was hugely at risk and Bethesda laughed in their faces. 
---
So when someones already been warned and chose to do nothing how is that still not their fault??
---
I do that often, but tonight I will replicate the hack
---
My question more stemmed from the various issues and controversies the community has been battered with since day 1, rather than any actual game flaws. That wasn't terribly clear in my post though so I edited it to reflect that.  
---
Though, I would like to hear what your favorite things are, I'm intrigued!
---
You don't have to play this game every day to know it's a steaming pile of shit.
---
It’s not the community as a whole but a very loud subset that promotes the toxic vibe. A lot of members are very genuine and supportive. Especially on the F76 related discord’s. 
---
Don’t get swept up in the negative toxic vibes. Focus on the positives I say.
---
\&gt; few

[1 hacker 531 players](https://youtu.be/Xehnhq38EHk)
---
Hahah game was trash the first day it was released, who gives a fuck now.
---
It took them less than a day to patch it, after it started showing up in-game, and all people do is complain about the semantics of the announcement. Do you really wonder why they aren't more involved on this subreddit?
---
How is that a bullshit response lmao? You're saying if the game was properly built and secured this would still be happening?
---
Literally look in my comment history, you reddit tards really can’t take 2 minutes to just look... smh
---
This
---
They were warned about hacking a long time ago, and were warned about this hack before it happened. They should be closing down the servers to fix the issue.
---
Is the cheater one of Putins boys?
---
There will still be more than enough people to pay for it. I was totally sure this Fallout 1st was going to be a flop since game is still at terrible state and everyone had left it after this year of nonsense, I could not imagine any people would even play the game at this point, but boy was I wrong, there are a lot of people who are happy to pay for Fallout 1st no matter what. And its gonna persist.   
---
Yes, a lot of people change their mind constantly, even since beta when I've started to criticize the game on official forums, people who've argued with me and called me brainwashed hater had one after another joined my cause saying "now they see" the same things I've seen since beta, it happened at every of those turning points, yet when firs came, it has been a huge success for Beth. Wastelanders will be a terrible mess just like everything before that, but people are still going to pay. Mark my words. It never changes.
---
At least you can burn coal
---
Because I like the previous games and have a shred of hope they will fix this shit show they call a game. 
---
The entire experience is broken (accept for the atom shop). The game is so damn predatory and begs for money but offer no kind of fun or positive experience in return for spending money in micro transactions. 
---
The people who support and partake in this are idiots, especially when there are a ton of other games that do what bethesda is attempting so much better and do not beg for money in the process just so this project can stay afloat.
---
yeah, lol, and the Titanic had "slight water damage."
---
Nah. They died because 8$ broke their bank
---
Any time.
---
Same. I tried the private but... it's lonely. If I want to play alone, I open Fallout 4. In 76 I'm alone but there is always something new: a low level stuck in whitesprings, someone that launch a nuke on the queen, a stranger that come in my camp, wave me, check the vendor and go away. It's more satisfactory
---
That black market you speak of is literally in the open, entirely.
---
I watched a video about it as well and had a good laugh.
---
the US Government was warned about September 11th.
---
Whats your point again?
---
A warning that a crime is going to happen doesnt always prevent the crime.
---
I knoq you are trolling, but I legit feel bad for the devs. It just seems like main studio, daddy zenimax, the freelancer coders, the yong yeas and us the community as a whole just throw a curve ball at them each time.
---
Yeah, i would like to play the game offline
---
So, serious question. How does it benefit you to see others in a bad situation?  I’ve never understood that point of view but am curious. 
---
What do you get, tangibly, out of witnessing the misfortune of others?
---
I agree, but they choose to exact revenge on the players that they feel are aiding in ruining the franchise for them.
---
A crime isnt require for a Hardware ban?
---
&gt; in one video it shows 570 some odd players losing all the items they're wearing/carrying. 
---
this is how disinformation spreads.
---
Lmao ones in real life with usually very real physical danger thats potentially life threatening. 
---
One is just losing hours of work on a video game. 
---
If you seriously still think that then oh boy friend you should really get outside shit. 
---
And I'm not sympathetic at all lol I'm just more disgusted by Bethesda than I am some random hackers.
---
Hardware banning would do the trick, but would probably take Bethesda 10 years to implement... But one can hope...I guess. Either way my experience with this game has been ruined, and depending on what their response to this hack is, i might leave it for good, and am sure the other hundreds or thousands of hacked players feel the same.
---
I play on both. Most flax I get is for using a controller and not a keyboard.
---
Almost seems like the game was doomed to begin with.  
---
Oh.
---
"may have resulted in a few players losing items"
---
"only a small number of characters have been negatively affected"
---
MY ASS Bethesda; and I highly doubt that you actually are taking this "vey seriously" and that resolving it is your "top priority."
---
You'll probably fuck up even further and ban everyone whose inventory was stolen and not ban the actual hackers, lmao. Too bad you already banned the people that could be helping you fix this problem right now. What a shame.
---
Are the discord channels mainly for PC?
---
try harder next time, I think there is a video of the grapefruit technique out there. Give that a try next time (assuming your customer isn't allergic to citrus.)
---
Don’t get me wrong, I love Beth. But is it just me or everything Beth does to stop cheating/hacking just ends up backfiring so bad it triples the problem. I dunno wtf Beth is doing in that building of theirs, maybe having a orgy with Elon musk or something.
---
Beth, please fix your game like adults!
---
I will say, despite everything, FO76 has one of the most united and strong communities of any multiplayer game. Your willingness to blast Bethesda for their errors is VERY laudable.
---
And thats incorrect...how exactly? Sorry are the hackers running fo76?? 
---
Wait yeah I guess now they basically are lol
---
I feel you. people are quick to dismiss gaming just because it's perceived as lesser than, say, fucking sports. then again, people are quick to dismiss anything in this sub if that means stroking Beth's ego.
---
hopefully a local server solution comes in the future so we can be freed from this nightmare.
---
Didn't only affect pc though.
---
We others had to pay for the fix that once again, was exclusive to pc players.
---
"we are currently looking into ways we may be able to compensate you" That sounds like they are NOT going to be restoring items or rolling back characters otherwise they would have said restore.
---
Yep, pretty stupid.
---
I guess we won't see you again until Fallout 5, then.
---
Buh-bye, "concerned citizen".
---
They should  have temporarily taken down the servers before this hack was posted especially since they were warned. I love fallout, but they can be doing so much more to prevent players from getting hacked. Which includes not banning players that were helping them find bugs.
---
They did close the servers down to fix the issue.
---
Its already been implemented.
---
But you are too busy reading hate messages that you missed it.
---
I respect your opinion, even if it's wrong.
---
Oh, I'm aware.  But they lose what I might spend in the Atom Shop.  Even though I've already spent roughly $25 shortly after launch, didn't spend anymore after.  Just spent earned atoms from playing as the year went on.
---
So I spent about $145.  One game for me and one for my daughter, plus the atom purchase.  I did enjoy while I played, but I'm done for now.
---
They should have done this 20 hours ago. I am not going to applaud them now.
---
Fo76 was developed in less than two years right after fallout 4. What are you talking about????
---
The victims are the players. Bethesda is making some new and sweet Fallout 1st money thanks to this.
---
I do that often, but tonight I will replicate the after effects of someone that’s been hacked
---
I see your view point and kind of agree but with how the game is at the moment, removing legendaries will do more harm than good.  With no official faction system, good pvp, a damn chat and a proper auction house, player generated content will be extremely limited, and I am heavily emphasising on 'extremely'.
---
Not along same lines,  but I wish I could use certain melee weapons in Power Armour.
---
Good for you man thanks for trying to help make gaming a better place 👍🏻
---
I completely feel for anyone who loses the stuff they’ve spent so much of their free time working to get, and I hope they’re compensated or their inventories restored, but other than that there’s no sense getting worked up over a game. If you’re sick of the game or the way Bethesda has been handling things just stop playing and find something else to do.
---
Bethesda certainly needs to improve on multiple fronts, that’s indisputable. People who are so inclined could certainly boycott Fallout 1st and buying atoms, I’m down with a that - but just as friendly advice, don’t let it bother you or worry about teaching Bethesda a “lesson”. It’s frankly not even worth your time.
---
Can you cite any evidence (other than anecdotal)  that consoles were affected by this hack?
---
Thanks.
---
This was absolutely wild to watch. Maybe your weapons weren't affected because you were using the workbench?
---
I think the only exception here is scrap and repair kits.
---
When you run a company, there are standards set in place for the types of protection you must provide for user data.
---
The ease of access that hackers have to player inventory constitutes a breech of the integrety of the service, and the downtime required to fix it will cause a loss of service availability.
---
These are both considerations that a company is supposed to be making in regards to Information security, in order to secure their services.
---
You can't see the irony in Fallout 76 trying to sue someone?
---
As a recovering heroin addict, that's an incredibly ignorant analogy. Trading in a video game is nothing like being high on opiates.
---
Placeholding a post for when I am off mobile and on desktop...
---
All platforms.
---
They should go take a look at the forum where this hack even started. He can get a good idea as to why hackers make shit like this in the first place. Apparently some of them have been following this sub and laughing at the "butthurt users" getting upset because their stuff was stolen...
---
If they are posting on youtube this makes the acceptable to all California laws and USA serves.
---
Yeah but not consumables which people do spend money on.
---
They have. They essentially said they'll be compensating affected players, shutting down the PC servers, and rolling out a potential fix.
---
LoL when you watching Donald Trumps gaming channel after he's booted from the POTUS  and you're thanking him for updating you on FO76
---
That is true, so far we've played different games though, like Child of Light.
---
I had planned on getting F1st once wastelanders came out.
---
I got 1 month of FO1st because of the hack and because I wanted to farm santatrons at all the workshops.
---
Well, after 6 hours of my own private server, I gotta say, if it ain't pay to win, it is the next best thing.
---
It would still crash or kick me, so I still had to team up with somebody just to be able to get back in when that happens.
---
I get to laugh when I see them get angry over something so minuscule AS A GAME 😂
---
The hackers are a consequence of Bethesda's actions. If the game was not so easily exploitable thanks to Bethesda there wouldn't be this level of hacking. Simple.
---
I haven’t played in a long while and I forgot they added those to the atomic shop. Good point.
---
Taking the game offline is evidence they meant what they said here.
---
You honestly think that everyone on the planet has a PC powerful enough to play F76?
---
I may have to have a look for Xbox. Maybe I can find a good group of people or look for a community for help on end game content.
---
Bethesda has done so much wrong, such as, charging full price for a game with no anti-cheat, the canvas bag, the nuka-dark, the bugged quests, atom shop challenges, and events that haven’t been accessible since release, the hackers they’ve done nothing about in NW, the constant breaking of promises, they added a subscription service that costs more than the game itself in some countries that includes no extra content, but still makes the game ptw, they delayed just about all content added into the game, they promised more communication yet we learn about hot fixes the day they’re being applied, and that’s just my short list, because I already typed out everything I could remember in another post.
---
So next time you think, “Why are people mad at something?” It’s probably for a good reason.
---
Do you only browse reddit and read comments and nitpick so you can feel validated? Do you actually bother to check other sources? No, the 8 minute and 54 second long video does not contain proof of 532 people losing their items. I doubt the hacker actually recorded EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON getting their stuff stolen, but i have no reason to doubt him/her. You bethesda apologists are too ignorant of how serious this situation actually is.
---
I'm in the same boat, never got super far in either game, but recently upgraded my system so I can play them at 60 fps.  I've been going through all the campaigns I missed playing right now Battle Front 2 and Titanfall 2.  Not sure what I'll do after I beat them both.
---
Of course they are more justified. Because a far larger number of players have experienced those issues that caused them to rate it a 3/10. So across the board, you're far more likely to experience those issues than not experience them. If it were the other way around and a tiny portion of the playerbase experienced those issues, then the 8/10 would be more justified.
---
But as the game stands now, your 8/10 score is the exception. It's an outlier. It's like if you go to a restaurant 10 times and 8 times the food was terrible, while the other 2 times the food was good. You're far more likely to experience whatever issue caused the food to be terrible, so you're going to judge the place based on those 8 bad times rather than the 2 good times.
---
Peopel should just stop playing at this crappy game at this point. No soul and effort at all into this crappy game.
---
They aren't making those anymore, are they?
---
I love the series. Played the original when it came out. 
---
Bugs? Plenty of games have them. 
---
And none of the major issues have impacted me
---
i'm not playing anymore, someone took all my stuff that I worked hundreds of hours for
---
The very first time bethesda spit on me as a customer was when they sold the game 50% off only 2 weeks later after official launch. I know every game goes on sale on black friday, but 50% off to a newly released game? Give me a break, pre-ordering was pure scam.
---
Skippin leg and arm day.
---
Doesn't that count all platforms together?
---
instead of taking down servers or at least adventure mode and giving everyone temporary access to private for the time of fixing it is too much to expect
---
It was Pc only there’s no way currently to even mod a jtag or xex mod or menu of any kind onto the Xbox one
---
Similar the PS4 has no issues
---
In older Fallout you could pickpocket NPCs by just walking/sneaking up to them. OP is comparing the new hack to this mechanic, with the victims of the hack being the equivalent of the NPCs.
---
Im not shitting on Fallout, but Conan Exiles is honestly way better than 76. I'd give a shot if you're even slightly interested. You can basically build a kingdom in it, it's a really fun complete sandbox with a huge map, plus you can play it by yourself optionally.
---
It’s ok, don’t worry about it.  I didn’t state it was me anyway.  He was just commenting succinctly that humans see text walls and don’t read them.
---
don't they have it support? I get it - they can't just flip off the switch on their own but holy shit isn't there one person that they can reach out in case of an emergency?
---
I'm also tempted to check out Anthem and see how it is getting
---
It’s thousands of players 
---
Stop downplaying your incompetence
---
It depends, if your not comfortable with keeping your health bar being below 50% then go junkies, otherwise go bloodied.
---
The OP is trolling.
---
My fear is that it would just be me and the 10 other assholes left from beta in my servers.
---
The sub is basically Bethesda’s step child at this point. 
---
Can you not take constructive criticism about a developer that only cares about how much money you give them without getting triggered? 
---
You can’t deny the facts, and you confirm the stereotype that most 76 fanboys are working with a limited intelligence.
---
Common sense? Gotdafuckouttaheaaaaaa
---
Oh my god you poor poor thing.
---
“Out of the millions Bethesda has made, they had to pay to actually take care of the game, but not for the consoles who weren’t affected, only for the pc players, so how dare Bethesda solve a problem for them and not us”
---
This. This is what you sound like. Grow up
---
Why do you laugh when someone is upset over a product they purchased not functioning as promised, or when a third party take deliberate action to cause some form of loss?  
---
Why does that amuse you?
---
Being a Vendor is a big part of the game for me right now, that and improving my gear.
---
I love Nathan Barnatt
---
I was merely correcting your statement, there was no other point. To be clear they removed the obvious fakes, the 4 or more starred legendaries and the non-legendary items made into false legendaries, plus some of the FO4 items. There's no evidence I've seen that any hacked/spawned 3 star legendary items, or other items like FO4 weapons and armour were completely removed, so that's considerably more than the few that slipped through. In fact we don't know just how many it is, and neither does Bethesda, but it would make no sense for it to be a few items, much more likely we're looking at very large numbers, like the previous duping exploits we've seen.
---
With that said it's clear the problem has not been addressed at all, in a timely fashion or otherwise. They acted yes, but to imply the problem has been dealt with is entirely wrong. I sincerely hope Bethesda pulls their head out of their ass and acts appropriately, but almost everything they've done thus far says otherwise.
---
You must be on the Xbox One S.
---
You may be right.
---
This game is something else for sure.
---
LMFAO 
---
Funny and distasteful. I can see many people liking this and then the other half not. 
---
May your Karma stay around neutral and may you never lose your dark sense of humor.
---
I never said it was true.
---
Not what I said. 
---
Can you cite any supporting evidence that the PC player base for Fallout 76 is currently less than 5000?
---
Mutations
---
But do you really think 500k+ are still playing? Or are they logging on to check the atom shop?
---
Honestly, usually people like him or Legacy are either outright wrong, or make the video after the issue is fixed.
---
The game deserves criticism, but it's so obvious they're just bandwagoning for the views (Aka The Money)
---
It's a Shame too, because I used to watch these guys when they appeared to be somewhat credible.
---
Oof.
---
So can all those who keep trashing and telling us how crap the game is and are leaving fo76, can you just go and hangout at w/s for awhile on your way out and let us no if it's all clear. Thanks
---
"a few players" Fuck right off. there is literally a video of a dude stealing 500 players stuff. and you think hes the only one? thousands are probably affected at this point.
---
Geezus christ. I just saw Yong yeas video about this video. Good fucking lord.
---
That’s what everyone said just a few days ago when this was announced. Everything is a rumor. The difference is, smart people actually prepare, even if nothing happens, whereas the shills fight everyone until it happens
---
you understand it takes time to investigate, and figure out how to patch the exploit, then it takes time to write the code. Then it takes time to make sure the fix works. 
---
20 hours for a major hack, thats lightning speed.
---
Interesting how your comment has aged.
---
I don’t know but as I think it through, my guess is 15000 simultaneous players across all platforms. Which makes 500 on PC a whole lot bigger. 
---
Again, I could be way off. It’s a not-quite-uneducated guess, that’s all.
---
"Send nudes."
---
532 players, if they lost items that cost an average of $5 each, brings the potential charges up to Grand Larsony and Unauthorized Use of Computer Systems Affecting Interstate Communications and Commerce.
---
/u/90sMemelord is potentially looking at hard time over this, if he's the one that utilized this hack.
---
You you are really into RD2O like fallout 76, you get a gold multiplier after getting at least one challenge a day for 20 days straight I believe. So you get 9 free gold a day on top of gold for bounties and missions. It’s the most generous in game currency I’ve ever played and it’s almost like an in game mechanic with gold bars being actually rare but not so rare compared to fallout atoms. Those are bullshit.
---
It’s honestly a great game in a lot of different ways.  I love the story and the lore, I especially love the holotapes and the voice acting on them.  I love the camp building and the in-game community, visiting each other’s creations and talking about them.  
---
Nuclear Winter is also the most fun PVP game I’ve played in a long time. Annoying hackers aside, it’s actually a great team BR, and the only one with a setting lore I actually enjoy. 
---
I still maintain that Fallout 4 was the biggest disappointment in the series.
---
Three of my favourite types of games include base-building games, shooter games, and multiplayer. Fallout has all three.
---
I love games like Fallout 4 and Minecraft, as they allowed me to build whatever I wanted.
---
I love games like Seige as I love shooter games, they have unique characters, like Jäger, and I can play it online with friends.
---
Fallout, especially Fallout 76 - it has all of these.
---
That is why I like playing it.
---
It was mentioned they were looking into it.
---
Now thats just stupid.
---
“We hate what happened to our favorite franchise, even though thousands of others like whats happening. So lets ruin it for them.”
---
Why not hack theaters showing the new SW while we are at it.
---
Typical hacker mentality if you ask me.
---
How sad of a person so you have to be to get your kicks out of this. Like damn guys...go watch a comedy or something.
---
In compairason to number if aysrs across all platforms even 2k may be a small relative number.
---
I agree that even one is too many however
---
Im not saying its not thair fault, what Im saying is its both their faults, you cant just give hackers a free pass to be cucks because bethesda didnt put enough security into the game, its like letting burglars off the hook for leaving your window open, no, its damn well their fault for being dickheads
---
finally i can get that light wood laminate
---
You are right. This isnt an actual "hack", as in information theft, or a DDoS (yes, ddosing people in games can get you into hot water. Like scalding hot. Europol, FBI, Interpol and a dozen other national police forces hot. They are going against DDoS with international cooperation, and Europol specifically mentioned gamers using DDoS to boot others as targets. Of course thats not because they care about you playing in peace, but a dipshit kid suddenly facing the FBI is going to spill really quick where he paid for the DDoS, and those sites/people are the same ones attacking business.
---
Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahaa
---
Few passes through the rad shower. Maybe soak 'em in Med-X.
---
Yup! December 17th - Janrurary 6th.
---
I never thought I'd see the words 'exact revenge' used in the context of video game playing. 
---
Some games companies are getting more greedy, and some gamers have too much excess energy and nothing good to put it into.
---
A "few" players. \*video of someone taking 500 players items away\*
---
Bingo
---
Maybe a more secure stash and more weight added would be a perk... I mean like 2 k or free scrap hording
---
noone cares
---
When I was at Uni, the staff talked about Bethesda in hallowed reverence. I can't help but find this really entertaining. Fair play to the hackers for taking Bethesda down a peg, what a crapfest.
---
To anyone that's lost stuff, it will eventually get restored. Don't get in too much of a tizzy over this.
---
Yeah reddit a mad house and the forums lol
---
If you like the game, then why let the criticism bother you and just have fun?
---
Why does it go one way but not the other?
---
**Submitting a Ticket** 🤣🤣🤣, like my Support ticket 191209-002576 ? The one you Bumped ( Violating their on Code of Con ) ?? The one you ignored for 9 days ???
---
I can make psychotats ...
---
I'm pretty tired of greed in the games industry. But the butthurtness of some gamers and their judgemental petty attitudes are far, far more annoying.
---
One day... one day...
---
No, if you used ebay, craigslist, gameflip, ect to buy items with cash, you will not be reimbursed. 
---
This is against the EULA, so you are SoL.
---
I get that they need time. But I am just saying they should have been taking down the servers 20 hours ago and having it down until they fix it, since it is a major hack. I am not saying they need to investigate it and patch it within 2 hours, I understand this might take them awhile.
---
a reasonable take on things
---
At this point it's obvious he doesn't give a shit and expects no consequences, and he's probably right for all I know. What power does Bethesda have here? He can just buy another copy and find a way to get around whatever they do...
---
I mean, it's pretty much on you. why would they compensate anyone for something that goes directly against the ToS?
---
And Lincoln was still alive before he went to the theatre.  What's your point?
---
“ I’m not a fallout 76 player “ okay then you have no right to make such claims on the game you haven’t played it simple as ... now I advise you find something better to do with your life than to hop on a “ fuck Bethesda “ train to give you the adrenaline and attention that you want ...
---
[It's been patched.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377441/an-update-on-the-current-pc-exploit?language%5B%5D=en)
---
imagine going to ebay to buy weapons for fallout 76. lmao
---
Considering it’s against TOS to buy with real $...
---
It makes sense
---
[Bethesda has patched it.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377441/an-update-on-the-current-pc-exploit?language%5B%5D=en)
---
I think I speak for a large portion of not just the player base, but the gaming community in general, when I say: 
---
"Take your 'compensation' and shove it up your moneygrubbing @$$."
---
People have lost hundreds of hours of progress, not to mention the poor saps who paid real money for in-game items, all because you couldn't be bothered to implement even the simplest, most rudimentary of security systems. Then, you have the unmitigated gall to tell the people who have stuck with you through this s#$% show of a game that you can't replace any lost items, despite the fact that *the hackers who caused this mess can make* ***10 star legendaries, AT WILL***, and now talk about "compensation"? You think $5 worth of Atoms will fix this?
---
Go back to whatever pit you pulled this game out of, Bethesda, and don't come back.
---
If it had to be from a previous Fallout game, I would have to choose the ANTI-MATERIAL RIFLE from Fallout NV.
---
If it could be from anywhere, I think it would be neat to have a wider variety of CARBINES to be able to use in the game. Having a lot more guns that people use commonly in this day would be wonderful. I understand that they didn’t include weapons like this though as it would not fit the theme of Fallout - especially the time period/difference.
---
The hack was bad, but what pisses me of even more is the downplaying that Bethesda is doing right. Also a moderator on the official forums, deleting every single negative post people post. Because of 'the rules'. Well fuck those rules. This hack is bad enough to make an exception. People been accepting your bugs and shit since the start and we stayed loyal. But there is a limit and you crossed it!
---
Role back the hundreds of affected accounts asap. And hire people, so you can handle support during Xmas time.
---
Bethesda has more of my trust than strangers making claims on social media.. you wanna promote something while your at it ? Chewlies Gum, eh? What is with this effort to shit on this company. Is the competition really doing THAT poorly that they need to come here and steal Beth's players?
---
What? 😂 it’s not that deep bro get off your moral high horse it’s just funny
---
[If not Bethesda, who just patched it, then...](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377441/an-update-on-the-current-pc-exploit?language%5B%5D=en)
---
so no one has phones in this universe?
---
We are all on private. I won't risk. They don't say jack shit about that hotfix.
---
Lol, like Todd howards erect penor just slowly creeps into the middle of the screen towards your reticle unless you stop everything your doing and click it away xD just happens every 30 seconds for literally no reason
---
Yeah, rape jokes sure are funny when you're a giant manchild that only has to worry about their in-game toys, right?
---
I feel bad for them but at the same time, why would you spend real money on items in Fallout?
---
Not at all! If you enjoy the game, that is totally fine.  You would be lying if you reported this game as 100% fully functioning and a complete masterpiece. If you enjoy the game, keep at it! No one's here to ruin anyone's fun, but it is good to be aware when a company isn't willing to put 100% into their games, especially to fans like you who are willing to find the good things in all of the bad this game has. You are a true fan and you deserve better.
---
I'm putting my foot down... on sad people like you. Stop using 'we' like you're the leader of some neckbeard revolution. And stop redirecting anger from the hackers to Bethesda, you slimy slug.
---
The game is very enjoyable. You should try it instead of shutting on it from the sidelines
---
True. 
---
I've had trouble playing negitive karma runs and tend to be chaotic at worst and saint at best
---
Well hopefully someone breaks into the house and steals all the xmas presants
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HTd4Um1m4
---
Is it pc only or consoles also?
---
Real money trading is against the TOS. Bethesda will not help. For atom-shop items, they can be crafted back.
---
Reddit subgroups fo76filthycasuals or fallout76factions is where I would look. Plenty of discord groups promote themselves there.
---
In real life I don’t think so I try to be friendly with everyone I know/meet. Also to an extent online, but when I have a hack or something like that gives me an advantage is when I turn into a dick as you might call it I want to ruin people’s fun when I have something they don’t and they can’t do anything about 
---
I like to look at gory stuff as some might call it 
---
Like the watchpeopledie was my favorite sub to look at
---
But stuff like that I usually keep to myself
---
This is just one untermensch's doing. He cleared over 500 people and I doubt he's alone. I'd say 2000+ affected players is a more realistic number.
---
This sarcasm is on another level.
---
They are working on the servers right now to fix it. Took them down a few hours ago.
---
I did report them, fortunately I was able to get a capture and submitted it.
---
Okay that makes a ton more sense then what you first put lol. Some people payed 60+ for the game at release just to point that out or even more for the exclusive versions. I think people’s largest issue is how much stuff costs on top of how buggy it is. You don’t see people complain as much as they do for other games that ask for micro transactions because they generally are not as buggy. I never heard of an eso player losing all of their stuff. I have also never seen any other game crash so hard that it actually turns my Xbox off so it’s more about quality of service then cost of service.
---
This is why I'm sure Bethesda won't do a god damn thing to fix this. How many Fallout 1st subs do you think they're going to sell off of the back of this? Not many, of course, but when was the last time Bethesda displayed a logical, non-predatory business model?
---
I consider myself a filthy casual I'll check there first haha.
---
These arent your items, nothing in this game belongs to you. Not even your copy of the game, its a limited license. Of course if they have the least sense of PR theyll compensate, but besides that they have no reason to do so, **including** for lost shit bought from the store with cash. Thats only licensed to you too, with the specific note that it has no real world/monetary worth.
---
See you're just outright dismissing a significant number of player's experience because it doesn't fit the 3/10 narrative you're trying to push. 
---
You're basically saying "Hey let's look at the average of something....but let's dismiss numbers that won't give us the number we want"
---
You're also not factoring in the fact that pissed of people are more vocal and more active than satisfied people. Angry, unsatisfied people are also significantly less likely to be objective. The entire thing gets painted as shit. No matter what.
---
I largely like 76. I've had a good experience with it. Looking at the game as a whole, they did some things well, and they fell short on certain things. I will gladly look at the game as a whole and am more than willing to criticize the game where it's warranted. At launch I'd put it a 5-6/10. As it stands right now it's in the 7/10 range. 
---
While I don't doubt that, especially in the first several months, more people had buggy experiences than not, there's still a significant number of people who had largely positive experiences. 
---
While those of us who experienced positive game play, with limited issues may be a smaller number, that can't just be dismissed. So while our 8/10 rating may not be representative of the entire player base, nor is the 3/10. 
---
The avg would fall somewhere in the middle.
---
Which makes me feel better about possibly playing the game in the future, but I still feel for all the PC players getting their collections stolen.
---
I hear there may be a force way in for the scammy hackers to to continue this in to fallout first...
---
Of course I do, I don't need to handle a gun to know I don't want to be shot in the face.
---
I still blame bethesda more. This could have been prevented easily.
---
#fuckyongyea
---
Didn’t know it was against the TOS. Good thing I don’t buy stuff with real money. I just don’t understand why people would buy stuff with real money in Fallout, but I was still curious to know what’d happen to them
---
They’re downplaying this in an extraordinarily evasive and dishonest way. Anyone who has seen the video of the guy running around stripping people of their gear knows this has affected way more than a few people, and that was just in just one video.
---
who is EA now then?
---
This is just one hacker and i doubt he's alone.
---
XD damn i like you
---
Actually Bethesda hasn't reached their levels of terribleness, they are in the negative millions
---
Or, alternatively, they'll sit on their hands and let it all burn if they see people scramble to sub to Fallout 1st to protect their items.
---
Probably best to wait for more people to come forward on that. Either way Bethesda has a lot of work to do in the next days and weeks.
---
Let your fear and imagination run wild. Surely they will lead you to great justice. :P
---
It’s a really enjoyable game. Most of the controversies were blown massively out of proportion by click bait youtubers.
---
No thank you.
---
Icis
---
It arises my curiosity and wonder for what people will do for items in Fallout as well
---
Bethesda CAN'T fix it. I don't think people are understanding this. These are fundamental problems integrated into the very core of how this antiquated engine works. They would need to rebuild the majority of the games engine from scratch to prevent these problems.
---
They were warned about this from prior to Beta. The engine is better understood by the modding community than by Bethesda themselves, they even said this. Let me make that clear : BETHESDA STATED THE MODDING COMMUNITY UNDERSTANDS THEIR ENGINE BETTER THAN THEY, THE DEVELOPERS, DO.
---
It's not getting fixed anytime soon, and if "fixed" its just plugging a hole in a cardboard wall against a tsunami.
---
Bethesda has repeatedly shown their incompetence in the release, marketing and upkeep of this objectively garbage product. It's time for it to die, and I'm happy to see this be the deathblow.
---
Well there, you, go... 😂🤣
---
they had to weigh the pros and cons.  If they had taken the game down, the internet would be bitching at them about that too.
---
Its a lose lose situation for bethesda whenever anything happens. 
---
If I was beth at this point, I wouldnt be telling the players anything anymore, because they are damned if they do, damned if they dont.
---
I am honestly concerned, just like you, as to why you would post on a forum of a game that you obviously do not like?  I's an honest question.
---
The issue here is believing any company isn’t greedy. They all are, but there is more to hoard than just money. Most companies try to get as much money as possible, a few will prioritize reputation over money (very few). Bethesda hasn’t been hard at work on this because they don’t care about 76 anywhere near as much as their other projects. Example? EVERY fix they’ve made has broken something prior. But it would cost money (in the form of labor and time) to test this against previous patches, and even more money to fix them properly. But they are quick to release it because it sounds good to hear things have been fixed, even when you’ve made them worse. It sounds like you’re listening and doing your best, but if anyone has actually thought they’re doing their best, no offense, but you’re too naive. I used to enjoy seeing the best in people, and believing people wanted good things. Then I started playing games. Games these days aren’t escapes from life. They’re constant monetization. Hence always online games-as-a-service. I’ll say though, I am surprised about the new Star Wars game. I still feel like EA has something they’re gonna do, or maybe they finally are working on their reputation before the next storm, but that would be my naivety
---
Oh I don’t buy items with real money. And I’m on Xbox so the hack wouldn’t affect me. But I was just curious because I’ve heard that people (idk why) buy in game items with real money.
---
PC, XBox, PS4?
---
I see no reason to trust the word of a thief about their prowess at thievery, especially when the video shows at best (worst?) -dozens- of players being affected and not hundreds. That's a problem to be sure, and I am willing to believe that the number of adversely affected players is potentially in the hundreds. But I see no reason to take them at their word they accomplished this specifically stated quantity of mayhem. Or perhaps they are purposefully inflating their reign of chaos and they in fact took 532 _items_ (taking ~5-6 items from ~80-90 players in an evening sounds much more likely) and not items from 532 _players_.
---
In either case yes it's a small number of players -that we know of- who won the shit lottery and had some asshat take their crap. I'm personally quite adverse to logging on out of an abundance of caution until I feel comfortable knowing this particular exploit has been addressed. But If there's as few as 50,000 active players we're talking about a problem that's affected 1% of players which, again, is alarming but is definitely a small number.
---
500 plus players arent small. I guess compared to total count. Just think how many players wanted to avoid being robbed out of their clothes
---
You can try to get your weapons back.  
---
You may end up banned though for admitting to breaking ToS
---
Dude, if it was PlayStation, I wouldn’t be playing until 100% confirmed it was fixed.
---
*damn unless we are talking beavers. Hmm not sure what you mean by that. I lost $10 on Fo76 and I’ve been awake the entire day soo. No sleep missed? Assuming I don’t have some crazy sleeping disease that I am unaware of.
---
500 Atoms you can earn from a new challenge
---
Remeber (beth said) "Millions" of people Play... GTFO 🤣
---
Moor loot for me !!!
---
Why? These "hackers" were doing what y'all been doing since the game came out, robbing the players /u/BethesdaGameStudios
---
Is the video still up or is it somewhere? I think there's like one video (haven't seen it due to bad internet) that's probably showing hacking someone, but I really doubt that it's evidence that they've hacked "500 people."
---
I feel like I’m the guinea pig in this situation
---
That should fix it for all of two hours.
---
A few players lmfao.. it’s all your players.. you only have about 500 dumb enough to keep playing this game
---
Truth is that most of the bad things about the game doesn't affect the entire playerbase. I play casually since the beta and never lost an item, never had any game breaking bug, etc. A lot of people bad mouthing the game had never played it before. And many will come here and tell us that we're stupid for playing it.
---
What I like about the game is that I can walk around just chilling, there are many things to see, the world they created have such attention to detail. You walk around and there's a scary message written on a wall, or a giant cockroach on a toilet seat using a top hat or some funny reference to another game. It's just a very nice world that's interesting to explore. I also really like that feeling of solitude, I don't think any fallout made me feel like I was in a pos apocaliptic world better than this one.
---
Then there are the builds. You can build your character any way you like and you'll be able to progress. There isn't any content that requires you to follow a meta or stuff like that, everything works. I like creating different characters and each will use a different kind of weapon.
---
And finally, camps. building my own camp is fun, but visiting other people's camps is awesome. Have you seen some camps out there? I am jealous of these people's creativity. Visiting camps is always fun.
---
Bless you
---
I barely comment and argue with the 90% morons Reddit is filled with but you my friend are an absolute retard ... genuinely ... how are you making such claims on a game you’ve only ever perceived and looked into through the media ... YouTube videos , articles , Reddit ? Funny enough I played a 1000 hours of the game and I loved it ... definitely could of been better but it was no where near what it is described to morons like yourself by the media ...
---
Where do you see active player count? I didn't know that was a metric publicly available.
---
All the evidence I need are the epic raids we waited for...
---
People were warned to stay off the game, and they didn't listen. They only have themselves to blame
---
I mean I've seriously thought about it.
---
"We are aware of the hack going around on Fallout 76. However, we will not be restoring lost inventory or offering any sort of compensation, and we will instead offer a free year of Fallout 1st to the modders who email us and explain how they breached our anti cheat. We also will not ban these players, for they are still valued customers, and we will not do anything to prevent this hack from affecting anyone. Give us more money, heres more cosmetics :)"
---
...fair enough...
---
Idk, why don’t they ban the people who’ve been gloating and uploading videos of them breaking TOS for months now?
---
Borderlands 3 is a good choice.  ;)
---
Man I do feel sorry for you if that’s what you seek as entertainment
---
Remember the Fallout 1st civil war between subscribers and non-subscribers? You idiots that paid for Fallout 1st are so fucked XD
---
I got it for free! I get to participate in it too!
---
And I guarantee not a single one of these people will get anything more than a form letter saying "sorry :(" from Bethesda in way of compensation.
---
And how many is actively playing online?
---
What a moronic sentence. You don't need a beast PC for that. 90% of PS4's games look a shitton better than Fo76. Fanboys are so delusional its not fun.
---
Have you noticed a huge increase in server disconnects recently? It's often caused by a common dupe method that requires crashing the server. 
---
Back before the hard cap on carry weight and ban waves were implemented, the massive amounts of duped items were causing insane amounts of server lag every time the dupers logged in or opened their inventories. 
---
Sure, some of the duping methods may have been relatively harmless, and it's nice to have nice gear, but when the cost is literally breaking the game, there's nothing heroic about it.
---
This is Verm.   Whats up?
---
Oh come on anyone with any technical know how knew the second Todd said ‘MMO fallout’ something was gonna happen
---
Bethesda just responded to this here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQZSOtzWuyQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQZSOtzWuyQ)
---
I’m definitely not apologizing for Bethesda, they deserve all hate they get. They released a half baked product that they constantly break again and again. 
---
They then charge their loyal user base up the ass for basic cosmetics and simple QoL improvements aka F0 1st. 
---
But to take some assholes claim as fact isn’t right. Dude just wants attention and is trolling. I’m sure a lot of people were affected and this is a really fucken serious bug that Bethesda needs to act immediately on but you’re just playing into that dudes hands. There’s no proof he stole from over 500.
---
No one asked.
---
You would have to pay me to play this
---
Simply put: No
---
Nobody had to.
---
I’ve been enjoying it. It’s strongest suit is its combat and gameplay. It is a legitimate “Iron Man” simulator. 
---
They’ve improved the drop rate for legendary items beyond all recognition and as a result now you can actually put together a viable build without dedicating 80 hours a week to the game. It’s now in the realm of normal looters. 
---
There are rumors that the game is undergoing a massive ground-up revitalization, and I hope it’s true. We could use a more robust crafting system, a character stat screen, more opportunities to interact with other players, and (as always in any game) more variety in items. These problems can be solved though, and I hope the devs are doing what we’ve heard they’re doing.
---
It does.
---
Why? These "hackers" were doing what y'all been doing since the game came out, robbing the players /u/BethesdaGameStudios_
---
Anyone still playing Todd's games at this point has completely given up on life.
---
This cheat isn't affecting a "few" players, it's affecting MANY players within the FO76 communities.
---
We’re not friends I don’t know why you feel the need to sway the conversation to this ... ^ 
---
Get a life kiddo
---
I look forward to news of the fix, and for the first brave souls to risk adventure mode to confirm this cheat no longer works.
---
Until then it is simply too risky to play given the apparent ease (YT vids) some players are able to abuse this.
---
I assume its not safe to come out of the vault yet...I dont have alot since I am lvl 22 but what I have I want to keep.
---
32k spread across all platforms.
---
because it's not really profitable for them to allocate the manpower for that one purpose?
---
not to mention that's completely different than what op proposed.
---
Bloodied has better perk combos but it's all preference
---
its time you guys got a anti-cheat system.  like wow.. warden like
---
So the downtime today was more profitable then?
---
Kek, you guys using Betheda's games, especially F76, really look like a stockholm syndrome...
---
We need to get together and DOX these hackers and send the info to Bethesda.
---
FO1st abolished, Free Private Servers, And 50,000 atoms free to everyone for the screw up. That's chump change. It's hot the level of computer fraud now. Either they pay up royally, or be sued into oblivion.
---
I'm on console
---
All tamable mega sloths should spawn at lvl 20. If it spawned scorched, it should show it's level as 40, but should go back to 20 after server hopping.
---
they hotfixed it
---
I just want some dark boxer briefs. Tighty whities are a no-go once you leave the vault.
---
Because my entertainment started at day one. Even the idea of a game this broken is just incredible. I may have to pick up a copy of the game to try the hack out myself
---
&gt; Hackers can reportedly get into private servers, too. Just shut it all down, I say.
---
Hahaha.
---
What a clowncar of a game and of a company.
---
...which may have resulted in a few players losing items... 
---
A few hundred....
---
Here's their apology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=15HTd4Um1m4
---
the worst that happened to me so far is that with a custom.ini i crash in Nuclear Winter
---
if they didnt want people to use custom.inis, the game wouldnt look for a fallout76custom.ini upon launch and prioritise whatever is in there over the fallout76.ini
---
I have No sympathy for people who bought items of ebay......
---
&gt;~~thousands~~ one thousand
---
Ftfy
---
You should ask your good friend if they've been using the dupe method that requires crashing servers. If so, you may want to reconsider their role in your group.
---
Yeah, that's never going to happen. I mean, it would require upwards of two whole *hours* of work! You don't expect them to put in twice the effort they did to making the game in the first place to fix one bug, do you?
---
[They literally finished patching it before you posted.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377441/an-update-on-the-current-pc-exploit?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Weird way to spell “forever.”
---
And then I take a look at your previous posts and hey your a stereotypical lost American man who loves his guns ... now this all makes sense .
---
Stop while you're ahead. Or should I say behind. Meh, like it matters to a troll.
---
Yeah,   
---
\- teleport hacks don't exist  
---
\- people didn't mod the game files to make a Raid shorter   
---
\- people didn't use stolen accounts to literally write their sites on the major cities

&gt; When I saw the coding on fo76
---
Where/how did you see the coding?
---
Small number??? its a big number! shouldnt be over 500 I really hope this is taken care of soon!!
---
Sad to see the lemmings who allow this to happen to them.
---
Yes because my enjoyment in fine firearms does show that I don’t waste my money on horrible games that are broken from day one
---
How much are we talkin?
---
[They've already patched it.](https://bethesda.net/community/topic/377441/an-update-on-the-current-pc-exploit?language%5B%5D=en)
---
Hmmmm, name the price?
---
How were you carrying 30 weapons on you?
---
See you next year then
---
Do the pets defend your camp?
---
FO76 is a trash fire.
---
They falsely advertised their SE package with a sub-par product. Read : "canvas" bag
---
They falsely advertised their Rum bottle, and the rum itself was just..... only technically consumable.
---
They put people in actual physical danger with their Nuka Cola PA Helmet product by not ensuring quality control.
---
They falsely advertised pricing on their Atomic Shop products by marking things as "on sale" when it had never been on the market to have a baseline price to begin with.
---
They continually market cheap, poorly made products at exorbitant prices using an IP they bought, but have no passion for, because their own products are considered subpar by even their own fanbase.
---
Save the gaming industry. Stop giving Bethesda money.
---
Lolol, you can't make this up. Bethesda, you treat your customers like shit. As an outside observer, I don't know why they keep giving you money. You'd have to pay me to play this trash.
---
Is it safe to come out now?
---
Name it baby, name it
---
I’ll do it for three pennies. Physical
---
Pretty sure Bethesda anti-cheat measures are the digital equivalent of anti-theft stickers.
---
If you are absolutely that stupid to spend real money on a weapon or piece of gear maybe getting it stolen would be a wake up call to pull your head from your bottom side
---
And testing them lol remember how performance tanked pretty much every dlc, fasnacht, Halloween, arktos, the vault raids, they can't get it right
---
Wow I hope people can get their stuff back.
---
I hopped in for a bit, but was too scared to really do anything. There were quite a few ppl on the server I was in, though.
---
Hackers probably gonna wait til everyone think its safe and then strike again.
---
Not really a new weapon but mods for the xbox. I really want explosive bolts.
---
Play something else for few days.
---
I’ve heard about it and yeah it makes sense now didn’t really think hard about it as luckily console doesn’t have that issue atm still feel bad for PC it’s really low to even do that to people
---
dude same lol. 25 hours for me but fucking same everything hahaha. Still salty about the game tho
---
I tried them once in early game, and the impact was negligible at best. 
---
They are useless perks, your points are better spent with a more useful perk like Class Freak, Serendipity, 4 Leaf, Better Crits, bloody mess
---
Hes probably waiting until more shit like this happens, because at this rate its gonna be a whole series lol
---
It's nearly Christmas, everyone that could give and estimate is on holiday leave.
---
I have my top items stashed and I am only playing solo or with closest friends on private servers. There has been literally over thousand hours of grinding in the game and at market places to get the gear that I want. Losing all that in a blink of an eye for a hacker who just wants to watch this game burn is too big of a risk. I will likely follow this mess from a distance and maby get back to adventure after wastelanders update has been live and patched a few times
---
If single player was possible it would already be out as a mod we could play.
---
Them hackers having upper edge due of dupped items and all, is one thing. But messing up fun for others is truly malicious.
---
Same group.
---
Why are people gilding a corporate account?
---
I'm not dismissing a significant portion of player experiences. I'm dismissing a small amount of player experiences, since most players, the vast majority have experienced huge issues. It's a very clear minority of players that think the game is fine or better.
---
I'm not saying let's look at the average. I'm saying let's look at what a player is more likely to experience. If the vast majority of players experience huge issues and rate the game 3/10, then that's the most likely thing a new player will experience. They might get the 8/10 experience and if they do then great, but it's highly unlikely.
---
It does not matter who's more vocal. The issues with 76 have been well documented for over a year. And the fact that most players experience those issues is also well documented. Everyone can be silent and this would still be the case.
---
You liking 76 doesn't make it good. There's a difference between a game being good or bad and you liking or disliking a game. I do enjoy 76 the little that I play it, but in it's current state I'd never give it higher than a 3 or a 4/10. I can separate my own enjoyment of the game from the state of the game.
---
There's not though. Again, the vast majority, at launch and still now, have incredibly buggy experiences. If you didn't that's great, but overall it's very rare to play 76 and not encounter a myriad of issues.
---
The average falls in the middle, yes, but I'm not going for an average. Again, using the restaurant example, if 8 visits were terrible and 2 were good, sure you'd rate the place a 5/10 on average. But would you overall think the place was good and would you want to return?
---
Definition of Karma. Or close too.
---
Thanks, I value your opinion.
---
They probably are the dupers/sellers.
---
Both hacking to steal items, and duping/selling are breaking the rules.   Hackers have no desire to follow rules, its like the whole point of hacking.
---
&gt; BETHESDA!? I REPORTED HIM 2 FUCKING WEEK AGO! YOU ABSOLUTE DIPSHITS, SO DID MY WIFE!!!!!! 
---
Imagine, it's almost 2020 and people still think Bethesda will not fuck them right in the bum, and want to actually help, or care at all about players who already paid :D
---
Lawsuit these incompetent noobs to get full refund.
---
Also, it's hard to imagine people play this game and are heaving fun, there are so many better.
---
I'm not the originator of this line, but it's hilarious:  
---
Kudos to Bethesda for making the most entertaining game I've never played.
---
[I did it. So can you.](https://i.imgur.com/GjKSWsH.png)
---
This guy knows what's up
---
There's no blame to share, it's two different offences. I deem the Bethesda one to be worse though, because without the Bethesda one there wouldn't be the other one.
