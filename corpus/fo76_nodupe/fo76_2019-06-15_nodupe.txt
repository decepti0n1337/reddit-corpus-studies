Well I‚Äôm a vats/Crit/Rifleman build but I found I noticed more when my addictions took my agi or Str down by more than a point.
---

---
At the moment my 5 are: Daddy-o, Daytripper, Med-X, Mentats and formula-P and I don‚Äôt seem to notice a big reduction in how often my Crit meter fills...the biggest negative is that I can‚Äôt share perk cards since my chr is whittled down to 1...I‚Äôm tempted to swap formula-P for alcohol but haven‚Äôt got around to it yet

---
I don't have a mic or anything for my pc but my laptop has on I don't use it often though :^)
---
Well, what is an "honest opinion" for you? What if the persons that are complaining about NW or about the game actually have some good arguments?
---
A lot of people find it inconceivable that the game has *improved* and they just keep spewing out the same regurgitated hate when they've either 1: not played it in 6 months or 2: *never* played it.
---
I love that piece. I wish we could level gear up, like we can with the Mistress of Mystery gear.
---
Just drive to my place. I'm the only person in my town that has FTTP. My download speed sits around 96mbps
---
I don‚Äôt think so but I guess you could hope
---
&gt; you sure
---
[Yup. ](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dogmeat_(Fallout))
---
I think that players that get to the extremely high level of 100 within the small time frame of the beta should get something more than just the Hellfire PA paint. I remember the first guy who launched a nuke (Frenchtomahawk) even managed to get a signed letter from Todd Howard himself. It would be great if they did something like modeled an "overseer" after their in game character or reached out to them as a player.
---
Once you seem to stop learning from them when you scrap, sell them for easy caps.
---
I have a handemade that I found but I need to be 25 to use it
---
Yea if it‚Äôs a honest opinion then I don‚Äôt mind, and completely understand where they are coming from, but if it‚Äôs just  Fo76=bad and Fo76 dumpster fire circle jerk garbage that‚Äôs where I draw the line.

Yeah you are correct. I mistook what you wrote.

If I weren‚Äôt using the gauss I‚Äôd have the same build minus Batteries Included and have Rank 3 Concentrated Fire for damage. 
---
If you want one I think I have an extra one on PS4
---
Well that and you‚Äôre supposed to kill everyone else I. The vault to become overseer... but if you do that then who‚Äôs left to be overseen?
---
I‚Äôm so impatient have to wait 6 hours lol

Have any tips for Ballistic fiber farming? It seems to only spawn in Fort Defiance... but its always gone... and all my gear is broken and needs to be repaired &lt;.&lt;
---
If people think that aimbots are not a thing or not readily available I feel for their naivety.
---
You're suppose to drink the blood of your enemies.
---
Yes it's a bug
---
K
---
Even an honest and substantial argument *against* the game earns my respect, it's the people who just throw out insults and repeat things they've heard whilst not being able to substantiate what they're saying.
---
Ok. Here‚Äôs my story. After they announced it at E3 last year I was so bummed. I felt really let down by the news. I figured I would eventually play it but wouldn‚Äôt get in a rush. Didn‚Äôt buy it at release and told my fianc√© not to get it for me for Christmas. Instead my mom did lol. So I figured what the hell. Went in with no expectations. Figured it would be a griefy buggy mess. It had been out for a month or two at that time and still had a bunch of bugs. Never had any game breaking moments. Played mostly solo and teamed up with some people I know IRL and just played casually. Made it to around lvl 60 and took a break. Came back and all my previous friends left. Just did my own thing a lot of building and crafting/scrapping weapons for plans. Made it to lvl 105ish and felt done. I enjoyed myself but I didn‚Äôt know what to do anymore. Then they started releasing the new content. Jumped back in for Faschnacht and the booze quests and haven‚Äôt stopped again. Lvl 150ish. It feels like fallout. It feels mostly like fallout 4 with other people. The lore is there and there are stories all over the place. The people are just dead. I don‚Äôt want to spoil anything but it makes sense to me from a lore standpoint.
---
I like fallout because I can make my character SOMEBODY. It feels the most like that in 76. No strict storyline making my character be something or somebody.  I‚Äôm just somebody out of the vault. So I gave my guy a story. It has some similarities to my real story but obviously is different. I grind for legendaries but still have a way to make sense of it in a RP way. 
---
It‚Äôs still fallout and feels like it more than some of the other games in its own way.  If you like fallout you should try it. There will be bugs. Bethesda games have always had bugs in my experience. Just be patient and they really won‚Äôt bug you. A freeze here or there or frozen enemies. Meh not great but doesn‚Äôt ruin it for me. The community is amazing and most of the trolls have gone to survival or just gone away at this point. In a word it‚Äôs fun. Check it out!
---
So don‚Äôt play that mode?
---
I like your idea, let's make it a feature.
---
Tank Killer is a nice addition to your perception special if you can afford it.
---
That's no problem, I've sent you a request :)
---
You were talking about challenges? Not perks? Or I did I miss something?
---
It never did show up for me on xb1
---
What would be better is if a grenade or chem runs out then a close equivalent is loaded automatically. Can‚Äôt tell you how many times I died when I ran out of diluted stimpaks, but still had 50 regular still in inventory.
---
The only weapon I‚Äôve felt is truly OP in NW is the Tesla Rifle. Simply because you don‚Äôt even have to aim the damn thing.
---
This whole concept of higher level players helping lower levels is what makes the Adventure mode so damn good. So, on behalf of everyone you‚Äôve helped along the way I say Thank You üëç
---
No that‚Äôs just a radiation storm
---
&gt;yet
---
Not a fan of BR games. I most likely never will either. Apex is the only BR game that has appealed to me, and that's solely due to the tight and satisfying gun play.... which I can't exactly say for Fallout games... especially 76.
---
Might have to quit game and re-boot. Yesterday I couldn‚Äôt swing my All-rise or shoot any guns. Did a quick quit and restart and all good.
---

Rad storm, very normal
---
It's just there blinking.
---
This sub doesn't like pics but someone posted a pic in r/gaming already and it looks just like it should
---
Oh, okay. I've avoided Workshops because they're PvP. And because they're PvP, I though they were amazing at getting resources or something!
---
So far, when I need something, I'm pretty good at scavenging for it. But things like acid and lead give me trouble sometimes.
---
But it needs the vampire legendary trait. Might be able to server hop and visit players stores to find one
---
I couldn‚Äôt agree more.
---
Most likely you won't be able to place it how it was. It's rare that you can; you'd have to find somewhere that accommodates it perfectly without any collision or obstructions. If you go to your stored structures and press X (or whatever button it is on the system you're using) to store the blueprint, it will store all the items used in that specific blueprint, so that they can be accessed and replaced out of the "stored" category without using more resources.
---
I ain't no theorycrafter but I'm leaning towards 100. I do like 2k damage with 2.5x sneak attack and when I sneak attack crit, I do 2.2k and that's with eagle eyes 25% crit bonus
---
But have you checked your internet???
---
You bastard lol. I'm in Bywong, about 20 minutes north of Canberra. No NBN out here but I use a wireless provider that is pretty decent (not using skymuster) I've got a 24/24 plan and could go up to 100/100 but the price for a TB is ridiculous.
---
No idea thats weird
---
Idk man, I played this game for a few months after release pretty hard core, it may not now be a dumpster fire, but it sure as hell was. And it‚Äôs hard af to turn that around. The majority of my like 200 something odd hours in those first few months was honestly difficult. But being the fallout fanboy I am, I stuck it out till I finished all of vanilla content. Hopefully it‚Äôs improved since then, I almost have no drive to want to go back since all of my weapons that were top tier are probably Garbo now anyways lol.
---
I myself feel that without VATS I am but a measly stormtrooper, forever destined to missed all shots, save nukes and other planet-destroyers
---
Yes, it's called a "rad storm". They don't last long and they do produce some radiation.
---
I almost got killed by this dude. Out of nowhere made me overencumbered in front of supermutant‚Äôs army.
---
Agreed! Or a dropping loot icon if u want to share armor and stuff. For now I just use the ‚Äúshooting‚Äù emote but sometimes a level 0 just starts spraying, giving everyones position away.
---
i just want my dogmeat back.
---
My old, semi-nice headset had a mute switch, indeed. But these are dark winds upon high, my furry friend. The time to test the mettle of man is now, with cheap gas station earbuds and having to hear 'ya boys' talk trash on it
---
thanks, that worked out. the terminal reappeared
---
Yay! :)
---
Fire department
---
That's just a part of a building. Not sure why it's there as it should be stuck to a wall.
---
I enjoy the game deciding if i win or lose
---
Vault 51 is close by there right?
---
Yes this is something we sometimes see when we first load in. It takes a minute or two in order for the server to spawn everything that's required for that segment of the game, it does seem like it takes forever. And also as mentioned sometimes it does take a reboot.
---
amazing experience anyway. Love the game and spontanous things like that. After so much hate on this game Im surprised how good it is.
---
maybe for Wastelanders against human enemies it might be more useful, same with Gamma Gun
---
Go to main menu in the game the one before you select a game mode, press triangle then select it from the news section. It will take you to the atom shop then load up the ps store where you can purchase it from there. under the "e3 tom bundle.
---
It‚Äôs on sale, just do it! Super fun!
---
Destory the sentry bots at whitespring, they drop cores.. Can get about 4-6 then server hop
---
There's one exception I've made in fallout 3-4. My favorite campanion besides dogmeat(s) was Charon. From the Ninth Circle in fallout 3. He has a combat shotgun, he usually only grumbles things. And he's just. Nothing compares
---
Medium multi player my guess is that what its at least supposed to be.
---
How about just no dupes for cards? Makes no sense for them to even be in the mode, you cant use 2 of the same card anyway, just give me a card I dont have. Once you've done most of the challenges and leveled up a lot it's pretty hard to even get a card and then when you finally do and it's a dupe its demoralizing to say the least.
---
sure about that? I got some radiation standing in one place.
---
Didn't take it as being a jerk.
---
Pardon my response i forget sometimes not everyone knows that my native tongue is sarcasm but I'm also fluent in irony, with a proficiency in over exaggeration, and wit.
---
I probably take the campiness of the Fallout Universe a little too serious but I'm with you on the clothes I just don't feel comfortable unless my character has her clean shiny red dress on I mean she's NOT a savage. Just a cold calculating death dealer. But you KNOW WHAT??? SOMEDAY SOMEONE is going to open up a restaurant in Appalachia, and not just ANY restaurant a 5 star one with the finest Deathclaw Wellington, deconstructed Mirelurk Tacos, and much more! THEN WHO IS GOING TO LOOK RIDICULOUS trying to get a table with your big sheep head for a hat?? To each their own but I plan on being PREPARED.
---
In all seriousness though does your OCD extend to the legendaries you pick up? Is your entire weapon cache just

---
Agreed. I know we can go in solo, but almost everybody else is in teams of 4. The odds are stacked heavily against the solo players.
---
\[PC\]
---
I guess I get it. You are trying to feel immersed in the game and then you have to witness a repeated digital squat to the face. Still, tea bagging is like a staple of multiplayer games. If you look at most similar modes, it's all about killing and tea bagging to celebrate your victory
---
I have more fusion cores than I know what to do with, and I don‚Äôt farm for them. I have a 1 * Power User perk and that‚Äôs all. So I‚Äôm wondering what the difference is? I don‚Äôt run in mine. And if I‚Äôm doing ‚Äúhousekeeping‚Äù work in the game (at camp, at train station, just walking around) I usually don‚Äôt have it on.
---
It's a Rad storm, they happen from time to time.
---
 When someone launches a nuke you'll know it. Everyone on the server gets a 2minute warning prior to launch. If you open map, will show large red circle of area of impact, giving you time to exit area if needed. If already detonated, same circle is still visible and affected area remains for a couple hours. You'll need a hazmat suit or power armor to enter the site of a nuclear detonation.
---
You got too much shit for a pretty good take. Once everything is done this game does lack anything engaging and many of the high end events are either boring or there aren‚Äôt enough players involved. 
---
Time to ruin myself but half the time it seems like people are kidding themselves of the problems with this game on this Reddit and it‚Äôs so disappointing. I love and enjoy this game don‚Äôt get me wrong but god damn does it have a lot of problems that for the most part just kept swept under the rug unless it‚Äôs something that is bad across pretty much any game (for example repair kits created major buzz for a few weeks but in game problems or shitty choices for end game content was practically praised or was viewed as fine) glad this community is doing good for itself but goddamn can it be delusional sometimes
---
\[take all Ricky's stuff and let him bleed out, you never liked him anyway\]
---
showed up st Lewisburg yesterday  to find a bunch of supermutants and 3 SBs, needless to say things got sporty especially since i wasn't in PA. I got them all just took a little while and some stimpacks
---
Well, get some more levels under your belt. High level characters need stuff to do, too. Acting like everything should be accomplished solo at low levels is kinda not what multiplayer games are about.
---
Yea, I‚Äôve stuck to the game since the server stress tests . There were times during the early phases of the game where I didn‚Äôt want to play the game for a few months because of the problems it had, but I‚Äôm glad that I stuck around long enough to see the game start to turn around, and I have been having tons of fun playing the new content from Wild Appalachia with friends and now nuclear winter although I never really liked battle royal games not even my friends but we‚Äôve been having a lot of fun and enjoying NW these past couple of days, and we are really excited for Wastlanders to come out in fall, and to see future roadmaps and content updates for the game! :)
---
try this i just commented to OP

" Go to main menu in the game the one before you select a game mode, press triangle then select it from the news section. It will take you to the atom shop then load up the ps store where you can purchase it from there. under the "e3 atom bundle"" 
---
I know you're on xbox but it should work the same way.
---
Sorry, how do you actually do this? Sounds ridiculous!
---
holy shit so its actually possible to launch the nuke and its different effect?! Love this game already ;)
---
Nice! I made it to final with that strategy too. I hate lurking (leftover emotion from my COD days), but when you‚Äôre in the center, I‚Äôm not sure what else you‚Äôre supposed to do.
---
They should just let us access it in adventure mode if its for the lore.
---
pick it all up? üòÇ
---
This game already has like 4 extra subs. Considering it's going to be a core mode of the game soon I disagree
---
I would love to have a dog or robot hang around my camp (which I need to move again, hard finding the perfect spot).  A human wouldn't be bad either, but hopefully it's not limited to generic female 1 and generic male 1.  If there was say... 5 to pick from at start and either more or customization options added that would be okay.
---
Probably a 25 yr subscription to one of the magazines, it's on you for not cancelling........
---
Also in the weight room of the Flatwoods hotel.
---
Unfortunately yes, this is a bug that's been happening as of recent. Submit a ticket to Bethesda so they know.
---
Thought you meant together! I been seeing a lot of that lately.
---
Don‚Äôt worry. Soon you‚Äôll have an attractive fly infested bloody meat pile instead.
---
That would have been neat if that was a perk to completing the mistress storyline; like we could continue to use that machine to level all our gear.
---
I know a secret location where if your team drops near by you can get a hell a lot of loot
---
Of course it is! Keep on playing. You'll experience one eventually. I'd rather not spoil it for you with details. But yes, game gots them nukes! üòÅ
---
I have literally 0 want to do anything that has to do with fallout pvp, on a side note, is the new content PvE based? And are energy weapons still total ass. I‚Äôm always an energy weapons build and last I played they were just shit compared to other weapons
---
Ugh, well that sucks, I spent like my entire first 2 hours gathering shit slowly. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I generally agree with scrap early on. But weapons fetch some coin at vendors so if you have a critical need for some Caps keep that in mind. Then go back to scrapping them.
---
Do the event at fort defiance you get 2 fusion cores each time you complete it
---
This has been happening to my friends and myself too, for at least the last week, almost seems like since the update/patch.  There's 3 of us that has had the same problem, we go to click on a friend thru the map, to teleport and the game crashes..
---
I am really glad you like it! You plan on buying it?
---
I think they announced today that they are leaving it up for longer than planned.
---
The quick scope of grenades and mines can create an interesting dynamic.  As for using on creatures, no offense, but if you have to waste AP on creatures in this game, that's not smart as you are hurting mobility that could save your life.  Right now, aiming and killing creatures without VATS is easy.
---
As for targeting mines and grenades, that is a niche.  Highly doubt MANY individuals will do that.  But have it be something like quick swapping equipment, calling waypoints or anything mainly combat oriented would be way more useful to a majority of players.  Again, this is mainly for controllers plus it can be a toggled ability in case some players prefer to keep VATS.  Kind of going back to my original post: the fact I have to give up my mobility to try and switch weapons is a MASSIVE nuisance.  Example from a game lastnight: I had a close range gun and a long range gun equipped within the first 2 minutes of the game.  I was in a hot area with many enemies.  I also had a melee weapon.  I ran out of ammo on both weapons.  I had 1 enemy left.  I wanted to quickly switch to that decent melee weapon I found.  Unfortunately, I had to stop to switch and fumbled the first pick.  Got it the 2nd time but it was too late.  If I could have at least kept running and dodging, there was actually a good chance of me winning since the guy was nearly dead.  This is a perfect example of how poor the control layout is in my honest opinion.  I would seriously switch up 5 or 6 button layouts if the D-Pad buttons were not locked.  Already have adjusted 4 in other areas.
---
Yes, but the odds are frustratingly low.
---
&gt; Companions will **NOT** follow you around in the game world or help carry your stuff. 
---
Then they're not companions, they're just NPC's.
---
If you just got the game I doubt you had that much junk, still that really sucks but luckily that glitch is not very frequent. Playing the game for about 4 months straight only happened once. Depending on your platform I could come drop you some junk that you lost.
---
The grind will make you want to commit........murder....... but getting the armor plated and high-capacity ones will change your play
---
Stealth Archer is neat when you use Conjure Sword or (I think they had)Dagger. Makes the non-sneaky bits a lil easier while not having to worry about carrying a big chunk of metal everywhere slowing you down ‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ°‚ñ° Then again, I always liked rogue/mage mashup builds so
---
T bagging is balanced imo, you do something to trigger someone and they kill you, and they have the T Bag perk they are well within their rights to use said perk.
---
Thanks for aiding the cause fellas
---
He said they do produce radiation
---
The first of many...
---
YESS BETHESDA I LOVE YOUUUUUUUU
---
Each zone is kinda level specific

---
Forest. Toxic valley. Ash heap. Savage divide. Mire. Bog. That‚Äôs the order based on suggested level ‚Äúrequirement‚Äù
---
I'd love to just be able to whip up a 2-station repair camp for armor/weapons and then trash when done, all within the main budget so as to not upset the delicate nature of the server stability lol
---
Yeah, it being a proper PVP GAME also helps a lot, objectives/goals/rules so on.
---
That was what I was going for, anyway. I'd buy a "Tobacconist" pack for 750 if it included some variety.
---
Doope kill some adventure peeps and make then rage
---
Thanks!
---
So why isn't that crashing happening to me?
---
Yea there is a good amount of new content that are PvE based, and yes energy weapons are still total ass lol, but from data mines there‚Äôs supposed to be some new plasma weapon coming to the game, fingers crossed that it‚Äôs good and not garbage.
---
Fuck that rule. Cheaters deserve nothing. Call them out.
---
I recommend storing your scrap ASAP, I know it can be hard. Luckily this bug is kind of rare so it shouldn't happen too often. For me it happens during events.
---
There's another fusion core generator at the power plant next to the teapot building to the bottom left of the map. All the fusion cores that i have came from looting them off of Power armors that I've found.
---
So, if it's a secret I guess you're not going to tell me where eh
---
Nuclear winter us pvp focused but their upcoming content Wastelanders is adding NPCs to the game, a story, factions and companions.
---
Dammit, stop stealing my soup...
---
People need to remember this is all brand new. They will make adjustments based on community input so keep the POSITIVE comments and suggestions coming. This is all new for everyone, lets help them shape F76BR into something amazing.
---
Your'e probably talking about this map below.
---
It's a loose guideline for levels. I'd suggest heading up to Grafton and trying to explore and level up as much as possible before moving into the next area based on the map. Otherwise eventually the biggest issue i see from most newbies is they rush the main questline and end up at a crossroads where they can no longer progress due to difficulty. I see them at level 20ish trying to get across savage divide and dealing with level 60+ ghouls. It can be quite daunting. Not saying it's not possible, but you'd need to be skilled, have amazing gear, maybe even a full team. 
---

---
My bad, I blame whisky :)
---
The game had problems at launch but has improved greatly since I play on the PS4 and it runs fine
---
I played the Beta, then left it 6 months before playing the full game. Absolutely worth it. It‚Äôs engaging, fun and it‚Äôs good that friends can dip in and out. It‚Äôs a smooth experience. 104 hours in and not bored yet.
---
i love multi SB fights, i wish i could lure them out
---
There are radiation suits sprinkled throughout Appalachia just pop it on when you see that radiation storm or get any clicking from your Pip-Boy. It is not totally radiation-proof nothing in the game is but it will slow down the RADS that you absorb.
---
Mk thanks
---
Lol that's funny, I can picture noobs in their lawn chairs eating popcorn going oooooooh ahhhhhhhhh at the splosions.
---
The One Tamriel update fixed most of that. Races are still organized by faction but you can now go anywhere with the exceptions of locations from expansions. And the faction thing doesn‚Äôt hinder your ability to play with others unless you‚Äôre in Cyrodil. You can still run raids and play battlegrounds with anyone.
---
Ok thanks for the input ill defenetly work on it later
---
Im not planning on using pa so this will be great then
---
I started playing in the beta last year and quit at level 30 for the reason you stated. Got back into it a month or two ago when they had a double XP weekend and now I‚Äôm nearing level 65.
---
First, I caved in an use PA in the toughest situations (I don‚Äôt like PA). Second, I finally got a Legendary weapon that matched my style (but not until level 40). I also caved in and started repeating areas, During the double XP this really helped me gain levels and perk cards I needed. Also, instead of scrapping everything I started selling weapons and paying attention to earning Caps. Then doing strategic buying of plans at the many vendors.
---
Also, I discovered I had missed places even in areas I explored a fair amount. Use a map like https://fo76map.com/ (deselect all) then start enabling locations in the safer areas and go anywhere you missed.
---
Don‚Äôt be afraid to kill a few beasts then run away if you need to. 
---
Track down locations of any treasure maps you have.i
---
Kind of, but it's still a little out from it.    
---
Here's a pic of where I'm standing on the map.  It's on the road NW of Aaronholt Homestead.  Still a bit out from 51.  
---

That happened to me. Spawned at light house and punches a guy to death cause he spawned right next to me. I got stuck in the house and the fire came and then I...
---
I think we should give it time for the hype to die down and we'll probably end up with a nice balance of pvp and pve posts.
---
Mk thanks altho im scared about trying to get upgrades but shouldnt be too hard
---
Mk
---
I am somewhat inclined to get 76 now. How much has it progressed?
---
Yes
---
I'm mainly keeping to the back and always making sure someone has their back watched when they're looting/hacking/pick locking. I've only gotten 3 kills in all of the games I've played but it's way more than I got in my whole Fortnite career. 
---
My school never offered any sort of help for anything, especially not that, but I may look into speech pathologists to see if I can get some sort of help for it. Glad you don't have to deal with it anymore, it's not the worst thing out there but definitely exhausting
---
Good point
---
It was announced today that it's no longer being taken down on the 17th and will be available past that date for anyone who purchased the game.
---
Tons of little bugs, like texture glitches, enemies falling through things when dying so they can‚Äôt be looted, enemies glitching through things so they can‚Äôt be killed during workshop defenses.. I think these things can‚Äôt be fixed considering they‚Äôve still there after all these ‚Äúimprovements‚Äù
---
To echo another comment, I found that athlete, archery, and swimming were the easiest to complete without a camera. Adding another place you can search for the tourist: at the top of landview lighthouse.
---
I claim unclaimed workshops to farm experience and whatever they drop then abandon them by server hopping so I don‚Äôt have to fight anyone.
---
Game is still free to try, in its entirety, until the 17th. It's not going to brick your console. This isn't Anthem.
---
Weird if that's the case.  I don't know what building that would be attached to nearby.  I'm in a farm/residential area.
---
wait picklocking others supply drop makes you wanted  im lvl 112 never knew  that i had it happen once and i thought it was just a new feature for all supply drops
---
I don't feel that way with NW, and that's what I like most about it. I can enjoy it even if I lose, especially when I have teammates who aren't dicks
---
It's currently free until the 17th. Check it out and decide for yourself.
---
Damn shame. Fuck battle Royale. This is bull shit. Go ahead and down vote assholes, this isn't fallout.
---
Ok, I preordered the game and played the game until December 28th 2018. There was very many bugs in the beginning but I still loved the game. I stopped because there was simply a lack of content, or maybe that was just me. But, with the announcement of NPC‚Äôs returning it peaked my interest. I‚Äôve started a new character and played though the game again and it has improved very much. There is a lot less bugs, player vending, backpacks, and a good amount of new content. Believe me this game isn‚Äôt perfect, still a lot of bugs and disconnects but I‚Äôm loving this game again. It‚Äôs a great game, getting better as time goes on. I like to think it‚Äôs like a fine wine, the older the better it gets.

Id recomend the fallout fandom wiki

Just type in fallout wiki should appear as one kf the 1st options
---
&gt;Also perk cards that increase the time don't really help with the amount of time they add to the cores lifespan.
---
Huh?
---
Happy Cake day!
---
I‚Äôm selling them I have so many.  Doing the same thing and rarely burn through one in a session.
---
Big Oof. Got any videos or images that back up theese claims? I don't wanna give up on a game because of false information , not saying that you would lie , but better safe than sorry.
---
I run PA all the time and I have cores all the time. They do drain faster, but if you're getting cores at Watoga etc, it's not unbearable. I currently have 11 full cores.
---
Dont smokers eat less? Maybe smoking cigarettes or cigars should decrease hunger. Maybe decrease AP, or burn through AP faster. But of course smoking a cigarette would dramatically increase Charisma right? Because everyone know that smoking is cool.  üòé
---
"we" hate it. Fuck this lame ass sell out garbage. You are part of the problem. Go circle jerk to fortnite and leave my jam alone.
---
I'm really hoping for a spot feature. Idk makes things nice without a mic
---
Here's where I'm at over by 51.  Pretty far out and it doesn't have any of those blue lights on around, so I don't know why that particular style light would be there.

I believe the zones reset every so often and take on the level of a new player entry to the area (with the exception of the starter zones) (i could be wrong).
---
Yeah man your text is all glitched never seen anything like that...
---
Naw I wouldn‚Äôt record that stuff lol, I still play the game they aren‚Äôt game breaking; just annoying.
---
Which would be fine, if it wasn't less effective than wrapping yourself in saran wrap.
---
Yeah, when I first started playing I wanted to wear those with my party hat and was disappointed to find out I couldn't.
---
The game definitely had and still has it's issues. But yes, a lot of the negativity has stemmed from youtubers and well other media just jumping on the hate bandwagon for views and likes. It's what's in basically. If your'e not bashing it, you're not making monies.
---
It is reoccurring. Every time you put a piece of tech data in the wall you get different loot. You can do it over and over.
---
Ah, probably for future content then
---
Boi I have about a 1 mbps
---
The energy weapons still being ass is a big issue for me, like I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt just be equal damage wise to most of the other projectile based weapons lmao. That alone makes me not want to come back to the game xD
---
Need been disconnected ever.
---
So it never goes away?? I keep putting the same tech data in there
---
Yeah it does include legendaries. So far I don't have more than 1 type of the same weapon so I guess at that point I might have to up my flamboyance haha.
---
It's meant to be recurring. It will start again any time you pick up tech data. You'll mostly get stims and bullets, but good stuff is in the loot pool. Like the BoS t60 paints. Some people will even buy tech data to farm this quest for the rewards.
---
It is supposed to take the tech data out of your inventory when you complete it.
---
Yeah, I dunno what I'm doing wrong, or if my opponents are supernaturally good at getting headshots or what.   
---
I've had decent luck using a combat shotgun and those perks, but even then, unless I hit someone point blank in the face, it takes me 4 or 5 hits to down them.  Never a one-shot.
---
And the revive button while in power armor.
---
Yeah, it feels like I‚Äôm 10x weaker when I‚Äôm in PA. It‚Äôs a shame
---
What is quality?
---
Humans are inherently biased.  "Good" is subjective.  What you're asking for cannot be given.
---
Why don't you download it to try it?
---
I mean from what I found from experience really the only good energy weapon is the Gatling plasma  , and that alone can be pretty op, combine that with perk cards for energy weapons, you‚Äôve got a pretty good energy weapon.
---
TIL You can turn Pacifist mode back on. Game Changer.
---
Now if only I could play on a private server so I don't even SEE another player (for RP purposes), then I'd be the happiest!
---
The cliff wall overlooking Watoga has a lot of dirt spots to place an initial foundation, then build out from there? I'm not sure what you mean by "jerky" when it comes to building, maybe I'm not understanding the basic idea here, though.
---
I would think that‚Äôs where knowledge and skill comes into play.  I wouldn‚Äôt tangle with a shotgun player as I know I will get wreck but don‚Äôt let me get you in my scopes as I‚Äôm build for sniping. 
---
It all just makes for different and fun rounds in my opinion. Everyone has a combat style and learning to utilize it better. Mix with a bit of luck, where and who spawns around you... makes every round has different outcomes.  
---
So far I think it‚Äôs an enjoyable setup.
---
look for player vendors with it.. they generally keep stuff under game vendor prices...
---
Welcome to fo5, no npcs no lore and no rpg adventure.
---
Fuck this weak ass game. Thanks to everyone that has helped ruin one of the last remaining decent fps rpg games.
---
Hope ya'll enjoy skyrim 6: battle Royale only.
---
I highly doubt this considering how the game is designed with weapon numbers and what not.
---
Oh yeah something like that would be real neat. The game *kinda* has that at the moment where it'll occasionally mark people with a red arrow above their head, but its pretty inconsistent.
---
Yeah, I took a shot of it too.  Been there since they added the sheepsquatch.
---
I'm at the top of victoria. I went with Telstra because they where doing a deal for $99 with unlimited data a while back. I'm yet to have a problem.
---
Bonus points if the patch notes say "Completely exonerated.  No collision."
---
This game is dope af. Been playing since release. Level 102 with 200+ hours played. I've played every Fallout game ever made. 76 was and still is a little janky but it's a wild improvement from launch. The new Nuclear Winter mode is a kickass diversion from the main game that can earn you things for adventure mode. NPCs, 2 factions to side with, companions and an entirely new main story coming soon. Badass.
---
The bridge wouldnt allow me to build anything on the canyon the way I wanted to.
---
Some military instalations have a higher spawn rates for ammo bags and mili tape i belive i can check the wiki if you want
---
I built mine in a tree
---
Thank you for not being a 12 year old franchise ruining asshole.
---
That makes two of us.
---
Sorry guys.  You're limited by us dirty console players' lack of keyboards.
---
Which one, handmade? Also is PA still crap or Normal Armor with OP legendary effects like Sentinel/Assassin?
---
I was talking to a coworker this morning, telling him that the only 2 games ive been playing lately are Diablo3 on Switch and Fallout 76 on Xbox. I told him about the new Battle Royal mode and how fun it was. I asked him if he plays it, and he told me ‚ÄúF&amp;$k no. I wouldnt waste my money on that crap game.‚Äù  I laughed and asked how does he know its crap if hes never tried it. His response was the same old, ‚ÄúIve watched youtube videos and read forums about how bad the game is.‚Äù
---
Pretty typical. Mofos ruin it for everyone. I made sure to do my best to sell him on the game and told him that yes it did have a rough start, but i still enjoyed it. And now its a fantastic game. Then i told him to browse through Reddit and read the countless number of posts from the free trial players asking why this game got so much hate, and that they are Loving it and most are buying it!
---
He said he thinks its on sale right now,(which it is), and he will pick it up on his way home from work!  Mission accomplished! Lol. 
---
My favourite is when i read negative game reviews on steam from people with only a couple hours or less on the game they‚Äôre reviewing. Pretty standard stuff these days.
---
They lowered the prices of clothing because people were doing exactly this and exploiting it.
---
I'd say go to lower level areas, clean them out, take all the weapons and sell them. Do your dailies and make sure to join up in events. Super mutants always drop caps, too. Bulk some junk you don't really use/stuff that's common that maybe you have too much of and sell it to vendors. Maybe take the Industrial Farm, use the food processor and sell it to vendors, too, along with other aid items you may have picked up but aren't gonna use/don't really sell in vending machines.
---
Also don't forget to use grape mentats if you have them to up your selling costs and lower buying costs
---
Theres no legendary in NW
---
Yes, bought couple games already to occupy my time but... I cant stop playing F76. Still thinking to wait for Wastelanders DLC to experience even better gameplay with npc's. Nevertheless F76 gave me a lesson to not listen to people who didnt play it or reviews which like to jump into hate train. Im 100% sure that if Fallout 76 would be created by different studio then it could get a praise instead of hate.
---
There are couple things to improve, especially survival mode(not a big fan of leaderboard in current state, it shouldnt show player location) but still Im having a blast in both modes. Playing coop with a friend in adventure mode. Yesterday we had so much fun in morans town where we cooperated with 3 random players to finish event(send food from the machine and defend the machine from ghouls/robots). Everyone was guarding different entrances and repairing machine. Loved it.
---
Survival... mixed feelings because of leaderboard but I had some cool stories. I met couple high lvl players who spared my life and exchanged some goods. Experienced horror story in morgans town airport, cleared the building and at the end I heard some mechanical sounds. I was wondering if I turn on some protectron or something like that. I was scared. It turned out that some 100+ lvl player was following me and eventually launched some lasers in my direction. He looked like judge dredd.
---
Love the game and I will buy it for 100%
---
They won't. This dumb ass br shit is captivating all the fall from a bus tweens that are going to ruin the franchise.
---
RIP fallout, you had a good run.
---
Whisky is just a catalyst.
---
But I want all of them :(
---
Im sorry, English is not my native language and Im really drunk. Forgive me :)
---
That's a good idea.
---
I think you mean "coup"
---
Between Flat Woods and The Overseer‚Äôs Camp there‚Äôs a truck on the side of the road with a gravel vein, if you set your camp up there you can make a resource generator to mine it.
---
The frame rate drop is just as bad as Far Harbour was (PS4 Player) but it‚Äôs honestly bearable. I‚Äôve had this game for about a week now and it‚Äôs quite good
---
So let me get this right. FO76 is now Fortnite with a new skin, and all our work on Adventure Mode means absolutely nothing? Glad I dropped the game for better titles if that's really the case.
---
Be glad that you missed it, the sub was really toxic for a while there. There was a post on the front page saying that they hope the presenters get booed if they announce a BR mode.
---
I told my friend i wish cigars were usable, hes new so hes busy trying to find everything he can in spots we stop at. I just want to dramatically sit by the front door smoking while i wait for him to finish so we can move on
---
Wow, color you yellow. Belly that is lmao
---
you can turn in 2 at a time for some extra caps. don't save them up, all tech data will be removed from inventory when turned in and you still only get credit for 2.
---
Sure thing buddy.
---
Fort defiance has a lot of mili ammo bags lying around
---
Yessir. Amazon is also one day shipping if you have prime. And it's a activation code, not a disc (pc)
---
Bethesda pls fix
---
I hope that the game really turns around in a positive way like Star Wars Battlefront 2 that had as bad as a launch as Fallout 76 but two years later with Dice listening to the fans of what they want in the game it has really turned around and is a pretty amazing game now and has a way bigger player base than it did at launch and 2017. But of course people love circle jerking and people in r/gaming still shit on the game who‚Äôve never tried it or even played it , I guess that‚Äôs how it is with haters and that‚Äôs how it always will be, the best that we can do is ignore the circle jerking hate and enjoy and play the games we like with friends.
---
I've noticed that.. it would just be nice to warn team mates near me, like in Apex.
---
Near top of the world if you do Rose's shit quests. Near Abbie's bunker if you do Abbie's shit quests. Otherwise choose a location that is convenient for travel and has 1 or more useful resources.
---
Isnt the nat king cole song in new vegas?
---
Excellent summary there! We have really came a long way.
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if not for the giant yellow stripes on the legs. But evidently everything Vault-Tec related has to have something like that.
---
Had the game since launch on PS4 has never dropped much
---
That would be great but I‚Äôm on Xbox lol
---
Thank you for the offer regardless!
---
Some of the overseer caches you come across have the plans to make the large ones
---
5 bags on top of the bridge near flatwoods next to the giant rad spill, a few bags in the shed at the cemetery north of the bottling plant, and 8ish bags at silo Charlie behind the main building.
---
The framerate is always bad, but bearable. I want to see it improved regardless. Some areas of the game run okay-good. Some areas run extremely poorly, like north of the map for example. Anywhere near those toxic lakes is easily 10 fps. 10 fps is not okay for any game.
---
There are a bunch of gravel mines you can camp by, but I always take the junkyard near the lighthouse. It has junk, wood, concrete and titanium.

Hi! Your post has automatically been removed because your post's title appears to be in breach of rule 6:
---
&gt; Use descriptive titles. Clickbait or extremely vague titled posts will be removed.
---
Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a longer, more descriptive title. 
---
*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) if you have any questions or concerns.*

You wouldn‚Äôt happen to remember specifically which ones have the plans?
---
You have to grind even more than you did for the backpack itself; so if getting that took a lot out of you, you might want to step away for a little while (I know I had to.)
---
Really?  That's interesting.  You can do the Free Range event near here, too.    
---
But does the blue light signify that?  Because I've found the event in other places and there weren't any blue lights around in those areas that I saw.
---
Weird.
---
So you're the Philosophical type huh? What i asked for CAN be and WAS given. By biased , i mean't no opinions from Moderators of this subreddit or a Bethesda employee. I don't want to download it and waste time and storage space , only for it to be a terrible game. That's why i haven't downloaded yet.
---
Right I agree, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs just the PS4 or both Consoles but sometimes it‚Äôs just. Horrendous, especially if I try opening my map while doing something the game just completely freezes
---
What a dumb ass thread. Does anyone realize that fallout has historically been an ADVENTURE FPS RPG?
---
Fuck this God awful direction the ip is headed.
---
Good luck filling a lobby in two weeks.
---
You know not what you speak. This will ruin the franchise, and honestly Bethesda deserves it for cash grabbing over what they are famed for.
---
Ad Victoriam!
---
When I'm in my power armor I'm always over-encumbered and burning AP (cores) without Power User, and I never have a problem taking a power plant for a short stint to rebuild my stores about once every 5 days to a week. I do not see the big deal.
---
I only recently purchased the game off of eBay (right before it was made free of course) and have been loving it. It‚Äôs a little weird without NPC‚Äôs but exploration has always been my favorite part of the game.
---
EX MACHINA
---
At the farm north of big Fred‚Äôs bbq there‚Äôs a shed with a wheelbarrow outside. There‚Äôs three bags in that wheelbarrow
---
Try camp McClintock there's a cache there idk if it has it in there though
---
Fallout was NEVER a pvp game. We wanted a decent fallout game with coop. Not this gay ass br shit.
---
R/ihadastroke
---
Screws are the worst for me, because vendortrons don't sell them. I sell chems and grenades to vendortrons to get caps. I usually spend them at player camps though.
---
Nope. Suicide doesn't work. Dying via PVE (jumping off a cliff) doesn't work. Letting turrets kill you doesn't work. Only if another player kills you or you wait the weeks for it to wear off.
---
Look, I'm not exactly a fan of PVP as it works in this game. Hell, I've been called a "care bear" by a lot of hard core PVP types. 
---
But  punching each  in the vault makes complete sense in the context of the mode. You are there to kill each other, to be the last person standing.  Everyone there is supposed to hate each other and be bloodthirsty and I'm completely fine with that.
---
PC! Sorry, I should have mentioned that.
---
Wow, cool. I never knew about that one.
---
I built on the cliffs over the ski resort...ish look around that area for a good place. Nice and central map wise so cuts on fast travel prices, defensible, and scenic. What‚Äôs not to love?
---
Liberators
---
Yes thats the main part I want looked into and fixed :) the freezing is seriously bad. Doing any sort of late game activity and having your game freeze every 2-3 seconds is the worst. Especially when an enemy you're fighting can kill you in 2 hits.
---
Lol don't spawn in popular areas. i kid you not there are times where one match this area is unpopulated then next spot is swarmed. the spawning tip seems a little bit useless though that could be a more on the side of luck lol. otherwise good tips.
---
Hahaha I found the same thing like a week back and just though it was a random glitch.....spoooky mysterious light!
---
I would be happy to help you - My game name is GUUUCCI
---
I went to save a guy once and ended up eating him instead.
---
Uh.
---
Oops.
---
No way this wasn‚Äôt planned all along (bar a super negative reception of Nuclear Winter), but good that it makes people happy.
---
Fill team is automatically on. You can invite friends from the main menu.
---
Screws are found in all the fans man!  Lol.  I hord the fans!
---
Find an area with mole miners (level dependent of course) slay, sell repeat.  I also have stared bulking my extra junk and selling it to get caps.
---
Camp McClintock and the fire bases in the cranberry bog
---
I got mine from at least one of the first four. Because I haven‚Äôt progressed past that.
---
Rebuilding America, one brown bag at a time. o7
---
Thank you for letting us know. Reporting to the devs now
---
I loved Automatron for this reason, for the most part, I find the humans to be annoying, I prefer Codsworth's soothing British accent to the snark of most of the humans
---
In addition to all the good advice others have given, there‚Äôs a very slight ‚Äúpay to win‚Äù aspect to NW.
---
If you‚Äôve got a PA skin or an outfit from the atom shop that‚Äôs dark or camouflaged you can select and favorite it in the atom shop just like with player icons. Then when you play NW your player will be wearing it and be much less visible than the default ‚Äúbright blue and yellow jumpsuit‚Äù
---
The scorched sometimes get this pose bug too. Super mutants seem to get it more frequently though.
---
Oh I feel stupid now, lol
---
Oh thanks
---
I saw 10 mins of shroud's stream, it was his sub-only chat telling him the game is shit while he was saying he was enjoying himself lmfao. If that's not symbolic I don't know what is
---
There was actually one at McClintlock, thanks for the help.

Is it here to stay indefinitely?
---
Glad I could help!
---
I feel Uranium Fever has been better and WS and West Tek worse
---
That's one of the reasons I haven't even tried NW. Unless its a scoped shot where I can take my time aiming I can't hit crap. The targets at Fort McClintock don't move or shot back and I couldn't even pass that without cheesing it.
---
Totally agree with Lucky Hole Mine so I'd say it's a good idea to set up camp at an acid resource.
---
Fun fact, those actually sell for very large amounts of money
---
I‚Äôm enjoying the demo. I‚Äôm going to purchase it when it‚Äôs over.
---
watch some videos or something
---
I hear you bro, I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre enjoying the game so much. Fallout is a great series, and long times fans know to take the good with the bad, with the exception of those who can‚Äôt adapt to a more social Fallout.
---
Gun fu was accidentally broken. The vats thing is intentional
---
A proper multiplayer fallout game was always going to have PvP in it. The issue was legendaries which completely unbalanced PvP.
---
Two steps forward, five steps back?  ‚òπÔ∏è
---
Don‚Äôt say that in this sub you‚Äôll be crucified!
---
I'd say it's worth.
---
Currently it's $17 on amazon so you might as well get it now before the sale ends, that price is a steal
---
You mean 1 step back. The gu fu thing is a step back. Many people didnt like that vats kept targeting more stuff and that's why they changed it.
---
So only 2 factions?
---
Really hoped for bos vs enclave vs raiders vs settlers
---
It might end up being a feature we see when they do the next update for it. That and re-queueing would be nice.
---
If that is the case you shoild be able to both quote him exactly and post a link.
---
I can't remember but isn't this Vault supposed to be part of the Vault Raids? If it is then they'd definitely have ZAX involved at some point.
---
From one of the machines or somewhere else?
---
But having a build that gives you extra damage doesn't take skill. It takes a perk card.
---
I absolutely wreck at NW when I find a shotgun, but not because of skill. Leaving it to skill and luck alone would, imo, be a better way to do it. Or at least start everyone on an even playing field for NW. Make sure perks in Adventure Mode don't work for it.
---
Should I start another Battle Royale circle jerk to fit in? üòÇ
---
From the machine
---
I think there‚Äôs enough of it lol
---
Which I kinda like now that I think about it, since it incentivizes  you to play the base game too.
---
I think this particular trait is cross generational, maybe as old as people itself. :(
---
You speak the truth though
---
Take workshops.
---
If you didn't like the looks of it day 1 you probably won't like it now. 
---
I've got over 200 hours time played and never bothered with the negative reviews because I thought it was fun.
---
They only last for a short time, an hour a piece I think. Instead of the old permanent upgrade
---
&gt;doesn't make you a better person
---
&gt;is referring to a video game
---
aight
---
Then congrats!
---
Stay strong, fellow Vault-Dweller. I just buried my grandfather who passed last Saturday on my grandmothers birthday who also passed about 6 months ago. You‚Äôre a great grandson to be honoring him in such a way. 
---
I‚Äôd be willing to do an in-game 21 gun salute if you ever wanted to. Gamertag is xXStoicTyrantXx
---
Finally for the first time just got the briefcase and all the codes... was minutes away from launching and my WiFi shit the bed :((( love this game mode tho lol
---
&gt; I don't want to download it and waste time and storage space , only for it to be a terrible game.
---
Oy vey.  "Good" or "terrible" is subjective when it comes to arts and entertainment.  Some people will tell you it's their favorite game.  Some people will tell you it's the worst game they've ever played.  You have to decide for yourself whether you personally like it or not.  
---
If your time is that valuable, don't play video games.  They're all a waste of time.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt it be awesome to switch weapons and not have that little micro-stutter? Or open up the map without a huge delay!? Oh god that‚Äôs sounds great üò≠
---
Yeah, I'll leave that to the others.  I'd swap to a different loadout, *if I had one*!  
---
But here, let me manually change my perk cards for the 15th time tonight. And then forget to change it back.  üòÇ
---
Yup, it‚Äôs an oddity.  Only place I‚Äôve seen it and nothing happens while it‚Äôs blinking.  
---
Never seen it not blink, though.
---
I would find it so genuinely hilarious if I got eaten instead of stimpacked that I couldn't even be upset.
---
There‚Äôs a vendor that sells legendary weapons? :o
---
Garden Gnomes! And the space in the fence on the west side of White Springs.
---
I would agree even though I'm too broke to buy that under armour, spent my atom's from challenges on camp stuff and some paint jobs since beta. I would much rather have an under armour that looked decent, they should add one to the loot tables for dresser's and such containers in NW. Maybe even a modded type with a lower chance in the high end random chests.
---
the Q&amp;A was total cringe.  I like how he kept getting back to his simulation theory, he really truly believes we are in a simulation
---
I was there. Confirm it really happened that way.
---
Dude they‚Äôre already downvoting us lmao
---
I‚Äôll be honest, its probably good it does nothing, in base game I‚Äôm tapping it all the time to see if anything‚Äôs ahead of me which is a habit going back to the launch of Fallout 3, whatever it‚Äôs switched to, I‚Äôd be doing it automatically.
---
That‚Äôs a bug. Does it end up working a way some people may like more? Maybe. But it is currently bugged.
---
Welcome to r/fo76. üòÇ
---
Fake raiders, as a ex beach boy the only true raider clan was the beach boys
---
You completely missed my point. Also , you can it with the, "\[Blank\] is subjective." , I wanted to hear reasons why people thought the game is good or bad. My time isn't THAT valuable FYI.  I just don't want to WASTE my time. And cut the sass , for your own sake. It's Cringey.
---
In the next lobby after my first win, ZAX said something along the lines of, "Good job, show off your victory to the other candidates". Which makes it even weirder that theres not even a one time emote to use after winning or anything to show off (plus no area chat).
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bn33ul/is_this_worth_buying_or_coming_back_to_the/
---
it would be so cool to open your pip-boy, go to shortwave and text with little robco green texts
---
House is just a house... Untill you add a sheepsquach plushy... Then its a home!
---
Yes please!
---
We survived until the end, then he killed all 4 of us. I was one of the silent dudes. There were 3 of us friended and you were the 4th. We were at the campgrounds and my buddy hacked the terminal and we know which direction they were coming from.
---
What a tease LOL
---
They're terrible, you have to farm coal.
---
Just drop some small purifiers and a generator.
---
Brutal, been hoping to nuke since 1st night I played. Heartbreaker losing WiFi at that momment.
---
My chick needs to be able to sit in her rocker on the porch with a corn cob pipe
---
Upvote the crap out of this. I've had people die near trees and the nuclear brief case drops straight into the model, so you can't even pick it up.
---
This sounds vaguely nsfw...
---
I didn't miss your point.  Your point is misguided and invalid.
---
The word "cringey" is usually used by 15 year olds who just witnessed something genuine and don't have the capacity for processing it, btw.
---
Since this is a new players thread, can I ask here instead of posting a new thread?
---
Can I join a server of someone I played with before without adding them? And if I move my camp, my house and how it looks will stay the same?
---
Thank you for this!
---
Maybe it‚Äôs not for them? The game is ok but I wouldn‚Äôt buy it.
---
:)
---
Bus to hell!! Right this way, move along please we do have a schedule to keep...
---
Dude., That breaks down to 32.5 days played. Game has been out since September 17,  that‚Äôs an average of 13 days a year... jealous lol. 
---
Just checked the leader board on https://www.wastedondestiny.com/leaderboard  
---
5692 hour= 237 days.
---
Took me 450 hours to get mine out of the machine at Flatwoods.  Now I can start on the main quest.  ü•ß
---
ty hadnt even noticed didnt show up on phone or laptop earlier today.
---
Jet makes you jittery!

I average about 1000+ exp if you make it to the end of the game. The cap rewards are not worth it but you can use the power armour skins and other rewards in adventure so if you‚Äôve played a lot of the regular game mode this is a fun way to indulge in PvP in a way that will level up your character as you go and risks none of your junk or aid. It‚Äôs a palate cleanser not a replacement, but I definitely see the gladiator mask and outcast PA skins as a fun grab for Adventure Mode.
---
I got one too the other day I stare at it sometimes in wonder
---
I literally did it in 5 minutes
---
That's what I thought, main menu Social Menu.  Had a bit of trouble earlier so just figured I'd double check.
---
To each their own but wouldnt that just reduce your real estate down range and increase the amount of the screen that's below head height?  Seems counter productive to what you actually want.  Either way I'm sure once mod support is live HUD mods will be very common and you can have any layout you like.
---
How do you start a heavy guns build? I know you can't find find a mini gun till 15 or so. How do perk it out without "wasting" too many skill points or cards?
---
Also there‚Äôs separate challenges for both collecting and using them
---
Go to Atom Shop, go to apparel section, when you are on an outfit you purchased it should give you a key option at the bottom of the screen to select for NW, once selected you'll see a mini nuke on the top left of the picture. Same with power armor skins.

---
What? It's not a fucking racing game, people should move freely and have instantly responsive controls.
---
beg to differ about the team... the worst teams I've been on were 1) unable to talk bec they didn't have mics, 2) ran hell for leather into combat 3) didn't share anything. The BEST ones I have been on looked out for each other, shared loot and stuck together
---
You can lower the aggression levels.
---
&gt;misguided and invalid.
---
Wow , it's like a phisical form of autism. How is me looking for opinions on a video game , "Misguided and invalid.". Also , you didn't invent the word cringey , and  you have no idea who uses it and in what context.
---
The game needs a text chat
---
My rank 26 and I'm still trash
---
Option to switch between them maybe? I'm kinda used to it on the bottom now lol
---
Love the mode, hopefully I do to reach some higher levels. Only level 11 atm.
---
ill add you, IGN panoflex
---
What he said!!
---
I highkey fucking hate this mode but UGH I want those rewards, I‚Äôm gonna have to tough through it &gt;:(
---
You'll understand one day when you're older.
---
Yes. You can trade in your unwanted legendaries too. Details here: https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/5v7FIGaz3bakvwrXsOZerZ/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-the-purveyor
---
Pings would be great for micers and no micers. They can ping high tier loot too.
---
My favourite machine gun in FO4
---
Best way to find any material you're looking for is to do a component search and just go on adventures.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! Thanks for responding! I‚Äôve had the game since launch but I have only recently picked it back up again. I had no clue this vendor existed.
---
BWAHAHAHAHAHAHA good point
---
I think the problem here is that so many creatures are completely immune to rad damage.  It seems like it's nearly anything that isn't a player.  Equip the Awareness perk to see what I mean.  Scorched?  Immune.  Ghoul?  Immune.  Super mutant?  Immune.  Ill-tempered mutated sea bass?  Immune.
---
I'm not at all against it, I'm a smoker myself so that'd b pretty hypocritical of me. But I think that'd be an unlikely addition as it'd be seen as "promoting" smoking. Which is negative attention I think Bethesda would like to avoid.
---
Fuck consoles and their rules affecting us.
---
From day one of the game I was bulking all my scrap and selling it.  At your lvl I was farming purified water for about 3to 4 hundred caps a day. Marine tactical helmet is still profitable, but hard plan to find.
---
As for ballistic fiber, all of the forward bases in the cran bog have one or two, but the west wing of Defiance is the most b. Fiber rich area in game. Also each straight jacket sells for 50capd...
---
Looks crap, like something you'd buy at kmart for $10
---
yeah that'd be best im getting pretty use to it as well
---
Lots of player vendors have them. I sell them for 150 and they don‚Äôt really move.
---
80 levels? Try 10 years and four games worth of VATS, I barely played any shooters before Fallout, now I‚Äôm absolutely abysmal. At least 76 forced me to start getting better due to the level 50 soft cap limiting my agility
---
I have the same problem, no idea of a fix so if someone has one then I‚Äôll just comment.
---
It's nothing new people will always hate games for whatever reason 76  is just the big one at the moment. Nothing new just people hating without doing it themselves. Just means more people to block and ignore.
---
Fo76 isn‚Äôt part of game pass.
---
I have experimented with a few "out of the way" spots and I am not convinced of being able to depend on any number of crates. Which is offset by there USUALLY being quite a few anyway. I had one run where there was virtually nothing around (waterworks) I had to run buck naked for way too long before i even had a half decent gun, never mind armour
---
I live this mode but everyone is already looted my the time the Xbox one x loads the map
---
Sure buddy. Judging by your name , i'm gonna go out on a limb and say that i'm older than you. Thanks for the entertaining 50 minutes , though.
---
Thats true but I thought game pass also allowed us to play any xbox game on pc
---
Yeah shit is stretched yo.
---
Haha my husband said the same thing. He finally got one of his badges. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Learn from me, ‚ÄúTeam Meatshield‚Äù is a very under appreciated combat role
---
I can my psn is NotBanned_ but I'm gonna get off soon
---
Why shouldn't he? It's a legit feature in the game and can use it freely to your advantage.
---
I am shocked at how easy the scorchbeast is to kill in this game! ...of course i have a 100% against all creatures perk too so ....
---
7 bags on top of monorail elevator, you need to take elevator yourself to get there
---
I mean when I stopped playing this was objectively false. Sentinel/Assassin and Sniping with Vats or automatic with explosive destroyed everything and everyone.
---
This is a RPG. Typically MP isn't balanced.
---
Nope only certain games
---
Try playing a scavenging only character. No buying, crafting, or repairing changes things a lot. The search for gear never ends since even when you do find something good you only have it for a limited time until it breaks and is useless.
---
I see. Well its still a great deal.
---
üòÇ
---
completely agree
---
Gatling plasma very cool for pve
---
Probably the 15 new vault dwellers around Flatwoods. Every time I login there‚Äôs a lot of them and only 2 people or so around whitesprings. It used to be the other way around. I hope they implement the NW reward system in adventure mode. Would be nice to, for example, get a free PA skin at level 100 instead of just a perk card.
---
Or just Radx ( diluted for us mutants)
---
[You should try ManyATrueNerd's video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5slMpmGlUGY)
---
I see.
---
Who? Massage me the video cause everyone I have seen loves this mode
---
I was having the same issue. Hard reset your XB, and it started letting me back in.
---
wanna try hopping for the coat?
---
Did you hit another server with the bot?!
---
Alright, I‚Äôll add you now.what level are you?
---
There have been some issues with Nuclear Winter (i.e. last night I had a teammate who got stuck in a specific spot where it took them a minute or two to finally free themselves of) but most of that can be chocked up to it being pre-beta.
---
Is it just fortnite fallout?
---
Ye, I don't really know what i want :)
---
the inventory respawns as far as i know, i thought i joined you server again haha
---
Yeah I have him here
---
Maga
---
Explosive and heavy weapon perks, froglegs and a grenade launcher. Nothing comes close :)
---
I was thinking the same thing; I was watching his stream too and I mean, my dude's channel is HUGE and he genuinely liked it. Because of that, I redownloaded it after 6 months, came in 4th somehow on my first run, and played a bit of the adventure mode again.
---
k we can take turns then, and i cant hear your mic if you're trying to talk
---
Workshops, I've been using dolly sods
---
‚Äú...isn‚Äôt anything better to hate on right now.‚Äù You haven been over to r/Pokemon have you.
---
Why ?
---
Haha, make it so people in photomode appear on radar and in VATS
---
Got one after a long time of hitting the machine then not even 10 minutes later found one on top of West tek.
---
OMG, that event is a killer. Thanks heaps for the info. I'll mark this one as "fixed".
---
Yeah I was trying. Mic isn‚Äôt working I guess.
---
The real fix to this issue.
---
Got my first one last night!
---
Which ones are broken? I was about to start doing them, don't want to waste my time though.
---
I agree, I wish they would add the ambient music from past Fallout games in the game as well to add more variety! I'd buy that on the Atomic Shop in a heartbeat!
---
Not sure if it'll work, but you could just do Nuclear Winter and revive a teammate there.  I'm assuming that counts.
---
Otherwise, you should post your platform.
---
I just wish there was some kind of 'casual', 'experienced', 'hard core', 'competitive' queue in team matching. I am just trying different things and helping new people but the hyper competitive tend to spout profanity laden rants which would have put Andrew Dice Clay to shame if he lived to the modern day.
---
Idk, but I‚Äôd like to have an NPC at my base to operate the bar I have set up. Even if they just stand there and actually do nothing, just the idea of being able to make my base seem like an actual establishment seems cool.
---
I‚Äôm not very good but you can add me maxm_1993
---
Finding a lvl 15 vampire handmade in a player vending machine? That'll take months lol
---
All right cool!
---
Try player vendors
---
ill stay connected here just keep relogging as you need for now dude.
---
Crap, crash to desktop.
---
After 2 level ups i can say hiding is better than killing. A team of 3 circled around me hiding in my bush and i could only imagine what they thought. They finally killed me.
---
the esrb actually rates games with use of tobacco overwatch actually has this on its rating because mcree smokes a cigar 
---
Im not saying its gonna raise the M rating the game already has but it might be added
---
[removed]
---
57
---
Sure sure.
---
These ones are by far the easiest, I'd reccomend everyone to do them, only took me one session to finish. Just get the crossbow first, get your kills with it as you do the other stuff, and repair it any time it gets a little damaged to get those 3 repairs knocked out. Oh and the bathing suit is in the porta potty near the start of the swimming agility course.
---
Sell for 1 cap.  Everyone vendor has them but @ 1 cap, it sells.... I've seen them go for 2-35 caps but no sell, according to my other friends.
---
Me too I'd like to set up a shop and have them behind the counter like the securitrons at the train stations.
---
This. I prefer it below for that reason. I‚Äôd be annoyed if it blocked my view down range
---
Most Youtubers are salty because Bethesda stopped giving out review copies to them and journalists Bethesda was like "we will let the fans decided and you can pay for your copy to review the game"
---
Thanks. You able to play tomorrow? After that I can play for a bit on mon-wed and pretty much all day after that
---
Loading in again
---
What region are you in?
---
It seems like legendary damage bonuses aren't "your" damage.  For example, when I blast something that's below 40% health with my Ex Combat Splatgun, they take a hit of regular damage, and then you can see a second hit in the health bar appear afterward.  I suspect that damage isn't "ours" but belongs to the legendary gods.  The same likely applies to perk damage bonuses.
---
Agree whole heartedly
---
Well i got a two shot gauss rifle and crafted ammo, now I need to find out what to get rid of cause my stash and character weight is pretty much capped lol
---
Don‚Äôt believe so as ranks aren‚Äôt shared, but I‚Äôm not 100% sure.
---
i got another long coat for my buddy so keep going for a few mins
---
I've noticed, rarely, that regular mobs are dropping them lately-- since patch 9, I think. I got two off a glowing one at WS and one off a scotched at the water park. Sentry bots drop them as well. And you can make them using one of each stable flux, nuclear material.
---
Pacific time zone
---
I think so. I was able to make the small crate on my alt and the alt hasn't played NW yet. Might be a bug
---
What's the big deal? Just saying? I picked one up for.......  get this, 15caps.  No BS.
---
Ok
---
Radstorm!  I remember my first one in Fallout 4.  Terrifying!
---
Yeah... Shroud has been streaming Nuclear Winter for three days now, each day like 10 hours or something. He keeps pointing out how the game is "troll" and "not serious" and "couldn't be competitive", but like every 5 minutes he's laughing and saying how he loves the game and is enjoying and how it's great.
---
And when this is pointed out to anyone; that one of the biggest battle royale streamers is loving the Fallout 76 battle royale, the first response is "he's being paid to say that."
---
Because of course Bethesda can't make anything enjoyable. /s
---
join my game IRL and see if you like being tea bagged after I murder you in the IRL game
---
just having dinner so i can stay on til you find one
---
I can definitely play tommorow, what time is it for you currently?
---
Your English is pretty incredible for a drunk person!  And better than the English of many sober native English-speaker friends I've known!
---
9:40 pm
---
I dont think u will unlock stuff like that for nuclear winter
---
Without batering perks only 20 sadly :(
---
Not all debates have to be hostile. I'm just giving you the honest truth. Even when the most balance oriented competitive e-sports games have a meta, I'm sure an unpolished mess of an RPG with slapped on PVP is going to have a meta too. :P
---
(PS: The Discord gave me pretty good answers, it seems Rifles and Heavy Weps are the meta! Especially with Stealthboy. PA is garbage, you want normal armor.)
---
They are because they‚Äôre atom shop items.
---
Imagine some people really don't like it.
---
How do you know when you get a reward? (Clearly I have not)
---
Nope. Never do lock up. And I love those big windows. The light comes in handy when I'm crafting Psycho.
---
Make emotes team-only, and yes, a "Contact!!" emote would be great.  The trick is relating which direction, unless there's a way for it to mark teammates' compasses with a short-duration flashing pip based on whatever direction the sender is facing.
---
Grape mentats, sweet rolls,(recipe in whitespring) unyeilding armor +low health. There is a top amount available for each item, no matter how high your stats .
---
You maybe able to... via Xbox not game unless you see their name in the recent list then you should be able to ‚Äújoin‚Äù game as a selection. 
---
Camp placement can be tricky if you move it depending on where you go. Sometimes it works other times not so much. 
---
If you‚Äôre lower level I would stay in the forest area of map since low level enemy spawn there.
---
Me too buddy.
---
Bethesda hear ya, Bethesda don care.
---
I‚Äôm not very good either.  Let‚Äôs make a team of not so goods. Wetard0d
---
So frustrating. Nada. Thanks for sticking around.
---
Does that work? I know in adventure the paper bag goes away if it's empty. But also the paper bag doesn't have collision I don't think.
---
You never know
---
yes, my bad
---
And its the only BR where I havr other modes putside of BR to play to consistently get good with the basic gameplay.
---
Congrats, it's worthless in this situation
---
As long as you have Pacifist on you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about PvP at all unless you pick a lock on someone‚Äôs camp or take a workshop.
---
Hmmm I'm looking to use shotguns, anything you could recommend there or would it be mostly the same?
---
Don't forget the jump Bug when trying to wire stuff.... drives me fucking insane sometimes.
---
A semi organised bunch of not so goods has got to be better than a random bunch of not so goods haha
---
I've had the game since launch and that button is still showing for me too. 
---
If they have your money, you're probably fine, keep track of your receipt email just in case though. So, if it stops working when the free days are up, you can put in a ticket.
---
Honestly I've tried. In other games I never feel like I make an impact, in this one I can at least fulfill some role as the meatshielld, calling out good drops i find, and pointing out enemies. So far I've had some really great teams, and some really shit ones. It's so frustrating when you're trying to go meet up with the one guy who just set up his camp and refuses to leave it, and a fire fight breaks out less than a hundred feet from him, but he refuses to do a damn thing. I'm sitting here in PA, soaking hits ans blasting away, and when I finally go down i see this jackass staring at his frog in a jar doing nothing.
---
Good call! There‚Äôs also a challenge for that to look for. It will List out the workshops you‚Äôve taken and get 40-80 atoms once complete!
---
Basically
---
Thank you that's all I needed to know
---
can keep going if you wanna
---
All rewards were already data-mined. Maybe in the future, but theres already the hellfire armor at level 100
---
Search fallout maps via google. There are a few that will show you where the acid is and there‚Äôs a few in the forest region.
---
Thanks that's what I was thinking but wasnt 100%
---
just gonna have a smoke now.
---
Yea that X-02 sounds like a good cash grab rather than a earnable reward
---
yup. NiceNameForMe
---
A couple more then I‚Äôll call it a loss. You‚Äôre awesome.
---
Holy shit the amount of hate on that subreddit is unbelievable.
---
How do they know they didnt hide the coding in some stupid folder no one would look in?
---
Have you considered that this game is unpopular because people don‚Äôt like it and not some conspiracy where everyone is lying?
---
Whoa.
---
But the player vendors are on NW. And while it's nice seeing all these new players, they are broke and my wares are not moving.
---
Yeah, I've been triple jumped by SBs outside that station twice! Pain in the ass. And agreed, not worth the ammo.
---
They didnt lol people data-mined based off of what was most recently added/changes. Not even top BR games can hide stuff in files
---
If you had Pacifist on that wouldn‚Äôt matter. You could sit there all day and shoot them and nothing would happen. This is why I pointed out to make sure it‚Äôs on. 
---
I farm a lot at SBQ and White Springs and having it on prevents you from causing damage to others.
---
I absolutely love it. I especially like that I can blueprint structures in adventure mode and use them in battle royale. It's been a huge advantage as many people have not been doing this yet.
---
There are more people that actually like the game than hate it, the haters are just more vocal.
---
Glad to help! There are a lot of great players and excellent sources like websites that help especially with walkthroughs!
---
Or maybe they just have the code ready and havent added it into the files and is just sitting on one of their computers waiting to be released
---
If you're actually trying, you can tell. If you're actually following your team and trying to help out it goes a long way.  It's the people who wander off and totally ignore that they're on a team that are annoying.
---
Then people will have an adventage. Defeats the purpose of a battle royle
---
You should build a tower on a cliff high enough they die when they fall
---
I bet he'll be level 50 and find those plans in his notes tab because it doesn't say anywhere that you have to redeem them.
---
Take off whenever. Thanks again.
---
Thanks. 
---
Wdym only sometimes it works? Does that mean if it didn't work I have to rebuild my house from scratch?
---
ok sounds good.  i just got lucky i think.
---
Shhhhhh! All your plastic pumpkins are belong to us!
---
No you unlock it in nuclear winter and use it in adventure is what I mean
---
Mine neither. Is free week over yet? :)
---
Ah gotcha
---
No. I think its vault 94 and 96 that are going to be vault raids.
---
No. They should always stay, duffle bags should never deapawn. Adds a new strat. ‚ÄúJust pin him in with our corpses‚Äù.
---
In BR, there should be a substantial difference between wood armor and nothing. There just won't be much difference between wood armor and everything else.
---
I will try this
---
LOL also you can tell they're fresh off the battle royal boat. one was meleeing my empty powersuit yesterday..??
---
I'm building small, one floor foundation bases now. They will be portable so I can move them occasionally. 
---
What I know about good location:
---
nice view
---
not near enemy strongholds &amp; no enemy spawns in base
---
central map location makes fast travel cheaper
---
some people think open water is important
---
Why is that???
---
I wish at the very least it had the character name in the mistress of mystery system. I‚Äôd also like for vendors to maybe say our names like the early bots did in vault 76
---
Shottys are my secondary so these work for meüòâ
---
lol You're doing the Lord's work giving these kids clean water!
---
Thank you for this post.
---
The chance of the machine actually giving you the pie is slim to none. I‚Äôve tried probably 300-400 times and haven‚Äôt gotten one yet! Yes you can find them in one or two locations or buy one perhaps, but damn would I feel like I hit the lottery if one popped out a portodiner
---
I'll bet it burns, burns, burns
---
I sell the Shielded variant for 1500. The base version maybe 200.
---
Yeah, it doesn't really feel like there's much difference between armor and no armor really.
---
Ash piles have been an issue since Oblivion.
---
Probably a couple hundred since it‚Äôs pretty easy to find in cranberry bog.
---
Let me know if it works, I need to do the same thing. :)
---
The rewards from NW have been datamined and no sign of X-02 being a reward was found, but they had to have retconned it in for a reason. I assume it will either be added in the Wastelanders update or be an Atom Shop skin.
---
Elon Musk is a scumbag and I‚Äôm disappointed to see my boy up there with him! Todd No!
---
I put my camp right next to flatwoods on the bridge for the exact same reason. üòÇüòÇ I'm always running around Flatwoods and close places. I check my map slot and when I see someone at my camp I'll run back. Greet them and give them a care package and welcome to the world.
---
Player Vendor had 3...
---
Not quite as much as I was hoping for, but thank you lol
---
You put 200 hours into a game you felt was difficult to play? You must not realize what you actually like
---
Kinda wanted a bit more from it, but thanks
---
I don‚Äôt think Bethesda cares that much about the lore but then again they retconned bos so who knows ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è would be pretty interesting tho
---
People already have an advantage; Perk cards are randomised. If you're lucky and get Heavy Weapon perks or other good stuff early on, you're going to kill enemies way, way quicker.
---
Oohh, I never do workshops so I forget you can do that there. Thanks.
---
Enjoying something is not as entertaining as hating something. Unsub and play the game. You're not going to win over YouTube clicks.
---
I have said it once and I will say it again Jim sterling is a idiot who hates everything who only got famous because another idiot sued him you can be outraged at stuff but if you are outraged at everything then your just a angry idiot trying to get attention.
---
Well let me feel like I accomplished something
---
Thank god. I haven‚Äôt been able to try it yet because it‚Äôs finals week next week and I‚Äôve been trying to study, and I was putting off making the painful choice of continuing to study or procrastinating and playing fallout...
---
But now I don‚Äôt have an excuse Bethesda. What the fuck?
---
If Bethesda didn‚Äôt try to pass this game off last year and instead release it this month, this game would be nowhere near as infamous, driving potential players away. I‚Äôm tempted to buy it
---
It‚Äôs just my opinion. Since player vending came out. You have the extreme low side and the overly wishful people on the other. If it were me, even though I already have it but if I wanted it. I‚Äôd go max of 500-800.  Prices will fluctuate based on what you‚Äôre playing on.
---
I have a heavy gun card :D
---
I‚Äôve tried to get it for years and it‚Äôs just a mini accomplishment
---
I've unsubscribed to essentially every Fallout YouTuber there is because of this, I think I'm down to one or two now.
---
I think the thing that got me the most which one won YouTuber said that Fallout 76 was trash and should have been at division 2's level of quality because it was a "better" game. However, he went on to mention that he hasn't played division 2 in months because he's been playing Fallout 76. Fallout YouTubers are just breaking their legs jumping on hate bandwagons nowadays.
---
Make friends with the submachine gun, the 50. Cal, the radium rifle, and Gatling gun! These guns take chunks!
---
I think the biggest hurdle for this was the fact that the games have been made for consoles first and ported to PC since Morrowind, instead of the traditional other way around.
---
I've flat out ignored other players on XBox, not because I didn't want to interact with them, but because I don't have a mic and I wasn't about to type out a whole message with the D-Pad when I can't traditionally pause the game.
---
You're right, though. Emotes aren't enough. I play RPGs for immersion, and I'm not immersed if I can't RP.
---
I want NPCs in the world to ask for help and lead me into a trap and kill me or rob me. Just a remind that the world is cruel. I seen a mr handy try and stick me up and was just a one shot. A choice of a couple different sides in a quest line and find out later on the path you chose was with the bad guys. Something within those lines. Maybe hiring an NPC bounty hunter that‚Äôs a higher level than the person I want killed. Being able to choose a random person in the map and then not finding out until later. But that would be to much griefing
---
Getting to Overseer level 100 gets you the Hellfire PA skin. There's that at least.
---
Much better.
---
This place has yet to let me down. I always atleast walk out of there with marine armor and a .50 cal or handmade
---
Smoke-a-Cola.
---
 It was a surreal experience when I could relate to my grandma through music lmao
---
I was just thinking that it would be cool because he actually got a Easter egg in fallout 76
---
Not really, all the items should be stored in your camp to the far left of the camp selections as a stored item (like your whole camp). 
---
You can select to store the camp which will breakdown all the parts individually to use again at no cost or extra to you.
---
If a game is developed for PCs and consoles, text chat is almost always ditched.
---
Known for a long time. Have fun building there when they wipe your camp in like 2 weeks
---
When he says it's not serious or competitive he is talking about an esport competitive game. To be fair he isn't wrong about that at all.
---
Absolutely! And even on PC I rarely hear anyone using prox chat, why would they? I feel like most people aren't playing alone so we assume they would be in a discord or a party chat right? A traditional MMO emote system and text chat would get people talking in game while they talk privately too.
---
I find voice chat immersion breaking.
---
I know where to look. That‚Äôs why I posted this. I got more than I could handle before the patch. I was leaving 1*s on the ground. Since the patch I have to play for like 4 hours to get 150.
---
I was in power armor and a newly grown tree stopped me
---
Raids! I think it will be cool endgame content.
---
My buddy got it for 20 bucks to play with me, logged on for an hour and said the frame rate was shit and returned it next day :( 
---
It's like people want a reason to hate it.
---
Why care about them?
---
I love the Gatling gun... I found a legendary one with 25% faster fire rate and if you upgrade to the speedy receiver it makes it more fun. Good balance for accuracy, range, fire rate, and damage in my opinion. And damn 250 round clip with a rather fast reload
---
Ultimate troll weapon, I've sold a couple for a thousand caps each. When doing a nuked Whitespring it works like a healing gun, you can heal the ghouls so they become unstoppable and kill the players, steel scrap... profit. 
---
Or I used it on legendary ghoul mobs to keep them up while using the emote "come to me" so everyone got a hit on them without killing it quickly, once the whole group got there an got a hit in I stop healing it and let it die, 8 to 10 people got legendary drops out of each mob instead of 2 or 3.
---
I'm not worried about PvP. I'm worried about RP and my immersion in said RP. I imagine my character being one step behind for the first 9 days (levels) of his journey into WV, and only catching up with another Vault Dweller on the 10th day/level, at which point he needs to be caught up to speed on everything they've done while he was lagging behind (join teams and learn from them until level 20). Then he can continue the main story missions and bring 76ers with him versus taking on the Overseer's mission Han-style.
---
Constantly running and gunning and looting and shooting and building and raiding with no immersive RP is just wildly uninteresting to me. It's why I never play online games anymore.
---
I think he is just talking about the whole game not just nuclear winter. There are so many fallout you tubers who make videos about how they hate the game, but then they just keep playing it and doing the same for views
---
Lol Very true also, I'm not building there mainly because I love every little detail of my current camp. It's a revelation to me though. 
---
You can argue both ways to be able to build there. Unless they do anything in adventure mode, it's an insignificant place to limit.
---
Wait... hating on a game over frame rate? Wtf?
---
This does put a smile on my face...
---
So we can have packs and packs of cigarettes all over the wasteland as long as no one lights one up?
---
At the same time though, it was inevitable in regards to pokemon.
---
Gamefreaks recent announcement was kind of the straw that broke the ~~camels~~ numels back.
---
Just checking, but the paint works on all power armor, right?
---
Wait so when do you unlock the Knight helmet?
---
*coughs *Pewdiepie* *coughs
---
The ring of Fire......the ring of Fire!
---
Your not wrong but I have yet to see one negative review on NW that was just mindless bashing
---
It is called grinding, it's meant 2 be hard and take a lot of time.
---
Shroud clearly really enjoys the game. It is fun. It is not a good esports game, but he clearly doesn't care. And it is great to see that he just goes ahead and plays what he wants to play.
---
And Fallout is, at its heart, pretty "troll." That is part of what makes the IP so enjoyable.
---
What makes you think that BR games are just for ‚Äútweens‚Äù because of fortnite? There are plenty of BR games out there that aren‚Äôt played by just children yet everyone likes to say so because the biggest one so far was indeed made for children. Silly idea really.
---
Second. Do you really think the ‚Äútweens‚Äù if they played this game to begin with at all. Cared about adventure mode to begin with?
---
I gave it more then a fair chance. Still wanted to see the lore and story, it is still part of my favorite franchise. I know very well what I like, and hoped that the game would have been in a playable state by the time I had quit. But alas the server still didn‚Äôt load scorched queen loot half the time, or it would crash before it would load, weapons were duped and abused to Shit, explosive weapons triggered the anti cheat and stopped you from being able to do damage. Who finds any of that Shit enjoyable, and you‚Äôd encounter that in every lobby, day in and day out. Don‚Äôt try and act like this game released as hot garbage
---
Might sound goofy but I do alot of vendor hopping.  You would be surprised with what you find.  Like a real garage sale.  I no longer wait for a nuke to get ingredients for flux when I can literally pick one up between 50-500 caps! That's where I found the pie which I've seen selling for up to 10,000 caps?!  Really? It's just a pie!!! Or am I missing something?
---
yes all the time, with my irl friends and online randos. I encourage you to report this issue on bethesdas website as it has existed since the game came out and is very irritating to say the least.
---
To be fair I love the game and I think the battle royale is shit
---
&gt; you to report this issue 
---
In Soviet Russia, this issue to report **you**!
---
^(this post was made by a highly intelligent bot using the yakov-smirnoff algorithm... okay, thats not a real algorithm. learn more on my profile.)
---
I did the same, what a waste of 700 atoms.
---
Nah. It shouldn't be a levelling farm.
---
It‚Äôs not intended.
---
I mean I kept most of my companions at one settlement in Fo4 anyway ahah, but I can see why some people will be disappointed, course nothing is definite so we may see things change after the update
---
Just had our team of 4 nuked, along with 2 or 3 others :(
---
Thank you! I'll send you an friend invite. I'll just wait until we're both on. Doesn't have to be today or anything. Ign is Legendary-Raider.
---
Cider!
---
Do you have any actual stats to back it up or are you just going my "I feel like this is true"? 
---
There is still a group of people who can't enjoy the game for technical issues there are, and I'm one of those. Constant crashes, game breaking bugs, network issues, server crashes,...of course some might be lucky and not have these issues.
---
I'm fond of Bethesda games (Skyrim alone has 10k hours across multiple accounts and that doesn't include the time I spent making, installing, and maintaining mods and fixes), but I'm not gonna pretend this game isn't their worst yet.
---
The faction I side with is going to be entirely determined by both who if anyone builds their poverty shit shack on my land and who has the best outfits.
---
Thank you as well young man. I got your reaction, so it is a victory to me.
---
Oh i would just pay atoms for that
---
Sounds good, I‚Äôll be on in about an hour and I‚Äôll be on for awhile. If you‚Äôre not on I‚Äôll catch ya another time.
---
XCloud will work for any game.
---
Have yourself a very pleasant evening.
---
 
---
* **Sprint:** Can now be used immediately after firing a ranged weapon.
---
* **Sprint:** Can now be used to cancel reload animations.
---
Of ALLLL the things that have plagued the game game since launch, this was one of my top complaints, and one of the things keeping my from playing the game. Thank you for fixing this.
---
Yea, I don‚Äôt like battle royal games either but I have to admit NW is pretty fun, just had a good game 5 min ago we were communicating with each other having a good time getting kills and reviving each other, we got really far into the game until we got outmatched by two guys in a trailer house.
---
Lead!
---
Is Xcloud part of game pass?
---
It heals ghouls, you can have some fun with game mechanics when you can create unstoppable ghouls just by shooting them with the wrong gun.
---
I bet is is! Level playing field....this is one reason I'm hesitant to play....I'm unfortunately a VATS player....which I know makes my actual game play worse!!!!
---
Because  VATS is not working very well in survival mode right now...my VATS perk cards especially, so it's become incredibly obvious how bad I suck at actual aiming!!!
---
Do they HURT??
---
Yea I have no issues with other modes. I have consistently above 90mbps and can play COD MP with no issues at all, so it just seems to be Nuclear Winter mode that is my problem.
---
Burn him! Burn the witch!
---
I‚Äôm not surprised, finding out you won‚Äôt be able to trade for older gen Pok√©mon would piss me off too. Yet they did the same thing in sun and moon. This is just to push the new Pok√©mon and two - three months down the road they will allow the National dex to be a thing.
---
oh I know I just told off 4 of them leaving my two cents on the topic. I won't lie I HATED this mode until I got to launch my first nuke and got my first NW BR WIN!.
---
Oh awesome, thanks so much for the help!
---
This is like asking someone who has cancer why they have it when you don‚Äôt.
---
The main problem was the game. The other problem is that we live in the age of hyperbolic ass clowns who are far less interested in being insightful in their youtube content than they are in being memorable. Being extreme gets clicks. If you don't enjoy a game, exaggerate the significance of anything you didn't like and talk like the game is unplayable.
---
Then a shotgun Or a pipe modded for automatic... point being that vampire is probably one of the more useful legendaries for lower level players
---
I logged off empty handed
---
Then you're just more unlucky than my level 20.  I haven't noticed any fewer drops personally, but RNG can mess with you pretty bad.
---
No, they're kinda seperate things. I think cloud is free though, if just for streaming games you own from your own xbox (as a server).
---
I‚Äôm going off of actual stats, and the crashes and game breaking bugs are not that bad anymore, I haven‚Äôt crashed all month nor have I experienced a game breaking bug in a long time.
---
Yep, this.
---
Only because many people that didn't like the game wouldn't go as far as to say they 'hate it.' But more people disliked the game than liked it.
---
Well, shroud appears to be enjoying it so..
---
Hold RB. Tap it makes you bash/heavy attack.
---
Agree. Winning should give u the xp not the killing
---
Elder maxon isn't even a fetus yet fyi
---
More likely Bethesda knew the game wasn't going to review well.
---
Oh okay thanks for the info
---
But the big thing is even though you couldnt get them transfered in at launch with Sun and Moon, they were still in the code.
---
Here, if they arent part of the galadex, they wont be in the game all.
---
shitty buzz.  sorry dude!
---
It's a lame way to be edgy and get views and such.
---
A day or two ago a user was following threads in this sub commenting on how FO76 is shit, didn‚Äôt improve, is broken, the new mode is crap, and Bethesda is a horrible company. As far as I‚Äôm aware, he was banned.
---
When outside of PA, swap out something and Serendipity lvl3
---
If your not a fan of pve and prefer doing what you mentioned, I‚Äôd say Survival Mode is totally you and there are a lot of players who love this mode as well! (It‚Äôs pretty fun!)
---
No they started this when Doom was coming out they said no more review copies and youtubers said oh the game will most likely be bad because ymthey don't want us reviewing it earlier
---
Curie, best of both worlds
---
It won‚Äôt be gone !
---
Anytime! Any questions just message me or this post! Be glad to help!
---
What timezone?
---
That last bit reminded of me when I mentioned the game to friends in a Discord server and one of them said that he played the game last year for an hour and uninstalled afterwards.
---
I've had a briefcase multiple times and 4 nuke codes multiple times. But never together...
---
They make new no build zones eventually. They have before, just a matter of time, since i dont think u can build by the other vaults
---
Until they can sell a functioning CAMP patch in the ATOM shop, they give zero s\*\*\*\* about it.
---
still RB
---
I honestly don't care about that until they fix the perk card system in that mode. After that, they can do whatever they want.
---
Actually when you move your whole camp gets automatically blueprinted. 
---
I too tried to blueprint my while camp and was only able to do a partial amount. 
---
However when I do move my camp it gets stored as a kind of blueprint and my purifier is a separate blueprint. That kunf of surprises me since I place it close to my foundation. 
---
This is better because it uses the actual pieces you have. When I've tried to use that partial blueprint I've created it creates all new components consuming resources.
---
I remember i got so excited the first time i ever got one.
---
Check out r/AnthemTheGame
---
What's wrong with your pet frog ?
---
Why? Just use third person.
---
You can block them in the game. You won't see them and they will not be able to interact with you.
---
Scorchbeast: Fus Ro Dah!
---
I don't get the YouTube gaming audience... For me that website is simply a vehicle to experience any media I encounter on the internet. I don't understand why people subscribe and follow particular content creators. Then again I'm old. I have a gut feeling it's just millions of children borrowing their mothers ipad.
---
100% need this
---
See, that's what I mean and how NW is so much different than the other team-based games I've tried out. Everyone seems to have this mindset for NW but it doesn't always translate to other games, like Smite for example. I'd get a lot of "hate messages" but it never bothered me too much because it was mostly just "uninstall" or "ur bad" or something hilarious like that. But I haven't had an experience like that in NW yet and it's why I love this mode so much
---
Naw, I like the collision, pile the bodies up.   
---
If they really in your way you can move them with a grenade or something.
---
True but I can‚Äôt see the company just discarding so many Pok√©mon. It‚Äôd just be bad business, the can always send out an update later on to fix it. Take them on or the National dex will Just supersede the galadex
---
Looking for help on PC revive ally + revive ally in water. Thank you. studna\_
---
I saw that after I made this post! And honestly, I'm glad, it's so much fun
---
"–ü–Ø3–î–Æ–ö" literally means "little a-hole" üçº
---
Damn I can‚Äôt believe you got that thing already!!
---
Regardless, people who need to come up with justifications to ignore differing opinions are no better than the hyperbolic youtubers.
---
Really? I remember saying a month into launch to my buddies that the game is perfectly set up for a BR. BR isnt for me, other ppl can enjoy it, but i just cant and that's okay. But creating a BR mode in games these days is just easy for devs, which is good for them because its the formula to popularity and cashed up coffers.
---
Thanks, appreciate it üëçüòä
---
yeah one of the more recent patches. You basically trade any unwanted legendaries at a legendary vending machine located near any of the normal train station spots. It gives you scrip points. you spend those points on a npc mole miner vendor in The Mire. near beck something. You still have to deal with RNG when buying other legendarys but its better than holding onto legendarys you are not using.
---
There have literally be youtubers who said they wouldn't buy another bethesda game because theu stopped doing review copies
---
I mean, they are throwing away megas and Z moves.
---
Im just happy people for once are gettint mad, and letting gamefreak know it.
---
Im looking to get back into it myself.
---
Yea but you'll almost never win and certainly won't make any friends.   
---
Then again, Vault 51 does say making friends is a bad idea.
---
Doesnt carry stuff... then what good are they?
---
Why don‚Äôt you learn how to do that? It‚Äôs the easiest thing to counter as well because you‚Äôll know where they land.
---
They last for an hour, but if you equip the curator perk, it‚Äôs 2 hours. And it‚Äôs play time. So if you use one and only play for half an hour, when you log in again you‚Äôll have a half hour (or hour and a half if you have curator) left on it.
---
Isn't survival just like the normal mode except there's no pacifist mode and anyone can kill you and the stat/resource management is harder and the enemies are more bullet-spongey?
---
That sounds like the opposite of fun. I haven't gone in there yet, but by description, it sounded like typical Bethesda Survival difficulty, but with other players trying to kill you.
---
Or maybe people could just get a mic?
---
I don‚Äôt know if you were the one who posted it, but I saw a similar story a little while ago. I cracked UP lol
---
Genius.  Pure, f‚Äôing genius.
---
Honestly, that‚Äôs brilliant. Thanks for the new strategy
---
I've still got that exact shotgun...had it for 60 or 70 levels. Love it. Someone will certainly buy that for at least 2k. I sold a similar anti armor in vending machine for 1776 caps.
---
How much warning do you get?
---
I had about fifteen or so plans before I got on a team and complained my camp was glitched and got asked if I read the plans. 
---
Cries in Tychus
---
I've found the console gaming crowd much more friendly and hospitable than pc. Just my experience...
---
You mean just  shooting a virtibird over and over again to get exp? Yea it's kind of real easy. Just requires a second person.
---
He knows their track record, we all do.
---
I always forget people listen to that neonazi-enabler.
---
Then I get sad when I remember.
---
The multiplayer fallout game should have less multiplayer and cater to solo players is what you're saying?
---
This this this
---
Oh snap, you‚Äôre right, ‚ÄúLove Me As If There Were No Tomorrow‚Äù WAS in New Vegas, I completely forgot! Thanks for catching that üòâ
---
Why aren't you playing the free week and find out?
---
Yea but Beth said they fixed it a few patches ago. Have you done it lately?
---
Why are you fixated on them? There were plenty of youtubers who bought the game and experienced the state at launch first hand. Why are you so focused on discounting people who played the game and didn‚Äôt like it? You liked the game. Nothing wrong with that. But a lot of people did not. I played maybe 2 hours post launch. Just bored me with so many better games to play.
---
Its more complicated than that. U have to have charisma at 6. Yoou must be twice the monsters lvl to tame. And it has to be a random spawn not a fixed spawn which most are.
---
I wish this would change as well. Mods seemed to be very strict from the start. It‚Äôs honestly been a bit of a buzz kill from the beginning. I love the game, I love the community, but the subs rules as far as video and picture posts is a little ridiculous.
---
There is no bus, this isn't FORTNITE!  ;)
---
What's wrong with the perks?
---
The Resident/s or ‚ÄòRessies‚Äô (According to the wiki)
---
I want to see full sets instead of individual items. Let us have chrome everything.
---
Fuck the gaming industry for not adopting controllers with more buttons.
---
 ‚ÄúElite‚Äù style controllers have 4 extra buttons and would solve a shit ton of issues if they were standard and didn‚Äôt cost $120
---
So you're saying reward the bush camping sit in the corner type of playstyle? i think that's fucked up
---
I sm not discounting them i am discounting yongyea or jim sterling who never played the game if a youtuber played the game then i take their opinions but if a Youtuber is like i never played it i never will it's a shit game then they have lost all credibility to critique the game
---
"....i just called to say i love you...?"
---
I craft them to give to low level players for free. Same with marine helmet and under armor
---
I honestly did not know that was a thing until right now.
---
Actually yeah. More than once in NW I have had teammates mention that the game chokes on their rig, but shit, you cant expect your 200$ fortnite trashbox to play FO76.
---
Yay, because it's addicting.  
---
Though broken daily NV: Challenges and duplicate cards is a little frustrating at higher levels.
---
Funny
---
Wait it's playtime only? Bobbleheads and magazines just went from worthless to nice for me. I always think as soon as I use one that I will have to stop playing for some reason.
---
Its still a tactic. You havent play a battle royle before? Thats usually how end game ends up
---
So they just follow you around and judge you. Great, its like my family!
---
I have no idea who those two are, but I saw plenty of YouTube reviews with the same issues I had with the game.
---
bad bot
---
And lead pipes, the weapon, have concrete in them.
---
Oh really? That too bad. Can it at least come attached to a submachine gun?
---
It‚Äôs stylistic, buddy
---
I went in there 2 days ago with a Lvl 5 character and just had Lvl 6 Scorched like normal.
---
What you're experiencing seems odd, and possibly sounds like you went in there right after a high level team triggered an instance.
---
I've played hundreds of hours of fortnite, apex, battlefield V BR and fallout BR along with realm royale. i understand tactics a little bit.
---
Ever need any help dm me buddy!
---
They are game "journalists" i watch juicehead and open world gaming for better news
---
Yeah, for a low level, this is probably the best location.
---
The Monorail Elevator has a lot, but I wouldn't fancy trying to get there before Level 30. üòâ
---
i sell the shielded for 777 caps or should i say try and sell, they do not move fast.
---
Lol what track record? Their track record for being one of the biggest innovators of gaming? Gamers are so entitled sometimes.
---
Ok cool I‚Äôll give it a try  thank you
---
The video game equivalent of the lines at Disney, Universal, and Busch Gardens...
---
Huh. Odd. My charisma is 8. Where do I find random spawn animals?
---
this is the best thing i've ever heard! XD
---
"Welcome to Appalachia! Have a drink!"
---
SURPRISE, MUTHAHUMPA
---
I think it was either last month or the month before when I did it.
---
Location i use is a bridge just south of harpera ferry but you wont be near high enough lvl for that.
---
Never, what we need however is Chinese assault rifle skin.
---
Faction War? I'd definitely play it!
---
I've played most BR games, even back when it was just a DayZ mod. H1Z1 and PubG were my favorite, until now.
---
Noobs, noobs always die.
---
They have confirmed that they can‚Äôt have NPCs in non instanced parts of the world at least not any time soon
---
aren't all arrows technically spiked?
---
It was in my xbox settings itself, nothing in game.  It was System then Settings.    Then I did Privacy and online Safety.  Under that, I selected Xbox Live privacy  and made sure I had voice chat with everybody selected.
---
I previously had stricted privacy settings which only allowed mutual xbox friends to hear my mic, so no one in game could hear me and I could not hear them either.
---
I hope this helps!
---
What system
---
I'm new to BR, so maybe this is a dumb comment, but what if we got 1 experience for every 1 damage we do to players, maybe 0.5 xp for damage to AI, and 0.75 xp for damage to Elite AI, and a flat bonus for kills?  Then you wouldn't get all the credit for swooping in and finishing someone off and you wouldn't get nothing for knocking someone but missing the kill.  I think connecting lots of shots on target shows more skill than just kill count.
---
Im sry u played fortnite
---
You can team with others and or raid with others and why I suggested based on what you said. 
---
A few players here have talked about that quite a bit!
---
Xbox 1
---
Sadly, they still do. That's when its so great to go in through the window.
---
I mean, people are allowed to dislike the mode. I don't particularly like it myself. Who's to say that people aren't just being honest and saying that they don't like the mode, because they just don't like the mode...
---
And this kind of whiny-ass post is why i'm unsubbing from here.
---
This is so wholesome I'm crying rn
---
I know the Plasma got buffed recently and is far more decent, not sure about lasers, I still think they're subpar.
---
I would tell you but then I would have to kill you. 
---
Actually now a days I sell everything. One of the reason I keep the one place secret is because the item is light which is important if you can only earn 200c at a time and have to FT from vendor to vendor. Since the vendor pool has been combined I can gather every dropped weapon, every unbroken down piece of junk and take it to the nearest train station and unload it.
---
I picked a place that‚Äôs pretty. I care not for resources I‚Äôm terrible at managing that crap anyways.
---
I'm joining you now
---
Adding
---
Huntersville has a group of...8? or so in the SE section somewhere.  Great source.
---
Bloody brilliant
---
This would be an excellent way to introduce Bow-specific targets like joints and weak points in Power Armor and other things, giving it a specific use advantage over other weapons to make it unique.
---
Nice point!
---
IGN Sgt\_OKeefe. I'll be online tomorrow morning from 8:30 to Noon EDT and can help you out. But, it really isn't that hard to change your build. You can move a point every level. I've completely changed my build several times and still have banked 25 options to change it again.
---
I hate it as well specially cause I rock iron clad taking out fusion cores though that‚Äôs genius
---
Honestly the backlash against it though has been so much quieter.  With Fallout 76 there are angry raging neckbeards over the fact that Bethesda didn't make New Vegas 2.0, and with Anthem it was sort of like the writing was on the wall and Bioware looked like they were on their last leg after Mass Effect Andromeda.
---
I have over 1000 ballistic fiber for sale at my vendors, someone usually comes along and buys 200-300 of it at a time. Check player vendors from players over level 100, you just need to find someone who is a master race power armor user instead of a legendary hobo.
---
Because it's a meme weapon, and just like any other individual legendary it is extremely rare compared to how many people want one to screw around with. Also, it still does good damage to ghouls with the right mods despite what people think
---
;)
---
Same boat. Was 17 bucks on Amazon. Mmo style games are always rough at launch, as well as most Bethesda titles. Glad I bought it but also glad I waited.
---
lmaoooo really, they're saying he's getting paid for it?
---
probably because the sub would get flooded with memes instead of discussion about the game.
---
I once played a game of apex legends and noticed shroud was in it since he was on the top team which gets advertised to all players. It came down to my team vs. his and none of us were very good. I lit up one guy but then someone got a noscope crazy kraber headshot on us that became a clip that was watched like tens of thousands of times.
---
And then go the Arcane Archery route with special bow tips that you could craft to do fire, cryo, electric, or radiation damage, or to do less damage but have a higher chance to cripple.
---
you can keep ghouls alive and blow off their limbs with it
---
Yes you get XP for your normal character
---
At this point the only people even following Pokemon are pretty much the diehard obsessed ones, so I guess it's not surprising.
---
It‚Äôs West Virginia, you‚Äôre only allowed to say,‚Äùwrassle.‚Äù
---
Thanks for the tip, I've not even thought twice to check them.
---
Thx, I didn't know this. I guess after playing adventure mode for so long one gets used to ignoring a lot of content that would otherwise give you nothing.
---
slighly cruel but very funny. Bonus points if you do it wearing a clown suit.
---
They can also give loot in adventure mode, although it's *much* rarer. I got a diluted rad-x from one yesterday. In NW, I think they're guaranteed to drop stuff.
---
nice makeshift trap!
---
Rejoining. I reckon you crashed out?
---
im so fucking sick of it tbh. Everyone is saying that NW is actually really solid. Meanwhile "some" people still insist on enabling the narrative of "lol Fallout 76".
---
yeah kinda, wait now that I think about it exactly, almost
---
You gotta scrap lots.
---
I'm Level 17 and have a similar experience. I recruited a group of people fresh from the vault and we went down south. We made it to the Nuka Cola Factory which was really cool and they were really fun.
---
I don't understand why you would support the game even if it is decent now. Why would you support a company that would pull all of the garbage that Bethesda did?
---
I had kind of the opposite in one of my last games. I had only just loaded and spawned and had just enough time to grab a Switchblade from a chest of drawers that was right in front of me when I suddenly had two people come running at me with nothing but their fists. They both tried punching me to death and I quickly killed them with the knife. I couldn't have been in the game longer than 5 or 6 seconds and had 2 kills already.
---
Same bro - seems incredibly low, also on some weapons seems like 0.001 percent chance to get a mod.
---
The perks create a huge seperation among players. Not to mention there was already supposedly an exploit on tuesday that rewarded infinite packs.
---
Nope we‚Äôre still in
---
The community supports each other because we are all we had during the whole launch to pre launch.
---
I have used that feature WAY too many times haha
---
I'd laugh!
---
I have a mic, but I would just prefer text chat. Easier to understand and less prone to loud environments.
---
I've been abusing the bushes + third person + holstered weapon. (Anyone with common sense does this.) But I had no idea that photomode basically let me launch a silent, cloaked recon drone. Thats nuts.
---
They need to disable 3rd person and photomode it seems.
---
I always gave my boi codsworth legs with automatron
---
Hey at least fortnite is keeping the real noobs away
---
Thats the correct answer.
---
Yeah right, I've played since beta stopped. I just got back into it and i feel so under geared now. I'm lvl 80 and everything over  powers me
---
Whats wrong with that kinda hard to like a game if you cant play it
---
Any info on the method of exploit? School research project..
---
that you Oxhorn?
---
I think it's good for the community, showing how we / you care about helping those that need help to start their survival in a unforgiving world. One step forward, two steps backwards kind of way.
---
None of them played it to any extent. You can tell that with every single "reviewer" who chanted "no npcs" 
---
There's no human npcs. Anyone who played the game for a fair amount knows that. Anyone who can quote the press release accurately knows that. And I'm talking about Rose, I'm not even including Mia and Vlad, Grahm, Rachel, prize bot, etc... Even the vendors should be considered npcs.
---
I played before Season 1 began and stopped when it got hyped up..
---
I do, the only thing I get mods for has been weapons
---
You can place camp for free. I'm using a low level alt for battle royale so I dont have many resources but I built a decent 2 story tower with walls on the 1st floor for stimpak cover and concrete barricades around the second floor perimeter that are perfect for crouched shooting. The structures can be destroyed but the enemies give away their position in the process.
---
How much does a movie cost? How long does that last? 2 movies? If you get 5 hours of gameplay, you've equaled 2 movies.  Well, unless you bring a date...
---
I was wearing the swimsuit
---
Don't worry we're all still around playing adventure mode. (Don't like NW anyway.) The problem is the number of free week newbies is 1000x that of the veteran players playing prior to free week. Come Monday it will all go back to normal for the most part, or at least half the servers will be vets again when the free crap ends.
---
The one I saw in a video was around 20 seconds
---
once the servers start tracking damage correctly ill consider enjoying myself. until then this 100-level content grind is a slideshow of load screens and chronic fps problems.
---
if anything this mode is just proof that no matter how old and busted your engine is, any studio can tape together a br to monetize cosmetic microtransactions
---
Tesla's range is limited, don't look at the range stats in the pip-boy. They are probably just for calculating the hit chance. Unless it is explosive Tesla, then it is just an explosive firerarm that runs on fusion cells.
---
Also in my experience a direct hit with Tesla seems to deal less damage than a reflected bolt. So in my opinion it is better to aim at a surface nearby your target than use VATS and hit it directly.
---
Cannot say anything about lasers, don't use them.
---
Penguin0 just uploaded a video called "Fallout 76's battle royale is awful"
---
Mfw power armor isn't even competitive in BR mode :(
---
Yes, playtime only, which is really awesome!  Otherwise I wouldn‚Äôt bother with any of them.
---
I finally won my 1st match day and it was a really great feeling
---
I tried to get the younglings to kill me when I got wanted for theft. Nope. They just wouldn‚Äôt shoot back.
---
Over E3 and Bethesda‚Äôs conference they were, but I guess now they‚Äôve actually tried it they may have changed their minds.
---
I had the same issue. I ended up swapping the buttons manually from the options menu in 76. It solved the issue for me.
---
I agree...   I'm now level 230+ but I had many help me out, even in the early days.  One player even gave me a level 40 TSE shotgun when I reached level 50.  Needless to say I killed myself a lot with it until I got the Fireproof perk, but it was a symbol of how much I've been helped along the way.
---
I kept that TSE shotgun until I could find another to pass it on to.  I've been helping another player recently and when they leveled up to above 40, I passed down the TSE shotgun...  the legend continues...
---
I don‚Äôt want a skin for that. I want it to show up as it‚Äôs own rifle using 7.62. Maybe a dlc that has an old Chinese base with dead US soldiers out the front with the R91.
---
I was able to buy the additional Tricentennial DLC by itself for $11.99 from PSN store today.
---
Excluding Raider and Excavator
---
The Music one, the one where you craft a frog habitat, the leatherworker one is virtually impossible since Deathclaw hides are extremely rare.
---
you say that like he doesn't accept money in exchange for showcasing games as an influencer, but he does this regularly and it's a common practice in the entertainment industry. if you think you can trust any of his on-brand opinions then obviously you're the reason this type of marketing works.
---
My first team experience was shortly after I'd started exploring mutations after I was lucky enough to get Marsupial as my first mutation at a low level.  The teammate, who had invited me randomly from across the map, shared Strange in Numbers(enhances your mutation's positive effects while teammates are also mutated), both a perk and a feature I hadn't discovered before.  I was used to jumping over fences, but now I was jumping over entire trailers in the Toxic Valley.  Now, I invite random people when running large events, legendary-yielding events, and nuke parties.
---
... you know you can just wear a full set of matching armor if you want to, right?
---
It is worlds ahead of where it was. Glitches are really rare, and there's lots of new content. Plus this new BR gamemode in which you can earn exp and caps for adventure mode. I love it.
---
You could just move your camp.
---
Gotta keep scrapping. It takes a lot it‚Äôs honestly worth buying them. If you want to make sure you are able to learn them from scrapping and not take my word you can put armourer perk and scrapper perk on. And craft leather arms and scrap them. You get more supplies back then you use and learn leather mods.
---
That would be a good way to separate them, actually. Realistically speaking, the purpose of the compound bow is to alleviate the need for the strength stat, so you could have:
---
\-Long Bows  that require barebones resources to make and have higher range than the other 2 types, but the condition is harder to maintain and each one would require a certain STR based on its stats.  
---
\-Recurve Bows that give you higher Accuracy and RoF, but cost more resources to make and do less DMG.
---
\-Compound bows that can be fully customized with a number of attachments to increase each individual stat of the weapon and the STR requirement is cut in half, but require different resources to make and have the slowest RoF.
---
How much are they sold for?
---
The only ‚Äòbad thing‚Äô about Star Wars battlefront 2 were the ridiculous micro transactions, the mechanics were smooth and did exactly what you‚Äôd expect, my laser rifle would break after 10 shots at game lunch with 76 , not sure how early you started but yeah 76 had worse of a launch
---
I felt like the cool older sibling, showing them the good loot in life.
---
Look me up when your on and we can wander. Late nights, Chicago time. Gt: Gr8dne42
---
Hahaha hahah. Love it.
---
I must‚Äôve missed that. What was it?
---
A proper fallout multiplayer experience, aka the one fans have been asking for since 3, is one where they can wander the wasteland with friends. Not this idiotic pvp bullshit.
---
Although I must admit that the non br pvp might have been more appealing without the cheap ass one shot invisible invincible armor builds.
---
Yeah I don‚Äôt want explosive energy weapons, too silly.
---
Said so in the patch notes...
---
I‚Äôm not gonna lie, it took me a while to realize it too. Finally noticed when I read a banner during the load screen
---
07 lmao
---
true dat
---
Drugs and alcohol are in the game.
---
100% agree. Even quick texts, similar to emotes would be better. Especially with new players not evening know how they work.
---
Probably yes but I have to admit that an explosive Tesla shotguns are fun to use ))
---
This needs more upvotes, I‚Äôm tired of seeing new posts about adding new stuff when honestly fallout 76‚Äôs biggest problem right now is the constant disconnects sometimes literally minutes after joining a new server/resetting your console. It‚Äôs getting ridiculous when you can‚Äôt even complete an event or a daily quest without getting disconnected over and over.
---
I swear there's some shenanigans a foot. I am playing 3 to 4 characters concurrently so keeping track of their inventory is iffy but I swear each should have multiple pieces of data. Each time I go there I figure I'd drop them and turn in a piece at a time but when I get there it shows I have just 1 piece. Like it combines them all.
---
My brahmins demise put tears in my eyes
---
Wrong. Some people don‚Äôt wanna use that shitty app to post pictures.
---
Craft it at an armor station, under Outfits.
---
just go to your armor crafting bench and should be in there
---
Craft it at the armor workbench.
---
Armor workbench you craft it there
---
Thank you! I‚Äôm trying here, this community is so wholesome I love it. It‚Äôs a pay it forward world out there, not just a wasteland.
---
I bought the Appalachia guide outfit thinking the same thing, it would be hard to see. I can equipment but it replaces armor. I picked up a wood chest piece and suddenly I'm wearing the blue vault suit again.
---
I just stumbled on it today and I figured with the number of times I've seen "x perk is not passive!" It wouldn't hurt to share.
---
What platform you play on. I need friends
---
 Lol
---
I'm on xbox
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the server stress tests, but yea I get what you‚Äôre saying.
---
As a Digimon fan Mega Evolutions were the closest thing I've had to a good handheld Digimon game for a while.
---
Was indifferent to the Z moves but when they started killing the Megas in Sun/Moon I was really sad.
---
Give me the short angry stogie, dirty army helmet and pants with no shirt and I‚Äôll be happy
---
I wait by the vault with a bunch of level 5-10 BOS Hunting Rifles to ensure their survival in this wasteland
---
Bless your sole. I wasn‚Äôt too intrigued because i figured they were just collectibles. A little disappointing that they aren‚Äôt a permanent perk like in FO4, but I can live with it.
---
I‚Äôm stuck between two camps , I‚Äôve played since beta and defended the game for so long, but I also get mad at newcomers who can‚Äôt understand why anyone would ever say anything bad about the game lol
---
He could have it set to login automatically to his account. 
---
On Xbox you have to create a new user first then once you do, you can start game and it will ask you if you want to create a Bethesda account...
---
Thank you!
---
I would at least love a robot or dog companion
---
If you play 8+ hours a day and abuse the mechanics, you can, but even I'm impressed someone got it this quickly even doing all that.
---
That‚Äôs upsetting I‚Äôve found one before I don‚Äôt remember the other effects but I just traded it for scrip lol
---
PS4, unfortunately. I am definitely looking for people to play with though as well
---
Free fast travel no caps needed! lol
---
Somedays yes somedays no hopefully they fix it when it comes back
---
Have you tried Many A True Nerd, or is he one of the 2?
---
Which I did. Well, I signed in to my account rather. Just after I made this post I loaded it in and it took me to character creation rather than his character. He told me he's like level 50 while the loading cars said level 1. Maybe it's just typical Bethesda
---
Smoking is bad for your health. 
---
*takes a cocktail of Buffout, Psycho, Mentats, Day Tripper, Fury, Overdrive and whiskey*
---
I‚Äôve always hated that hopping around like an idiot actually helps in these types of games
---
I know I‚Äôve only been able to play a couple hours a day (at the most) and I just hit 20 earlier today and I was pretty stoked about that! Lol. I got a LONG way to go!
---
Same here! I managed to snag the tricentennial version for 18 bucks used at gamestop. Surprisingly, the code inside for the bonus stuff actually was unused!
---
I was thinking why is he asking for opinions when opinions are biased by nature.
---
I understand that they want to let people explore the vault and discover the lore, but Apex Legends has made me realise there is no need for the pre-game lobby, just let me go straight from the main menu to in a match.
---
sounds like the worst kind of torture. who would do such a thing?
---
&gt;I laughed and asked how does he know its crap if hes never tried it. His response was the same old, ‚ÄúIve watched youtube videos and read forums about how bad the game is.‚Äù
---
Some people prefer that other people do the thinking for them. They'd rather not give a chance if they can just be told what to do by somebody else.
---
ESO is freaking great dude. The lore is very good and while not being a technical power house its very nice looking. And classes don't really matter, you can use any playstyle, you just have different powers to use. unfortunately, the magic system is no where as cool as the BGS games.
---
You can deploy your camp like you do in campaign just FYI.
---
Everyone else is a circlejerk ... but not this sub. They are 100% wrong, we are 100% right. The game is good. Everything is fixed and balanced. If you do not like it you are wrong. It is all the youtubers fault. Only we can think for ourself. Only day good things. There are only good things.
---
They are bad, the game is good, we are good.
---
The energy weapons are pretty amazing in Nuclear Winter, but still total ass in Adventure/Survival.  I'm not going to use energy unless I can find an exploding laser gun.  PEW PEW
---
Look for "depth of field" in options
---
If you're on XB, a hard reset helped for me.
---
I saw a bit of stonemountain64 playing today and he had a similar sentiment. Some of the peanut gallery was shitting on the game and he only answered people who openly asked what he thought of the game. he was very objective with his opinion and said he liked it and would keep playing for the next few free days at least.
---
You may see his level one picture like from the vault but the only character you should be able to choose is yours. 
---
If you can select his, it‚Äôs not your account.
---
First: grammar. Learn to effectively use it because your argument is incredibly hard to follow.
---
Second: yes. That is my point precisely. Tweens DON'T care about adventure mode. Fallout is, and has always been an rpg first and shooter second. Fallout is NOT a pvp shooter. But the devs seem hell bent on destroying what makes fallout different. This cash grab has nothing to do with fallout. Hell, why not turn elder scrolls 6 into a fucking BR. I'm sure the long time fans won't object. 
---
If you wanna jump out of a gay ass bus and go circle jerk around for ten minutes I don't begrudge anyone for that terrible life choice. Just keep it the fuck out of a game I've loved since the first isometric top down, lore rich, adventure/rpg/shooter fans have supported for almost two decades.
---
Its here to stay now as far as I'm aware
---
You can do blueprints in adventure mode and place these in NW, it only takes seconds. They'll probably remove that though.
---
I had an explosive laser Gatling that was 20% bonus damage to scorched. Never used it because it always used to bug out and not do damage way back then lol
---
Hello!‚ÄôHow‚Äôre the kids?
---
If you build it in one spot and set your camp somewhere else, you can use that entire blueprint instantly if you have the room to set it down.
---
People pre-build structures in adventure or survival and blueprint them. They can then deploy them in NW
---
Cool thank I'll give it a go if it happens again
---
I thought it was just running for a week I hope you‚Äôre right I really didn‚Äôt expect to enjoy it as much as I do.
---
Luck buff, because if you‚Äôve got a pupper you‚Äôre a lucky person
---
Way too high recoil, even a controlled burst is hard to control.
---
Ad Victorium brother. Sad to see this once great franchise get watered down and castrated like this.
---
dear future team mates:
---
If I go down, leave me. If you try to revive me without controlling the area, you'll die right next to me.
---
Go to the lfg! There is ALWAYS someone looking for team mates on their!
---
Ugh I don't like that at all.. been enjoying this a lot I'm up to rank 37 but now everyone is just huddled in their pre built 4 story buildings. I really don't think this is good for the game. You definitely shouldn't be able to use a blueprint.
---
A humidor it's in the terminal at the taxidermy place on the terminal behind the desk
---
Scraping is much rarer on armor mods than weapons, sadly.

 here's the tweet to confirm
---
How is the shotgun version? I have two shot explosive Tesla and I‚Äôve always used the semi auto barrel... curious how that barrell might perform
---
Just made my day
---
No. Unless he had the PA suit to help him. His agility is the equivalent of trying to eat oatmeal with a butter knife.
---
Hey papa_Skekels. Do you happen to be on PS4 , cause this story your telling seems just like what i came into the other day. I showed up like 5 minutes after nuke drop. An she was bugged outside of the nuke zone by the one mine site. Flying in the same spot? I think there was 4 of us for 10 or 12 minutes then a few ppl rolled up
---
Just happened to me. Restart the game didn't help, happened again. I'm trying the hard reset that was commented to see if it works.
---
Level 2 wakes up in watoga lol
---
You can‚Äôt get duplicate cards. If a card gets unlocked that you already have it is instantly ‚Äúsold‚Äù for 50 Overseer XP. It‚Äôs happened to me twice so far.
---
ALL SHEEPLE üêë AMIRITE!!!!!!!!
---
Baaaaa baaaa youtubers baaaa
---
On behalf of new plays thank you!
---
Probably +PER.  Nicotine is a stimulant and people sometimes use it to calm nerves and focus.
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app /incident10
---
You're going to get this error a LOT. Building in this game is finicky and buggy. I've gotten things to work that SHOULD work by exiting the game and restarting. But sometimes things just will not go where you want them to go. I've got 30 someodd camps under my belt and every single one was frustrating in one way or another.
---
Hopefully it stays an active mode for awhile.
---
Probably going to be awhile before I jump in since I'm still trying to focus on clearing out the map/finishing all the non repeatable quests.
---
First: k
---
Second: like I said, do you really think the tweens were playing adventure mode to begin with? Like you said they only came for the BR mode. All those people you saw in adventure will be back once they either get bored of BR or they open the vaults.
---
Yep there's random encounter ones that are unowned that are safe too though. Just have to watch for the steal text on the activate button.
---
It sounds like you‚Äôre looking at this from a very biased point of view. Now I am sure some youtubers do it for views but just like the vast majority fallout 76 isn‚Äôt a popular game. Nuclear winter might be a solid addition to the already saturated battle royale mode but you have to understand. Fallout is fundamentally an RPG. The majority of fallout fans never wanted an online version of fallout and even more fallout fans do not care for pvp and battle royales. The reason youtubers are mad at this game is because bethesda have taken a franchise that a lot of people hold very dear and sacred and skewed it quite horribly with this game. All of them and all of the people like me who don‚Äôt enjoy the game wanted to enjoy it. I really really wanted to enjoy it but it just isnt an experience that most fallout/elder scrolls fans enjoy. 
---
Now the overall point of my response was simply to say you obviously enjoy the game, and thats great but what these youtubers are saying isnt for views. Whilst it might be popular to hate on fallout 76 there are very good reasons for that. A lot of fans felt pretty betrayed by this game and especially how bethesda handled it. You need to stop taking the fact youre in the minority so personally and just enjoy the fact you enjoy the game. Hell I envy you, I wish I loved it.
---
Yeah I spawned in ran into the building like 10 feet away and immediately got gunned down by an assault rifle. I'm just like wtf.
---
Except it is, it feels very Fallout.
---
You can also just ignore this game mode and wait for Wastelanders, which is going to be VERY Fallout. More Fallout than Fallout 4 in some ways with the way the dialogue is going to be.
---
I remember back in my day, petrified corpses gave loot. -rocks back and forth on rocking chair on porch- But then, Godd Howard decried that no more! would the statuesque char folks give sweet, sweet stimpaks. -knocks out tabaco pipe- Yup.
---
I was looking foward to save the world but then the BR came out
---
Love that movie! Hated when I was younger. I didn't understand any of what they were saying. Watched it like 9 or 10 years ago an had a blast lol
---
Yeah lots of people do that.
---
Same. Is not that I don't agree with "this game doesn't deserve the hate it gets" but at launch it definetly deserved some hate.
---
I still remember the poor performance and loosing my Camp, it doesn't mean it's not a great game but people had reasons to complain.
---
Fallout 4 never claimed to have a lot of choices.  New Vegas however sold itself as being filled with "choices", most of which ultimately meant nothing.
---
Take the medicine skill: NV has at least 7 different opportunities to heal people with a Medicine check, yet the only one that really means anything is Caesar, and even then it's not really a choice for most characters since failure only means something if you side with the legion and can't save him through any of the other means (repair, luck, quest) since failing the check, not doing the quest at all, and assassination all have the exact same result.
---
It's patched
---
Are you buying from the robot vendors for those prices? Do you want plans or a gun?
---
When you first start out every weapon is a throw away. You'll basically be leveling up pretty fast to hold on to any weapon.
---
That.... That's the problem. Just because it gets thrown into the trash immediately (Let's be serious, 50-150 Overseer EXP is nothing), doesn't that mean that duplicates don't exist. Almost half of the perks I got have been perks that I already had. And now I'm around level 32 and have an incredible hard time to even get more perks, and if I get one, it has a big chance being something I already have.
---
That doesn't work for under-armor, the devs forgot to add that to the favorite listings, thus they are 700 atom paperweights.
---
Plans and robots right outside f Welch
---
"You can shoot up opiates and get blind drunk, but by God, if you so much as think of enjoying a nice Maduro cigar, you're the devil!"
---
It sucks they are getting rid of them but it seems Game freak is going for some new gimmick every game now. Mega, then Z now dynamax or whatever it‚Äôs called.
---
It seems to be a decent damage sponge for 1v1 situations but that's about it.
---
I bought it on Xbox live, $30 idc Pay to stay home drink a bill and download it
---
Super mutants drop screws fairly often at higher levels.
---
ONLY GOOD THINGS
---
All things are good in fallout76.
---
My favorite feature is how when I‚Äôve just cleared a particularly hard area and I‚Äôm half dead someone wanders by and everything spawns right on top of me and kills me. I also like how they made a camera necessary for many of the atom rewards then gates it behind RNG you can spend tens of hours server hoping (another great feature) and never find it. It‚Äôs an incredibly innovative way of creating content with only the slight trade off of making it harder to get atoms by playing. Innovative.
---
Don‚Äôt get me started on how awesome it is that enemies/builds are balanced so that they vary between one hit kills and massive bullet sponges. That‚Äôs very cool.
---
I downvoted you because you are bad and have been brainwashed by youtubers.
---
I didn't abuse anything bro.
---
Just make sure your team mate doesnt want it.  Had a team do this before and I was WTH man?  Haha!  He had to run back and plug me in.
---
Really not going to argue what you do with your money but i'm reminding people they have better options.
---
When I still had the +100 damage to creatures perk on, they were like screechy sky kittens... that you could kill so easily.
---
So easily...
---
So are there some servers that never crash, some that crash occasionally, and some that crash often? I just manage to get connected to the ones that never crash? Other hapless players somehow keep connecting to the ones that crash all the time?
---
I‚Äôve found that, in most cases, exiting workshop mode and reentering it fixes the issue
---
You can't tame any creature, it has to be a random spawn, alone. 
---
Here's a map of random spawn points: [https://i.imgur.com/HzUrefq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HzUrefq.jpg)
---
There's no guarantee that creatures at these spots will be Tameable, but it is possible to find tameable things at most of these spots.
---
Accuracy and listed range is worse with a shotgun barrel but you can charge it for maximum output. It also depends on whether you use VATS or not. The best solution would be to try it on your own. I guess a two shot explosive Tesla will fire one more pellet than a quad one or vampire's. If you want to try a Tesla shotgun I could mod your Tesla free of charge, if you have fiber optics (like 12 or 16 pieces I guess, charging shotgun barrel seems to be the most expensive to craft).
---
There is a perk card that lets you do way more damage to buildings
---
Gun plans are hard to find outside of the robots. Lever is a great gun, but it‚Äôs costly to make, and the mods are not learned easily. My second character is high charisma, if you want me to see if she can buy them cheaper if you‚Äôre on XB1.
---
My camp is just north east of Arktos Pharma, pretty near to the start of the game. I have a lot of early-valuable things very low priced (15 caps for hunting rifle plans, 10 caps for stimpacks, etc). I had a level 3 message me saying he didn't have enough caps but he wanted the hunting rifle plans. He asked if he could give me ammo instead. I told him to give me a minute, while I made a fully kitted BoS Recon Rifle with 200% durability, full deep pocketed leather armor, and dropped him 300 .308 rounds. He tried to give me everything in his inventory but I told him "Take it, we're all survirors!". He hearted me a hundred times, added me as a friend, and ran off into the abyss with his newly acquired gear. I'm only level 47 and started 3 weeks ago, but it feels nice helping the new players, presumably here for the free week. Show them the game is worth buying and the community is worth interacting with :)
---
It would still weigh 10 pounds even if they added this, it would simply be displayed from your stash.

I‚Äôm on Xbox
---
Fortnight made billions of dollars with their "free" game. Nobody "had to buy" anything. League of Legends did the same thing.
---
I click on image links of I want to see the images. But I'd be happy to be able to see stuff right here, too.
---
They're not going to ditch the base game.
---
It‚Äôs like everything else in here. RNG. These cards are kind of like scrapping armor and weapons to learn mods. After you learn most of the mods, you can scrap hundreds of the item and maybe or maybe not unlock the other mods you need.
---
I noticed that tobacco has its own rating stamp, but it's usually not enough to bump a game over Teen from what I've seen. At least, that's how I always remembered it.
---
Millenials killin the country, ruining videos games..
---
I know it's not too bad to change, leveling a new character is also helping me get back used to the game. That'll be great timing for me, I'll send you a friend request!
---
The whiskey is very important, especially if you're self-conscious of your image while exterminating other players in NW.
---
You misunderstand, I'm saying you cheated or broke any rules, I mean used the game's mechanics fully to your advantage, aka third person bush camping, photomodedrones, etc. Basically I'm saying your not playing the mode like a newbie. :P
---
I no where to get the mg42 plan free
---
It's part of Twitches terms and services that you have to declare if you are doing a paid promotion (as per FTC guidelines).
---
Where?
---
I think that actually may be a feature in the next large update series (the one after wastelanders), on the roadmap there was a mini-sentry so it‚Äôs possible and seeing that a lot of people seem to want it and that Bethesda is listening to fans, it‚Äôs likely at some point.
---
The game has improved, they have fixed bugs and the game is more stable. However, for the vast majority of fallout fans the bugs whilst annoying were not the downfall of this game. Hell this is fallout were talking about. It literally has a rep for buggy releases. This issue with fallout 76 for a lot of people is the content. The majority of fallout fans want a solid rpg like the games predecessors however that experience doesn‚Äôt exist in fo76. Fo76 more closely resembles a game like destiny, where you play through the story level up then grind out instances and stuff for loot. Now there is obviously a market for this kind of experience but fans of games like fallout 3-4 and new vegas generally arent of that demographic. I jumped back into fo76 after E3 having not played it since january. I am level 75 and have given the game a solid shot however even with the new improvements the game still doesn‚Äôt hit the right notes that im looking for in a fallout experience. 
---
Some people do jump on the hate bandwagon I agree but there seems to be a lot of ignorance from people assuming everyone that dislikes the game is one of these.
---
I‚Äôd like to see some kind of infinite dungeon rouge like procedurally generated vault. Like, you enter with nothing, equip as you go, loot gets better the more levels you get down. Go until you die, then get to keep everything you had when you die.
---
But I am a worm and only if Todd wills it so, all praises be to Todd - giver of Battle Royales, Band of youtubers.
---
I can buy the lever gun plan for 1458 if that helps.
---
Check settings to make sure it didn't get repathed?
---
That would. Thx

The newest update does make sprint cancel things.
---
Second this one. Great ideas.
---
probably a bug, submit a ticket
---
The youtubers have brainwashed everyone to disagree with us about Fallout76. We must be the water to their fire.
---
I think it'd ruin your experience to have anything given to you in the early stages, but that's just my opinion.
---
Anyway, I don't think you should get attached to any type of weapon until around level 20. Until then, the weapons you get won't exactly be good and anything you pick up will most likely become as obsolete as fast you can find it. You'll want to scrap (so that you can learn mods) or sell most of whatever you find. I wouldn't personally worry about modding weapons until level 20/30. 
---
When you do start building up a setup for the endgame, it really depends on what you like? My current setup is focused on pistols/VATS but I have a shotgun and some perks for it as well. I'd really recommend picking up the shotgun perks because I only have one and it's already ridiculously high powered
---
Join me at Whitesprings. My gt is AaronCarr. Team up if you need fast travel.
---
It's a poopoo/peepee color scheme...
---
Is it above stairs?
---
Try moving the stairs, build the roof, then move the stairs back.
---
Ok. My name is HFD comrade. I will be on at about Tom o‚Äôclock eastern time
---
I think that is where a lot of the built up anger was coming from. 
---
Game freak does a gimmick, and then almost never follows through on working with the gimmick. To me, if they just worked on improving what they have already, and then introduce new things we wouldnt be where we are right now.
---
What garbage would that be exactly?
---
Gotta go in solo and learn how to sneaky snack. Spawn in, get rid of that bright blue jump suit, find a nice bush in the safe zone, and wait. I get into the top 10 every time, one time I even reached third place without even picking up a gun (spawned near a bunch of people and ran the hell out of there, couldn't find a non-looted box after that, got shot when trying to loot a player :P)
---
Lol wtf? Cuz that's comparable to being tea bagged in a game to you?
---
At the pleasant hills cemetery there is 3 safes that take level 3 lock pick to open but u can get the mg42 plan from them I get 1 a day I'd give u one but I'm on ps4 u unlock the safes but dont take anything out if u dont take anything out u can server hop until u find the one with the mg42 plan the most it's taken me Is 5 server hops but it's a for sure drop spot for the mg42 plan once u take something from the safes u will have to wait until the next day to do it again so dont take anything out unless u find wat u want this spot also drops deathclaw gauntlet plans and some other heavy gun plans
---
You were able to repeat the NW daily in each match, so you could get perk cards every match. They've turned it off, though.
---
its not hard to break the walls lol
---
Probably not an oversight, upgraded underarmor would provide an advantage over other players, thus the devs limiting favoriting items to cosmetics only. Then again, it is still in a BETA test mode, so who knows what the final mode will be like.
---
I was reading this thread while waiting to load in, and once I got in the game I was killed by the same guy.
---
Alright
---
They could please both sides by having a version without legendaries and one with but needing two separate characters. I would love an adventure/survival mode without legendaries and wouldn‚Äôt mind keeping one that does. Gives you an incentive to roll multiple characters and not feel like your time was wasted on the one with legendaries.
---
Basically, if you're at the epicenter, you're fucked.  If you're at least halfway to any of the edges and notice it soon enough, you can probably outrun it.
---
I‚Äôve been doing the same and had a level 86 get pissed at me for dropping bulk scrap and known plans to a level 16. They take up space in my stash. I‚Äôd rather a future Enclave recruit have them rather than me. They were mostly worthless plans anyways.
---
Jim Sterling bad! It‚Äôs not ok to write off a game juat because the launch was nearly unplayable and clearly not out of beta, and they knew it, yet still charged full AAA price before it plummeted within weeks, knowing it wasn‚Äôt a AAA game. That‚Äôs not a cash grab! 
---
This OGN article really sums it up, Jin Sterling should take notes!

I just rebuild at every spot, cause it's my favorite thing to do, and the blueprint system kinda sucks. It does blueprint your whole camp, but good luck getting it to actually work.
---
Why?
---
Go to a source of water. Pop a Rad-X or put on a hazmat suit. Spam the collect button into your at max encumbrance. Drop just enough dirty water to be under, then fast travel for free back to your camp.
---
Been there done that,apologized over the mic. But I am sure it didn't sound very sincere as I was laughing so hard at finding out that was even an option...
---
Try harder.
---
I already knew fallout would be great for a battle royale game several months ago and everyone just treated me like shit for saying that and acted like I had 10 dicks growing from my face.
---
Yeah, that is totally true. All depends what others are going for
---
Ten ET tomorrow morning?
---
Spawned with 4 enemies in the same house. Got smashed into the floor by a flurry of fists.
---
Yessss
---
Hell yeah, if you can multitask 20 different characters then more power to you. 3 is hard enough for me lol
---
Yeah, that's called not making it fair or fun for everyone. Giving everyone a one shot button isn't the way to allow your dad to play, letting him play adventure mode in pacifist mode is.
---
Good launch. I hope you got some good loot. üëçüèº
---
His channel went to shit a while ago and now he‚Äôs just another ‚Äúgrump old man‚Äù personality who hates everything. He even streams ‚Äújust chatting‚Äù most of the time.
---
About 400 hours gameplay. Maybe 20 with other players. There‚Äôs a lot to see, a lot of stories to follow and I don‚Äôt even pvp yet.
---
Fort Defiance + the tons of military outposts across the Cranberry Bog.  Each outpost has at least 1-3 as long as nobody's picked it over before you.
---
That‚Äôs what we play for!
---
I just checked, and it's still there for me, too. And I've had the game for months.
---
How do? No xp or only spawn rate decreased?
---
Studded heavy leather with deep pockets
---
The point of this is letting them think they're safe, and then they get attacked and you leave and take their protection from them.
---
You can post links to pictures all you want! But there‚Äôll be so many memes if we do direct links.
---
::shivers::
---
So we have to kill it all. Not just the memes, but the womemes and the childrememes too.
---
This legendary hobo can probably carry ten times more heavy weapons than your scrawny power armor user
---
Greetings,Responder.
---
Why do you think they'll remove it?
---
Feel free to add me gridion_31.  I‚Äôm ps4 in pacific timezone.  Usually play adventure and trying NW last couple of days.
---
That's a crappy way to go, I had the same thing in one game, except it was two guys who snuck up on me, I turned around and they were both just standing by the door, waiting until I turned around. I screamed a real loud üòÇ
---

---
this sounds fun, maybe the fire ring would constantly shrink to keep a little movement so it doesnt drag on.
---
Did not know this, thank you friend! See you in the wastes!
---
Sounds more like recurring temporary companions, like quests where an NPC says "I'll come with you", and runs around aggroing mobs before you can stealth-kill them.
---
Hope they come with new types of diseases.
---
Same shit happened to mee i thought i was going to win so i was looking around for the other player thinking it was 1 on 1 ...
---
Buuuut turns out it was a full squad and they dropped a nuke on me and WON the f*****g match !
---
I wasnt really mad at all because i was so close to winning. and it gave me alot of exp. Hahaha
---
Known bug. Probably be fixed in the next patch.
---
I asked for it months ago and everyone just shit on me.
---
This last week means I am all out of materials so many brown bags of goodies dropped in the forest for so many lowly ex-vault dwellers.
---
doesnt work, it doesnt disappear like the paper bag, its a permanent static container
---
Holy shit, waiting till 50 to do main quests? That‚Äôs insane. You level up fairly slowly in game unless you play a pretty long amount of hours per playtime. 
---
With that being said, I hit 53 before the trial ended and I did most if not all of the quests aside from the nuclear detonation. 
---
I can‚Äôt see not doing main quests until 50. For one, most quests up until around Grafton are severely underleveled enemies. Waiting till 50 basically assures you that you‚Äôre going to one or two shot everything in your path. 
---
Not to mention, each level up gives you a full HP regen and main quests give you a fairly decent amount of XP.
---
As long as it's Johnny Cash - Ring of Fire on an endless loop.
---
I just grabbed a copy from Walmart for $17 bucks. I'll throw the dice at that price.   
---
That being said I've been playing for a few days during the trial and I'm happy except for a few BIG issues. One example is that i just got disconnected from server and lost a few quests. As in, not lost progress. They are 100% gone from my quest tracker and everything. That makes me pretty raw honestly.
---
Yea some people expect for large games like fallout 76   to run smooth and perfectly with 60fps or over on potatoes that can barely run games like fortnite.
---
Oh, man. That‚Äôs rough. But what are you going to do? haha
---
This is nice
---
It takes an average player up to about 120 attempts just to get a bracket of a 95% chance of actually getting in from a vending port-o-diner
---
I've had alot of big issues over the course of the free trial that I would argue negatively affect both the battle royale and normal mode to an extent I couldn't justify any price on this game as it is in its current state. Though I realized a lot of you wouldn't feel that way so instead i'm trying to make sure no one forgot about the actual price of the game rather than the deal Bethesda is pushing.
---
... it‚Äôs like a settlement attack in four. What would be the point in building a super fortified camp if nothing will happen to it? 
---
Attacks don‚Äôt even remotely happen that often and when they do it‚Äôs usually low-mid level enemies with the occasional high rank. 
---
It‚Äôs not going to be a realistic game. It‚Äôs fallout. Not Life RPG
---
Build a bridge out of them!
---
fell off new river gorge bridge because i stepped through a hole
---
it's crazy and unnecessary ...
---
The ones you doing are just events, they not part of the main quest line. Go to your pipboy and go to data and do the quests on the Main tab, you can ignore the side quests for now, follow the main quest line.
---
I am guessing they either saying it will become easier when you get to level 50, or there are certain quests, where you only want to do when you level 50 like Major of the Day so you get the maximum level weapon. So major of the day is one of them, I would wait until level 50.
---
Else do the main quest line until you can't as it eventually takes you into high level enemy territory  ... or you will be levelled up by then, it doesn't matter or you will just get bored of quests like me.
---
Thank you. While the game has gotten better,  it's still isn't the role playing game that many veteran players of the series have waited for a long time.
---
It was all good because a few matches after i got my first win with a random squad getting 5 kills in that match .
---
Thank you so much!

Mg42 seems decent and fun, however im not so sure if its a good choice because of the ammo.
---
Yeah
---
Ouch! Not gunna survive that one without PA lol Those damn epic crates are always on the edges too üôÑ
---
With luck at 15+ and 3 points in critical savvy it takes two shots to refill your meter after a critical. The other perks are is waste.
---
I‚Äôve started playing this week, and I‚Äôve gone all in. Level 36 on day 4 here, and I‚Äôm giving low levels freshly crafted weapons (for the bonus health), ammo, and when I have some to spare, power armor chassis‚Äô. Feels great to help people, and this isn‚Äôt even because I had someone help me that way lol. Tho there was one amazingly kind lvl 224 who gave me a serum of a good number of mutations just because he wanted me to enjoy them.  Didn‚Äôt make me help others but it certainly influenced me to give a full Raider PA to a new level 15 I met :)
---
You have to equip it straight from the atom shop. Just click on the item you own to favourite and equip it
---
I wish Power Armor was better. I can get better stats with Marine armor and Ironclad.
---
Its explained on one of the vault-boy displays.  You select your outfit in the atomic shop.
---
Do events, the awards are worth it and the XP I'd great.
---
Lol thats true. While people were angry at Bethesda for FO76, reactions to Bioware and Anthem were more along the lines of "I'm not angry, I'm just disappointed."
---
The past few days I've seen like 3-4 wanted newbies on the map. Good times...
---
Hi, Are you Elon Reeve Musk ??
---
How isn't vats fair, everyone has it. He does play in adventure mode I'm not saying change nw
---
When hearts like ours meet
---
I fell for you like a child
---
Oh, but the fire went wild
---
The controls on PV need a complete rework - especially the menus. I get controllers have limitations we don‚Äôt, but we don‚Äôt have to use them and by default don‚Äôt so there is no good reason, at all, to hinder us with them.
---
I think any structures you can build should be drops only aka the walls and guard towers/turrets that drop now. Adding more building items as drops would be much more preferable than allowing people to use blueprints to instantly build giant structures. I would rather this game not be like fortnight etc. It already feels very unique in the Fallout setting but I think it detracts from the game when allowing the blueprint builds.
---
I think it‚Äôs a great idea. I imagine they‚Äôre going to clean up a lot of what contributes to the time in between matches between patches.
---
Fitting the raider stereotype with shoddy English too.
---
Anything to fit their narrative
---
You can buy a MIRV mod plan from the train station vendor by Top of the World.
---
‚úãüèº
---
I agree. I would love to wear armor but still see my Vault Suit without any armor on it.
---
Been here since launch, put it down for a few days a couple of times, but those country road keep calling me back
---
It‚Äôs always had problems but I always come back each day
---
Bought it for 40 bucks at gamestop in December
---
Got banned for picking up a bag of quantum‚Äôs, alternate account now playing
---
TIL!!!!!! Thank you for that information
---
There is an option it's called your tv volume or headset
---
Lead is the fire department for the responders. Theres a gym with literally hundreds of pounds of it. I cant think of aluminum off hand.
---
I get tons of lead ore from the breach and clear event then get alot of acid and just melt it down
---
I play on pacifist mode so I don't accidentally wreck lower level people (level 94 here). My stash is overflowing with ammo and junk. But don't let that deter you. The wasteland is replete with junk, events, and good times. Sometimes some bad shit just happens. That's life. Don't be discouraged by it.
---
True!
---
But it sucks bro
---
Hate sells to more eyeballs.  You get the haters that agree, and those who disagree who watch to be outraged.
---
And they're going to keep doing it as long as people keep watching.
---
I wasn't around then. But I've watched enough videos where the old and new games were compared to know what you guys mean now. It used to be fucking immersive and your decisions mattered. It's wasn't wacky and funny.  I like 76 and all but I hope F5 goes back to it's roots and it's super expansive and everyone plays a different story.
---
Just do laps around watoga. The bots drop steel, lead, and aluminum.
---
You can use a blueprint too, FYI
---
I'll keep these in mind thanks everyone
---
&gt; you can use a blueprint 
---
In Soviet Russia, a blueprint can use **you**!
---
^(this post was made by a highly intelligent bot using the advanced yakov-smirnoff algorithm... okay, thats not a real algorithm. learn more on my profile.)
---
Shhhh
---
lvl 375 played pretty much every day since beta
---
Yea I don‚Äôt think so lol
---
Good bot
---
Ok have fun playing ur unfinished game
---
Like uranium fever, do u get lots of XP?
---
Educate them...lol they‚Äôll learn one way or another...lol
---
This is a work of art. I'm copying this
---
It sucks I can't wear the sheepsquatch mascot outfit I earnt through completing events but I could wear the Baad News Billy one if I purchase it with atoms. Almost identical outfits.
---
 Allowing non atom shop clothing will keep people playing adventure for outfits, then NW to show then off. Good way to keep both game modes active. Hopefully it changes in the future
---
Most if not all games are unfinished lmao so have fun with your circle jerk hate
---
Lucky Hole Mine for lead.
---
It's funny because no one gives it a truthful shake. It's either a circlejerk hate fest or people act like the issues have been and are miniscual.
---
Flatwoods and Vaulttec univ gyms, aluminum from robots in Flatwoods as well
---
Neo-nazi enabler? I don't know anything about the guy.
---
Absolutely op at lower levels. I get it every time.
---
I had the same thought, but you can see above you using the camera, which you sorta can do in 3rd person but not to the extent that photomode gives with the FOV slider.
---
PC
---
What‚Äôs the lie? The end game was virtually unplayable on release. Only reason I brought it up is because someone questioned why I put so much time into a game I ‚Äúdidn‚Äôt like‚Äù when it came out. I gave my reasons why I quit.
---
What has been happening? I have been hearing that but haven't found the details of it
---
honestly Im really not to fond of those "I hate everything" types(including IHE).
---
I can't properly aim in 3rd person, and by aim, i mean even pick stuff from containers.
---
I played through Fallout 3, 4, New Vegas and now 76...still no pie, EVER
---
So that means other players shouldn‚Äôt be able to use it?
---
Its in the settings it says music
---
Tell that to NW mode.
---
I didn't say that.
---
I realize I'm in the minority but as long as video games have been around, if there was an option to turn off game music that was always the first thing I'd do-- I *hate* music in games. It is just more immersive for me personally to experience all off the other game sounds without music interfering with that.  
---
I also think that if I've turned off music that the start menu should sit there nice and quietly.... so I guess my point is that I agree with you completely. :)
---
No, there are different types. Google Arrowhead types.
---
It seemed implied, if not, my bad
---
Build where there arent scorch beasts, weve all been there
---
Go ahead check for your self you can‚Äôt change the main menu music
---
I watched a video on this and while the scorched "cult" is very different from the dragon cult in this 1 way. Disease.
---
the residents of WV were obviously affected by the enclave created scorchbeasts (An enclave general had these beasts made to force the area to defcon 1 for the use of nukes to be cleared. though all WV enclave died, so the general's attempt just ruined WV)
---
The disease affects those afflicted by damaging their mentality and their body, their mind becomes weak enough to allow the SBQ to send frequencies (i believe) to those transforming into scorched, making them into slaves, the reason why they shout "we are one" and all that is because they're literally part of a hivemind the scorchbeasts use.
---
i also mentioned it affects their body. how you may ask? they're burned to a crisp and tiny ultracite fragments are growing on them, the scorched are quite literally dead men walking.
---
I believe the hardened bodies full of rads you find everywhere are scorched aswell, which is why we see them in the same positions as the hardened bodies sometimes.
---
I feel as if you are missing out, some games have incredible music
---
It runs like shit on my Xbox S with 250 down 100 up internet. I'm not very knowledgeable about IT related things but this game runs worse than any game over ever played online. Literally, ever. No Halo, COD, Destiny, BF, etc. Has ever ran like this. I really like this game. But, it seriously has stability issues. I shouldn't have to pend a grand on a PC to play a game made for console as well.
---
My character‚Äôs name is ‚ÄúPP Master‚Äù. Not sure how that‚Äôs gonna go for the role players.
---
Lucky Hole for leaf
---
I like to keep it to a minimum but let‚Äôs hope someone see this
---
It's gotten bad for me sense the NW update last week. I came here to see if I was alone hope they can fix it because it's ruining my vending income..
---
I have...one still appears for me though
---
No, just a comment, but I can see how it seemed like that. Now in reference to what the person above me said, if it was a legit competitive mode (like for money, such as CS:GO) then maybe I can see having it locked down.
---
Jumping kills your appetite though so it's still a huge risk in 76
---
It's gotten bad for me sense the NW update last week. I came here to see if I was alone hope they can fix it because it's ruining my vending income.. and like others mentioned not a great to to advertise the game.
---
4 man 50 cal cheese. They had a giant base and spawned it 3 seconds.
---
Eh, I can‚Äôt. That‚Äôs like removing overpowered weapons, or removing stealth boys because people can‚Äôt play against them. 
---
It seems stupid to really even consider it.
---
Now the photo mode is something that should be removed because you can travel way beyond what you should be able to.
---
Do not downvote them! Or comment or anything - that means they get engagement which boosts their channel.
---
...and that setting has no effect whatsoever on the main menu music.
---
This happened to me recently too, except reverse! Us lil guys love the help and comradeship, thanks yall
---
Sure user name?
---
Assholes that can't hack it in the pvp mode will try to claim your workshop just to initiate pvp.
---
So heads up. If someone takes a workshop 9/10 it is someone trying to initiate pvp for caps. Please fix this Bethesda.
---
You‚Äôre (all) welcome! Had a blast doing it!
---
completely agree. % anything is a cop-out for poor design. how can anyone build a character when half the perk cards are required to even function
---
Yup it doesn‚Äôt
---
Sent pm.
---
I think the attacks add a bit of immersion. It‚Äôs a post apocalyptic nuclear wasteland, fraught with mutated creatures of all manner waiting to gobble you up. Of course your base is going to be attacked, nowhere is truly safe.
---
I look at the camp attacks as Appalachia bearing gifts anything my machine guns or rockets kill I'm able to loot.
---
Yes I would also advocate for a first person only mode as well.
---
I really wish bobbleheads were permanent small boosts
---
I‚Äôm also out of materials. Gonna have to refuel and do some aid/food hunting!
---
i did say maybe. i am not really sure if it's a good idea or not. can't really think of a good reason either way. i agree with you, but i also consider that most competitive games don't give both options. to your point though, that's how the game is and if we talkin competitive well you better learn to play the game with all mechanics included. kinda tough. i wouldn't call it stupid though.
---
That's more likely a leftover from when they copied the attack dogs from fallout 4. The one that drops it isn't even the scorched dog
---
This comment is a breath of fresh air.
---
I learned the hard way when I started playing lmao
---
Frame rate is a pretty valid reason tbh for some a bad frame rate can make them feel sick or give them a headache
---
You are getting there, persevere.
---
A bit more training and experience and you will be able to hit the trifecta: not being able to place a floating item that is not selected because it intersects with a non-existent existing object.
---
Well I experience them often. We're on a sub full of fans. Of course everyone's perspective here is the minority are the haters. In this day and age the expectation of a AAA title is well known at launch. It was a justified thing that people were pissed and stopped playing. Let it be a lesson learned to Beth. But this onslaught of negativity from people who haven't even played it gets old.
---
No. People had legit criticism and that should be seen or else the game would never improve. Review bombing negative e or positive is just a bad idea.
---
Should but won't. Most of us are too busy enjoying the game.
---
Yea but frame rate could be a system issue and not the game
---
It‚Äôs made some significant process - 8 months of development will. It would have been nice if they‚Äôd just done that before releasing it (and the 6 more it needs) or released it as Early Access, up front about the state of the game and what they expected of it (not a AAA game, not a ‚Äúhigh metacritic‚Äù, etc... at a reduced EA price for those who wanted to support continued development actively. Would have stopped a lot of the bad blood, bad press and burned players who have written the game off forever.
---
It‚Äôs def better, most notably in being a lot more stable. There are still a lot of real problems with the game - general and broad balance issues, bugs, over reliance on RNG (wait till you decide to get the pro snap so you can earn as many atoms in game as you used to), perks breaking, spawning mechanics being insane, a dozen more real, significant issues. Things that make those of us who WANT to enjoy the game endlessly frustrated as they build up annoyance.
---
For all the shit I give people on this sub, I‚Äôm honestly glad they enjoy NW and the new content - but I really wish they‚Äôd dedicate more resources to cleaning up what‚Äôs already here. I‚Äôd like to be able to use a laser shotgun or not have to constantly check the map to make sure new players aren‚Äôt close and about to trigger a respawn in dangerous areas on top my half dead character.
---
It would also be nice if we could actually discuss these issues without people needing to feel floor they are in some holy struggle against
---
‚ÄúThe Youtubers‚Äù who have them so triggered you have to pretend problems are insignificant, everything is fine, the game is now a 100 metacritic GOTY candidate and if they just keep treating it like it, everyone will ignore the reality.
---
Enjoy the game, when the issues get to you, take a break - don‚Äôt bother venting or raising the issues here though, it‚Äôs 95% only absolutely dedicated people as the vast majority moved on. There‚Äôs a decent amount of content now if you‚Äôre not playing 8hrs a day all day, there‚Äôs no point to rush.
---
One tip - build your camp away from common highly trafficed areas like white springs - if a player visits your camp or in some places just walks by they can trigger a soawn at their level. Being lvl 25 and trying to fight off 5 max level supermutants is a good way to end up rage quitting.
---
I did the same too :P
---
Same here dude. I got fallout 3 release day and today is the first time I got the pie
---
It‚Äôs like a holiday
---
Yeah, I'm gonna have to ask you to try again. If you're getting paid on Twotch you legally have to say you are.
---
I agree 100%. I don't really listen to any music at all...
---
I use to watch a few, for legit news. But I wouldn't even entertain those click bait titles. I stopped watched the youtubes and they stopped popping up. Hope those channels die but I know they won't. Too many pitchfork holding haters who refuse to at least try the game when it's free.
---
*Raises hand*
---
Level 207 now.
---
I would, and yea exactly. The mechanics are there, you‚Äôll just have to learn them. If not, then I guess you‚Äôll just lose?
---
Harpers ferry vendor
---
Strength for Heavy Weapons perks.
---
True true
---
The quests I would recommend waiting until you're level 50 are Cold Case and Mayor For A Day. They reward legendary weapons with unique effects. Other than that I can't remember if the main quests offer anything too exciting.
---
No mic btw
---
Do you have your vendors running? what you sell is part of your cap
---
Normal revival
---
I do that just ling enough to gain their trust, then i offer em a swig of farewell nukashine.
---
I was kind of agreeing with you there
---
I expected someone would say this. :) I agree that some games do have great music and I realize I'm missing out on that. Knowing that I've tried to play with the music on and it just doesn't work for me-- it's much harder for me to really get into the game.  
---
&lt;shrug&gt; We all have our oddities and quirks. I realize I'm weird and just roll with it the best I can. :)
---
No it's not. They said it's take 6-8 months for us to get it and they stated that back in December not November. So get your facts straight.
---
Thanks man I appreciate it
---
Great little story! Made me smile. I swear the community for this game is very unique.
---
Better be vintage, we‚Äôre treating the newbies with respect around these parts.
---
Ah I see, I was a bit confused lol sorry
---
Oh what a great idea. Yes, please, Bethesda.
---
üñêüñêüñê

I don‚Äôt think there is a silenced weapon is there? The lever has one but it‚Äôs still normal for me I think.
---
lead is in tin cans, wood blocks, weights, tons of stuff, i never run out of lead.
---
I stated I didn't in the original post. I just wanted to to replace a ceiling light with another. Replace as in not build another and it won't let me. Deleted several things now and I can't build anything cause my budget didn't go down.
---
i always lose. i blame me being high and having a slow reaction time ha ha. i did pretty well earlier today when i was sober. i think my squad hit 2nd place 2 times in a row.
---
Heresy! ;)
---
The perk card system needs a reworking. I can be done with no duplicate perk cards and the introduction of a prestige (post level 50) system.
---
Lucky hole with excavator
---
Haha, as long as you are having fun right?
---
Never seen it until recently but I like that kinda schlapstick comedy lol
---
If you‚Äôre using melee, definitely look into a Bloodied build.
---
If you want to wear it in NW, select it in the Atom shop, a small nuke icon should appear on it.
---
how many turrets do you have? are you using wood or steel?
---
I think early December I took a break when the duping server crashes were at their worst, but other than that... üñêüèª
---
Are you referring to Maria Chavez "the syphilis queen of Appalachia"? Who, it's rumored, managed to infect nearly all of the responders, who in turn went on to infect eventually everyone else, thus wiping out the entire population of survivors?  THAT Maria Chavez?
---
I started playing this week and had help from some high level players. I was wondering if bethesda pays them to welcome newbies lol, turns out their just awesome guys!
---
Ok but you still need a 15 point investment into luck.  In my op i illustrate how other gods require less investment. 
---
How does your argument in any way invalidate my overarching point that crit build requires way more investment for less payoff and thus needs a buff?
---
Too bad I won‚Äôt be able to use T-60 for another ten levels...
---
I'm experiencing a problem where I can't loot anything. can't pick up a single thing... Makes it a bit hard to play
---
There not companions if they don't follow you around. There just an allied faction npc's.
---
I don't mind if you cant change there gear or give them stuff but if there a "companion" i'd expect them to follow me wherever
---
And making non-combat related perk cards passive.
---
wow stop, just worry about you. once you start complaining how other players play then u will start hating the game. just worry aboit you.
---
They want to gobble *you* up not a mutfruit plant that they could just eat off of not destroy.
---
Someone did this to my group while we were trading supplies. The supplies became an offering to the air. Dude had 3/4 of his health in rads and was just out of reach of the radaway lol.
---
It used to be quite common yes but as far as I know the disconnects have gotten alot less common since Bethesda did some patches/stability updates. 
---
I get DC'd once about every 30 - 40 hours or so of play now.
---
It might just be happening more since the free week has brought in alot more players?
---
You'd be surprised how many times the scorchbeast either puts down your opponent or gets them low enough to take out.
---
Sure the inverse happens a lot too, but it's definitely not almost impossible to win. I'd say you have a better chance winning solo, than making a friend with a random.
---
Camp Mclintlock (sp) in the south forest not by the airport near the ash heap. 
---
Server hop till you get a fresh one. Walk in front doors. Laying in an open locker on the right is a pouch. On the cabinet top behind the desk is another pouch. Go up the stairs, on a small table is a knife with a military duct tape.
---
Go outside, around back, by the half tube housing units. In the carrier in front there‚Äôs a pouch, in the crates in front of one there might be a duct tape. There can be another pouch or duct tape (don‚Äôt remember) on one of the tables at te bak of the tube housing units.
---
No enemies, every 24 hours you can go back. It‚Äôs like 10-12 Ballistic Fiber, should be enough to take care of any damage you have in a day.
---
Fort Defiance has a decent amount. Left side, brotherhood side. Only ghouls and bugs/molerats and stuff inside, easy but it‚Äôs in a high level area.
---
tru dat homie
---
Hahahahahaha imagine being cucked so hard that you actually believe that
---
Actually I think you are still below, by just a tad. Power armor is like 190~ while iron clad and marine is 188~. I could be wrong.
---
I heard from a Reddit post the other day they disabled the dailys for NW
---
I've been playing 46 hours with no problems. PC NV USA
---
I feel like there was a budget reduction that wasn't really communicated..
---
I think you‚Äôre supposed to use the duplicates to upgrade your current cards into more powerful versions. 
---
If you mean still getting dupes after maxing out your cards, then sure.
---
uh thanks for sharing i guess
---
Do not forget this game mode was given to us as a "pre-beta." For those of you who aren't used to such labeling, it's basically an Alpha. A tight alpha, but an alpha nonetheless. They will change many aspects of the core gameplay of NW before it's released as a full fledged game mode. I understand your concerns, but worry not, friend.
---
Yea he said that BR games should be like NW and not be so serious, but fun and kinda random. I tend to agree, BR should be wacky and have extremely op drops etc not a balanced tryhard game. Just my 2 cents
---
definitely a great decision by Bethesda. Im glad bethesda didn‚Äôt abandon the game like alot of other developers usually would do. This is one the first times ive been genuinely excited to go home and play a battle royale. Also i got my first win last night which was awesome.
---
Make sure to sleep to have the well rested which grants +5% bonus xp for 2 hours.  Do Feed the People event which rewards canned meat stew, which grants another +5% bonus xp for an hour when consumed. Doing quest, especially the faction quest, will also help you level up at a good pace.
---
go to white spring and grind, beat everything, kill robots in watoga, when i was leveling i did no quest i just beat stuff down.
---
really dont want to move my camp , im inn the same spot ive been since beta and im very fond of it ....ive gotten my base perfect just the way I like it ....really, really dont want to have to move camp entirely ....feeling frustrated...
---
Excellent post. Hopefully the devs actually see it.
---
Dup cards after having them maxed out.  It's such a waste.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox if that changes anything.  Seems like it‚Äôs due to the free play week though.  That‚Äôs good to hear
---
Damn I'm jealous. I'll be there one day. I just hit 33 lmao
---
Yeah I can definitely say that since that update the server disconnects seem to be getting a lot more consistent. I enjoy the new mode and content but I really hope they just focus on server stability for a while because it feels like I can‚Äôt even complete 75% of the events I‚Äôve tried recently.
---
I play with headphones so as not to wake the wife and kid. Talking is not an option.
---
Of course, the music one and the frog habitat one were 2 of the ones I was planning on doing. I completed the frog jar part though, is that the part that's glitched for people? Or do the pictures not trigger completion?
---
Only crashes I had encounter are during  scorch Queen even then those are rare. Ps4
---
No turrets, nothing for sale, nothing stored. I used to be able to switch stuff out like a poster for a painting but now I can't do anything.
---
They could totally program them to act like vertibots in that you could send them to a location or maybe even a patrol route and if they die they will just appear back at your camp after a certain re-spawn timer acting like they were gravely injured and you have to heal them.
---
It would defiantly liven things up seeing a bunch of npc's wandering around that players sent out into the wasteland.
---
There is so much to do and so many interesting little stories to find without the NPCs and settler/raider factions, I don't think you will regret jumping in
---
is this because they raised the budget on neon lights in the last patch ?
---
Screw the youtube! Fo76 community is all that matters! üòÉ
---
I think NW is pretty balanced to be honest. But yes. Fun is the main point for sure
---
No, the weight would never reach zero.  If you have 100 and reduce it by 20% tou have 80.  Then reduce it by 50% and you have 40.  Reduce it be another 50% and you have 20.  You never reach zero.
---
Oof, you‚Äôre right. Still, the Marine Armor is less bulky than the Power Armor.
---
God damn some of these are sick. Guess it's time to grind to 100
---
I don't really think the purpose is to outclass everything though.
---
The appeal to the gun for me at least, is that with how little radaway there is even if I die, you're probably fucked after also.
---
Having huge amounts of damage while also permanently decreasing health through rads would make the gun broken.
---
I've never noticed. What's you connection speed like?
---
Oh yea 100%. Power armor is garbage considering you run out of ap faster and you can‚Äôt use a stealth boy. It‚Äôs just not worth it.
---
Played half a dozen games with a buddy and we just queued for them all normally?
---
Sounds fun... definitely Strength for Heavy Weapons perks as suggested. I tinkered on this site a bit taking into account the style of play it seemed you were going for, also considering pirates are typically drunk, well from what Ive heard at least I don't really know any personally, so... :

You could do less luck if you were not going for a mutation build. See you in the wasteland, have fun out there.
---
Ah yes, that bethesda quality. :P
---
Thanks for the heads up
---
Thanks all for your help
---
I think the balancing act is that it does radiation damage and radaway is a bitch to find usually. So it cripples people even if it doesn't do the damage other guns do.
---
The first stage of any silo includes a gym full of lead.  Top of the world has a bunch of ski poles for aluminium.
---
Wait what
---
I agree
---
How so like you can equip them without cost?
---
Except for the fact that you have to CLEARLY display that you're being sponsored/payed for shit like that.  
---
As someone who streams, you get emails constantly about the ToS and how you are meant to uphold it, and one of the biggest things always highlighted is the clarity of paid promotions because of the legality of hiding it.
---
üëã
---
What is your daily play like jw?
---
So excited for that!
---
Well beside NW
---
Base bag, yes. The mods, not imo. The armornone reduces weight to 30 and the extra weight mod reduced your armor by quite a lot.
---
If the grind wasn‚Äôt so intense for the mods, I‚Äôd say yes, but as is, no. Especially if you need the prosnap camera for many (not 100% but pretty sure you do when it says take a pic) - which if you do t have is a whole luck based rng grind that might just never happen for you. I spent 11 hrs server hopping for it over a week and nothing. If you have the camera, then maybe.
---
Because the madlads at Bethesda did it, they somehow balanced pvp!
---
What's the point if they dont enter the world with you though?
---
Imagine being so ignorant that you believe the propaganda that you listen and watch
---
well i always do the dailies that have a chance for rare outfits then i have a "rare plan" farminf route i run ..i cap out 1400 for the day always get 150 scrip..shop a few stores run a few events that don't give rare outfits but are just fun
---
Happened to my comrades too.
---
Good.  YouTube reviewers are what‚Äôs wrong with the world.
---
Well the idea is that onces you've chosen a non-combat related perk and advanced it to it's 3rd tier it works passively.  In other words, without equipping it.
---
Bethesda alpha, at that.
---
Bruh I‚Äôm level 56 on ps4 I believe I‚Äôve had enough experience to say the game fuckin sucks hahaha
---
Still useless imo.

How about fixing the possum challenges? Namely the leatherworker and musician challenges not working? The deathclaw hide is supposed to drop from deathclaws and it never registers me as playing anything for musician perk.
---
üëéüèº I wish I was here day one , but the negativism detained that
---
I need someone like this. Wanna take the dive and just buy the game before the free trial is but i have no one to play with
---
Do one better and leave a mine behind ;)
---
Have had it since early on and its never affected my ap
---
So add useless things that have no purpose for anything other than to role play... cant you just say - smokes cigar when you're doing that?
---
This and show how many legendaries are in a machine
---
i agree entirely, i have to turn my master volume up all the way to hear teammates in Nuclear Winter. I dread leaving games or waiting for friends to get on because the menu music is deafening, even on my normal settings. Playing Nuclear Winter so much has really got me hating menu music in general.
---
Old bug. The only fix is moving your camp. If you're modular enough and married to your spot, just move it slightly to the side, otherwise look at this as an opportunity to put down roots somewhere new.
---
The follow the overseer quest is not bugged it‚Äôs just not complete yet. 
---
You have to launch a Nuke and for that you should head to the enclave bunker.
---
I spawn inside the vending machine instead! Yes this has happened several times.

That's just the way it is. Nothing broke.

You mean to tell me my vast collection of green thumb cards are useless?! üòü

You can report players from the social menu. I don't know if there is specifically a cheat option in the report function, but there ought to be something close.
---
Report cause you got killed wack
---
[Everything in this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kjyeCdd-dl8)
---
I've revived others while in power armor, never had an issue. So doesn't sound like it's a 100% always going to fail.
---
Low framerate is a valid critique. The game does not run super well. It would be a lot more fun if the aiming was buttery smooth, input lag low, etc. All of this is tied to frame rate.
---
Fair nuf
---
Can confirm there is a report player for cheating, used it today.
---
When you click on the nuclear winter after clicking play you have an option to turn fill off
---
Found the cheater.
---
When going into Nuclear Winter you should have the option for team fill on or off. On for a team off for no team. You would still be playing against teams though
---
This is incorrect. In NW you CAN NOT rank up cards. Once you get a card, if you get another, it is immediately ‚Äúsold‚Äù for 50 Overseer XP. 
---
This has happened for me twice so far.
---
Yes.
---
Press R on PC before joining a world and it Lets you solo, your key or button is shown in the lower bar
---
I didn't see that option on Xbox, or I am just blind. I'll boot it up again to check. But does this mean I'll be solo against full squads?
---
Pretty sure I think it‚Äôs x for Xbox square for PS4 to turn off fill when the little window pops up after clicking nuclear winter
---
Anyway, yeah your'e not the first to complain about it. I've actually seen several other posts reporting the same thing. So definitely a problem. Just not sure if it's randomly occurring to some while in PA, or maybe a few other things need to be present, not just PA.
---
I really enjoyed survival when it was longest life on the leaderboard not top kills
---
Actively hunting and being hunted added such a fun element to the game, now it's just a trainyard fuckfest
---
It's still one of the funniest things I've done/seen in a game. My friends and I were dying because it was so unexpected.
---
Ha. Really?  Just do that right back to them. It's a battle royal, no holds bars.

I ran at a Power Armor/50 Cal user at the beginning of a game with nothing but my fists and a dose of Psycho.
---
i haven't tried  NW yet probably won't i just don't care about pvp in fallout but I'm glad it's doing well and might add more people to the game
---
It's good in sustained combat where the enemy would have time to heal, but now has to use a radaway and stim. Otherwise the SMG shreds with the higher rof and magazine
---
Okay I actually see it, didn't notice it before. Thanks for the reply! I don't mind playing against full teams solo.
---
I've had it for months now without issues.
---
Have you played prop hunt? Haha
---
Oh no you attacked a sports team within my region!
---
I don‚Äôt identify with brands, which is why I don‚Äôt cape for BGS and can remain honest and critical.
---
This could be like, the only BR I know that actually has stalemates instead of giving the win to someone.
---
I mean i could see why they would think it‚Äôs not good because the combat is really clunky and bad. I like the mode tho it‚Äôs fun to play but it‚Äôs definitely not a good shooter it‚Äôs just a fun thing to do.
---
All the fortnight players down voting enmasse it seems.
---
Xbox
---
I was talking about for adventure mode. I know you can‚Äôt rank up cards in NW.
---
My opinion is that it is for game balance, and also simplified perk card loadouts. They have done lots of things like this in NW. 1) The lockpicking and hacking perk cards have been reduced from needing 3 cards to just a single card. 2) Instead of having to build complete armor sets piece by piece as in adventure, when you find armor in NW you find a complete set, etc.
---
I think some of the advice you got was correct but incomplete. I tried following the story straight thru but it was too hard and i almost quit playing. I was petty unhapppy when i got to the mole miners in the ash heap in my teens.
---
Then i followed advise on this board and became very happy. I explored the entire forrest rather than just the areas you mentioned. At l20 i went to toxic valley, then ash heap in mid 20s. Then savage divide in early 30s followed by mire in early 40s. At that point i found a vampire shotgun and started going everywhere.
---
If you want to do the whole main story at one time and are an average player without an amazing gun then waiting til 40 is a sound plan but you should def move on to more challenging areas and explore them a lot rather than staying where you are.
---
Thank you for the tag! I will share this :)
---
Got to the final circle as the single player left from a team. Against 6 others. They are fighting inside the responders building in flatwoods, so I Chuck a nuke grenade through the window. Players start dropping and some stupid accomplishment comes up. I don't count how many players may be alive and start jumping up and down.....my grenade only killed 4 of the 6. I am shot and killed mid celebration.

 &gt; Thank you for the tag! I will share this :)
---
Hard disagree. I have friends that won't even think about playing the game because of negative reviews from people who never played it, this stuff has real life impacts. Let people know there is a crowd of people who enjoy this game and what specific points they try to make against it are incorrect.
---
So how about the deaf/mute players?
---
Weak sauce! Sorry dude!
---
I would also like to formally request a player level when scrolling over a camp. Nobody wants to buy your level 20 golf club. How are these trial noobs setting up camps in the Mire. Stop giving noobs drinks that make them wake up across the world.
---
\^\^ This is exactly what I'm imagining.
---
If the dialogue is good and there's some depth, I might understand the "companion" thing, but I'm skeptical.
---
no i am on PS4 and to old to be bothered to cheat, but i dont let others bother me. to many people cry for no reason.  
---
its like just because someone is not playing like you, you need to go tell on them. put your big boy pants on and get over it.
---
Oh, ok, sorry. The different variations on the discussion were confusing me.
---
No
---
I am so bad at BR I can‚Äôt even imagine how fast I would die without a team.
---
If you go to grafton an event should spawn with protesters.. pretty much all the time someone new visits.... they are not rare or worth anything. Can grab 6 or more easily at each event if you wanted to.
---
Whatcha mean by 'Weak sauce'?
---
Agreed, watched some vids earlier and he was so crap, then bashing the game because he couldn't get a kill, didn't understand the mechanics etc.
---
Oh my god! Nobody wants regular level 50 guns and armor! If your at level 50 you sure as shit don‚Äôt need anymore sharp shooters assault rifles! They need to put a legendary slot along with weapons and armor. I‚Äôve wasted thousands of caps fast traveling for nothing but regular junk over the last 30 days!
---
Just that it sucks!! I would hate to get that far and it end that way!
---
Loved is probably too strong a word. But I have liked it since day 1
---
‚Äú‚ÄùI don't however think the criticism of the game overall are justified in the least. ‚Äù‚Äù
---
‚Äú‚ÄùYour experience is not universal. Hope that clears it up.‚Äù‚Äù
---
Yeah.... and you don‚Äôt see the problem with telling someone that they‚Äôre wrong to not want to give the game a second chance? You can‚Äôt claim objective and subjective reasoning in the same breath.
---
And man, I didn‚Äôt feel old until you said 26 is not young.
---
Good to know, thanks. They're good for caps and gunpowder too.
---
On the contrary they are quite worthless!
---
I'm sooo surprised /s
---
How? You guys died at the same time? Wtf lol
---
And: NOBODY WANTS MORE PLANS. That they allready (KNOW)
---
Kills are barely worth it, it's only 10xp per kill or something!
---
The progression is very slow!
---
What?
---
Why are you here then?
---
Some people have mules though...saw a level two and he had a normal looming inventory card thing on the map. FT there and he said some SOLID legendaries.
---
On pc its holding down alt, on console its the button that throws grenades.
---
Asd me to the list
---
Oh damn. Ouch!
---
Oh yeah - although to be fair, I was the one who dropped the bomb and killed everyone!
---
You should lose all your equipment on your character. Like the main character you use for Fallput 76.
---
I just tried to give a level 12 guy 200 rounds of shotgun shells. He was playing my piano and the server crashed before he could get them. Sighs *
---
Oh man I didn't hold down the button. That's awesome, thanks so much!
---

You don't like those Marylanders? What about the people in Austin?

Yeah, seriously what

Oh rip I dropped like 500 in cigarette machines a couple times lol

Doesnt that already happen?

Not in the battle royal sadly.

Preston (The Babe Poet)
---
Classic FO4 raider move, I like it üòÇ Shame it didn't pay off.
---
So just a heads up, we figured out a workaround. Instead of clicking on the map to fast travel to your teammate, we hit control + tab and fast travel from there. No crashes after that
---
I‚Äôve been playing since the stress tests and I have enough experience to tell you that It doesn‚Äôt suck
---
I guess I'm on r/woosh I dont get it
---
While yes, review bombing is dumb, there were definitely criticisms that weren't even fair. And to say the game would never improve without them like the development teams work so far has solely been based on negative feedback rather than an original idea of expanding the game is laughable at best.
---
Yes, criticism was fair, but there were posts for weeks that talked of people being able to steal through trading and other things that were completely false but spread around like a plague. To say that it deserved EVERYTHING is absurd just as much as saying it didn't deserve any backlash.
---
That being said don't fucking review bomb you fucking heathens it's why reviews don't mean anything anymore.
---
I play solo every match. I find it so much fun to hide and hunt. I've got to the final 2 5 times as a solo only to lose cause I suck at pvp. Good fun.
---
Lmao! have a like 45 plans at my camp and they are probably the best selling thing I have tbh! But I try to put the best ones I have in there tho like sheepsquatch weapon mods and random spawn plans. Also stuff from the queen for people who don‚Äôt run it. But I have 80 percent of them at half the in game value so maybe that‚Äôs why they sell.
---
To be fair you can literally just see every single person in adventure mode.
---
As for the other things yeah that would be nice to at least toggle.
---
They always were lol jk
---
No one has said any of that. People that actually play the game have been some of the harshest critics.
---
Dude. Maria killed them all.... it's better that you're hearing it from me, now. It wasn't radiation poisoning like she made it out to be. She left all those tapes trying to covet up what she'd done.
---
There is a god! And he is merciful!!! Thank you so much!
---
Hmmmm... Interesting
---
It doesn‚Äôt though. NW Rules are different for AP drain. It‚Äôs basically using VATS or sprinting only and cats only locks onto the creatures not players
---
There was 5 of us left, all boys from the village.
---
The circle was getting small, the fire - raging nearby like an endometrium in a uterus's membrane.
---
One of the lads I killed dropped a briefcase, his team was on the \[Sutton\] rooftops nearby. I jumped out of my power armor and sprinted to his corpse whilst spinnin' up my stealth boy - stealthy.
---
I grabbed the briefcase, and launched the nuke in the last bits of the small safe zone whilst in my power armor.
---
15 seconds later, it all changed - an irreversible change - everyone and everything were dead.
---
Ran into that issue today me and a friend got stuck in a T pose afterwards üòî
---
Because I was pretty intrigued by the game pre launch and was staying in the loop here hoping it got better then got the free trial and realized it wasn‚Äôt for me?
---
Oh no! I was the last one of two players a couple of rounds ago, I totally pysched myself out because I was on a hill with nothing but fire behind me and just had no clue where this dude was, ended up trying to move up the hill and the second I came out from behind this jacked up tree I got popped in the head üò£
---
The best use I got out of it was in a mega team fight and I was the front line. Got lucky that game and had PA, 2 shotguns and a grenade launcher. Was super super fun, but I was literally just the meat shield/distraction. Running around like a derp firing grenades.
---
Before entering the mode there is an option you can choose which says ‚Äúfill group‚Äù or something, it is on by default, if you turn it off you can play without a group or without being put into a group.
---
Well rip me. :( I've been in this one spot for a long long time. Had everything set up super nicely too...
---
focus on sneeking and ambushing! i play solo and for me it‚Äôs a rush haha
---
Nuclear Winter is a damn battle royale, and not the best one, if you ask me. People say their oppinion, whats the problem with that? Fallout 76 is pretty bad compared to previous BGS titles, so the gap between games feels even worse because of that and, considering the game... troubled release and its quality on launhc it is totaly understandable for people to sail of the hype waves about the game after E3.
---
Ok, thanks. I think it was just false information. Maybe people overreacting to the -AP effect.
---
It really is, I played my first 5 team games today, first 4 wasshitty team work and we died fast. The last one someone took charge and we all worked together and we got second place
---
We lost cause we got ambushed going up a hill then got flanked
---
Why did you quit? Most of the XP is gained from how long you can survive, I would have just waited the storm out, grabbed a drink or sandwich or something. I mean, yeah it sucks and is boring, but hey, free XP.
---
Yeah.... and you don‚Äôt see the problem with telling someone that they‚Äôre wrong to not want to give the game a second chance? Their experience is not yours, to then it is absolutely justified and they‚Äôre just as entitled to that view.
---
We were absolutely duped into buying the game and you don‚Äôt get to tell us otherwise, lol. It‚Äôs not like Todd Howard came out and said it was not a ‚Äúhigh metacritic‚Äù, AAA game during release, when it sure was priced like one.
---
And here‚Äôs a little Econ tip for you - what‚Äôs wrong with selling a broken game today, that will be fixed in a year is my original post: it‚Äôs called time value and option value of money. It‚Äôs essentially a 0% APR loan. We could have waited a year and bought the game for 70% off. Instead of paying 60 and incurimg the Opprotunity Cost of that purchase. Buying Fo76 meant I forwent Pathfinder Kingmaker. The cost of 76 was a not having Kingmaker, which was not broken.
---
If it was a car or a lawn mower you would not be saying this. It would be clear that you could have just spent that money on a car or lawn mower now, for one that worked now. And if a company was not honest about the condition of the car, it would obviously be underhanded and predatory.
---
Sounds like he wants you to drop your legendary weapons or armor you have on your adventure character if you lose in NW. In other words, that 3* level 50 AAE handmade you paid 25k caps for, or traded multiple items for? Kiss it goodbye.
---
Sneaking I can do.  It‚Äôs the ambush. I can have a great weapon great armor and I just have bad aim under pressure. I keep going back because I‚Äôm getting better! It‚Äôs just never been my thing but I love it in NW.
---
Bruh it‚Äôs objectively a bad game you should know if you played at launch and saw how booboo the game was and the fact that you can‚Äôt acknowledge that makes u the most ignorant fanboy ever hahahaha
---
Being out numbered constantly is really annoying. I really hope they put duos at least in the game. Randoms are generally useless and won't communicate, so coming up against a full premade is really hard when the 2 randoms have decided to drop somewhere that is generally full of people and then just die, so it's me and my premade against a bunch of other full squads. It's so frustrating.
---
I think what they're trying to say is that you lose your character's items in Adventure Mode if you die in NW. 
---
I think.
---
Or we can stop being fanboys and reasonably acknowledge the plethora of issues this game once had and still has.
---
No?  Oh well.
---
Like yeah the game is better than launch but over the last few days I've still ran into plenty of issues.  Disconnects, invincible ghouls beating my ass, freezing, getting stuck loading holotapes/terminals so forced to altf4, getting attacked by sliding-on-back ghouls....
---
Or gear a lower mode for those of us who will always be alone (no friends to play with, etc) and can't really go after the bigger beasts alone, and don't even want to try. But we still want to move around the map and explore too without  always being fearful lol.
---
If the quest actually started it all already simply run towards the trailer park start picking up toxic waste, sometimes it doesn't announce that you need to pick up the toxic goo better to just appear anyways. Pick it up and it'll trigger the rest of the mission
---
Because Facebook messenger is a thing and I like to keep up with events for bands and other things
---
&gt;  you run out of ap faster 
---
oh really? I hadn't noticed that.
---
See now in a _real_ Fallout game? This would be the story. Bravo.
---
Fallout 76 as many of us know has tons of problems, but this is by far the most glaring one.
---
Not a scientist but it seems like maybe your game isn't responding.
---
Wow that is great! I just get sick of seeing plans for lights or brick walls or whatever. I am on all the time and i havnt seen much sheepsqatch weapon mods. I am on the lookout for the Signs and Letters Plan. Just putting it out there.
---
Never heard of a dutch door. Have heard of a dutch oven.
---
I posted this and got a reply from Bethesda that they know it's broken and will fix next patch.
---
bada bing, bada boom, problem solved
---
It still amazes me how wholesome the community for this game is. It legitimately blows my mind
---
Wait how exactly did she kill everyone? I‚Äôm confused
---
Yes it is still bugged.
---
Because I was pretty intrigued by the game pre launch and was staying in the loop here hoping it would get better then it was on launch,then I downloaded the free trial yesterday and realized it wasn‚Äôt for me? Is that a good enough reason?
---
Fucking thank you
---
I imagine they will basically be the same, if not just a little less often. 
---
Definitely a no on removing the scorch queen.
---
I just think story wise it'll just be "oh the vault dwellers are keeping the scorched at bay right now." Now that we have the inoculation more scorched won't be a problem. If anything it'll just be framed as exterminating the last of them.
---
That's funny in a tinfoil hat sort of way
---
Wow, that all sounded epic asf. Congratulation on your stalemate since its probably rare to happen
---
I threw a mine down. Sconds later threw another one down... blew myself up. No one around.
---
Also there is a huge chance you get stuck if you try to revive someone with PA on
---
I didn‚Äôt at first either, someone pointed it out earlier and only then did I notice. It‚Äôs either that or it stops the 40% less ap cost when sprinting from happening.
---
It would be great but there‚Äôs super strict laws in a lot of countries about portraying smoking in games, that‚Äôs why other characters can do it in FO4 but not the player
---
If it becomes one of the most played features what makes you think they wouldn‚Äôt?
---
R/games was literally convinced that the E3 crowd last week was full of people paid to clap for Fallout. The delusional hatred for this game is stunning.
---
Yea, happened to me way too many times. I wonder what triggers it? Because it only happens like half the time for me. I usually just get out of the armor now instead of reviving in power armor.
---
True maybe they will give us some back story on the distribution of the cure. Or you will under go that yourself helping your desired faction.
---
If you're someone who thought the game was fine at release not only do I not trust anything you have to say about it in it's present state, but you need to gain some serious self awareness and perspective as well.
---
The game is a lot better than launch.  It's still plenty plagued with issues regardless.  Stop acting like it's now the perfect game you already thought it was anyways.
---
They‚Äôve had issues there as well, Med-X was originally meant to be Morphine but was changed after Australia threatened to ban the entire title
---
I am a critic and even fair, well intentioned criticism gets nothing but downvotes and excuses on this sub. People DO literally say that, they have been saying it ever since the first juicehead review, lol. Not everyone, but they are here, in a not insignificant number.
---
who cares what they think? obviously they aren't very intelligent.
---
Let‚Äôs not make this political Terry
---
Pictures don't  do it justice. Its great. I will be using as a gym bag. Its quite great actually.
---
Ah I see a fellow man of culture 8)
---
How is this entertainment?  It‚Äôs not funny it‚Äôs sad.
---
Thanks, I added it.
---
this is just a helpfull reminder that its called legendary and not enchanted
---
That shit kills me ‚ÄúRAR I HATE DIS DUMB GAME GRR‚Äù
---
‚ÄúOwned less than a week‚Äù ü§î
---
I am playing game since launch. I dont like it. It has many issues. It has many bugs. It has questionable game desighn choices. It has realy annoying things. It has strange controls on PC. But it still has pretty enjoyable exploration, good lore and story. This what makes me enter the game every few days for an hour or so. And hope that it will be fixed one day.
---
I think it should have some minor buffs but it seems like the real application is being able to survive in a nuke zone with decent DR vs the hazmat
---
Man am I glad I'm on console
---
Suggested this before
---
Bummer thanks for sharing mate
---
Oof. I chased an in armed guy with a double barrel for 2 minutes earlier! I probably cracked off 12 rounds before I killed him! It was at the point where he realized I couldn‚Äôt hit him and he turned and rushed me and I had to start back peddling! Not my finest moment in NW.
---
Some things are so sad they become funny. Besides it will help people compile clips which is the main purpose.
---
üíØ
---
The fact that you didn‚Äôt recognize my comment as obvious mockery says something about this sub.

Welcome to Fallout 76,
---
LMAO it blows my mind how you fanboys are so ignorant that you assume that ALL youtubers hate on the game for views and likes. 90% of the youtubers that are hating on the game don‚Äôt need to make a fallout 76 video to get views. They   get a lot of views and likes regardless. They are just fed up with Bethesda‚Äôs shit like me and many other people are. Look at it from our perspective. Instead of putting more resources into fixing the game and making it better, Bethesda made a Battle Royale mode. If that doesn‚Äôt scream desperate I don‚Äôt know what does. Get your head out of your ass and maybe you would realize why those youtubers are upset with the game.
---
Who is Cr1tikal and why isn't he cleaning my shoes?
---
works good with perks
---
I think if that were in the game, the only ones playing it would be lower levels who either didn't grind countless hours or pay lots of caps to get where they are and what they have.
---
Compile clips for what purpose though?  To laugh at exploits of the game?  That isn‚Äôt super sensible since it‚Äôs a huge problem and needs to be addressed,  not laughed at.  ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
The great imitator questline
---
What does he say?
---
Why? Because they dare to have a different view than them? So I'm not intelligent because I don't wildly love the game?
---
I had the same thing happen to me today. 
---
I think they‚Äôll get more common as folks get more comfortable with nukes. If you know you‚Äôre screwed and in a tight circle, it‚Äôs really not the worst play.
---
So your input is largely irrelevant.
---
What's the point of such a stupid comment like this?
---
I think it‚Äôs got more to do with the game being free for a week than NW.
---
And yet here you are.
---
With great risk comes great reward. That sounds like a good time to me.
---
i hope this somehow fixes my problem where i have never been able to trigger operation tidy and am stuck at 3/4 on tadpole mission :(
---
It's worth a shot man I've been having a blast
---
Um... Check yo math son. You're not even ball park.
---
Most if not almost any other game is built on a fossil of a game engine and developed by a company that regularly gets beat out by unpaid amateur modders üôÑ
---
It‚Äôs a reddit overall rule thing that mods have to follow.
---
That isn‚Äôt a quest, I can‚Äôt find it online at least
---
I think showing the player level would be a good thing. Then low level players would be able to find vendors with some stuff they could actually buy and use. Low level characters could also do vending if they want without upsetting the high level players. You guys might not want plans or level 10 and 20 weapons, but there are players in the Forest at least that do.
---
Yeah I loved the game played non stop but when I lost my character to a bug and I lost everything it really dampened my joy for the game this was in February mid January but I tried to play with new character but yeah I'm coming back its downloading it right now and hopefully my love for it returns.
---
No problem. Several of the challenges are bugged. Hopefully they get sorted out soon, but who knows.
---
Man, it's far too late to live down the release. 
---
No matter what, people will just say it's a barebones piece of shit even though they've never played. Anything Bethesda does is shit and anyone who defends it is a shill who can't see bugs because they're so brainwashed.
---
The best course of action sadly is to just enjoy the game. I don't think anything will change public opinion. Especially since they've already decided Outer Worlds is the new deserved Fallout successor.
---
Maybe they will do it if we ask nicely? and a lot. emphasis on A LOT.
---
Actually lots of people have said that it's really quite disturbing how crazy and cultist like some fans of this game can be. I got horribly attacked just the other day for daring to say that the game would be a lot better on a more modern game engine.
---
Played since Beta. Never left. But the game has only been at release quality since the past month or so. I'm impressed that Beth managed to turn this steaming pile of shit into a playable game.
---
There are plenty of people that never stopped playing and also recognized the massive amount of flaws that have only recently been addressed.
---
People can enjoy playing a game and also be critical of its flaws at the same time.
---
I pre-ordered the tricentenial version of the game,and personally think it was worth the 80$ I used to buy it.
---
Lol I just got lucky and snagged them for 3.5 off of the lfg on xbox the other day. I was stoked! Yea I try to do free range as much as possible so I can sell those suckers! That and all the mounted plans, those sell pretty good for people who don‚Äôt grind out the new daily‚Äôs.
---
True. If you are implying that the one who makes the kill gets the gear, but I don't know if many would want to risk the expensive stuff lol
---
Ain't that the sad truth. Just imagine how good Bethesda's games would be if they put even 5 cents into fixing or replacing their fossil of an engine. 
---
Actually wait it wouldn't even cost 5 cents because unpaid modders have been fixing their engine for years and would happily help Bethesda do it ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Fair enough, friend.
---
Ya but as another comment touched on, those drugs are fictional.  Cigarettes are real and have groups lobbying against the advertisement of them to children. No such groups exist for Psyco or Bufftats :P
---
It's far worse this patch. Happens to me about 2/3 of the time now... quite awful when trying for that conduit heavy clean looking camp.
---
And that's fine. But give me the option. I love the idea of some pissed off basement dweller going mental because my level 3 killed his ass.
---
This guy fucking gets it.
---
Get ready for the downvotes.
---
Lucky hole mine
---
All the missile silos have a weight room right in the beginning 
---
Charleston fire department has a weight room
---
Monorail elevator, third level has weights 
---
Roof of west tek has some paint cans
---
Yeah I'm curious as well. 
---
I think it should be completely separate from what currently exists, unlockable after you complete current main questline. Otherwise what was the point of everything we did up until now if it's just gone. 
---
I realize many won't like my answer and are only here for the npc's, but coming out of the vault and finding a deserted wasteland is also part of the story.  
---
My thoughts are it should be a separate mode, without the queen and scorched and introduce completely new challenges and new big boss at end. Like maybe the enclave finally shows it's true intentions and we need to take them down. 
---
Maybe have the modes labeled something like Phase 1, Phase 2 etc, and you need to complete each before moving onto the next. That way you can show clear progression in game, yet still go back and redo things like the scorched queen by accessing Phase 1 again. 
---
What you guys think? Maybe their is a better way I'm not seeing.
---
And...? It's not okay people don't love the game and have a different opinion than you because...? It harms you how...?
---
YESSS
---
Yeah, the video isn‚Äôt very genuine. The performance is nowhere near that bad and he‚Äôs on low settings lmao
---
You also probably don‚Äôt have hundreds of hours in adventure mode with lots of stuff you‚Äôve grinded for. Nuclear Winter is supposed to be fun and rewarding not literally life or death lol no thanks
---
Yes. There are certain signs that are extremely rare so I‚Äôd just keep them all just in case.
---
I‚Äôm reporting you for being a cheater now. You‚Äôll be banned for sure.
---
What about the alcohol then? And it‚Äôs still drugs no matter if it‚Äôs fictional or not.
---
Yep!
---
Yep I‚Äôm at level 246!
---
Not my fault I outsmarted someone. I fail to see the problem here.
---
Legendary‚Äòs, junk, nuke cards, bubblehead‚Äôs.
---
I just played my first match, was having a fun time to my surprise, got loads of loot, found myself a full set of T-51. My full team was still up, I thought for sure we'd win with the armor, but instead I was going down in 3-4 shots and I was the biggest target on the battlefield, totally fucked my team over as they had to come revive me 3 times, got them killed in the end.
---
Power armor needs a massive buff.
---
It's called a headset. Wal Mart has them for $20.  Stop playing charades and communicate.
---
Because their just saying it to get more views, if they can actually explain with valid points for the hate then sure, like for example. Survival pvp balance is GARBAGE because of legendaries. or That the launch of FO 76 was a bug ridden MESS. That would be factual. However NW is probably the most polsihed thing that has come out of FO 76 ever.
---
Woah hey now none of that here this is the FO76 sub where reasonable and logical ideas and comments are worse than racism. There's no way some people just don't like the mode anyone that doesn't like the game is clearly engaged in a huge conspiracy to get clicks gosh are you new?
---
/s
---
Were you streaming? Just saw that on twitch, it‚Äôs hilarious!
---
I don't even know who Maria chavez is so I kinda half-believed that
---
Yeah I couldn‚Äôt jump to a different server so eventually I sucked it up and sneaked into the camp and claimed it. The owner thankfully didn‚Äôt make it back in time.
---
At least you can build your camp right there and keep Murgles company.
---
Like I said, you probably don‚Äôt have countless hours into adventure and don‚Äôt have items that you‚Äôve grinded for just to be lost by losing a match
---
Yep - sell it. Good luck!
---
Yeah and saying having a different opinion and disliking something just to get clicks and views is a lame way to board the circle train and karma farm and such.
---
He should've kept it to himself. It's rude to ruin it for the rest of us
---
Country roads will take us home to the places where we belong
---
If they don't want to lose their items, they can toggle not to. I don't see the issue here.
---
Man, why would they hate on a battle royal when there are so many other battle royals that do it better instead of on a broken engine?
---
Thank you for policing me.
---
Strangely I hadn‚Äôt thought of that. I like to play alone and only have ‚Äúfriends‚Äù for back in the old days of manual vending ;)
---
Dumb ass idea. Just... Why? That is so niche.
---
If you're into digital vaping/cigar smoking, just play RDR2. I'd be far happier with an increased stash limit.
---
Did you even read the comment you were responding to?? He said he thinks the battle royale mode is SHIT. Not that it's the shit?? And yet you just respond going on about yeah how fun it is like the OP said anything like that too? 
---
Do you just see "I love the game" and then not bother reading any further lol?
---
Get rekt
---
yeah i know i‚Äôve improved recently haha
---
Cool. Thanks. I did wonder how you made Brahmin appear. The bathtub from FO4 didn‚Äôt work so...
---
Glad I‚Äôm not the only one that was wanting this.
---
Explore. Kill. Trade. Befriend. Do whatever the hell you want.
---
????? The game absolutely has frame rate issues especially if they were on console. How is that not a good reason to return something? Your friend paid money for a product that doesn't work 100% well and he might not have had the best experience on he is 110% in the right to return that and get his money back. 
---
Jeez you sound like a pretty bad friend wow.
---
What do you mean toggle not to??
---
Help camp budget is not going *up* üòî
---
If they did this they'd have to allow you to actually use the gear.
---
Why risk my amazing gun and armor when I can't even use them? There'd be literally no point to join besides making an alt account to farm people too dumb to do the same.
---
Either way at the end of the day that sounds like the most boring experience ever solely because you don't want to grind out a good legendary and want to hide in a bush for 30 minutes until the scorchbeast kills the last survivor.
---
I do that after my group is dead or I see they are not playing as a team  ;p
---
This is a tricky one, you want spoiler free or don't care?
---
Aluminum: One of the mole miner items drops it. Top of the world and surrounding - ski poles. Ft. Defiance, trays. There are a few other really good tray spots, one is a cafeteria in a school, I think.
---
Lead, Charleston fire department gym and flatwoods motel gym daily should keep you good.
---
Go ahead
---
If you read my post, you'd see that I'd want an option to toggle item loss on or off.
---
Thats normal?? And 110% valid and a person buying a game is fully within their right to not be a fan of that? A low frame rate literally makes a game worse just some people don't mind as much and it's fine if you do but jesus how small minded are you to think someone else should put up with that? You know theres lots of people with sight or medical conditions that makes playing or watching things in low frames really bad? You're not the only human on the planet. Jerk.
---
For some reason, my game took an abnormal amount of time to load me into the match. So long, in fact, that I spawned with someone already decked out in marine armor with a minigun 10 feet in front of me, who instantly turned around and sprayed me down before I could even move  an inch.
---
If you're the kind of person who needs flawless performance and pristine graphics, the game will really bother you.
---
Grinding is bad design.
---
People hate on it because they always assume it‚Äôs like fortnite. I saw many people who said they were angry about it end up enjoying it, I never heard a complaint from anyone who tried it.
---
Anyway why would you lose ADVENTURE items from dying in NUCLEAR WINTER. Wouldn‚Äôt it be smarter to lose like overseer tank for dying or something? Or dying in adventure loses your gear?
---
They‚Äôre currently hiring a server maintenance position! That‚Äôs why they‚Äôre so bad the current guy quit! üòÇ
---
Should but shorn‚Äôt
---
People that can run Assassin's Creed Odyessy and The Witcher 3 on ultra 4K can't even get 60 FPS on FO76. It's because the engine is a fossil.
---
Shhhhhh
---
Making it unlockable after you beat the year one quest would be an impractical undertaking. You‚Äôd have to dedicate and entirely new set of servers to year one or year two content and then separate each players login by their quest progression.
---
Maybe, but I'd like the payout for coming out on top.
---
Just for shits and giggles, lets add on.
---
The sound glitch, guns sounding off as if they are shooting but not present.
---
Challenges such as TODAY, the NW challenge to PICK LOCKS CANNOT BE COMPLETED.
---
Yeah, Bethesda really redeemed themselves, as a company who puts out a game full of problems, to never be fixed. It reeks of a company treading water.
---
Your the one being a jerk rn, continue to harass me with your hate comments and I will report you.
---
You get a lot of overseer xp, sounds to me like you just want some easy loot without having to grind for it.
---
As far as I know, no. But this WAS supposed to be a limited time so I don't think they had it ready for a whole stat tracking system.
---
I figured. Thanks.
---
Then take a workshop at a power plant.
---
Maybe you could look here  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76)  to get some basic knowledge about the game.
---
I literally never said people can't dislike the game. It doesn't harm me. But it continually harms the reputation of the game and the company which is really frustrating when they put out something that is genuinely decent and most people are enjoying.
---
I followed a lowly level 6 around for a while tonight, giving him the thumbs up emote and attacking him in pacifist with a buzz blade. 
---
I hope he likes his haircut and that he wasn't weirded out by the psycho in combat armor smeared with blood!
---
Fastest possible is have someone high level let you tag high level enemies and then kill them, or was. 
---
Solo without exploits is to just find somewhere with high density enemies you can take down fast and server hop.
---
Yeah i thought about that, but don't really see a way of doing it without just undoing everything from year one. Which I'm sure some will love seeing as all they want are npc, but i feel it robs you a bit from the story. Or maybe I'm just feeling like year 1 was a waste of my time if it's being undone lol
---
This game has a potential like GTA games. You can add countless game modes. I hope Wasteland won't be the last expansion.
---
Thanks :P
---
You‚Äôll never find me if I get the bush üòè
---
Simple, dont build by scorchbeasts....O.o
---
Nope! My username in-game is Trus though - sounds familiar?
---
Why is it bad design to play a game and be rewarded the more time you play it? Especially one designed to be played for years.
---
A bad design would be making a game mode designed to punish players by taking hours of work and flushing it down the drain because a player would rather do nothing to get good gear.
---
I HATE HATE HATE BR games, even as a diehard 76 fan I was talking so much shit...then I played a match and fell in love lol
---
It's very different from the other Fallout games.  It's only loosely story based and is much more of a sandbox game.
---
There isn't much to do beyond explore the world, kill, loot, craft, level up, repeat.
---
Seek out the Overseer Logs, they'll naturally lead you to areas with more quests.  You can start by heading to her campsite.
---
random question, as im having the same issue, do you do a lot of mp? or do you only solo?
---
This.
---
Ask WoW players how they like grinding for 20 hours just for once upgrade. It isn't fun. It's repetitive. It's like going to work, you go to work because eventually if you stay long enough you can buy that nice car that you can't really afford to keep.
---
Explore, kill things, take stuff, have fun :)
---
Maybe because it's a garbage game mode? Maybe because the problems that have existed since BETA have not been fixed?
---
All the hate is warranted, and I don't give a fuck.
---
There is prett sick rewards I suggest you give it a try fallout was my main game before the BR
---
Oh wow I'm sure you have infinite wisdom and insight on my situation how could you not since you're coming at this with literally next to no info and no connection? So because I'm sad my buddy gave up on a game without giving it a second chance I'm definitely a monster.
---
Jeez I told him to return and it's okay if he didn't like it I just wish he did smh
---
I stopped around january because i got stuck on a quest, and when you're at school till 2am every night you dont even have a chance to consider playing games. I never disliked the game, but i acknowleged its flaws, and ive seen a lotta those flaws fixed and improved now.
---
So I played some fo76 a few weeks ago for a few hours after buying it for next to nothing. The shooting is terrible, the performance is terrible and the hitboxes and hit registration is terrible, lag was constant and the vats were just useless. How can this make a good battle royal, especially when competiting with other polished games?
---
Don't. 
---
Haha just kidding. I heard they updated energy weapons to do more damage but as far as I know, it's still a very underpowered way to play the game. Which is sad because laser weapons are a staple of this franchise. Just focus on perk cards for energy weapons and whatever type weapon it is (rifle or pistol).
---
So basically gta?
---
Must know more....
---
That also requires you to actually get a completely full set of all the same armor with all the same mods that change looks... which can be quite the hassle if you‚Äôre not drowning in supplies.
---
&gt;I had a teammate who got stuck in a specific spot where it took them a minute or two to finally free themselves of
---
THIS PROBLEM EXISTS IN ADVENTURE MODE FOR FUCKS SAKE. This is NOT exclusive to NW.
---
Honestly wish I could say that I stayed with the game since launch. I was a bandwagoner and wanted nothing more than to hate this game as a meme. I've come back and since 100% changed my mind. Bethesda has actually gained more of my trust than before.
---
Jeez I told him to return and it's okay if he didn't like it I just wish he did smh wow
---
Because of how much time and effort they've put into Adventure and Survival.  If Nuclear Winter is popular enough, they might allocate more servers to Nuclear Winter than the other modes, but entirely removing Adventure and Survival modes would be a PR nightmare, and rightfully so.  Not at all like the other bullshit Bethesda has put up with.
---
I'd rather go to work than get stabbed and have my wallet stolen anytime I go to the market.
---
Really, there isn't much difference between laser and ballistic weapons in regards to perks. The Science perks and Batteries Included are the only ones that are specific to energy weapons (crafting and ammo weight reduction, respectively).
---
For increasing damage, each energy weapon fits into a category: Pistol, Auto Pistol, Shotgun, Rifle, Auto Rifle, or Heavy. So just use the associated damage perk to increase damage for the type of energy weapon you want to use.
---
Sorry, but chances are that you are all incorrect. In the latest update Bethesda increased the budget cost of certain items. This means that if you were at 100 percent budget or even close to, after the update you were potentially over 100 percent. Scrap something neon and see if that works. I believe anything neon got a significant bump.
---
God I hope Bethesda doesn‚Äôt read this sub reddit, if you knew the game was gonna be grindy, stop complaining and either play the game or don‚Äôt, just because you want free easy loot doesn‚Äôt mean it should punish players who play the game as intended, get out there and grind!
---
**A comprehensive list of ideas/suggestions to enemies that I think would make FO 76 experience much more better and immersive and dangerous! (feel free to post suggestions that you'd like Bethesda to see)**
---
**Behemoths**
---
***- as one of the if not THE biggest enemy in game it stands nobody should be having a easy time soloing them let alone with melee. Behemoths should only be attacked with ranged weapons if you plan on surviving.***
---
Add a rag doll attack and radiation aura and increased limb damage , if you don't have PA with a jetpack or Marsupial you should be in for a lot of trouble
---
why rag doll? Well one it's the biggest enemy in game, and the danger of rag doll will equalize encounters and add the risk of aggroing nearby enemies making it difficult for solo players unless they clear the area stealthily before engaging or bring allies
---
**Deathclaws**
---
***-Why does an apex predator, announce it's presence when it sees you? A real Apex predator will be within striking distance before you even know it's there. The Deathclaw is the signature enemy of Fallout, and he needs a lot of work if he's going to be taken seriously again.***
---
Remove the Roar if isn't fired on before it sees you and give make their roar give them a speed/armor boost and increase their detection range so they start seeing the players first more often.
---
All Deathclaws should inflict MASSIVE bleeding damage if their claws can cut through power armor right? their ranged rock throw attack right now is useless/place holder for attacking people standing on stuff they can't reach, make it stumble the player so it can actually close distance without being fired upon and knock people off objects. Increase run speed so you can't out sprint them without speed demon. Bring back Chameleon Deathclaws (Stealth boyed Deathclaws) as a Random encounter at least.
---
Right now Yao Guais are much more dangerous because they can stunlock players with the stumble which I think is perfectly fine but every time I see a Yao Guai kill a Deathclaw my irradiated heart breaks a little inside.
---
**Snallygasters**
---
***seeing as this enemy is more a specialty and shows up in far less areas then most it should have its threat amped up and also personify the region it's showcased in. I.E Toxic Valley***
---
Given they ooze toxic waste of some sort and spit acid, Snallygaster's Acid spit and Tongue attacks should deal INCREASED durability damage to armor/power armor. This will change them from just being another mob to something you may want to actively avoid fighting or risk getting your freshly repaired armor melted into goo and leaving you at a severe disadvantadge.
---
**Robots**
---
***these enemies given their inherent nature should be tougher to deal with in close quarters given the fact that their all steel and metal. How am I breaking an assaultron with a boxing glove? My boxing glove or even arm should be breaking.***
---
All robots should do increased durability damage to melee weapons used against them, You wanna run up to a sentry bot or assaultron and kill it with brass knuckles or a golf club? you must have low INT.
---
**and as bonus no more Bloodied builds soloing the entire whitespring staff with melee weapons.**
---
***Possibly thinking that attacking robots with fist weapons will cause arm limb damage***
---
***(You ever punched something made of steel?)***
---
***Honeybeasts/Bloodbugs/Stingwings/Radscorpions***
---
***I feel like these enemies should really expand on the poison mechanic more, not just damage over time but STAMINA damage over time.***
---
***Make poison damage drain AP over time***
---
If you these nasty buggers get close enough for you to be stung/bitten, toxins should cause your body to go into shock or some kind of allergic reaction which keeps you from running. Suddenly getting swarmed by Blood bugs and Sting wings or being ambushed by a radscoprion is terrifying if you're not in a protective cocoon of power armor.
---
**Mirelurks**
---
***The name LURK is in their name! These guys should be really exhibit the ambush predator behavior, I should never see a mirelurk kill claw just walking around aimlessly being easy pickings for VATS, and if there are mirelurks around I should be worried about what put them there. I should be extremely paranoid around any large body of water of a Queen sleeping there. Similar to robots they have a hard shell EXCEPT the King/Baby mirelurks. Give them increased durability damage against melee weapons that hit them.***
---
Have Mirelurks burrowed more often and remove the abillity to VATS on them while their burrowed or at least require a perception of at least 6 or even tie it in with the Awareness perk. The only mirelurks that should be wandering around are baby mirelurks that aren't big or strong enough to burrow and stick around the nest and Kings/Fogcrawlers that stay above ground to protect them. Engaging one should extremely risky not because their strong by themselves, but you're not sure how many are burrowed nearby. Make watery areas high risk zones instead of a safety net. Make players think twice before diving into a river and swimming down because their might be a Queen/King sitting at the bottom of the river bed with the abillity to hurt me while I'm swimming whereas the rest of the mirelurks need me to be on land to walk up and hit me. Even possibly add Fog Crawlers walking along the bottom which can aggro and chase me as I get back onto land me before I realize why the combat music has started.
---
**Ghouls/Wendigos**
---
**you know what's scarier then a ghoul? A ghoul that's intelligent.**
---
**Make certain variants of Wendigos more quiet give certain Ghouls a different hit and run attack instead of just tripping over and falling.**
---
Similar to the Deathclaw don't make the Wendigo announce it's presence when it detects an enemy and give them bleed damage. That alone will amplify their already terrifying appearance. Reavers/Stalkers and other higher level variants of ghouls should have a new attack animation that doesn't leave them slowly getting up after diving at you, give them a different kind of tackle that stumbles the player and lets them run off afterwards and leaves the player open to being swarmed by other low level ghouls while they run away and and attempt to blind side the player with another tackle.
---
***IMPORTANT DETAILS!/Additional Ideas***
---
**-Double the radiation damage taken from Glowing enemies so Rad-X becomes more valuable**
---
**-Puncturing/Piercing weapons don't take double durability damage against Robots and Mirelurk shells**
---
**-Powerarmor prevents rag dolling and protects against poison and disease damage and until it's broken**
---
**-Mirelurk Queen Acid (maybe Grafton Monster?) also does durability damage like the Snallygaster**
---
**-Scorchbeasts/Sheepsquatch/Deathclaw/Sentrybot possibly have rag doll added to certain variation of their attacks**
---
***I.E The Headbutt attacks for Sheepsquatch and Deathclaw. The Forward Charge attack for Sentrybot and Scorchbeasts***
---
**-Scorch Beasts/Queen Gas attack does poison/stamina damage (gas mask negates this)**
---
**-Modify certain existing perks to become relevant to these changes such as**
---
***Awareness allows enemies burrowed in ground to be targeted by V.A.T.S***
---
***Blocker Perk maxed out prevents rag dolling.***
---
***Vaccinated reduces poison stamina damage by X%***
---
***Dodgy perk Maxed out player begins recovering from rag doll immediatly instead of after hitting ground***
---
***Ghouls/insects weak to flame damage! (Make laser weapons great again!)*** üòÑ
---
I feel like these changes would definitely switch up how players interact with the world and also be more immersive and dangerous and instead of every single encounter being monotonous, would add different benefits and risks to what kind of equipment and weapons people use, hope you enjoyed my suggestions Bethesda!
---
I thought that you needed to level up your intelligence like other games.
---
Yeah... was really bummed when I got the "NW: Pick 10 Locks" world challenge and made 0 progress on the "NW: Pick 3 Locks" daily...
---
What is a Steadfast?
---
Just continue with the main story until it becomes too hard for you, then try some side quests. Or, just explore the world and have fun!
---
I play on Xbox as well. They added a slider back in January I think. You can turn it down or off and it's fantastic. The game looks significantly better putting it down to 10-20%.
---
With 900 hours in yes it‚Äôs amazing. I just don‚Äôt watchclickbaity YouTube garbage
---
Primarily neon. Pretty sure it was in the patch notes.
---
Grafton Train station vendor has deep pocketed metal armor limbs for 880 caps (15charisma and hard bargain rank 3)
---
I could see that being pretty helpful.
---
I suppose I need to level up my intelligence to access those cards.
---
Yeah for some. Most weapon perks are usually in agility and perception but the laser specifics are intelligence.
---
Im lvl 16 playing the free trial and am really enjoying the game. Got max achievements from FO3, FO:nv and FO4 so i kind of hit the ground running. Im honestly surprised how much im enjoying it. I miss the npc's and i can definitely feel their lack of presence but im still really enjoying myself. Its nice to be back in the Fallout universe. No game comes close to the feel of the Fallout universe and it's good to be back.
---
By far my favourite part of the game is visiting peoples bases. Some very impressive builds over here on xbox. Im looking forward to drilling the game over the weekend. Its damn good to have a new FO world to explore.
---
I play stealth pistol. Vats Concentrated fire headshots melt them. Not sure if any of that is viable for you at 16 - but if you are going stealth build con fire is a must imo - just one card.
---
Pop all the relevant chems, get a stealth boy and head shot him down. Taking out a leg might be a better option at your level. Get some grenades, sneak in, chuck them and then try taking out a leg or both.
---
If you go right instead of straight ahead, there is a body with a pipe pistol on it. Most people including me just went straight forward and only had a machete to start with. So go right and there will be a corpse with a pipe pistol in their inventory. I hope that this somehow proves useful.
---
I hope they do. Because as a member of this community my opinon is no less valid than yours.
---
To be fair, I can't even get a consistent 60 frames on a 2070 on medium settings. It dips to around 30 sometimes as well.
---
While I don't mind as much, I can see why this turns people away.
---
Gotten three, all from the same machine. It‚Äôs my lucky machine :)
---
I don't build by scorchbeasts. They literally spawn right at my camp. Yes spawn. Like magic. I could be sitting out on my yard and suddenly I hear that screeching and see a scorchbeast appeared in the sky.
---
Imagine trying to raid the enclave vault, that would be stupid hard
---
No one is stabbing you and stealing your wallet. Jesus christ stop being melodramatic.
---
Admittingly, they were clapping at odd times, but that sounds like an Alex Jones level conspiracy theory.
---
Console makers are going to have to adopt controllers like those as standard if they hope to compete with PCs in the coming years. Gaming PCs keep getting cheaper and cheaper. I bought my VR ready PC, which runs most newer games on high and was ready to play out of the box, for only $750. That's only $350 more than a console.
---
Doing this tomorrow for sure.
---
Same- happened to my group as someone suicided with a nuke when we were down to the 2 teams.
---
You on Xbox? I‚Äôll show you my spot and I guarantee you‚Äôll love it
---
Ahh ok thanks, hadn't been up there lol
---
At this point I'd believe anything is possible. And I do love me some prop hunt lol
---
This is only partially correct. Having a higher intelligence does allow you to utilize more Int specific perks. And Science and Batteries Included are both Int perks. However, a higher intelligence won't increase damage with energy weapons.
---
The only passive higher intelligence provides is a larger condition bar when you craft weapons and armor.
---
Damn didn't realize being too dumb to grind a game also made you too stupid to understand metaphors.
---
Learn something new everyday! Anyway enjoy the grind!
---
Nope
---
Are you sure it was from vault 76? There are a few dead dwellers around the map but they're all from 94 and the overseer who escaped from 51.
---
Just won like 15 minutes ago from sitting in a bush. Was down to 5 and I was shitting myself since I thought a whole team and me was in this small circle but then the beast appeared and 2 guys shot at it. A guy opened up not 10 feet from me and killed 1 and the beast got the other. I stood up and grenades the guy beside me with the launcher, reloaded, and fed him another one.
---
You have a right to your opinion. In all honesty, I do believe your opinion would change if you were risking a God tier weapon that you grinded several hundred hours for to lose it because someone caught you off guard at just the right few seconds.
---
Junk, power armor I can‚Äôt use yet, ammo for gun types I don‚Äôt have yet, clothes I want to keep but not currently wear, notes/holos. Lots of stuff.
---
Right! I imagine basically finding out this entire time we've been helping modus to basically wipe us all out. We finally learn his intentions and it's all out war with enclave.
---
You didnt break anything. You just did the main quest in a different order. Which is fine.
---
You get the scorchbeast queen if you launch a nuke at Fissure site Prime, this is an optional part of the I Am Become Death quest you did to launch nuke. If you launched your nuke there, you already did this, but if not dont worry, you still can. 
---
Simply launch another nuke at Prime. This will bring out the actual scorchbeast queen.
---
As for the overseer quest, it's not bugged. It's just not over yet, theres more to come.
---
There will be npcs in wasterlander dlc.
---
I suppose you‚Äôre correct, but even though your opinion is 100% just as valid, mine is 100% less idiotic. I know you still won‚Äôt listen, but I‚Äôll make it simple. Say you could go to work and get money ok? Or, you could take some time off work for a relaxing evening. But, the twist is you get robbed of all your possessions for trying to have fun. See the issue?
---
This isnt traditional Fallout just so you know, but the game is mainly just shooting looting and leveling up.
---
Oh real mature, hurl insults at me. Beautiful. You little boppit. Want to piss your pants because some people don't like grinding then act like it was *I* who pissed your pants for you. Give me a break kid. Calm down.
---
Source?
---
Ditto that's exactly what happened to me. I got the 10, but not the 3 daily.
---
I tried so hard to enjoy it at the start. The stress tests were a great way to warm up to the game but then the actual game came out and was a buggy mess. Every other quest seemed to be completely bugged, opening my map would periodically lock my game for 3+ seconds. T-posing enemies, unavailable quest items, and the overall repeated frustration of just trying to 'play' completely turned me off to it.
---
I have bought at least 2 copies of every BGS game including 76, this was the first game where I was honestly disappointed by and far. I may redownload it, I tried a few months ago and the first enemies i saw were t-posed and buggy so i said screw it. It does look pretty fun now
---
If I lose then it's fair game. I don't see why I'm being lynched for this opinon. /r/fallout said you guys were toxic, but jesus christ this is ridiculous.
---
REEEEEEEEEEE
---
Link to "actual stats" please?
---
Also are you the only one playing the game? Because if not then your personal experience doesn't matter and doesn't mean others aren't having issues. How self centred are you?
---
I killed atleast 100people, but won only 2times so i am rank 22. Guys who just sit in bush till the end and lose as second team are bigger ranks. Don't worry about kills.
---
I'm of the opinion doing both is good. Reporting it directly to the devs means that they get alerted to it, which is great. But posting it on social media makes more people aware of it, which means more people know about it, which means a more even playing field until it gets fixed. If only a handful of people know about it and are doing it, then those people have a massive upper hand on those who don't.
---
I use a stealth 10mm pistol build - very underpowered. Great against humanoids (what isn‚Äôt though), and oddly Yao guai, but everything else is rough. Especially with the stealth nerf.
---
Wow. Seriously? Going the passive aggressive "I'm smarter than you, you know?" route? Cute. Really cute rocket man. I see the issue. You want people to play the game the same way you do. Well sorry kid, I play to win.
---
More like Bethesda literally said they didn't expect the game to review well and didnt give out review copies accordingly? Duh??
---
And reporting you for harassment.
---
I noticed all the new players coming in, so i built my camp as close to vault 76 as i could. Basically, they have to pass through it to go down the hill. All crafting tables are set up, and my vendors are stocked with really cheap supplies. Clean water for 1 cap, stimpacks/radaway for 5, free ammo and clothes, and any time i find a PA frame i strip it and leave for someone to take. I love seeing peoples reactions
---
Fallout 76 has more RPG elements than GTA. In FO76 your character starts out weak and ignorant about the world they've just entered. Your job in the game is to guide and develop your character as they gain experience, learn about the world, and grow stronger. Have you played any RPGs?
---
That's a bit dramatic too...
---
Melee is easier to be good imo. Don‚Äôt do pistols, it‚Äôs hard mode. Rifles can be good imo, but melee still beats it in terms of ease and raw damage.
---
On a related note: I used to run Strong Back but have decided I'm sticking with Lock Pick and never going back.
---
Lock Pick, Commando, Life Giver, Irom Clad, Bodyguards, Action Boy, Marathoner has been working really well for me lately.
---
Well, Bethesda will never put this feature in the game so you better get to working for your gear, I don‚Äôt want people to play the game like me, it‚Äôs just how the game is meant to be played. You play to win, but somehow still lost...
---
You haven't seen my inbox lol.
---
The first time I found the Vault dweller was I believe right in a bathroom right by a cabin. The second time I found the vault dweller was in a bathroom in a fort. So I believe he or she will spawn on the floor or in any location Bathrooms.
---
Those were purposefully taken down due to an exploit...sounds like you need to take that whiny bitching down to the cheaters and maybe do some research before you open your mouth again.
---
your both right think about you leave your camp somewhere else and letting the enemy get nice and comfy shotting at you from a tower you left behind then... then move your camp... all of sudden they have no cover and are falling. easier target then if they were in the bushes.
---
Ahh, okay, yeah i just nuked morgantown. I figured there would be more steps telling us explicitly to nuke that site or something. Welp, time to get ready to take the bunker again :p
---
Except Jim Sterling played the game and yongyea too? Shit yongyea literally got a collectors edition sent to him by Bethesda so what are you talking about?? Could you lie more please??
---
I mean with so much different decor, it would work really well I think.
---
I probably have but I don‚Äôt remember
---
Ah Far Harbor, remember how it got delayed for weeks on PS4 because of the fog lag?
---
Yeah but it was not a skeleton it looked fresh I had a screenshot of it I might just post it later
---
I came for the free trial and ended up buying the game. I play on Adventure, since I have no interest in NW (nothing bad to say against it, just isn't my thing). I'm really enjoying the game and I'm in the planning stages of my future in Appalachia. I'm on xBox, so if you see me on there, come say hi.
---
But it was before the Vault 51 dweller was added
---
If you scrap an insane amount... You unlock/learn a new attachment for em
---
I got stuck at the beginning of the match.
---
free xp yeah but a waste of time.
---
Why get a small amount of xp when i can actually play and get more
---
I had a hell of a time getting low levels to loot drop bags. I kept doing the follow me/gift emotes...they don't get it.
---
You can keep the holotape to listen later.
---
I found your camp once and bought some level sturdy leather armor. Been looking for your camp ever since. Thanks for helping out the new players!
---
"GIVE ME YOUR MILK!!!"
---
He literally said he was never going to play the game when he got it
---
did you even read what he said, before you flapped your mouth hole "i dont like battle royale games *either"*    he was saying it was better than other BR games in thier opinion.
---
To be fair, most people don't have time to check out every game, so reading forums and watching videos on a game are all valid options. The problem is when people simply regurgitate what they read and hear as the ultimate truth on a game, instead of understanding that what they read and hear are the opinions of others and not representative of everyone's experience or enjoyment of a game.
---
Go to the fallout76.ini in the games folder and change uMainMenuMusicAttnmB = 800 to something like uMainMenuMusicAttnmB = 2400, much quieter.
---
Lol have you been active in the anthem subreddit since launch?
---
Which is a shame. I really hate scummy businesses! Perhaps the fame got to him...
---
Username checks out.
---
Honestly if people are so dead set on hating this game than I say let them. All of the hate and 76 still isn't dead because it has a dedicated fanbase who actually enjoy the game despite all of the people trashing it. I'm just glad that more people are trying the game and actually enjoying themselves.
---
Me too I was thinking something like what destiny has where you can move items in and out and track quests, challenges, and even friends progress...
---
It'll probably be pretty fast for you, but again your a high level and you have all the fast travel points already.
---
If I could just fast travel to new Vegas or the institute at level 60 I'd probably be able to finish those games in no time at all also.
---
Also none of the main quests really connect besides leading you to places where the next will start. You'll obviously see a chain of events and be able to follow an obvious path, but you can still understand the whole story while missing some parts. If that helps for your raider thing.
---
So theres more to her quest coming in updates then?
---
Yeah, i launched one before, just not at a fissure site. Gotta do it again i guess
---
There's a few hints on what modus has done/future intentions. More gets released with every patch. Mabye we help the bos destroy some of the enclave much later.
---
More survival than MMO, you can play solo or invite friends or group with random guys they always intvite you in party, if you like fo4 you will like this too. Of course NPCs missing but bethesda on E3 said NPCs coming.
---
Tragic, done in by your own mine üò´
---
Would have been convenient if bethsheda puts in messaging in the game instead of mic speak. Most players will always emote "no mic" even when they do have because their english is not that good and their pronounciations is difficult for others to understand.
---
If you dont find a rare explosive laser dont bother. Explosive lasers are rare because they no longer drop. They patched them out a few months after launch.
---
Ahhh lag fail, the BR player's ultimate enemy!
---
Yep, I think nukes and mutations are core to the 76 mood :)
---
Idk how a name like nuclear winter is somehow less good than fire storm when the franchise is literally all about nuclear war but okay I guess...
---
Those little metal letters are my favorite thing ever. 
---
Show up at my camp? Guess what? You know the prices of everything before you even open up a vendor machine. And what I'm out of. Screws sell really fast, apparently. 
---
It's probably not the most descriptive thing in the world, but you have an idea of what you're gonna spend before you spend it.
---
What attachment? I can‚Äôt seem to find out online
---
I delete fo76 game and re-install but it's not changed :(
---
How do you manually re-updated ps4 system?
---
Just wait till you want to readjust a piece of floor you put on top of a staircase. Forced to pack up your entire camp
---
I don't know how atom shop skins discern player skill but whatever makes you feel better about being worse than the next guy.
---
Marathoner doesn't work in Power Armor in Adventure mode (not sure if that's always been the case, but the perk card didn't say "Not in Power Armor" at launch) and it's possible that has carried over into NW (despite the wording missing from the NW perk card).
---
Ah, I never used the card in adventure so I never noticed.
---
I‚Äôm not one to kink-shame.... but damn
---
Okay, whatever you say jackass. I just wanna be kinky
---
My best use is if I cant find a rad suit but want to loot some things in a hot zone. Get in, loot, exit power armor.
---
I hate that I can't store Power Armor in my inventory. I dont want to use it, but I also want to have it just in case the end of the match is a nuke zone.
---
But yes, you certainly run out of AP faster in Power Armor. Cant tell you the amount of times I've been stuck in a storm because I couldn't sprint thanks to wearing power armor.
---
Mabye because if they named it 'Ring of Fire' immature idiots like me would be giggling everytime we started the mode up. üëâüòÜüëà
---
Snap. There‚Äôs a separate challenge in the World section for picking 50 locks in NW, and that one‚Äôs counting up just fine. But the Daily? Bugged.
---
Yeah and?? The OPs comment was still that they don't like the BR mode. Why would you then respond to them saying you like the BR mode?
---
Delete this post. We don‚Äôt want any one to know our secret.
---
Okay I will start to explore the forest more and see what‚Äôs out there.
---
&gt; If you want to do the main story at one time
---
I‚Äôd rather do it in one go to stay immersed. So I‚Äôll probably wait till 40, but branch out more and do the other quests until then.
---
Around what level should I do the scout camp badges? Those seem interesting.
---
You won't find one except for more caps than you can hold realistically... since they don't drop anymore. TSE tesla shotgun (uses rifle perks still) is crazy fun though.
---
200 down, what does connection speed have to do with the game freezing since launch?
---
And? He played the game and then gave some pretty accurate criticisms in one of his videos. What about this is hard to understand? Are you saying he's so stupid that he would bash and talk about the game without having experienced it?
---
My main has too much junk in her trunk. A couple of decent legendaries I don‚Äôt use but can‚Äôt bear to part with. Clothes. Way too much scrap. Aid I could ditch. Some stable flux to start an under armor business. My alt is more discerning. But certainly clothes and screws.
---
The problem is what does Nuclear Winter have to do with the game mode though?  Freezing to death in a post-nuclear blizzard is the direct opposite of being burned alive by a nuclear fire hell storm.
---
It's like naming your dog Cat.  Yes, Cat can technically be a name... but it doesn't exactly fit a dog.
---
Harassment how...?
---
Yeah it's just moreso noticeable in NW where you can't quick travel and time is of the essence.
---
Continuing to reply after I asked you to stop is harassment
---
Welcome to commercialized entertainment.
---
Where whatever generates more views and likes is what drives the content creators. Currently the popular thing is to bask FO76, regardless if the content creator actually enjoys the game.
---
Money &gt; player integrity and honesty.
---
Kids hate FO, so lets cater to their whinging and provide negative content to get those upvotes and liked and ‚Äòbe cool‚Äô.
---
There is a word for that kind of thing though.
---
It‚Äôs called being a sellout.
---
And that is really what they are. Selling out their honest opinions for an extra like.
---
I unsubbed from several dishonest content creators over the past year as they were obviously just on a hate train against various games simply because being a hater was (and in some circumstances still is) popular.
---
And I really hate transparent dishonesty. Sellouts do not get my like or views.
---
Yes from what I‚Äôve gathered it‚Äôs for legendary weapons, and if I understand correctly there are only two specific quests like this, and they are both side quests? 
---
If that‚Äôs the case I will start playing the main story soon and just branch out and do other quests besides those specific ones.
---
been playing since launch. even through all the hate and backlash the game got I still just kept on playing, hoping Bethesda wouldn't give up on the game. now we have a great BR mode, all of the content we've got from the roadmap so far, and Human NPCs with dialogue trees and choice/consequence coming soon. the future is looking bright.
---
Yes because he said he never played
---
I'll be walking anyhow as I want to 'organically' experience the journey as Bethesda intended; if I hadn't walked the rails to Morgantown Airport I would never have discovered the Flatwoods casualty note on the dead courier. So that will probably tack a few more hours on.
---
From reading the wiki I'm lead to understand you get sent to the Top of the World but Rose won't let you in, and then won't help you, unless you do her tasks. What I was hoping for was that there was enough to go on info-wise to 'jump' right over her quests and move straight onto the Free States, Brotherhood and then Enclave quests, but the wiki's are pretty sparse on details.
---
 There are clearly some from posts I have read, but I can't imagine it is widespread enough to bother with until we have a way to display collectibles.
---
Helvetia Church is the only place I've picked them up.
---
Moving the camera in photo mode takes FOREVER, though. I think I'd feel at a greater disadvantage trying to use this over just going into 3rd person.
---
What I really wish they would fix is allowing spectators to be in 3rd person. It should be 1st person spectating or not at all.
---
Truly sorry for breaking character, gday
---
???? Your comment was literally "My friend got the game, had bad FPS so he returned it. It's like people want a reason to hate it"
---
In what word does that not read as "friend hated on it for a bad reason like FPS"??? It's not my fault your comment was very misleading if you do actually agree that returning a game because of low FPS is okay and valid. 
---
Literally your comment was fine and even touching until the whole "its like people want a reason to hate it" that really ruined it and made it sound like you think your friend was wrong to give up on the game due to low FPS.
---
Where are all you blessed souls on Xbone? Unless I use the LFG to find nice people, the most help I get is people tagging into public events. I've had exactly one guy run up right after I left the vault on my new character and drop me a handful of plans for basic stuff, but that's about it.
---
The battle royale is the only group pvp. You have survival mode which is the core game but every other player is hostile and unmarked on map aside from the top 3. Adventure mode is the core game with PVP being optional, and almost non existent now in that mode. The past events/add ons were all dead within days. The last event arktos was very glitchy and many players couldnt even do the event as it was an instant crash. If the free event doesnt turn in alot of new customers the game will struggle further. I server hopped quite a bit but still see the same people quite often. Once the free weeks up ill be curious to see how the player base looks. If theres a comeback in store its right now as theres alot of new players obviously.
---
My first encounter with a higher level was him killing me at the overseers camp
---
Yeah. Just like Fallout 76. So whats your point?
---
It is just as I said, it isnt something new to see. Is ot good? Nope. But it is not uncommon these days, especially if its a multiplatform title.
---
Realy? Thats cool but like wht do you mean!? Send me link mate. You on xbox or what
---
Yeah that's true, though it does describe the game mode well. You're trying to survive in a more and more hostile place whole scavenging for any supplies you can find in a world that's trying to kill you. 
---
I just see it as an aesthetic thing. Like sure, naming a dog cat doesn't make it a cat, but if I base all my life in cats and cat stuff and named my other dogs after lions and other cat stuff it would be weird if I just named my dog "German shepherd."
---
I'm using master heavy gunner, cowboy, demolition expert, master commando, lockpick, lifeguver, and bodyguards
---
what they need to do is make it like power armor and not like video game "armor". then when it's OP and slow and easy to hit and everyone can hear it coming, everyone will focus it down. the balance will come from fear
---
There are four options that it will display 3 of those 4 options.
---
no this is funnier.
---
I've had very good luck selling some of the more rare world spawn plans and the like. Same with costumes.
---
I was just disappointed he gave up so fast and I was making a broad statement about people in general.
---
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
And how it‚Äôs not unusual to see things just strewn about. It‚Äôd be damn impossible to find props
---
Where did she find that fabulous dress? My character would look fantastic in that!
---
That's a lot of various damage perks.
---
It'll pretty much say things like:
---
Screws, springs, and gears = 7 caps ea.
---
All clothing = 20 caps
---
Mags = 25 caps
---
All ammo = 1 cap
---
Everything else 60% off listed value
---
I put the majority of youtube ‚Äúreviewers‚Äù in the same category as ‚ÄúTheReplyGirl‚Äù from years back.
---
She would say controversial shit, generate a storm of haters and defenders, which generated tons of engagement for her channel.
---
She was way ahead of the curve even then in understanding how youtube works.
---
Now these youtube ‚Äúreviewers‚Äù have learned that being dishonest and just stir controversy creates more buzz, thus more views.
---
However, it is dishonest douchebag behavior. And dishonesty deserves nothing. So screw those fake reviewers who are just sellouts for likes.
---
 This is a big part of it, though I am sure a lot of players are playing the new mode also.  I am entertaining myself with bombarding flatwoods harmlessly to mess with the new players ( i am in pacifist mode so no damage done.  It is fun to watch them all scramble.
---
Agreed! Not sure why they don't? Unless it is to puah people to NW to ease the servers up on adventure/survival?
---
I'm on Xbox and close to level 100 and I haven't been able to launch a nuke or do Arktos yet. Any time we try to launch a nuke, either an objective glitches out, the game freezes, or I get kicked from the game. With Arktos, the elevator button doesn't load most of the time. I've managed to have it work twice but the first time, the objective was glitched and no legendaries down there. And the second and only other time I got to do it, all of the legendaries would disappear within a second of death. There was a bunch of us in there and I know at least 4 other people in there experienced the same issue. I don't get many frame rate issues but everything else you mentioned, I've experienced recently on Xbox too.
---
Lol yeah I just took off cowboy for bullet shield I tend to get more rifles than anything
---
"I never said people can't dislike the game"
---
"Put out something GENUINELY DECENT"
---
Those two sentences are very mutually exclusive because the game being "genuinely decent" is only your opinion. According to the reviewers the game is definitely not genuinely decent. 
---
Again it's also largely just your opinion that the games better than launch. How does it harm you that some people don't share these opinions of yours? Why does it make you so emotional about it? They 110% deserve to have a different opinion ESPECIALLY if they put any money on the game. 
---
Also Bethesda FULLY deserves to have their reputation ruined and they don't need random internet people to do it, if you know anything about their history they're doing a fantastic job ruining their reputation all on their own. 
---
Also for every "lol fallout 76" person there's also a "BURN THE YOUTUBERS AND ANYONE THAT DARES CRITICIZE F076" person so I really don't see how you can go after just one group when both are equally as damaging. I get you're heavily biased but still come on?
---
Hate comments? How are they hate comments? Didn't even notice I responded to you a few times makes sense why I thought the writing seemed familiar lol
---
Any fallout 76 youtubers you recommend? It‚Äôs really hard to find videos on YouTube of this game that isn‚Äôt someone just slamming the game
---
 Just downvote his video and move on.  Haters gonna hate and troll
---
To be fair since legendary can stack, you can very well get all 3 of those effects on one weapon.
---
201 comments, for some reason I don‚Äôt believe you
---
If you want practice in a pvp where there are a lot of targets and opportunities to practice aiming, play the crucible in destiny. Takes about ten hours/100 kills to get the hang of it. 100 kills in NW will take you FOREVER.
---
Please link me a video of someone just hating on it without any points. Please just 1 because anytime I've asked someone this I never get a response lol.
---
Yea was watching some Kritical earlier and he hated the game because he didn‚Äôt know how to play it. Said it was trash the entire time because he was fisting people
---
Marine tactical helmet makes cap farming downright trivial.
---
For less than 100 caps in materials from the vendor you can make more helmets than you can sell in a day. I can‚Äôt believe they haven‚Äôt changed that yet.
---
No , im Fine with bad graphics.
---
Link? Because in his initial video about the game has made lots of valid and widespread pointed criticisms and even a few I hadn't heard much of before.
---
I've been seeing the same on my furious plasma flamer this patch. I don't know if it's not working or just me seeing things due to the damage  numbers looking off
---
Agreed, Most of the time soloing into Nuclear winter to get a random team is that I have had problems with no on talking.
---
What are you playing on?
---
Just block me?? It literally suggests you do so? You keep responding to me so...??
---
Personally I don't watch Shroud, but Lirik's chat is the same crap. Bunch of morons who probably never played this game hating on it because it's cool thing to do.
---
Sorry, my bad I'm on ps4
---
Good! They just need to optimize it so it runs better!
---
Waste of time. Theres even a scout challenge that requires you to find certain stuffed bears but they dont count if you buy them. Only if you find them in the wild. Junk like that and magazines weigh too much to collect plus its real easy to scrap junk. Unless you have a great 3 star item or ultra rare outfit its hard to make money as most players sell the same stuff and many sell things very cheap.
---
Ive submitted a ticket with Bethesda
---
yea that sounds like a great idea, it's a plausible idea for the developers to think about doing. they had a companion app for fallout 4 that was on the App Store before the game even came out AND they made fallout shelter. (reinstating the fact that Bethesda has already had plenty of experience in app development for their games) so I don't see why fallout 76 shouldn't get a companion app.
---
Lets see how many are retained.  I think a lot.  The game is fun really.
---
go look up any of the streams mentioned, google is a thing you know
---
That's all that's ever happened to me on Xbox, I had no idea it was supposed to requeue.
---
No.
---
And yet assassin's would be worse than almost any other prefix in both PvP and PvE.
---
Thank you for posting this, it‚Äôs fantastic to see all the images too.
---
I can't remember for sure, but i think you have to do roses quest.
---
That's because he was reading off people experience on reddit that's all yong does is read reddit abd kotaku

---
I'm completely fine with constructive criticism, but most of the time it's just hating because it's cool thing to do, just like on release. People acting like this game hasn't improved over the last few months. Just ignore them and move on, or even better, dislike the video and write comment about how you enjoy this game and see people getting triggered.
---
Only place I know is the place where the Mistress of Mystery quests finish, I think Seneca Rocks?
---
that sounds like perhaps one of the best stories I've heard someone experience from this game so far lol
---
That station is good for a lot of armor mods.
---
Well, it would make sense to have one of the biggest and best BR streamers to pay the game. It's good publicity and even better if he genuinely enjoys it which he seems to do.
---
I find it actually pretty funny we can't use cigarettes or cigars, meanwhile we can hapily pump drugs into our veins.
---
I agree that would at least narrow down you trying to roll and pray for specific pieces of gear you want to upgrade.
---
I‚Äôve seen one at Tanagra Town and one at Tree Tops before :)
---
If you were on xbox I would be down. Oh well. :)
---
Might just put master commando on though
---
Sorry I don't give a damn about streams, I thought we were talking about actual video content since everyone keeps saying to burn the youtubers. If you can't provide a single video example or only are talking about streamers this doesn't matter then.
---
Jumped down a cliff really carefully so as not to take fall damage.. landed in the middle of a group of 3 enemy players who had been hiding at the base.
---
Ad Victorian brother
---
It's ok not to always be ok;)
---
I want a pet alien
---
So because he had a lot of similar criticisms and issues with the game as other people that means he didn't play and was just reading reddit? It's beyond impossible that more than 1 person can have similar issues and similar thoughts? That defies reason does it? Would it break the universe if that was true?
---
you know what people stream? video.
---
How about also adding more stars for a compounding increase in price as well. but you can only apply an additional effect one at a time, would make for great weapons and armor or absolute crap with rng. Along with no removing of that effect.
---
He literally says in every video he read reddits
---
I'm on PS4 as well, mine doesn't freeze at 30 down ü§∑
---
... and get shot in the process as it takes three or four keystrokes to get OUT of Photo mode. Does it let me elevate my field of view? Sure. Does it also make me a **sitting duck** ? **1,000% YES**
---
Honestly, it seems like people are actively *looking* for crap to complain about at times.
---
Change your activate key from E to F, you can now no longer use activate to place items.
---
also not been working for me the past few hours.
---
Again, can you provide one single youtube video to back up your claim? Just 1. I don't care about some stupid streamer and everyone keeps blaming these youtubers so I'm sure there should be one example for you to provide right? Unless your whole argument is just biased smoke blowing and witch hunting?
---
Sorched earth event spawns some queen of the hunt daily too. I find them in the mire something just walking around
---
What do I do if I‚Äôve always loved the game, had it basically since launch, but haven‚Äôt been able to get the upgrades to my computer to be able to even play it?
---
I love this game. just started playing
---
i was the big guy my Whole life... i was already 50 in full t60 At the end of the Beta
---
1500 hours in
---
Okay and one person is on reddit? That's it? Am I talking to myself right now?
---
Awww no, that blows. I once jumped down to follow my group into Sutton Station. Turns out they came in from the other angle because they saw two people on the cliff hiding out, but because I'm more cautious and dart from bush to bush, they ran off ahead and didn't emote for me to follow so I didn't see what way they went. They left me to die üò¢
---
Its firestorms that black out the sun. Firestorms caused by nuclear blasts. You know, that wall of fire that nips at your heels as it closes in.
---
Firestorm is the name of Battlefield 5‚Äôs battle royale mode so that‚Äôs ones def already taken
---
I mean, are we really going to complain how someone uses the movement in the game?
---
I think both apply.
---
Been here since launch
---
Level 313 every day play
---
Add it to the atom shop with the description, "This stylish nylon bag looks just like canvas!"
---
doubt they will only for the fact that they are trying to push sales in the atomic shop, when a battle Royale game starts to gain some attention its popularity goes up, so does the sales of cosmetic items/outfits. adding in-game items to be worn in NW wouldn't make sense the their business. although I do agree that it would be cool.
---
If you plan to constantly move, you're probably better off building just a basic shack.
---
Myself, i built something decent and basically haven't moved in months. Not a waste in my opinion. Camp isn't destroyed by players anymore, not since last patch. Only thing to worry about now is the monsters or someone dropping a nuke on your camp. Both of which have simple solutions.
---
Build turrets to defend camp and if someone dropping nuke, drop off server and problem solved.
---
Problem with constantly moving camps is you can't always place it down again. Will say some pieces are floating or not properly aligned to ground. I suppose this one depends on how you build your camp. I believe if you only have a single foundation and build up from that, should be able to move without issues.
---
No dude yong yea literally just reads post on teddits abd tells people about the experience he doesn't do research or anything
---
This is intended and how it's always been...
---
The last thing that this game needs is a KDR. I‚Äôve played enough GTA Online to know how a KDR stat will bring out the worst of the toxic players in this community.
---
Because people are dumb and sunk cost fallacy is a real and scary thing.
---
Been here since BETA, playing between 1 to 16 hours every day. Love it!
---
I am a luck sob too, never had my camp griefed, never got hunted down and killed when slap damage didn't work correctly. Never encountered any big bugs that ruined gameplay. And now it is smooth and nice... mostly.
---
Didn't think I would like BR in this, but hey, it is fun.
---
Yes people forget that the money comes first, no matter how much devs love the game they still need to eat, pay bills, take care of family, and live.
---
Sometimes things get out of hand
---
It's really fun having so many low levels around this week to help out!
---
Yeah but my understanding is you can only place it once per round, and there‚Äôs a decent chance it will end up outside the ring at some point.
---
I did this kind of thing to a new player way back February, gave him some weapons, ammo, and some meds when he came out of the vault. I wonder if he is thanking me out there somewhere..
---
A popular tactic is to down a player and wait for teammates to try to revive. So when you leap in and finish the downed player off you are in fact ruining things, please don't do it.
---
I'm sorry were we not just talking about Jim Sterling? Why the shit are you talking about Yongyea? Of course yongyea just reads reddit there's no one on this planet who doesn't know that hence why I didn't even bother talking about him. Why are we suddenly talking about him when you were trying so hard to say that Jim Sterling has never played the game and was just hating on it to be cool. Stay on topic??
---
This makes my blood pressure soar! I hate this glitch sooo much!

My brother and I started playing on a 2 person team. We were both hiding in bushes near the bridge and resort.

Him: "I wonder if someone is going to run past again without noticing me" (referencing a previous game)

Less than a second later, 2 people run past both of us, with a 3rd chasing after them.

People gotta complain I guess

Because all the debris tossed up from the multiple ground bursted atomic weapons  would eventually result in a nuclear winter?
---
sad
---
It‚Äôs only meant to be one of them per day, either lucky mucker, chow line or dross toss so it‚Äôs working as intended. It is a long grind but keep an eye open when using player vendor machines as I once found 75 mr fuzzy tokens for sale, I guess they got fed up collecting them, I‚Äôve been doing the challenge every day since the beta and I don‚Äôt have the whole outfit yet but it will be worth it in the end lol
---
But the game and game mode are awful.
---
Nope I was talking about Jim yongyea idgaf about he just drones on about reddit stories mostly ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

What a great way to alienate the new community members!

The only youtuber I watch thats plays this game is "The Wanderer" hes good

I really only use the Automatic Pipe Rifle &lt; Radium Rifle &lt; SMG &lt; Automatic Combat Rifle &lt; Automatic Handmade. I feel that's more than enough choices that Commando covers whatever I happen to find. Theres been VERY few games where I didn't find one of those weapons shortly after spawn.

Jim i don't like because he gets outraged about everything which just makes it seem like he hates everything

Rare and common outfits. A lot of weapons(i get bored using the same weapons over and over). 3 sets of power armor. Junk that I use quite often like wood, screws, alum, plastic and steel. Few pieces of regular armor. I also threw in all my notes and holo tapes in there.

Heh?

Yeah lol, 50 cal is nice but hardly ever find them

I'm just tryna have a clean new tub and toilet . And be able to have a bobblehead case to display them. Once we pick it up. That one appears In the case. Same with the magazine rack. Loved collecting all of it in FO4 and displaying it in the settlement. Also the ability to drag and drop items like beer bottles to my bar would be great. Then people can come in and take it for free. So it looks like a real bar
---
They wouldn't remove those modes.. they would just stop updating them much at all.. it is literally what happened to fort ite save the world.. they have all the resources and money now and still put everything into their BR

Fallout 76 is a joke, I don't need to put my computer specs, everyone does and some people like myself included have a PC worth 3k or more my pc is more like 4800.00 custom build best of the best and can throw any game at it, benchmark apps the numbers are right on the money. Then you play fallout 76 to hear all the things/ reasons it must be your pc and what you have to do that in fact sometimes none of them work. The game lags all the time, stutters, loads slow, crashes, bugs player weights are wrong and have to keep relaunching game to get them right. Ever time they come out with another thing that is going to make the game great they still have the 50 other issues they don't address. Just like now fallout nuclear winter load times vary, bugs, lag and no it is not my pc.
---
Not fed up, just see an opportunity, I usually hit up Camden once a day anyway, and if other players who do want things on that redemption list want to give me a few extra caps for having bothered with the daily, I'm not going to complain...
---
Its supposed to have at least 30. I'll check there later, thanks for the information.
---
I hope that's something they're going to add later.
---
Keep exploring I would start in the toxic valley then the savage divide and there is plenty of quest line to get you higher in the levels and you can get better weapons
---
Just kill a ton of enemies by a vendor and pick up LITERALLY EVERYTHING they own and sell it to that vendor with hard bargain equipped. This works best with super mutants and mole miners in my opinion. I say do this next to a vendor because youll probably be over encumbered by the end of it.
---
Still playing my dude from the first beta session. Amazed he hasn't encountered any of the nastier bugs that could've messed him up.
---
I like to run through west tek and take all the super mutants weapons and sell them, server hop, repeat. Good 5.56 and xp farm too
---
NARC!
---
Why not make all enemies friendly. I hate going in to Westek and all those dang super mutants keep attacking me. I should be able to just loot the place without being harmed. What's this game coming to
---
I'm in love with my cozy little spot overlooking the 1st Overseer's camp. 
---
Just in front of Arktos Pharma building. There is a rock outcropping and it looks like you couldn't build there but you can place flooring that 'syncs' with the surrounding rocks and actually looks rather nice. Even got a copper mine nearby.
---
Gatling guns are the most common heavy gun and even then, they can sometimes be rare. A friend of mine runs the heavy gun perks because he can always rely on us to find weapons for him so it's more reliable.
---
The only time I've left it is when I can't physically get on my Xbox to play it.
---
Unfortunately that is way too often but I still love this game!
---
I found 20 or so once. Likely another player took them. I wish we could have our own instanced interiors of places, or some system where the item gives us one but stays for the next player. I must have missed so much because someone else got there first.
---
Well they would definitely sell like hot cakes I‚Äôm sure, and once I have the outfit, the big plush and finally the paddle ball il be selling them to other players as I dump stuff off on that vendor at the park so I‚Äôm always in the area
---
Hey that's great bud, but also people being apologist for a negative reaction to a post just wastes more post space. The apology was unnecessary and you'll probably get more flak for making a post that really doesn't bring anything to the table.
---

---
I‚Äôve played it here and there but always was discouraged to keep on playing because no one I knew played it but I had so much hope for it. It payed off in the end, more of my friends play it so we all have a blast but I wished I played it a little bit more when it came out.
---
A dutch oven? what's special about it? It gets hot just like any oven.
---
Lol well that would make the game too easy. There's a fine line between easy and ragequit hard. Sometimes this game is all the way to ragequit hard.
---
Run the Feed the People event for the Beef Stew. If gives you +5 xp for (i think) an hour and you get something like 4 or 5 of them.
---
I‚Äôll help you
---
Battle royal mode. Not standard.
---
Pick up every assault rifle you can carry and sell those. They are common with super mutants . They sell for a pretty penny. 
---
Or you can buy my mutation serums for 250c and sell them to the vendors for 500c :)
---
How do you get scrip so quickly? I farm whitespring and uranium fever everyday and manage to get 1-star everytime
---
It‚Äôs such a fun game, I got it at launch because but I‚Äôm only level 25 because I got loads of games for Christmas that I‚Äôve been playing, I got back into it a few days ago, I‚Äôve been meaning to for a while but I wasn‚Äôt prepared for the day of downloading updates!
---
Personally, I made a habit of walking circle around top of the world area and Harper ferry just killing whatever in sight and just sell their weapons. Usually clean the vendor bots out by then for a good 1400 caps for 30 min of works
---
yeah why don't you look them up by the names mentioned repeatedly? I'm not gonna do it for you, you're a grown man aren't you?
---
This is really true
---
I was just going to suggest this, prop hunt in this game would be the most absurd shit ever!
---
Great post! This is what 76 is all about!
---
I now have a goal other than live as long as possible lol
---
They're storage bins for your camp.
---
So instead of building stash boxes you can build those. That's it. Just camp decorations.
---
Decent? It's the best DR...
---
Yeah buddy... suuure
---
Love might be a bit of a stretch but I have rather enjoyed it.
---
I've been here since day one; preordered the day it was announced. I've quit for spurts here and there. Either real life getting in the way or to wait for bug fixes and such.
---
I admittedly haven't played it for a while because I'm in a bit of a bind with gaming in general. I was a heavy console gamer for years but the past few years have been leaning more into pc gaming and leaving my consoles behind. 
---
The problem I have now is that my current pc is like 7 years old and pretty much EOL when it comes to running most games and I currently can't afford to upgrade at all. 
---
I'd love to get back into FO76 but just can't justify the cost of getting it again when I know my pc probably couldn't run it.
---
You must have missed out on the griefer era when no camp was safe from plummeting from random enemies and players. Those were good times.
---
-looks up from stove as i'm cooking-, -raises hand- yo this guy right here
---
What the others said.
---
Kill things, sell the things that the things have in their inventories to vendors.
---
Some people like to kill the things in Wes-Tek, others in Harper's Ferry, others in Whitesprings, there are even those who like to do it in Fort Defiance for Straight Jackets and giggles.
---
At lower levels The Ash Heap is fairly generous. Welch (and surroundings) has OK density and a vendor. Camden Park has a handful of scorched, a lootable raider camp and a vendor on your way to the Ash Heap.
---
Kill, loot, sell, repeat. They did nerf some sources but they also pooled the caps of all the vendor factions so in this case hey, they took away with one hand but they did give away with the other. This is a rarity. Make the most of it.
---
you're right okay can we please not start a stupid arguement? the choices are no DR in a hazmat or some DR with hazmat with ironclad perk and PA. you happy?
---
And some are player icons
---
No I remember those times lol. It's why I stopped playing after playing a few months after the beta. Then I return because looked like the game improved in which it did
---
What the hell? I was just correcting you, relax.
---
Exactly so you have nothing to backup your argument with okay good try üëçüèª
---
almost as much as he hates gay people?
---
I absolutely love the bloody explosive with vats. It's so good I feel like I'm cheating so I rarely ever use it. It takes away all the fun honestly.
---
They could do it by just restricting certain lines and NPCs from people that haven‚Äôt completed it. Or add those NPCs to the SBQ battle to help solo players along. I‚Äôm sure it could be done without creating two entirely separate set of servers though.
---
This irked me also. I'll be delighted if a new patch introduces new weather though. Toxic soot blizzard anyone?
---
I love bloodied explosive damage wise but it gets annoying having so little health lol.
---
Well yeah he mostly covers anti consumer practises and general BS by the AAA market. There's a ton to be outraged about and MORE people should be actually. Jim does make positive videos every so often though and he says lots he hates how negative he is but again, there is SO MUCH negative shit to cover sadly.
---
I've wanted to smoke the cigs that you find on the ground since 3

---
So a talking statue lol still sound cool guessing they will do the old meet you there thing and give cool quest.
---
Not with the right perks and armor. I don't even go full low health. Maybe around 50%. Still one shots everything. Even Colonel Gutsy that asshole.
---
So far my 5 wins have been pretty fair. It happened once when I was duo'd up with a friend but it's usually pretty stable.
---
Out of my 30-40 games of NW only 2 have disconnected. I have an original ps4 for reference.
---
Yea it‚Äôs just hard to get the right legendary armor.  Between scammers and people wanting super high prices I can‚Äôt seem to win lol
---
You're welcome! Thanks for taking the time to leave a nice comment!
---
arguement? you're just offended by my comment because you felt it applied to you personally lol, this whole conversation is just you trying to cater your ego. good try
---
Appalachia Missed Connections
---
Awesome thanks for the help üëçüèª
---
rip those levels and time once prestige comes out if you end up prestiging.
---
I've got 600hrs in the game and I never built a base worth looking at. Just a simple place with the necessities. I'm never there anyway. Too busy looting for legendaries. But if that's your thing, enjoy it. Things have changed since I started and now griefers can't destroy your hard work. I just don't have the time to spend hours on building something just to look at it.
---
West of Watoga TS, along the lower track, NAR Repair Yard. I've come across a megasloth there a few times.
---
Sign me up and take my Atoms.
---
I'd love to have a 'standard' camp I mainly use and then a 'farming' camp I place as needed.
---
I'm pretty sure those bugs were fixed. It's a long time since I last lost mine. Building is optional. If you want a house, build a house, if you want a Fort, build a fort, if you just want some crops and workbenches, just build crops and workbenches. Simple is good for a camp that moves a lot. Fancy doesn't really do much but impress other players.
---
i will if i can get more then one turn in for my extra lvls
---
I rarely get those
---
I enjoy having a camp. A comfortable place with all your crafting tables, musical instruments, bed, water purifiers, and food growing. It can sometimes feel really nice to "go home." I haven't lost my camp since the early days of the game. 
---
I've moved a few times, but usually only when I'm starting to spend a lot of time in a particular area. If you are going to be a Vendor then it is best to choose a place in a high traffic area or an area where people might want to fast travel to.
---
Character icons or camp stash boxes
---
Sorry but people don't always need to be corrected over some minor detail nobody cares about. it's just being rude and nobody is any better for it, I didn't used the word decent instead of best big deal? my point was it's the better alternative to surviving in the nuke zone vs hazmat with no DR. Doesn't really matter if I say 'decent' or 'best' PA is still better then hazmat in the nuke zone. So you're just being a hyper critical ass, you see?
---
You made a frankly baseless and silly claim. I asked you to back it up with even just one example. You have not been able to provide that. As such I have to conclude that you're another illogical smoke blowing fanboy üëçüèª
---
Well that would make sense.. üôÉ It‚Äôs not even nuclear winter servers that are bad..in fact they are running pretty damn smooth compared to adventure mode from what I‚Äôve experienced. I‚Äôve only disconnected one time so far in NW and I‚Äôm overseer rank 18. üíÄ
---
Well it‚Äôs possible but on older firmware and on older firmware you can‚Äôt play online.
---
I've got over 600hrs in the game and I've never been scammed. Not saying it doesn't happen but if you follow the threads on Reddit a majority of sellers/traders are honest people. Everything I have was bought or traded, literally everything since my luck with drops is zero. Good equipment is gonna cost you. That's just supply and demand.
---
Soooo, what if I am? but if I was, why would I say my 2nd comment? Dilemma. Guess now it's on you to provide evidence huh? lol
---
well i have almost 1400 hours now... i never threw anything 2\* or better  away
---
Hmmm, I wonder if NW has a higher bar for internet connection and it is on my end. This has happened to me the last few nights. Thank you for the response!
---
I only stopped playing because the poor optimization at launch made it nearly unplayable for me. Seems to be much better so here I am. Does a couple of months break void me from getting my pat on the back?
---
I wonder if they‚Äôd consider making enemy players invisible via photo mode as a fix, rather than removing it.
---
Yea I know it just can be difficult to make the money to buy the stuff. Buying stuff for over max caps also confuses me, I don‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs done at all
---
no, you just get extra xp if you win - it's not really worth it
---
When you‚Äôre ready, you won‚Äôt have to.
---
That's pretty lame using a photomde exploit though
---
I hope that they've been finding the Halloween candy, intestines and Free Watoga! notes that I've been leaving in the bodies at Vault 76.
---
They're used to buy stuff out of the vending machines at the pioneer scouts camp :)
---
No. Eventually the large amount of exp you get for winning is not enough to rank up. The experience needed for the next rank keeps increasing.
---
Hey this sounds EXACTLY what happened to me when I was level 5, maybe you're the guy who helped me.
---
Literally started the game, grabbed a pistol, instantly mowed down by three guys with .50 cal machine guns and full armor. I looted two boxes... how....
---
Won the game tonight with a 4v4, our team was on the edge of the circle and I launched a nuke that barely spared our sliver of the circle but screwed everyone else
---
The game mode is relatively new, so it'll probably get better after a patch or two.
---
Im sure it's a lot on the servers with the new mode and the free weekend brining the most players they've had since launch.
---
True, I built a run down bar on the southern border of the map and I can‚Äôt complain.
---
The thing is you can tighten the field of view and essentially get a 10x zoom looking around from 10 ft over your head. It stays locked to near you, but there‚Äôs definitely an advantage to be gained by checking around the map like that. It‚Äôs like having periscope binoculars.
---
If you get enough tadpole badges you get a backpack for carry weight, possum badges upgrades it, scrip you trade it to the legendary vendor for a random roll
---
You cannot have Assassin's and Mutant's in the same weapon. So no, you cannot have all those three in the same weapon.
---
However you can have either of those two along with Hitman's (+10% damage while aiming).
---
Regardless OP is correct and Assasin's on weapons is weak. Personally I think it should be on par with the other 'race specific' (Ghoul Slayers's, Hunter's etc) prefixes and give 30%.
---
Full disclosure, I don't PvP. I just don't see the logic of including a PvP specific prefix on weapons then castrating it to the point of non-viability.
---
Either way if you are going to write something with that degree of conviction make sure that is correct at least.
---
It's like the flare gun.. Both items are essentially thought too be users but have other "uses" if you scrap them enough
---
Wait for a level 50 something to show up and give you a clown suit, a bunch of stims, some radaway, weapons that are too high level for you, then asks you to team up and fast travel to toxic valley to get a key out of a box in a high rad pool where you also pick up a mutation before fast travel to get the alien blaster that you can't use until level 30. Just a suggestion.
---
Thanks
---
What are you wanting to get from the game?
---
One thing about 76 is it's open to interpretation. This fact initially turned many off, as they were used to a more structured gameplay environment. 
---
Do you want to be immersed in the atmosphere? RPing as a survivor? Then I suggest spending the first 10 levels or so just doing small circles around your camp discovering locations and looting *literally* everything you can. Don't worry if it's needed because at this point, you need everything. 
---
You'll quickly level up from the random scorched and you'll end up with a surplus of scrap. Once you have adequate 'junk' you can start narrowing your scrounging to specific things like ceramic (needed to power up your camp), aluminum, screws. 
---
You'll know what you need and what you can not bother with by then. With this knowledge you can start doing the quests without having to stop and go stash every 30 minutes.
---
It feels kind of empty in a way to me, missing a certain element I can‚Äôt quite explain...
---
Hand raised! Love that game to the bits!
---
I have been campaigning for this for weeks only to be pretty much ignored by this sub. I hope that by some random longshot your post gains more traction than mine.
---
Remember the 900 hours guy? I'm almost up to 1800 now. I've been here since day 1 of beta. I've experienced every up and down the game had to offer. I got temporarily suspended forever in late February. I bought a fresh account at the start of March. I play 8 hours a day cause I have nothing else to do. I've genuinely enjoyed this game from the start. It's all I really want to do with my spare time and I have a lot of that.
---
I get frustrated when I see people not giving the game a chance or outright lying about it. Youtubers and Bethesda themselves hardly gave this game a chance. Jim Sterling literally made a video this week reminding us that Fallout 76 wasn't very good at launch. He discussed basically nothing new, didn't touch Nuclear Winter and just ranted about how bad it was. You can skim through so many of these kinds of garbage videos that keep harming the game. It literally reads as "I've got nothing new to talk about this week so why don't I shit on something people like to hate for views".
---
The game is now probably at what I'd call "release quality". The game play loop is fun. There's a ton of different stuff to do now with fairly good rewards. But so many bugs still exist that have been reported and known about for months. Some bugs even get reintroduced with new patches.
---
I can only imagine how good this game would have been and how popular it could have been if it wasn't released in such a disgusting state. The launch and couple months after are still killing the games chances to be widely successful. Hopefully they've learned from it. Because fuck man, this game could be one of the greatest.
---
Noooo it isn't.  It might have 30 different possible spawn points, but it's never supposed to have 30 at any given time.
---
To me happened something similar, I was on my way to take the Overseer's Journal in her hometown, when I see this huge beast battling a bunch of Super Mutants. I just posed long enough to take an heroic-ish screenshot and then run like hell because the thing had killed all the Uglies in ten seconds flat and was coming after me next.
---
Could you also pass on the idea of a menu option to hide+show unwanted perk cards, ex. rank 1 gunsmith when you have rank 5.
---
Also perhaps allow creation of perk builds, and respec while out of combat for x amount of time - it could be a decent cap dump.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox but thank you! You‚Äôre a good egg!
---
oh so you found a video it appears  üëçüèª
---
Just follow the Reddit threads on marketplace and the bazzar. You'll know what the rates for weapons and armor are at the time and they fluctuate drastically depending on what's hot at the moment. For example, early on I got a bloody handmade and a bloody Explosive lever for 6k package deal. Obviously the items were highly duped but whatever. About a month or so ago, that BE lever was selling for 60k caps. Rediculous. Now you could probably get one for 15k. Just depends on how good the dupers are in my opinion. I'll play their market and buy before the dupe method gets patched. It is getting harder now though I feel but they will always find a way. Caps are too easy to get now especially with the player vendor. I'm always maxed out and have nothing left to buy.
---
If you really want to watch them scramble, sneak along behind them and blow up the cars with a silenced weapons.
---
I haven‚Äôt been on in a couple days! I‚Äôm on Xbox One üòäüòä
---
I had a lovely dude team up with me (level 20-something. He saved me from a giant monster thing haha) but it was hard cause he had a mic and I don‚Äôt yet. I have to get one!!
---
The scrip allows you to get a random legendary weapon from a special vendor.
---
Never left and I have always really enjoyed the game from release. That said it has been a rather rocky road.
---
A video of what?
---
Send me a friend request, it's my reddit username
---
Wow great contribution didn‚Äôt even explain why you wouldn‚Äôt want it...
---
This garbage. This makes me so fucking angry that all of these accounts are still temporarily suspended forever. 
---
Duping methods are surely gone by now. Why are we still suspended? They even added in ways to prevent people trading shit loads of stuff if you did dupe. Makes no sense at all.
---
Oh ok. I was just reading a few posts saying that people got 30+ from looting the whole place once.
---
I never quit from lack of enjoyment. Just had other games in my backlog I decided to start playing. I'll get back to fo76 eventually. Currently caught up playing Elite Dangerous. Got a HOTAS setup and really enjoy it.
---
Im having a similar issue with my mini gun it does the firing animation and the barrels rotate but it doesn't actually shoot. Again not blaming the new players but since that day its been very buggy lol i get random crashes which i didn't before.
---
I get really excited while playing this game. &lt;\_&lt;
---
Ok thanks for the help üòÅ
---
Here since beta,
---
Been around since beta, I love wandering my own way and not caring about anyone. I rarely bump into other players, which makes me both sad and happy, because I both am missing out on some potential positive interactions, and am finding a ton of good loot that nobody has gotten to on my server
---
I was just letting you know... Why do you get so offended by that? You want me to just let you believe something that isn't true. In no way was I being critical of you.
---
What the hell is your problem? Seriously. How insecure do you have to be to take a simple correction as a personal attack? I didn't insult you whatsoever; I was letting you know something for the sake of your own knowledge.
---
Plan added via arkos pharma event ‚Äúproject paradise‚Äù, or check player vendors for one people have crafted...
---
...think that‚Äôs right, others will correct me if I‚Äôm wrong... üëçüèª
---
Yeah the daily complete match doesn't register as well
---
lol raise your hand if you have *undescerning taste*
---
Huh wtf do I have to provide evidence of?? What have I claimed??
---
Man, I'd *highly* doubt they're telling the truth.  I've ran through that place multiple times and never found more than maybe 5-10, and 10 is being generous.   There are a few at the Eastern Regional Penitentiary as well as a metric buttload of prisoner collars.
---
I love that with my atom skin on my lever I can't accidentally sell it, need one for the handmade
---
You passively aggressively told me something I already knew, thanks I am enlightened now
---
Best way to make money is mutation serums or Legendary items for cheap prices. The cheaper the prices the faster you will make caps. Stimpacks and dog food move really fast as well if priced Right.
---
Oh yeah I've had that happen to my gatling laser as well, scourage of the heavies
---
PvP. Meh. I'll stick with Adventure Mode.  
---
I do hope everyone has fun though, that is the point isn't it?
---
It has.
---
The plan is a 'rare'(\*) drop from the Arktos Pharma event.
---
(\*) 'Rare' as in a 'attainable but not guaranteed'.
---
That's true, and it's my mistake. I didn't mean to make it sound so convicted I just didn't know not every legendary stacks as I've gotten a mixmatch of most.
---
Either way it's mostly just a min-max thing. Any legendary effect is effectively useless compared to a two shot explosive so the same degree of "Why bother" can be used for virtually any legendary upgrade that isn't that unless you use it for a specific purpose. Like the assassin's pre-fix.
---
Yes it's most probably the weakest, but still it gives a leg up on PVP. Even if it's 10 percent. It might not be strong against mobs but it's the same for a ghoulslayer or mutants weapon. They won't be as effective against non-mutants or ghouls the same way an assassin prefix won't be as effective on non players.
---
If PVP isn't your thing you shouldn't use it. And if you have a TSE you shouldn't use it. Either way not every legendary can be as useful as others but it doesn't negate their use either. 
---
It's basically common knowledge that if you don't have a TSE youre underpowered, regardless of whatever other legendaries you have.
---
The legendary weapons either need to be restructured completely or people just have to accept that some variations are just clearly better for certain situations and they probably won't have much of a use outside of what they were made to do.
---
How was it passive-aggressive?
---
Based on you referring to it as decent, I find it highly unlikely that you already knew, but okay. If that were the case, all you had to do was tell me and move on. You made this a big deal for no reason.
---
" Why? Because they dare to have a different view than them? So I'm not intelligent because I don't wildly love the game? " funny how it comes full circle  üëçüèª
---
Yeah they all share the same stash.  Before they all had 200 caps per area this is a bit better.  In my opinion.
---
How much do the collars sell for?
---
I cant find any straight jackets at Eastern Regional Penitentiary.
---
highly unlikely I knew something I just stated in the same comment?
---
You Quit when you die, don't wait around. Problem solved.
---
&gt; **or make it a "stash box" that you can purchase in the Atom shop** 
---
I think even Bethesda knows that is a terrible idea.
---
Also what about favoriting or selecting items? For example I'm looking for some specific items, so I tag them (similar to tagging junk in your pip-boy) and any camps that are selling those items will glow or something.
---
I only took a few month-long breaks so I wouldn't burn out. But other than that I've enjoyed it. In all honesty when my friends quite I did take a break because they were and I came back and enjoyed it more. Mostly cause they wanted to pvp and I wanted to be nice to people and (after I moved my base) give water and other beverages to people. So in conclusion, do you need water and see a man running around looking very Slavic well maybe they will give water if asked.
---
If it was tied to a reasonably small playing space, this would be really great fun.
---
No, it wasn't stated in your original comment. Your original comment made it seem like you didn't already know.
---
How was I passive-aggressive?
---
Ohhh okay I see now, I took a hiatus from 76 and still am catching up with changes. It is better this way yeah, was annoying travelling from vendor to vendor. Gotta think of more get rich quick schemes for myself now
---
Yep i usually just fire again after it jams and it usually fixes it. Still annoying.  What platform you on? Yknow we heavies need to stick together. We need to let others heart the thunder of our guns. Let the storm of bullets begging.  Lol
---
Seems like the projectile exploded early- can't tell which hatched first.
---
Thatd be awesome tbh
---
The amount of times I've died within the first minute lol
---
Yeah because fuck all those people who play with friends and don't want to spectate all round.
---
Just keeps track of your badges and scrip
---
Then you accept you're waiting for your friend who's still alive.
---
Again, problem solved. You're moaning that you're forced to wait, i told you to leave. And now you're moaning because YOU chose to play with a friend, and die?
---
Enjoy waiting, get over it.
---
"I think it should have some minor buffs but it seems like the real application is being able to survive in a nuke zone with decent DR vs the hazmat "
---
Read this comment, it means PA is better then the hazmat in nuke zones. regardless of the word decent or best, it's meaning is the same.
---
I'm on PS4, don't know if the glitches are solo to that platform or not. Those simple non heavies just don't understand our overwhelming firepower
---
There are also vending machines for the badges at Camp Adams in the west where the campfire tales event occurs. 
---
You can earn infinite possum badges but only 10 tadpole badges (one for each challenge). And there are exactly ten badges worth of items in the tadpole machine. Spend wisely üëç
---
&gt; Am I missing some kind of balance, engine or server issue?
---
From what I've heard it's to avoid clipping issues.
---
Welcome back to the wasteland hope you enjoy it. Little tip stay away from pvp its chaotic lol or till you get comfortable with everything.  :)
---
So aptly put!
---
Well someone's got a shitty attitude.
---
Okay again, I don't really care either way if this is implemented but you're basically just being a dick and saying suck it up instead of pointing out anything actual worthy of being a reason not to add it into the game. Like the fact it wouldn't make sense just lore wise for vault dwellers to sprout from the ground.
---
Have an actual conversation with people with actual points instead of being a dick and telling people to suck it up because the game doesn't already have a feature.
---
I ran into him (Shroud) earlier today. Agent\_Gray, Haggle and Logan were with me + 1 other and I almost killed him but he got me instead.
---
It doesn't mean the same.
---
"Decent" makes it pretty clear that it's around average. Nothing that is the best at something is described as "decent". Therefore, you thought that PA wasn't the best DR.
---
So, I corrected you. I didn't insult you, I wasn't passive-aggressive. You caused this by getting butthurt over nothing.
---
Thank you too! :)
---
For starters, forget that sale, $17 on Amazon and Walmart all platforms.
---
I'm on PC and game around this time, feel free to add me, Same as Reddit name
---
Most BRs shouldn't even be competitive. Fortnite competitive is a joke for example because Epic keeps in throwing things to keep the 12 year olds playing at the expense of competitive, and the only reason its competitive scene keeps going is because of the absurd Tencent money Epic has thrown at it.  PUBG and H1Z1 were like the only two trying to be semi-serious but H1Z1 is pretty much sinking into its grave and PUBG only has a few people keeping its views up on Twitch.  
---
The only reason BRs can work competitively is because of the potential for anyone to potentially make a deep run, akin to professional poker.   Yeah you'll likely have a lot of the Shrouds and Tfues or whatever up there but then you'll also have random Joe Schmoe possibly get a chance to take home huge money.   
---
Nuclear Winter is pretty much just a fun/whacky, albeit not fully fleshed out BR right now.  And hopefully it can stay in that spirit.  'cause part of the fun of Fallout _is_ that chaotic random nature of it that breaks up the serious/grim atmosphere.  Only reason competitive would likely be considered is if it's able to give extra promotional advertising to the game.
---
This is NO different to ANY Multiplayer title. If you die. You spectate. This is battle royal, not fucking team deathmatch, i'd have thought that much was obvious, going into a 1 life mode and complaining about that 1 life is like going to the swimming baths and complaining at getting wet. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Heh, amusing actually. But power armor is trash in NW, it makes you a much easier target, enemies can hear you from 40 meters away, and you still die instantly in one to any automatic weapon in close quarters. I always ignore them.
---
Not really, just game mode rules.
---
Somebody has shitty thumbs.
---
I played the majority of the game alone because it was hard to get my friends to play with the hate train and all. It's definitely fine to play alone, but I recommend joining a discord to help with trading. I used to be in a really good one, but left because I felt guilty for not playing for months. If I find it I'll link you.
---
It‚Äôs the only game I‚Äôve played since I got back into college! I‚Äôve been playing since Day 1, have participated in every event, every discussion, even was around when the only thing to do was the questline! This game has come a tremendously long way, I‚Äôm so happy to see it where it should‚Äôve been at launch.
---
It's pretty fun, and even when you get bored when you come back there's usually more content to play so it never feels old.
---
Besides that, the interactions you have with random people on this game are some of the best parts. I'm sure you could find a group relatively easy. And if not, as a fellow solo player, the game is pretty fun regardless. Just feels like another fallout.
---
I doubt that they would remove them outright, likely just less of them would spawn since a 1 year time skip (pretty sure the trailer said one year but not entirely sure) isnt that long, although I would like Scorchbeasts gone. Probably most players find them annoying and not worth killing, including me. Their spawns also really screw up some otherwise good camp locations.
---
Doesn't need explaining. This is Battle Royale. Not team deathmatch.
---
You can solo the whole game, you don't need friends but I'm sure you'll find someone to play with if needed
---
Why would I want to carry more than one of every heavy weapon in the game for a grand total of 7 pounds? You got it down to 3-4 pounds? Grats now you can carry a few extra purified waters. \*Golfclap\*
---
If you do the event to power up the plant first yoh dont need to worry about power for anything you build! Boxes on the walls will be more then enough.
---
You can tell if the plant is on by the steam coming out of the towers... So you may get lucky to an already running plant
---
Im on xbox it happens here too. Them non believers pff. Lol what's your best weapon rn.
---
Not very long at all
---
Riiiight, I already explained this. good luck!
---
thank you for your information, but i cant find any fallout 76 PC deal on amazon :(
---
Okay that argument might be valid if literally the two biggest BR games and benchmarks of the genre haven't had the respawn system in it.
---
Saying there's no difference when literally the TWO BIGGEST titles of the genre have it is real fuckin asinine isn't it?
---
Again. Lore wise it doesn't make sense to come back from the dead. But you're using some real fucking shit examples and reasoning to explain why you think it's a bad idea.
---
You're literally saying it's not on other games when it is a main mechanic in two of the biggest on the market???
---
No thanks, if i wanted to respawn on Battle Royale (just lol) i'd go and play Apex or Fortnite. 
---
Are we playing Team Deathmatch here? Respawning lmfao. Wow.
---
You didn't. You're just refusing to continue this conversation because you feel dumb. All you had to do was apologize for the overreaction and you wouldn't come off as a moron. But okay.
---
In place of a blunderbuss, which is pretty bad, I would recommend multiple (easier to find) black powder pistols. Favorite them all for very quick damage when needed (if you can remember to have them all loaded lol)
---
So some random guy streamed a video of him killing you. Ok.
---
u/valseek u/LoneVaultWanderer
---
The way Rust does building would fit incredibly well in this game. They kinda work by the same principles, but in Rust it actually "just works" when you want it to.
---
this video show team with hackers....
---
Ill tag along :) ill be your bodyguard. Unfortunately i just got off. And wont be on till later :(  GT: Saint Raging G if interested for future adventures.  I'll show you everything i know.  :3
---
Dude. The pie has a spawn on the roof of West tek
---
Okey, how did u do this format? üòÖ
---
I only grab it if I plan on taking some massive falls. I really enjoy climbing structures so it saves me from that. I'd love to get goat legs from a pack already.
---
Vets? It's not even a week old.
---
Added, thanks!
---
This comment was unnecessary, and only served to create drama out of thin air. 
---
You called it decent. It‚Äôs actually great. End of story. No drama needed. 
---
It‚Äôs easy to assume the worst when you‚Äôre on the internet. But we‚Äôre all here in this subreddit for the same reason. If you think someone is being rude, ignore them. There‚Äôs plenty of people who are enthusiastic about the game to talk to instead.
---
You care that much that I said PA was decent instead of best? You're the real moron lol, and now look you just want to argue like I predicted in my 2nd comment. Go find some one else to pester and 'correct'
---
Well you cant exactly control peoples actions. And people like to be contrarian and just do what they want.
---
Im sure you'll find a good team. I mean you're being matched with a random person out of thousands. It just takes time. You'll get that perfect Seal Team 6 soon.
---
I play with a few friends, so we thought one of us can build nice and big in one place, then have another member make a simple camp for us all to use as we move around.
---
Thanks heaps!
---
There's 2 in Forr Defiance, on both the 3rd and 4th floors. Do you have them both?
---
Is it on H1Z1? No. Was it on the culling? No. Was it on Fortnite before Apex? No.
---
Just because other games have it doesn't mean this should, this is Fallout. Not Fortnite, Not Apex. Should we have a Team Deathmatch too? Fuck it why not go all out and say Capture the flag!
---
Seriously in 2 minds to even reply to that comment tbh. So stupid it's unreal.
---
Respawning defeats the point of the game mode.
---
When the game came out every good camp location I found had a bloody scorch beast that flew over periodically and destroyed everything.
---
Thank you man, with the new battle royale mode, im really excited in this game, i may give it a try.
---
No I only have the one by the elevator on the 4th, Ive been looking everywhere here so I‚Äôll go back to the 3rd thank you!
---
I would love a Pancor Jackhammer skin for the combat shotgun.
---
I like it that we get only one life.
---
I think take my upvote! Definitely agree with this. Id also like to see an increase in xp gained per kills. Its just sad.
---
I... really don't know where to start.
---
This is why spreading misinformation with conviction is so pernicious. Misconceptions become beliefs, beliefs become starched and suddenly people stampede and trample over the facts on their way to la-la land.
---
TS is last year's news. TS is kind of viable depending on the weapon and useage but by reducing the multiplier from 2x to 1.25x whilst leaving the ludicrous accuracy penalty untouched they introduced a severe caveat.
---
E is still good but again not the absolute best. Again depending on the weapon, build and scenario 'Lucky', 'Rapid' or 'VATS Enhanced' can be just as good if not better.
---
So TSE is not even remotely the 'be-all, end-all'. IMO the way the devs chose to end the 'TSE reign' was the not most elegant but you cannot accuse them of not being effective. They most definitely made room for other prefixes to shine. Still unclear whether this was an unforeseen side effect though...
---
Moreover is besides the point. The point is that every other 'Race Specific' legendary prefix gives and 1.3x damage multiplier except Assasin's which gives 1.1x and this makes little sense to me.
---
Exactly? who cares if I say decent or best? my point is that PA is better then hazmat? this energy vampire of a person wants to argue and try and tell me I'm wrong because I used the wrong word, who cares, dude is obsessive AF
---
So? Many battle royales have the revive system. You just saying no. Makes u seem like a dick
---
*Place Everywhere...*
---
Thank you man &gt;:)
---
okay, thank you man, i have met lot of player in map too, but couldnt text chat with them :((
---
I really *don't* care. You're a stranger and it won't affect me. But I have nothing better to do at this time of the night, so yeah I'm going to continue this conversation.
---
If you take this as pestering, then that just shows how insecure and in denial you are. At what point was I wrong?
---
Decent implies not the best. I never insulted you. What exactly did I do wrong?
---
Oh, right. I corrected you, which obviously provoked an insecurity you have, and you found it reasonable to get butthurt and insult me.
---
Lol yeah
---
&gt; I think NW is pretty balanced to be honest. 
---
Eh it could probably use some tweaking still.  Stealth boys are pretty darn powerful for example because the shimmer isn't very easy to spot.
---
No worries. It's straight in front of the elevator. Also, just be aware that when you get it the challenge will complete but the quest will not. It looks like a bug but the common theory is that quest will continue in other dlc.
---
I have the same issue with furious not escalating damage. Ive raised a ticket with Bethesda unsure if theyll do something with it
---
THANK YOU SO MUCH! I just noticed he was broken today ;-;
---
Okay.
---
Battle Royale's.
---
H1Z1 (no respawn)
---
PUBG (No respawn)
---
Culling (no respawn)
---
Fortnite (pre-Apex no respawn)
---
Realm royale (no respawn)
---
Apex (respawn)
---
Battlefield 5 (no respawn)
---
Black Ops 4 (no respawn)
---
You can't counter facts so you counter with an insult? Ok.
---
"Makes u" seem stupid. But that's not my problem ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Vats for animals, also AP for holding breath when sniping
---
I saw a level 13 with a 5 cap bounty on the map. Went to him, stalked him for a bit, then I finally did it, *psccht (*is that how crossbows sound?) and he dropped dead. Dude did the "angry" and "no" emotes, and admittedly I did shoot him after a few minutes of hesitation. Can't justify what I did right there, and I took some junk out of my own stash and dropped it in the dude's camp. He fast traveled away from the camp, and I have no idea whether he took them or not.
---
Probably that Resolute Veteran gatling gun, yours?
---
So no pack mules. That is upsetting.
---
check player vending machines i bought 3 stimpacks to complete this challenge
---
Sirens cover up the noise of walking?
---
A twitch streamer? I wouldn't really care.
---
I got mine yesterday, happy to say that it is exactly what they originally advertised :)
---
Goes both ways. Sometimes a team of 3 will avoid where I choose to spawn (before they've chosen), get wiped and bitch at me for not joining them and dying.
---
And yet I'm the bad guy, even when I make my intentions known in advance.
---
Maybe? But the circles were so small that I don't know if it would really do anything at that point.
---
Noob üòÇ
---
The red tick only shows up for a couple of seconds after you shoot your gun. If you are trying to flank then you shouldn't be shotting until you are already behind them.
---
....huh?? You want me to provide a video to back up my claim that you said what you said in your first comment that I responded to...? 
---
Are you okay??
---
Yes, they become wanted relatively frequently. Picking the lock on someone else's supply drop does that for example. Conveniently, there are a few spots near Flatwoods for such supply drops, plus they visit the overseer's caches anyway so why not leave some goodies and a few bobby pins there too ;)
---
And I like not having to wait on my team to win or die because someone managed to grab a gun before me. If it was solo or matches didn't take so long, sure, one life is great. But it's annoying to get downed and immediately finished before my team has a chance to react, and I know it's just as annoying when it happens to my teammates. Apex handles it perfectly and it'd very likely be a great addition to this game.
---
And you're the type of guy going around telling people they're dicks because YOU want to respawn in Nuclear Winter because you suck at the game üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
True but that doesn‚Äôt need a whole AP bar to vats one animal I mean yes with the breath holding because that makes sense but they should limit that themselves to holding your breath for 4 seconds or something....it should pop up momentarily when VATS is available
---
Even then, I think it‚Äôs a pretty dumb mechanic. It ruins the element of surprise.
---
They are dwellers from another vaults like 63 or 94.
---
If you do the Guided Meditation event loads of super mutants spawn. When the event is over just loot the whole lot and crawl up to Sunnytops Station.
---
Im only level 26 but i try to help out. My vendors are way underpriced so if any new guys ever see howling1984 down by camden park come check out my stuff
---
If I'm there and i have spare stuff just give me a wave and i will help out.
---
+karma
---
I can sell you a dozen or so if you want some tomorrow. I'm on Xbox
---
Mine has to be my bloodied explosive MG42 beautiful weapon but ammo is expensive. :( but I've been grinding for heavies since the stress test and i got a few in my collection.  But that's my favorite
---
On my first day in Appalachia was looting around at Vault tec research till i caught in a hidden corner two Teddys doing 69 lol
---
Other good ones were the "hatmaker" scene in the forest and the Teddy-Doc, stiching the "butthurt" Patient-Teddy
---
I suspect they calculate damage again and separately from where they apply damage to mobs, hence the inconsistency.
---
That would be op... say all my team died.. circle is moving in and I hide in a bush. Not wanting to waste time or find me the other team leaves the area and I pop out and pick up my entire team and we roll up on them from the back and kill them all. It‚Äôs a bit of a ridiculous request to be honest.
---
Haven‚Äôt found any of those yet so I‚Äôm going to get searching.
---
I haven't had too many, but I have avoided building in the cranberry bog altogether because of them and every fissure site on the map I avoid entirely. The main place I want them to stop spawning is the lead and acid cave. I want a cave camp and that cave is the only one on the south side of the map (all other caves have terrible locations in regards to vendors), and conveniently comes with resources to help craft bullets. Only problem is constant Scorchbeasts.
---
Their texas studio is actually in austin. *awkwardly leaves room*
---
Been here since the B.E.T.A.
---
Teddy bears doing all sorts of things in FO76, smoking while playing drums, involved in adult situations, found in command of some sketchy looking gnomes, oh, and the gnomes are up to no good either.
---
Temporarily is such a lovely, highly flexible term...
---
Nah we're fine pal just don't die like a scrub. Battle Royale is supposed to be 1 life, referencing 2 free games just doesn't justify your point in anyway shape or form.
---
Go back to those games if that's what you want. I don't want people respawning once i've killed them, it's stupid and makes the entire point of killing them pointless.
---
If you don't want to spectate don't play as part of a team. Do you go for a swim and complain when you get wet? Serious question.
---
You know, for all this. You're not even THINKING about the Solo player. At all.
---
And yet almost everyone on here is a lynch mob if you even mention dupes and wanting to play again, I put over a 100 bucks into the game now I don‚Äôt want to give bugthesda anything especially not money
---
&gt; ... and get shot in the process as it takes three or four keystrokes to get OUT of Photo mode.
---
What? Press escape. 
---
I only do that while crouching in a bush. I'm not complaining.
---
I know how you feel lol, I personally like going to McClintock
---
No reply? Fucking "dick"
---
The story of Nuclear Winter is "There can only be one Overseer". Zax even says things like "I advise against making friends". So I doubt they will add in any sort of respawn feature.
---
Something something can't link amazon links, amazon. com/Fallout-76-PC/dp/B07DDD9VK7
---
**Prediction upcoming post**
---
Got Fallout, found sooo much friends and having a blast (2020)
---
Er, I‚Äôm talking about you. Your comment was unnecessary. Theirs was entirely valid. Because you were technically wrong. It‚Äôs not decent. It‚Äôs great. That is a significantly different assessment, regardless of what your actual point is.
---
It‚Äôs not an insult to correct you, even if it‚Äôs tangential. At worst, it‚Äôs something you simply ignore. And that applies to this comment as well. If this upsets you in any way, simply put it out of your mind. You can even feel free to downvote me, not that I could stop you. However, starting an argument where there isn‚Äôt one would be a waste of both of our time. 
---
So with that, I bid you adieu.
---
Wait is the elevator on the third floor as well?
---
Mark my words!
---
At my work place being fired is referred to as indefinite suspension.
---
The only reason im.not currently playing it is because im away from home for another 2 weeks, other than the odd weekend here and there, yeah played it nearly everyday since BETA
---
Still here and started with the b√®ta.
---
Really enjoying the game and only getting better.
---
not liking battle royale games at all, but have to say that I really enjoy to play nuclear winter.
---
Use a stealth boy
---
I have a feeling the lovely raiders coming in the wastelanders patch aren't going to be super rad resistant.
---
Hopefully.
---
How would it be op? They'd spawn in essentially naked and it's put a big ass mark on the map. Everyone would immediately know someone was getting revived and where. Pods or beacons would be very limited and the chances of one being in the last few zones would be small. And again, it would show your location and your team would be unarmed.
---
So my strategy of getting a tesla gun/missile launcher and then building my metal tower without a door and sitting on top of it and wait in photomode for people to come and investigate then proceeding to ambush them is bad.. Huh i thought i was being smart using the tools made available to me. Just like that time where i survived most the game hiding in a portable toilet next to ten other toilets, worked like a charm until someone threw a frag mirv at me.
---
Looks like somebody needs more practice shitposting...
---
the meaning is the same, that PA is better then Hazmat, if you wanna be nit picky about it then go ahead but theres no difference between me using decent/best because there is no other alternative, theres only two choices Hazmat and PA which I said PA being the better. it's not rocket science you know
---
Not sure about 30 but there's a lot for sure. They're mostly in the ghoul side of the building so go right when you enter and check every room. There are a couple on the other side and in some of the rooms you need a jetpack/marsupial to enter too. Depends on how much time you want to spend searching.
---
400+ hours been here from beta, and still loving it.
---
I don't get what people are finding fun about this
---
Mine too. Zero accuracy. Mine is level 45 so I can‚Äôt use it yet. So do you have to be right in their face to hit anything with it?
---
And yet if your entire team is alive you all win.
---
How much firing are you doing that you actually had a weapon break?
---
And why didn't you have a back up weapon?
---
I didn't even know weapons CAN break and I have backups for my backups.
---
Yeah it has buttons for 3rd, 4th and ground.
---
So do you think furious damage is escalating?
---
I left, but only because my computer was a potato and I got burnt out by my main story breaking during Ounce of Prevention. Only decided to come back after getting a new graphics card and deciding "you know, I might be able to run 76 comfortably now", with the text chat mod just solidifying it more.
---
Oh oh I thought you meant before the elevators it‚Äôs locked for me right now
---
Because sometimes you get 6 kills with the only good weapon you have and all your other weapons are trash that will just get you killed in a gunfight.
---
They work well with stealth boy
---
thank you, by any reasons, this doesnt popup when i searched "Fallout 76" on amz
---
Wouldn't that breaking the law about promoting tobacco? If not in the US maybe the EU?
---
Oh right, yeah you have to do the BOS quest to get access else you can only get up to the 3rd.
---
Yes. That would be great.
---
Okay geez I‚Äôm dumb lol so I don‚Äôt have the 4th floor one I have the 3rd
---
Same problem with my AAE minigun and BE plasma gatling gun. Here I am ready to annihilate and no death pellets come out. Grrr! Seriously, sometimes it takes several times before it actually fires.
---
did you try wastlend whisperer on him?
---
Heh no worries, we're all just human :)
---
Yeah that's fair but also why does that have to be a thing to make you the best overseer?
---
What do you think ZAX would rather have? A kill hungry aggressive person overseeing his vault or someone who knows when to wait things out and make the shots that count. 
---
ZAX wants the best overseer, not the strongest or fastest. Sometimes the shots you don't shoot are the ones that count the most.
---
That being said I can realize just from a player standpoint how that's kinda fucky. Hopefully they change it but not too drastically. I want a balance so that the game doesn't also force me to go kill crazy just to get enough XP one round.
---
thank you man, but i realised that this is physical version. Is there any code enclosed? because im not in America, i can ship it to my cousin and he will capture the code picture then send it to me. Is it possible ?
---
It would be cool if you could leave a frag grenade or mine in a frame as a trap.
---
Important issue of the day.
---
4 characters ... 187, 183, 80 something and 50 something ...
---
Still some fun things to do. Honestly even my 180s aren't "done" yet with the cards I want
---
You play the regular game and level up. You pick where you want to upgrade your special points there and use that in NW. 
---
It's a good way to make people play boyh modes so. You also gain experience from NW in adventure mode so you'll probably already have a couple points to spend.
---
level up your adventure mode character. you‚Äôre getting more do for playing NW so you have a few levels. just choose the stat when you level up
---
Bro. Have you learned to the holotapes for lvl 1 though 30 in the vault? ZAX basically wants a freaking serial killer to be overseer.
---
Oh yeah, don't forget about the poor solo player who can't select solo lobbies. Yeah. Way to think about yourself.
---
P.S nice lack of reply. üëçüèª
---
lvl 106, "loving" is a strong word. UI is still garbo, server disconnects still daily, still no fov options (and i'm not interested in excuses), etc.
---
deliberately skipped forschnaight or whatever it was called, but when i want to build i now have this menu item informing me i don't have the plans for something that i can't get anymore. why not just take it out of the build menu or make those items cost atoms or something? time-limited content is stupid and i blame two decades of mediocre mmos for normalizing it
---
the battle royale is predictably unstable and anti-competitive, but for these reaons it's arguably the most balanced game bethesda has ever made
---
Lol, pretty sure you're describing an actual job role... This NW has been excellent, I've had no issues with it and mechanically it's well thought out. Pretty excellent imo.
---
But the unpaid beta testers comments aren't really obnoxious... There was no justification for releasing the game at full price in its state.
---
I really like the direction 76 is going but if everyone forgets the crap Bethesda pulled at the beginning they'd be likely to pull it again.
---
Haha true. I appreciate all the help, I‚Äôm really enjoying this game.
---

---
Back in the box BK, threads been put to bed.
---
The bugs infuriate me, especially when I look them up and see they're as old as the beta test. The absolute worst has been the work bench bug (XB1) where exiting out of a work bench will sometimes cause the menu too close but my character will be stuck in the crafting animation until I force quit the game. I really really want to like this game, but obviously Bethesda would rather slap on a BR mode than fix the bugs in the content that makes a survival game a survival game.
---
Yes, its just a disc case, with a paper disc containing a launcher code
---
Tagging /u/valseek and /u/jessbethesda in hopes they can help out.
---
The meaning is not the same. Words typically have very specific definitions. ‚ÄúDecent‚Äù implies that someone is only passable, when in reality power armor is literally as good as it gets, or if not then it‚Äôs close. Again, that is a significantly different assessment, regardless of your actual point. It‚Äôs entirely valid for someone to correct you on that in a post all about power armor, which is in an open forum for people to have discussions in. 
---
&gt; it's not rocket science you know
---
People spend years learning the nuances of language. Lifetimes. No, it‚Äôs not literally rocket science. But I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre using that phrase correctly here.
---
That is DEFINITELY a weird bug but if you dont mind me asking...
---
Why do you want to get rid of it. People would lop off their left nut for that.
---
It is broken
---
Dude... you are missing the obvious. You need to make the kills AND make it to the end. You don't have to die early just because you kill people.
---
Also: Hide and Seek... with tag!
---
I've just been taking the cores and armour off and dumping them somewhere else, takes some PA out of the match lol
---
How about you take your elitist attitude and go back to H1Z1 or PUBG. Or shove it up your ass, either one.
---
Think it's a bug in the latest update, hopefully fixed soon as gunfu is awesome in vats
---
War... was never changes
---
I agree!
---
I had no idea I thought it was busted üòÇ three tokens a day jeeeeeeez
---
Seeing the same topics posted over and over I tend to disagree
---
It's not worth the risk of engaging though of I only get 20 xp. There is no reason to fight people in the beginning they way it currently is.
---
Ahhh I thought it was busted! 3 tokens a dam day. üò≠
---
Watched about six guys have a big fire fight in front of me, when it was over the survivors moved on and one guy run up and hid in the same bush as me, he didn't know I was right next to him, I sat there waiting for him to notice me but he just ran off never knowing I was there.
---
I have been in quite a few final circles (not gud, just playing too much with a gud team) where the winning team or even solo was simply awesome. 
---
(except the tesla, nerf the tesla)
---
Zero cheats, just excellent SA and control. Pro league play stuff and an honor to be taken down by them. Really would like to post a comment on their wall, but that can turn toxic.
---
I only posted this because of the responses of being called a dick by you and others, whilst you all sit there and make demands based on YOUR individual needs without any thought or consideration for other people and their experience.
---
If you have no response other than to shout insults then you've lost the debate 110% (never had one in the first place, you just shouted down anyone who disagreed with you)
---
What about the Solo Players that can't select Solo lobbies? Why should they be forced to deal with respawns, not for a response?
---
I didn't reply because even though i'm literally on your side on this you're so in your own ass that you effectively won't let me help you form an argument against it.
---
And then 20 minutes later that stewed in you so bad you replied again to get my attention so this obviously means a lot to you. 
---
Again, my point was you need a better argument. Most people would agree that this doesn't need one but your argument was weak and based off of no merit.
---
And idk what saying "poor solo players" would do besides show the glaring problem that there needs to be solo matchmaking also.
---
"Oh this is a problem? Well what about this problem?"
---
Like ok dude you just proved that there's two problems to fix but you didn't do anything to explain why one isn't a problem in the first place.
---
Hey man could of bin me I'm on Xbox gt DrunkenLegend2
---
Ohh sorry I should have specified! I am on pc. :)
---
Agreed!
---
No, your point was just to say how wrong i was. Nothing was constructive or informative. And that's the behaviour of a condescending prick, and those types of profiles don't like being wrong (as you were) so you chose to sit in silence and downvote (to try and silence rather than converse) 
---
Statements about who you are as a person that.
---
The number of available caps from vendors is still the same. It used to be 200 caps across 7 factions, now it‚Äôs 1400 caps for all vendors.
---
AP limitation for sprinting is a good thing. Irritating but good, better than unlimited sprinting which then leads to more bunny hopping, strafe hopping and the whole carnival of cartoon physics (looking at you COD).
---
Ok, I shall not.
---
Level 187 and been here since Beta
---
Forest scout has the highest DR/ER, heavy combat second and i think urban scout third. Ideally you would want a full vanguard sentinel set
---
I‚Äôm guessing that if your aim is shit and your cracking off rounds like a madman, it will break. Improve your aim and the weapon will last longer?
---
That doesn‚Äôt make sense since hopping in BR doesn‚Äôt take away any AP running and jumping does but spamming triangle takes away no AP
---
There is no reason to fight at all, just camp, like winners do.
---
It needs changing so if you down a player and someone else kills them you should still be awarded that kill, lost count how many times I'm about to finish someone off and some fucker steals my kill.
---
Thanks folks. I don't suppose anyone has any estimates of how long it took them, at a higher level, just running through?
---
Go back to cod lmfao
---
I'm not able to move my camp since forever. I always have to rebuild it :( The blueprints shows green yet is impossible to place. Carpets and wall attachments mess up the process.
---
The ESRB has something against smoking. Take all the hard drugs and booze you want. I mean, Coke, Meth and PCP are in the game and just named something BUT GOD FORBID YOU SMOKE A STOGIE
---
Yeah, you are forced to use enter. That's terrible.
---
Thanks. You seem like a dick
---
You're welcome.

---
Look. I don't have a lot of time to explain this but I legitimately said in every reply that I A.) Don't want this and B.) Just lore wise it literally makes no sense to add. Then I explained why those points are stronger things to base an argument off of besides not liking something because it's popular.
---
If you somehow took that as a personal attack I'm sorry, but again, not every confrontation and conversation between two people with two standpoints is negative. I don't want it in the game either, I just think it shouldn't be based on going against what's popular right now. There should be actual reasons as to not implement it.
---
Bruh you fuckin high high lmao
---
Yeah until the other guy replied I thought the stashes were still seperate and had increased stashes. But it makes more sense it was just combined, stop people from getting too rich too quick.
---
If you shoot, then you have already ruined it anyway.
---
You say its not rly worth it but unless youre faming revives with a teammate imo its very worth it, its 575 bonus xp which is pretty significant
---
I went to look for some friendly skirmishes but everyone's just so damn nice I couldn't do it lol
---
just happened to me for the second time today, too. Had to put 120 items for sale again
---
Yeah but they can whip around and see me very easily. Think like pubg where you don‚Äôt always know where it‚Äôs coming from.
---
As far as I know the tesla can only be obtained through the hacker perk. So it's basically on par with the higher end weapons.
---
For the extra step of getting it and it's rarity I think it's pretty fair. You wouldn't stay bunched up with someone who had a missile launcher so you shouldn't stay bunched up for that.
---
That being said I don't know how far the arc goes, but I feel like with how rare the weapon is, it deserves to be pretty good. Besides, groups shouldn't be bunched up too hard anyway with the chance a grenade could wipe them.
---
WTF? You managed to break a weapon? I squeeze offf all the rounds I can find and no breaking.
---
Think about it, you jump further and higher from a sprint. 
---
More sprinting = more bouncing around the screen. 
---
Everyone moving at 2x is just silly, look at Blackops/Blackout.
---
NW is different in a good way because it is relaxed.
---
Yes, the health bar does decrease more and more with each consecutive hit. [Somebody](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c0kn8m/furiuos_retest_with_ingame_damage_numbers/) did a test to check this too.
---
it only pops up when you're in combat, goes away after awhile if you don't engage. Makes you play a bit smarter when engaging.
---
You can place it infinite times, its just not very good bcs its way better to sit in a bush
---
In one of the datamined files there is a voice file where ZAX specifically points out that even if you win as a team there can only be one Overseer. Might have more relevance further in, after all, they are calling it pre-beta. Also, there is a file where he points out that trying to win as a team sounds suspiciously like communism.
---
If wastelanders bring human enemies it might be somewhat useful.
---
Yeyyyyy, i never left! Though i wouldn't describe my feelings as love. I always say "the game is shitty sometimes, bit it's that shitty that i play it every day". Over 600 hours now and have 2 accounts too. 
---
Also... got me bag yesterday!!!! Thank you BGS
---
u/aten_ra
---
Theres a lot of bugs with stealth boy activation. I'm pretty sure you'd have them, but here's a recent example in PvP.
---
I'd rather they give us some sort of atom prize.
---
I feel like even just getting 100 atoms for winning the game would give me incentive to go back repeatedly. 
---
As of now I'm just going back to grind out the gladiator helmet.
---
same problem here
---
been here since launce but had a time out beginning of this year, I couldn't handle the crashes. I started playing again in march and loved everything about the game!!
---
Can confirm tesla is stupid op, combine frog legs and just moving super erratically with the tesla since it basically has auto aim and youre near unkillable till ou have to reload, and with 15 shots you should be able to kill a squad easy. That being said I, at level 37, still dont have the bonus damage to non auto rifles, bloody mess, or adrenaline perk cards, and ive had about 25 duplicates at this point because fuck that i guess, who needs useful perks so even without anywhere near max damage its still stupid op imo
---
What kind of computer or system do you play it on?
---
That sounds super specific to you or your internet connection. And I'm sorry it's happening. I hope it'll get better soon because I do think you would actually love the game.
---
The Brahim in Free Range Quest get killed by rads
---
U might need a graphics upgrade too ur device, or just an upgrade in general, other than that they may just be on the works for fixing some bugs so it will be fixed in a week or two. Platform?
---
Will try today, thanks!

Honestly I think 100 atoms would be too much, maybe 50 or less. Or to give us atoms every few ranks maybe like apex and fortnite have. Or just improve those rewards.
---
Someone said for us to power down our console then try again, I I‚Äôll try again today.
---
Well, I tried that and didn‚Äôt work, hopefully you have better luck than I did
---
I know the feeling man, i have 46 different perk cards now, and i still dont have any of the 3 i wanted the most (master rifleman, bloody mess, adrenaline).
---
Plus im lv37 rn so im probably not getting any more perk cards for a long time, theyre so damn rare at later levels and im almost tempted to start a new character just to try again, its so bs
---
I'd take 50 or less easily.
---
As of right now you legitimately get nothing for a win. Not even some sort of VIP access to some winner room in Vault 51. So it's a little lack luster.
---
Legendary scrip is okay but I couldn't care less about legendaries and if it was atoms it would at least actually be useful as you wear that stuff to NW.
---
Atom is not so good because it is directly linked to real money.  And Atom is Bethesda's important source of income.  Fewer people buy Atom.
---
Damn, that sucks, let‚Äôs see what happens today.
---
Just keep exploring and you will find some awesome easter eggs :)
---
I won't tell the one with nukashine hangover - but that one is really awesome.
---
If I may add has anyone been getting this one bug where the floor slowing separates from each other?
---
It‚Äôs likely coming in a future update. One of the roadmap icons shows a small sentry bot.
---
I think its the explosive legendary trait. It can hit multiple body parts, thus counting as multiple harpoons hitting. Could also be the flechette-mod doing the same. A combo of these would probably be the best way to multiply the harpoons since it could potentially hit an enemy many times over with a single attack.
---
Hmm. You must be one of the players. Weapons in thisngame dont actually break unless you are dealing damage to a target. You can shoot trees until you're out of breath and your hmu wont take any damage at all.
---
Cool! Any link to the roadmap?
---
The people who don't buy atoms right now still won't buy them regardless. Those that do will. 
---
It's not like you cant already grind atoms from challenges. I don't see any real money being lost. I'd be fine with 5-10 atoms per win.
---
People who want to buy stuff still will. Not everyone can come out on top consistently. And people who won't buy atoms still won't.
---
I don't see this change wrecking that any time soon. Especially when it's common knowledge that you support the game through micros.
---
Awesome work.
---
The other day a level 73 person gave me some high level gear n it made me consider something i hadnt before.
---
Im level 16 (played first month, too buggy, rejoined recently) and i guess that player considered me newbie, even though id spent dozens of hrs roaming no interest in upscaling.
---
What i considered was the players gift to me was a 'hey keep going, heres some motivation!' in the form of level 20, 30 and 40 required gear..
---
Made me def more excited to keep going to get to use it. Thanks random level 73 who also shot the ground n danced around a brown paper bag till i got the hint. Haha
---
Hey bethesda, you gotta find a more intuative system for highlighting gifts!
---
The trading system obvs is horribly laborious but the fast gift is great.. makes me.wonder others whove gifted me n others things where we didnt realise.
---
Peace yall, seeya in Apalacia! :)
---
You ahvw to actually be damaging a target for your gun to break. Missing wont damage your gun.
---
They called this pre-beta stage. If they add prizes I am sure it will happen after the mode has gone through more rigorously testing and is fully live. Right now all the wins would be farmed by cheaters if they added it in. First polishing. Then anti-cheat system. Then prizes.
---
Way too much effort to make a new model every week for a gamemode that is overshadowed by NW.
---
Back to back they faced each other, drew their swords and shot each other
---
wait you have to sit and wait till the end of every match?
---
This scrip needs review
---
Here you go friendo:
---
https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019
---
Go down to where there is a picture form of the roadmap, the very last ‚Äúbadge‚Äù has the vault boy and a small sentry bot icon.
---
Yea right now I‚Äôve found some good items I can turn for 2k caps a day or so, mostly steel, acid, adhesive, ammo, and cheap chems and plans. Just seeing if there was a better way, but I think I‚Äôll stick with what I‚Äôm doing in that case.
---
Darmok and Jalad at Tanagra.
---
Sounds like it could be a problem with your firewall or router, since you get disconnected as soon as you start to actually connect to the servers. Since this does not seem to be a general problem or bug, it seems very specific to you and your system. Check router logs and firewall settings, that is my advice.
---
Def the reason i gave Skyrim away. It broke the magic of the game for me to have to get close b pretend i couldn't have murked enemies from a mile away initially..
---
Shadow of Modor perfected this system of negating ya bowmen skills!
---
That would work if there wasn't an entire community of console only players who can't exactly use that method.
---
Maybe a PC only thing but idk how that would adjust the already pretty shaky code.
---
All duping is not fixed. So... issue is not fixed?
---
Welcome in Appalachia!
---
Make yourself comfy, have a seat, a nukashine for you? ...Good here you go...
---
You might try the cranberry cobbler - as my granny once told better stay well fe... **HEY!** were did you go?! Oh...
---
Nukashine. Nukashine never changes...
---
Lots of people would sell them for a lot more but if they were in my vending machine you'd probably pick them up for between 800-1000 caps depending on the level.
---
Watoga has many places that spawn. Check the rooftops and the street near the downed Vertibird.
---
Sure what platform?
---
So, we done now? Or do you absolutely disagree again? Despite the contrary above data?
---
Started mid Dec. Got two dwellers, bout level 60 each. First one I didn't plan special stats so restarted during a double xp event. New guy much better. Love exploring. Love building. Love fighting bosses with randoms. Love Reddit community.
---
I think it was the server I was on. Because it worked when I changed worlds.
---
Another reason is that I already buy most of the items at ATOM, which means I do not want ATOM because I can always buy ATOM for money.  But legendary weapons can not be bought for real money.  (There is no eBay)
---
Yeah. Or use VATS.
---
Meant the nobody dies and is downed until last teammate is downed
---
That is your choice, but I disagree. But this is about play-styles and even if they changed it others would get more upset about the change. People play differently and the ones who play in harmony with the way that it  currently rewards players will always be happy and other not. If they change it they only change which group is currently happy.
---
There's legitimately an entire forum of people who specifically farm legendaries to sell to other players so yes.
---
There most definitely is a way to buy legendary weapons with real money.
---
It is very agreeable.
---
But PUBG, as far as I know, has way more visibility.
---
In FO76 you can take off your clothes and hide in a bush and become practically invisible, especially if you have wood armor.
---
This problem is on your end. We're all playing fine. You can't blame the game for your hardware problems.
---
I'm a free weeker. Didn't get the game initially because I was pretty sure my aging system couldn't run it well enough. Low and behold, free week comes along and I've got nothing to lose so I tried it out and haven't stopped since it went temporarily f2p. I'll end up buying it in a month or two once school fees are sorted.
---
Hilariously Fallout 76 runs much better than my (heavily modded) Fallout 4, looks a hell of a lot better with huge amounts of ground clutter and godrays and all that jazz, and rarely if ever dips below 45 fps. Now, I'm not a high enough level to do fissure nukes just yet so we'll see how that goes eventually.
---
Are the lower mid levels, 25-35, supposed to be pretty difficult? Level 50 legendary sheepsquatch just chased me from Ella's bunker all the way to Raleigh's bunker. Seriously, the whole way.
---
I enjoy building as well but I‚Äôm really happy with my existing camp minus the location. It‚Äôs got a pretty big foundation so I‚Äôm feeling like it‚Äôll be impossible to place.
---
\*Raises hand\*
---
\*Wife gives me a weird look\*
---
But hey! I sticked arround since BETA. Because of my wife and 2 kids (youngest is only 2 months old) i haven't got all the time of the world to play. But that won't stop me from playing.  
---
I think the game had a bad start. I'm not the person to rant everything out in posts, but i do had my own opinion about it. But i saw the dev team working hard on those bugs and new content.  
---
Now, after all the updates and the coming of NW, the game really grew and it's getting more and more fun to play. There are still some bugs and still some additions that would really improve the QoL in this game, but i guess they are working on those things. They showed us that they really listen to the community and do there best.
---
I'll stop typing now and start playing again!   
---
See you guys ingame ;)
---
Read it again.
---
Works fine for me on both Xbox and my potato PC. Don't let the door hit you on the way out.
---
You could message me, I nevef finished the main quest
---
Been here since beta, bought it at midnight release and 900 hours later I'm still here selling chairs to strangers.
---
Huntersville!
---
Those who are bad at PvP and cant win gun fight are happy that they dont have to do anything but hide to lvl up. Those who get tons of kills only to be told here is your 20xp arent happy. Clearly the people actually doing some th ing should be rewarded.
---
Makes no real difference. I'm sure, once again, someone will start trying to argue with me for saying this, but it really doesn't. Too much dumb luck involved.
---
Just south of Sunday Brothers cabin in the Mire near a utility tower
---
Oh I definitely read it ahah I‚Äôm happy to give you 5000 caps for free I have to many lmao
---
What platform?
---
Lmao. I'm good bro.
---
Playing since beta. Never left. 4 Chars.
---
Further down the line, as you stack up more perks for your NW deck, you may get special perks that specifically benefit power armor. For example, I have a level 9 card that greatly increases accuracy and ignores 45% of armor for heavy weapons when I‚Äôm in power armor. Stack that with the master heavy gunner card and you‚Äôre an unstoppable fucking DPS tank.
---
I had one in my vendor for 10k for a long time because I never used it but didn't really want to sell it.
---
Well some kid bought it the other day, fwiw.
---
Right ok thx. So maybe its just a bug with the damage amount value being displayed.
---
Raise your hands to Make Feed The People Great Again
---
Level 244, I login regularly since beta but don't have as much time as I want.
---
Rifleman sneak vats w the pipe weapon that benefits from both pistol and rifleman perks
---
PA is USELESS in pvp
---
If you are good you kill AND survive. Which is the higher reward.
---
You sure it‚Äôs literally a free gun and caps ahah
---
I watched shroud kill 23 players im one match and nothing broke... This is the first iv heard of it... Honestly only won a couple of games and i didn't know it was a thing
---
No man. No matter how good you are if you shoot and the red arrow appears over you head, 2 full teams could swarm you and you're dead. You are being ridiculous.
---
Yeah. I'm all full
---
Yes, those are the dark levels. You find yourself sometimes wandering around over level monsters.  You dont have all your core perks let alone the quality of life ones like super duper and ammosmith so you find yourself living hand to mouth jerking armor, weapons and ammo in a usable state. You dont yet have solid legendaries that match your engagement types. You cant keep the fun mutations.
---
Once you get your core perks settled, it's a huge step up. Once you get those QOL perks as well to swap in, your economic position is tons better. 50 gets you most,  and by the time you are 60-75 you'll likely feel comfortable. Get a friend to help you out with some gear or get lucky and it's easy street.
---
He used like 6 different guns so that's not what I'm talking about.
---
I've been playing since the stress test, only took a break around February but got back into it in March.
---
I‚Äôve been keeping up with updates here almost religiously because I haven‚Äôt had time to play for a while, but I finally got to play the other night. I tried the BR mode with a friend who also loves fallout and was visiting for my graduation and we enjoyed the fuck out of it. We smashed and won our first game pretty handily. I can‚Äôt wait to play some more! I do hope they keep adding music though because I‚Äôm already used to the music (probably because I listen to the FO76 playlist on Spotify on my free time too).
---
All right bud bit late to the party I've had this same problem their are two solutions i know of.
---
Number 1 use a 3rd player you can both join to get onto the same server then you will be able to find each other in the recent tab to unblock.
---
Number 2 download the elder scrolls legends on the bethesda launcher its free to play and uses the same friends list as fallout 76. This game has the unblock function.
---
I‚Äôm incredibly averse to PvP games that have an included PvE element but I decided to try NW. I honestly enjoyed it a lot more than I thought I would and I didn‚Äôt think I would enjoy it at all. Definitely try a game or two out, they don‚Äôt talk long anyways
---
what did you do to fix it? I'm having the same problem.
---
Yeh I understand you, but its in every bttle royale the same, winning gets you just extra exp.
---
No but i suppose i could
---
I only had one thing neon an that was the "open" sign. Moved my camp somewhere else and it was at 106% but some stuff were dupped way too much like I had 6 tvs when I only had 1 and so I just scrapped everything except the walls and floors. Gonna rebuild somewhere else an start fresh. Was at that location since Dec too...gonna miss it but also got bored of it so to speak.
---
There is only one meta and that is the stealth gank meta. PA and Non stealth builds are only good for Ganking noobs and scrubs only. Stealth gank meta can only be countered by stealth gank meta which means if you ever want a fair fight that isn't completely seal clubbing your defenseless opponent like an honorless shit, well you wont see the only people who can possible challenge you because they're stealth gank meta too. 
---
Your stealth gank build can work with any of the weapon types but stealth is key to avoid getting Vats Locked and Crit. Congrats you're going for PvP in one of the lamest pvp games I have seen since 1996. to be optimal at pvp you're going to suck at everything else in the game. you'll be like a race car with no headlights. no AC, no turn signals. Currently I think the tesla is FOTM you can work and grind to get there in your shitty for grinding build and then it will be nerfed and become non viable and you've built your whole character around a broken pvp mechanic and it sucks for anything else. 
---
  The rules of engagement in adventure mode will only allow you to kill players in shops after you've contested it. The payout is capped at 50 caps per kill. This means you will spent 12 to 25 caps fast travelling there spend 12 to 25 caps contesting the workshop and then kaching you have just profitted as much as if you killed a level 5 supermutant. 
---
  If your just after salt most of us PVErs in adventure mode don't go back to defend shops if you're lucky enough to actually catch us there and kill us. I take a shop, keep it under budget and if it gets taken its literally no skin off my back, the loss of 50 caps is nothing because I have all the perks for playing fallout instead of trying to be a griefer. I sit comfortably at 25k caps at almost all times and the loss of a shop doesn't piss me off it makes me think of that how guys a  poor schmuck who sucks at everything else fallout putting a crapton of energy and effort into getting the one kill and gaining peanuts for it. meanwhile I serverhop gain 20 caps for clearing the fresh capture area pay 25 to claim it then get 50 to 100 in random loot value alone not counting the future resource's I will be harvesting. this means even in loss I have still made profit and recovered within 5 to 10 minutes tops. 
---
  Hopefully Factions will bring about some decent pvp balances and perhaps some meaningful reason to bother with it but as of right now pvp is broken and stupid and pretty much only played by people who really really want to be mean but only succeed in tormenting the weakest and most uninformed of the community. 
---
   Anyway good luck with that I would say enjoy your journey but if you level up any perks that actually make your life easier in pve land then you'll just be delaying your "greatness" by investing in the wrong points. All snark aside I would say level up as pver wait till about level 60 or 70 before you start trying to put points into your actual pvp build. at that point you can grind out all the levels you need and just sit on them till you're ready to transition into dick mode.

---
Same happend to me yesterday, we were fighting for first place and my teammates were downed, I revive first one and get bugged on a second one, was pretty pissed. When I was watching shroud stream, same happend to him, I hope it will be fixed soon.
---
This made me think of implementing ‚ÄúWell Bathed‚Äù or ‚ÄúGood Hygiene‚Äù as a perk for using a tub/ shower/ toilet/ etc. that gives you a slight resistance to disease or something? I feel like it would help with the overall progression for the game towards rebuilding Appalachian society because as it stands, hygiene seems pretty neglected from people only 25 years removed from the pre-war world.
---
Yea, I've taken to carrying around two armor piercing fire axes, Knock Knock and Who's There, because weapons seem to break at the most inconvenient times. I am enjoying it though. The survival aspect is lasting much longer than I anticipated it would and after killing my first scourgebeast by myself at level 30, I now stay low and quiet when I hear wings. Hid in the outhouse with the tin foil hat once, worked like a charm. Deathclaws are still sad though, wish they were scarier. Proper blocking and I can kill them without any real damage taken.
---
I‚Äôm running at 60fps on Ultra (for the little time the game runs before getting disconnected) on a 10GBPs FON connection in Europe; tried different DNS and port forwarding to no avail
---
No. It hasn't for any other FO game either. The light however does.
---
Try building another foundation and stairway right next to it. 
---
Usually that helps me. It usually takes a  couple times to figure out.
---
I've legitimately had to build foundations 5 squares away just to make it register that it's a solid base and can delete the objects around it. That's the goal. Make sure it knows that there's another foundation connected.
---
Besides that there's not a fix I know of besides altogether moving your camp.
---
Anybody help please?
---
Please from a guy who pre ordered please
---
It's not an issue with the game tho it sounds like you wanted to play the next fallout game and simply lack the hardware. This would be like if you said Majora's mask was just unplayable for you but meanwhile you didn't have an expansion pak. I'm on Xbox and almost never disconnect or anything like that. Power armor can get buggy for me frequently but nothing that really gets in the way of gameplay. maybe buy an Xbox and get it on Xbox if you really want to play it but otherwise I think you don't even have enough interest if you disconnected a few times and just called it quits
---
I struggled with this a lot finding them in the wild, build your own Brahmin pen at your camp and milk that one worked straight away for me
---
I connect, create a character walk around for a minute or so and get disconnected !
---
You don't always succeed. You will when the prompt goes away and you see Brahmin milk added to your inventory.
---
Gaaaaarryyyyyyyy. Gary?

Have had this issue for months. However, thanks to the attention that Nuclear Winter and Free Week has given this  **\[4:7:2000\]** error code they say they are looking into the issue. We'll see if there's a solution soon, but I think you received the same support ticket info that I did when asking for help. :)
---
Oh right ill have another go at it at some point this weekend then cheers!
---
The grafton one was an event so I'm assuming that's why I got mugged off by a giant monster lol.
---
More music would be fantastic
---
It‚Äôs such a counter intuitive system. In what scenario would you pick up a unknown plan and *not* want to read it?
---
Cool cheers. I'll have another look and hopefully won't go in after a level 60 hit squad! Lmao.
---
I crash at least once every 3 hours sometimes more in normal mode. BR I have yet to crash.
---
Bobble heads are just buffs in fo76
---
I‚Äôll kill you if you like, just for using the word ‚Äòyounglings.‚Äô
---
And Dropped Connection.
---
i stayed away because of all the bad reviews and thought i'd give it a shot, it being free and all. i mean, there has to be some sort of improvement in 7ish months after release. very few bugs for me, i love it!
---
I would say whatever universally usefull perk cards you manage to draw. its all based on luck, so if you specialize in heavy guns for example there's a good chance you'll get boxes of pipe rifles. it really is 90% luck.
---
I climbed aboard the 76vtrain this week thanks to the free trial, and I've had an absolute blast. Plenty to do, really helpful and friendly players and a wonderful world to explore. I was so impressed I went ahead and bought the game, something I didn't imagine I'd do back at launch. I've fallen for Fallout (76).
---
‚úã
---
In the video you can see that he has everything cranked up to max.
---
Yeah, but I also get ridiculous xp so I am ok with it.
---
It should just be doubled
---
Would be great if we could find some mods for it. Like jetpack, stealth boy, medic pump...
---
i took a break for a bit to play other games, came back for Wild Appalachia
---
Give us hardcore mode which is something similar to survival mode but with new characters, no legendaries etc.
---
From everything i have seen the game mode is far from FUN...
---
Easy there on the teats mate.
---
It's a Brahmin and not a ketchup bottle.
---
"Meet the friendly animals!" - Quericus, probably.
---
It's not a bug or anything, You can milk each Brahmin once every X minutes. The prompt will still be there to milk them after the first milking but it won't add more milk to your inventory. You just have to milk multiple brahmin to get the milk.
---
What happens to me in BR is I go where the team goes and instead of doing anything I would consider sensible they usually charge immediately at incoming teams in the great wide open vs the team charging us in the great wide open. win or lose becomes a dice roll at that point, or if I decide to go it alone and ditch the team I successfully hide and stealth my way to the center only to be outnumbered by the first team that engages me and then I get killed. sticking with the team has a higher success rate but only marginally.
---
Ah, thank you very much for your response.
---
I already new the fact about the light but I wasn't sure about the radio.
---
radshield suppresses mutations? news to me
---
I get that with the weapons bench at my camp, on pc. If I sit and wait for a minute or so it gives me control again.
---
No AP reduction when I started jumping in NW
---
"Meet the friendly animals!"
---
Reading about samurai while in fallout makes me a bit uncomfortable.
---
What on earth is calling you guys back? It's still the same buggy mess it was
---
lol. you said it better than me
---
On console it would be really easy to win as the props because the gunplay is so clunky
---
since there‚Äôs no VATS they could make it so L1 or LB &amp; any direction on the d pad are hot keys this Would make for a much smoother playing experience for console imo
---
It's not gonna make much difference in a battle Royale tho like if you die it basically just sucks but there's too many variables to put the blame on OP weaponry. It's like fortnite if u died it was probably just chance regardless of weapons used. You could arguably kill a whole team with a grenade, and I know that's a stretch but still. I think the more they nerf shit and tweak the game, the more they ruin it. Like how they got rid of the double pump in fortnite, it's just fucking stupid cuz it's not like that tactic can turn the tide of a match or anything. Or how they nerfed the handcannon. I don't want the game to be more balanced if it means change I hate when developers change shit in a game even if it's better. Thank God they couldn't update games in the 90s or else the golden gun in GoldenEye would probably only 1 shot if it's a headshot or some shit like that.
---
Isn't Bethesda Austin the main team that works on Fallout 76?
---
Logged in to survival mode yesterday (because that's how real fallout should be played). All 3 highest wanted people lvl 300+ full godlike were slaying noobs just outside the vault. Amazing matchmaking this game has. Also why the fuck there are scoreboards? What is this, pacman?
---
I‚Äôd say they‚Äôre essential at this point. Having endgame be the same dissatisfying SBQ fight, but also the base building alternatives are hampered by bugs *and* a lack of building pieces? The only reason I can think of for the dev‚Äôs silence on anything besides display cases or refrigerators, is that they‚Äôre saving a lot of the settlement pieces from FO4 for release at a later date. I don‚Äôt have to like that to understand it, but six months in and no new building pieces released at all? That‚Äôs not sustainable.
---
The issue is lots of people.doing the challenge. You have to wait for the cow to reset. The easiest way around that is to build your own pen and milk it.
---
He threatened to kill you then put his ball sack in a dead mans mouth....
---
That's a slightly erotic and homosexual threat if I've ever seen one.
---
They mentioned on the 12th that they had to disable daily NW challenges. All the other permanent NW challenges can still be progressed and completed
---
It should get nerfed in adventure and survival mode tho cuz you shouldn't be able to get one shot by any weapon in those modes
---
Yeah, I usually like Jim's stuff in highlighting bad business practices, but his video was pretty much identical to the gazillion other '76 is teh worst' vids, offering nothing more than a chance to grab some clicks, as far as I can tell. Glad I made up my own mind and gave the game a shot during the free trial.
---
Go into adventure mode and open your pipboy. One of the options will be to either check your perks or level up. You can gain plenty of xp in nuclear winter but the actual level up/points assign process is all done in adventure.
---
You said ‚ÄûI connect, create a character walk around for a minute or so and get disconnected !‚Äú
---
It is defintely a Router/Firewall - Issue. You are offline while creating your Charakter. The Game connects to the Server when leaving your Room. 
---
So, Check your FW and your Router. The Problem lies in there.
---
at low level and undergeared this is what I do with alts  even at level 5 and 10 I can get capped in 30 minutes to an hour  if I apply myself. [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the\_way\_of\_the\_green\_thumb/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bw6ump/the_way_of_the_green_thumb/) 
---
at mid and High levels  just farm weapons like other posters have stated.
---
Text chat would have solved and enhanced any situation like this. 
---
Of course, if mmo's didn't have text chat, we would have had plenty of this awkward situations. Also wouldn't have had guilds, trade, or anything. Bring text chat to fallout 76, it's time already! There are no games like this without it!!!
---
I would love it if this is the case. OP was it you? WAS IT YOU???
---
it‚Äôs great when you turn up at the pool and the ghouls have already taken care of the frogs üòë
---
Thank god you don't work for bethesda
---
Can I ask, which dailies do you run and rare plan routes do you use?
---
You probably shouldn't have stolen his Sweet Roll!
---
damn man you just made me feel bad wanting to go pvp....
---
I have it under 'lights' I believe. I don't remember picking up a plan for it though...
---
Not actually had any weapons break or even come close. Rank 30 so far btw.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox, feel free to add me. I do have a regular person I play with and have got to the point where I‚Äôm making friends and having to try to get to play with everyone haha! But happy to run with you at some point. Things are a little more fun in a team!
---
do you have a link / screenshot where I can see the perkcards/equipment?
---
What pipe weapon is that?
---
I wouldn't mind if one patch run was *just* camp fixes, leave the floor ghouls, the moonwalking dogs and the sky pointing ghouls (I don't actually know of any other "live" mob glitches), they can wait another fortnight, but *please* fix the build system.  
---
If something turns green, it should be placeable, if it's not, don't turn it green!

And you can't complain that an item is floating if your crops bloody levitate!

Alright I‚Äôll try looking at that again but I tried port forwarding and DNS changes to no avail
---
The skyrim cart with the empty nukashine bottle is probably my favourite purely because not only is it funny it really shows they pay a lot of attention and respond to what the players are saying and doing.
---
mmm, cheers ill take a look
---
Ok?
---
I thought you only get marked if you shoot in 3rd person mode.
---
DO IT! You won‚Äôt regret it. I think you‚Äôll find that people will help you if you‚Äôre new. I‚Äôve had so many good experiences with people in this game, especially as a lowbie. I helped out a brand new player a while back. I fast travelled to vault 76 at the exact same time a newbie came out of the vault. I could hear him saying that he didn‚Äôt know what he was doing so I took pity on him, grabbed my headset and ran with him for a couple of hours. I told him the basics (he‚Äôd never played a fallout game before) made him so armor (which he accidentally scrapped straight away!) and gave him enough supplies to see him through for a while! I sometimes go check on him and see how he‚Äôs doing, pretty sure he‚Äôs higher level than me now :)
---
Where did you read that?
---
Urgh that‚Äôs so annoying
---
Just further evidence I am the chosen one, it's obviously a constant issue for everyone else.
---
They just fucked it up so bad in this game dude. Ive pvped in UO, WoW, GW2, EVE online, ARK, pretty much any major online game since 96 and this is the silliest crap I have ever seen. I love 76 but I don't pvp in it. 1K hours . Pretty well off , know the game well, I could do it pretty easy but its just so pointless and broken I don't bother. They really need to up they payout in survival mode drastically, they really need for non stealth builds to be viable. nothing funnier than two stealthed pvpers talking shit behind chameleon and neither revealing themselves lol. That is some high iq entertainment right there.
---
Lol. Ok. I'm the same lvl
---
Ah I can't, literally a 2x2 square and tried putting stairs on the other and they both have the same problem, absolute wind up...
---
I remember when the gift emote wasn‚Äôt even a thing. Nightmare
---
Ignore him. He's sounds like a whiney bitch that got picked on a lot. There are lots of good PvP builds and PvP can be a lot of fun. There is a reason that PvP specific armors sell for a fortune in the market.
---
In the european servers we have people speak portuguese, spanish, french, italian, english, german, russian, romanian, you get the idea... so even if we were blessed with a Walmart to sell us some good 20$ headphones, the text chat to write in english would help a lot instead of an italian speaking low level english to a low level english speaking russian with their respective thick accents while trying to find the biometric id card inside the silos while getting killed by assaultrons.
---
Trust me, i deal with it everyday.
---
Text chat FTW üëçüëç
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox and always willing to help :)
---
That the game runs on five fucking frames on ps4
---
I'm not usually keen on Battle Royale modes but yeah, had fun with this one in the brief, shining moments before I died!
---
Are you 100%? Even with the crossbow?
---
Not sure about the crossbow or melee attacks
---
Considering the absolutely ludicrous accuracy penalty of TS and the... number of 'rebalances' shotties first and explosive shotties specifically later have undergone I'd say... 500-1000 caps?
---
You can put a suppressor on it and if your sneak is high enough to shove it up the mob's arse undetected you may still do some damage.
---
Said that there is still plenty of people mentally stuck in the TSE era so you know, if you find one of those you may be able to talk them into parting with their money.
---
Lol sweet
---
For the love of God, this is the one thing right now that is really pissing me off about this game. I'm sick of spawning inside a foundation or cliff wall. And the same goes for Shoppers spawning in areas they should. I want my spawn at the front of my camp. so when you spawn in you're at the front door and get to follow the signs.
---
Never left.    Played almost entirely solo.
---
Looks like people have written hacks for the NW game.  
---
Must be clever stuff because I couldn't even get to the game lobby till I'd disabled my inventory and meat pile mods.
---
I didn't see that announcement. Good to know. Thank you.
---
Don't be cheap and just buy the game. It's pretty lame you are complaining about issues with a free trial.
---
Raising my hand. Pre-ordered the game, playing since release day and haven't really touched any other game since. Been taking my time just chilling with it. Just hit level 50,still exploring new areas on map and finding new places. Got my best friend into the game and he's loving it too. Greetings, Responders.
---
 [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks) this will let you play with perk cards better.
---
Puts hand down
---
Right! Plus I have a headset but don‚Äôt always use it. I don‚Äôt get much time to play, the odd half an hour here and there during the week when I‚Äôm just doing runs of whitesprings or fixing up my CAMP so it‚Äôs not worth using my headset or if I‚Äôm with my bf I don‚Äôt want to sit there with a headset on while he‚Äôs sitting with me, it‚Äôs kinda rude
---
I'm not a programmer, but I concur with the not a scientists diagnosis.
---
I've had armor break. I was more amazed I was still alive after being shot that often than annoyed.
---
Cannot raise my hand because i bought it on ps4 on easter's sales at half price, wanted to wait a bit and see what was happening with the title (and i'm totaly in love with it, skipped all the bug phase and find a quite stable title with many qol improvements).
---
But i want to point out that the dull hate helps nothing and no one, it is just plain stupid. Loved since day one other heavy "discussed" titles like No man's sky (wich needed a lot more time than this one to be appreciated from the masses) and Anthem (wich is still trying to find its way and i hope that in few months will be there too) and saw very similar situations to this one.
---
People need to understand what they are buying, how to correctly deal with it (its just stupid spending hundreds hours on the first weeks), know well themselves before buyng compulsively and, most of it, that everyone can make a wrong buy and crying on the internet, blaming developers, trolling and hating serves nothing.
---
Possible improvements to nuclear winter would be starting the game instantly if a lobby is full, not having to go back to main menu after every game and remove the red marks which appear on enemy players during a fight.
---
Why? Peoples republic scare ya that much UwU?
---
I thought in FO4 you had to hold the button down until you heard the pin click to use grenades.  Just pressing it normally was your melee.
---
I've played NW a lot. I've won and become overseer several times. I'm currently level 21. I've never seen a Tesla and didn't think they were in NW.
---
K bye.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since BETA! I only get probably 4-5 hours a week to play on and off so I‚Äôm still only level 66 but I‚Äôve never stopped playing it! 
---
*raises hand*
---
Upvote for use of the word fastidious.
---
I would love to have the previous Wild Appalachia background video and music :/
---
I also don't like PA that much, but the thing is you can use it to do some really cool stuff, won a game of NW with just me and a friend by getting lucky and being the only team to go to the bridge, both getting PA and the final few circles being under the bridge.
---
A nuke went off killing most of the remaining players and then we jumped off the bridge landing almost right on top of the last 4 man and wiped them out with 50 cal's.
---
Was pretty amazing.
---
I should clarify thats only in adventure mode. survival mode is better but it still boils down to stealth V Stealth. tell him I am lying and you know any top tier pvpers who dont use stealthboys and stagger.
---
I did too. I‚Äôve got to say I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs worth the extra and kinda wish I‚Äôd have just got the standard edition, mostly because it dropped drastically in price straight after I bought it but I don‚Äôt regret buying the game. I still love it now
---
If someone attacks unarmed, the cuts it leaves are brutal.
---
New disease: papercuts, take a miniscule amount of damage every time you pick something up.
---
Before the sudden influx of new players, those were almost always cap trap pvp teams. If you're not actively trying to get the bounty acheivment, never touch the low bounties. Honestly bounties need to start at 50 caps and go up from there. And mark them yellow if they have no caps to pay it or something.
---
The best build to win would be to choose special points based on the perk cards you are given.
---
‚úã hand officially raised.
---
You can invite friends at the main menu and then start Nuclear Winter as normal. And if you like your team, just remember their names and re-invite them after the game ends, man
---
I just won a game with it, it made me feel like I‚Äôm actually good at PvP, needs a nerf
---
We really need it now that there is a BR game mode. 
---
Having the ability to call out players for people who don't use mics (like myself). to just being able to ask "where are we going".
---
it would also make Adventure mode a lot easier as well. Nothing worse when i'm trying to give a low level some gear and they don't understand, so i have to play charades.
---
Ahh that sucks. Most ppl are trying out NW while it's still out
---
right after I posted this I got a server disconnect as I was loading into the map for the first time, So I reloaded and played for almost 6 hours with absolutely no issues at all.
---
I forget. I think it's a pipe pistol modded to have a rifle barrel? Something like that. I don't actually pvp myself, just know from reading the boards.
---
Dude survival is a shitshow right now. Stay out except to get the weekly weapon. They're gonna rework it with new characters and rules but they let us bring in our existing ones to test for the beta. Its god tier gear only in there.
---
I've played NW a lot and am level 21. I've never had a weapon or armor break.
---
Same here anyone know how to fix it?
---
I played it for like 2 weeks and then left for good. Maybe I should give it another chance.
---
no kidding, I just really wished they released the game in a better state. Even today, we're stuck with constant server disconnects and crashing, and an awful camp system. I did the same as you, (hilariously I preordered it), and it still seems to be the massive buggy mess it was at launch, now with a side of camera server hopping. I've got massive hope with Wastelanders on the fact that they can turn this game into something worth it's price.
---
That would be my guess
---
Did you submit a bug report? Definitely an issue a lot of people are having and the more reports, the easier it will be to see, identify, and fix the problem.
---
It was announced that NW is staying just fyi
---
This is the kind of helpfulness that makes travelling the Wasteland so good. Thanks for the advice.
---
In the words of Peter Venkman: "Alright, important safety tip. Thanks, Egon."
---
And it will be there forever
---
What were they doing? 76 doesn't have daily writs for farming bots.
---
I think so. I have recently started to use the text chat mod, which I knew since release but was too afraid to use mods, and for me its another game.
---
I never used voice chat due to issues, but been playing mmo's since ultima online. So I like to find random people for quests, trades, talk about the game etc.
---
 I never found text chat too toxic, given you always have tools to hide channels, block people etc.
---
Playing a game like this for about 500h like me, without text chat, but strong desires to socialize / quest with others etc has been very, very alienating.
---
I know all the legistlation deal (which didn't affect them as game was being developed before it) and can't understand why they don't implement it, specially when Bethesda is now hearing user feedback and delivering all we asked, having the playerbase like myself very, very happy with their support on fallout 76.
---
And yeah, battle royale without text chat? All other Battle Royale games have it, I am sure it would have been useful for many people, even if it is not the best for firefights, a word or two can change a chaotic team into a cooperating one.
---
Access Denied
---
Maby disabling it is too much,but reducing the range or make that it can only point at your character would be enough
---

---
Real friends die together.
---
I chase them with a Buzz Blade in pacifist, it's pretty fun hazing them.
---
The old players are on Nuclear Winter and the new players coming in for the free week are way too low level to fight the SBQ.
---
Fuck man, that sounds dope!
---
Did they bring it in this patch?
---
As I mentioned, I'm part of the people who are still experiencing many issues and so are the friends I play with.
---
The minor issues are shadows not rendering correctly, the AI forgetting how to fight, and some other visual stuff. Major issues include constant disconnects because of "another login attempt", quest items disappearing/not spawning/not being counted, random crashes while loading/traveling, and some quest targets no longer being able to be interacted with. Also random loss of progress isn't nice.
---
Game breaking issues for me were the times I got stuck in terminals two times with no text on the screen and no way of getting out, forcing me to close the game through Task Manager. In one quest the target item hasn't spawned for me and hasn't again so far, thus rendering that quest bugged. For another quest I have to get some data from a terminal, but I already have that data thus can't get it again.
---
FO76 might have been the only MMO I would be willing to play, but with the lack of proper story delivery through NPCs (which luckily are coming) and the amount of bugs, I can't give it a pass. At this current state I can understand the general negative attitude a lot of people have, even though it is getting slowly better. Which still doesn't mean Bethesda should be forgiven, they made a huge mistake that should be remembered for years to come, but that also applies to them if they manage to turn this game to something great.
---
.ini settings are everything in this game, I managed to have awesome max. graphics with good performance or otherwise depending on that.  
---
I don't have links at hand but would recommend you checking that, there's a thread telling how to lower shadow distance in .ini which works wonders.
---
It's either under lights or floor decor, one of the two.
---
Specs good man, don't just brag.
---
Level 35, but that's because I spend most of the time improving [my beloved C.A.M.P.](https://imgur.com/gallery/SQVa0X5)
---
 ‚úãüèº  love the game since beta some bugs are frustrating but a lot of them are funny xD
---
I always grab spare frames while wandering around so I can dump them off for new players coming out of Vault 76.
---
Haha - yes there is always a bit of luck involved; that‚Äôs why I noted to have a second and third spot in mind so if it is swarmed you can just hightail it to the next location.
---
You can actually zoom in on the placement map and it will reveal the smaller locations.  I usually zoom into my quad while selecting to get a better look at where people near me are landing.
---
Question - Will a pipe pistol with a full-auto receiver and added rifle stock benefit (stack damage) from both the Guerrilla and Commando perk cards?
---
I stock what I call "Noob Suits" in my vending machines to help people get through the mid levels. They sell pretty well. 
---
Level 20 BoS/Leaded or BoS/Deep Pocket Heavy Combat at 200 caps per piece, along with Shielded BoS Officer suits for 500, and if they feel like grabbing one, a BoS Combat helmet for 50 caps. 
---
Same pieces at level 30 for 300 apiece. 
---
Vets buy them to help their new friends. I might be basically breaking even on them, but I remember trying to keep up my armor in those levels. Wasn't the most fun thing to do.
---
Had it since te beta.
---
Raise my 3 irradiated hands
---
r/The_Donald user. Ugh.
---
It's a rare reward from Project Paradise. Rumour has it you have to keep all 3 animals alive to get it so there's not going to be many about, let alone for sale.
---
I pre ordered and played the beta, then played the game for a week or two then took a break. I‚Äôve been playing consistently with small breaks so I don‚Äôt get bored because sometimes If I play one game too much I get tired of playing it regardless of how good it is, but I‚Äôve been having a blast.
---
Yeah, it depends on the game with how toxic it gets, but most of the 76 community seem decent.
---
So many times though that I come upon a CAMP and want to actually tell the person "Hey, nice CAMP! I like ____ about it".
---
And actually, one of the problems i have with this BR, is squad mates looting everything and not being able to tell them "shit i need a gun" before we move out.
---
Yes. No collision.
---
Definitely start with purified water from your camp/workshops
---
I know it wasn‚Äôt a stimpak because I didn‚Äôt stop shooting them at point blank.
---
Yeah ikr, it was a birthday gift from Old Lady Palmer and you just nicked it
---
None of the daily NW challenges have worked all week.
---
Umm, you're in PA.
---
I mean a solo player only mode, similar to pubg. yes you can turn off team adding but that doesn't stop the game from matching you up against an entire squad.
---
Todd Howard confirmed that Skyrim won't be releasing on Tesla.
---
Fallout shelter is tho.
---
me
---
I can pass the game over to a friend of mine if you've still got it
---
Didn‚Äôt think samurai where a Chinese thing.
---
Did you buy her a drink first.
---
We need to know what all the perk cards are first.
---
 Never left.  Having a blast one-shotting Level Fives and then gifting them a bunch of weaps, armor and chems.
---
LOL maybe a bad friend but not a bad person. if you need the caps and they have it should they feel bad for not just giving you caps?
---
It's one of the default camp structures, hence no plan :)
---
Adventure mode is still boring and doesn't offer any interesting end game content. BR was nice addition, but will lose its interest in few weeks because it has no connection to the real game (adventure mode). Rewards from BR are kinda useless.
---
They are ultra rare drops. I've picked them up from hacking and the scorchbeast body so far.
---
RadX should suppress mutations, try that. Radshield lets you keep them.
---
If you check most of the servers (at least when I‚Äôm on) most players on adventure are usually 25 or less. Anyone higher than that is usually doing a trade and leaves from what I‚Äôve seen. Adventure is definitely a ghost town at the moment, and the other guy posting was right. High levels finally have something new so we grind NW and low levels assuming they are on the free trial are nowhere near ready for scorched earth
---
I could use it. I gave my physical copy to a sibling yesterday because they where going to play until NW game modes ended.  Which it's no longer ending.
---
Then you arent engaging people enough.
---
I can confirm - this stuttering, after last patch(Nuclear Winter) - is absolutelly unbearable. 
---
First, my gear is way to much overkill for this game(i7 3930k, 64gb ram, gtx1080ti, ssd everywhere, etc..).
---
Before patch I had occasionall bearable hiccups/stuttering, even in borderless mode. Now after patch, I get from micro-stutters to horendous 1-3sec freezes. I tried all possible tricks(RTSS with SS, unlockin/locking VSync, update drivers, changing visual setting from zero to hero, removing all visual mods, from borderless to fullscreen...) Nothing helped much, I would say it is just placebo.
---
This issue is especially problematic when I want to enjoy Battle Royalle - its just unplayable. You wanna snipe someone? -  Forget it, the target is either bcs of this stutter already elsewhere and you just missed it. You wanna play Rambo in close combat with 50cal? - Forget it, the game will just freeze in the heat of the moment and you are dead...
---
Harvest raw flux in nuke zones, along with glowing mass, hardened mass, and high radiation fluid off enemies, use a chem station to make stable flux. Stable flux turns into pure flux when you use it
---
Played 6 days a week since the beta ended so my hands up!
---
Upvoted to cancel out one of the downvotes. Smh
---
There's a recipe at the chemistry station to turn it into pure. You automatically have it.
---
I read that. You all can thank me for this. After all Tuesday is my birthday so that has to be the reason they did it. What an awesome birthday present!
---
I went to help a dude and it was just us two. after a few minutes of wasting ammo we just focused on farming the mobs and ignored the queen. I think the payout is better doing that anyway I may just start nuking her to farm the mobs.
---
Do you know the best place to farm these? So I can set off a nuke and go to town?
---
Overseer Level 27, quite a few wins under my belt (and a few nukes).
---
My current build: Lock Pick, Master Commando, Life Giver, Ironclad, Bodyguards, Marathoner, Action Boy
---
When I pick a start location, I tend to pick areas that contain safes. Safes are as good as the large loot boxes in terms of what you get from them. 
---
My weapon preference is Automatic Pipe Rifle &lt; Radium Rifle &lt; SMG &lt; Automatic Combat Rifle &lt; Automatic Handmade. Depending on the amount of ammo I find for the automatic, I may carry a back up 10mm SMG or some sort of shotgun. Always pick up a hazmat suit if you see one.
---
With Action Boy and Marathoner, I can stay near the edge of the circle without worry and I can escape nuke launches if I have to (and I have, more than once).
---
Life Giver, Ironclad, and Bodyguards makes me pretty tanky. Though I may be looking to switch Bodyguards out for something else soon.
---
Yes, I knew that. I took a risk, but I was pretty sure he was alone.
---
At least he didn't die to any edgy tryhard.
---
Best place to nuke for the materials?
---
raises left hand... changes to right hand... duh.. raises both hands...
---
I've never been able to loot the SB. I always die or win immediately after killing it. I'll have to try hacking.
---
Good question actually, I‚Äôve always wondered that also
---
You can come with me to do a full rutine! 
---
I can show you some hot spots; 
---
I‚Äôm level 101 and got here with my routine pretty fast;
---
Depends what you need. I've had good luck with cobalt and yellowcake in whitesprings and Morgantown, cranberry bog has a lot of violet. Not sure about crimson, haven't needed to farm it yet.
---
one of my mates would love it
---
Violet and cobalt. So whitesprings and cranberry? Ok thanks!
---
No. They are bind to your account. Like every skin from the atom shop.
---
okey thank you for the fast reply
---
Me and my mates that play are all level 300 plus and we have recruited low levels heaps of times and kitted them up with good guns, armor and rare clothes we can spare even if they can‚Äôt use some of them yet, then we take some supplies to their camp and Build them a solid place to bunker down for the night, faschnat ribbons and all, makes you feel good knowing your helping out someone start their adventure with a bit of an advantage because some of us that have played from the beginning know what it‚Äôs like to play with no help at all
---
Yup, make sure the waste disposal at the north side of whitesprings is in your blast zone, theres a bunch of cobalt there. And green thumb is incredibly useful.
---
Gotta let em regen! I swear if I let the 3stars regen I get a better roll. Nothing like killing a 3 star to get a 1* chameleon lether R leg lol. I'm just bitchin there's more than enough ways to obtain legendaries in this game! Wish there were more.
---
\*shakes cane in the air wildly\* back in my day we ONLY had text chat and we begged devs to make area chat and now all the youngsters don't use it! what the heck!? voice chat is so much better. someone posted the idea of a global chat accessed by using a computer terminal in game and I really like that idea. Maybe pipboy access or by terminals in your camp etc. words across the top of the screen would such in my opinion. too intrusive and distracting.
---
It was just an idea lmfao no need to be rude.
---
As long as you dont move it, your camp gets stored and put back when you change servers
---
I'm not talking about the Elder Maxson from Fallout 4 FYI. I'm talking about the Elder Maxson who created the Brotherhood of Steel. You know, the one you hear on the holotapes in 76 clearly named Elder Maxson.
---
It can also drop the auto grenade launcher if I remember right so it's definitely worth looting even if you have to chase the body outside the circle.
---
that's cool as heck. I wanna ride it.
---
Not if you've spent the time to go and find it,  1 cap per round is fair price though
---
I don't even know what to do with this information.
---
It was a 1 week event but is probably going to make a return at some point.
---
Random question.. How do you wear clothes from adventure I've seen other but I always just get the vault suit and no I don't mean armour
---
That isn't the point. The point is he made me realise I wasn't playing fo76 anymore but generic shooter #4. Not saying you are not allowed to enjoy it, just that personally I don't
---
I really hope so. Nuclear winter is where brainless pvp and leaderboards are. Survival mode should be a true open world pvp fallout experience with new characters free from dupes, no stupid leaderboards, maybe nox legendaries and hopefully some harsher mechanics and alliances (I'd love to rob some junk from stash, that locks would come in handy).
---
Right, thank you!
---
Oh but you can. I take the cores and mine them.
---
And jet was around before the war.
---
Gotta make excuses to make great things.
---
Sorry I don't watch YouTube trash. Maybe come up with your own response instead of linking trash videos.
---
Just for a week. Then when it officially releases ye.
---
So when I got damaged I enter a PA and everything is good again?
---
I think I've shown this one to you before. I posted this one a couple months ago and it's still around. The earliest i remember it happening was January.
---
You can also trigger it by teleporting with a melee VATS attack. I dont know if using a chair/workbench/bed etc would also work.
---
I had that happen on encrypid, there were quite a few lvl 100+ players on the server, and no one came. Imposter sheepsquatch killed me over and over for 8 minutes lol
---
This is 99.9% likely on your end not Bethesda or the game. Shouldn‚Äôt had on the game or come to a conclusion the game is shit without a little google search first
---
https://help.bethesda.net/app/answers/detail/a_id/42913/
---
Took me about 8 seconds to get this
---
Keep milking them a couple times a day.
---
You'll get the Survival Weekly weapon Salt of the Earth. Shhhhh ;)
---
It will no get removed they said so many players played it they will have it forever, start the game and look at the top right corner
---
I launched my first Nuke solo at around level 80 or so as I also thought it would be tough.  No showed up to help fight the queen though so I left her alone as a big bird of freedom.
---
Oh I didn't hear about that. Got a source ? :)
---
I feel like there needs to be a damage category. You gain xp for damage done.  Without changing the other xp gains this could make engaging more rewarding.
---
You can also do even more amazing things naked. I've been building my own stair cases into trees with wind chimes. then sit in a nice crevasse and go afk. consistent top 10. come 2nd 8 times. yet to win. I'm awful at shooters. without vats i cant do shit. Im 100% reliant on explosives basically.
---
Ahh ok cool didn't know that :)
---
Something to keep in mind when harvesting flux: it spoils quicker than anything else and turns into inert flux when spoiled. You can drink inert flux, it doesn't give you a disease, and it weighs slightly less than purified water. So it doesn't hurt to keep any leftover flux when it spoils
---
I qualify for everything except being 17+  whatever you will be missing out.
---
thanks üëçüèº
---
Really? I didn‚Äôt stay on the same server and completed it.
---
depends, if you're like 12 then I'm sure you know the answer.
---
Is a brand new game mode just added, it‚Äôs free, and it‚Äôs not even been a week.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs a bit crotchety.
---
I preordered it and stopped playing near christmas cuz i got bored. Once Wild appalachia started i came back and was impresed with how much they fixed and improved
---
Well don‚Äôt worry that‚Äôs not a bug on the PC version so go right ahead..
---
Hahaha, calm down dude.
---
I'm 14, I'm level 58 and have 130+ hours in the game.
---
Yes or share launch codes across a team..
---
Did you kill the ones that were marked already in these other servers too?
---
Damn I just started wish I run into people like u
---
*kills 10 bloated glowing ones and gets 1-star bolstering leather leg
---
This is a terrible idea.
---
I like it.
---
I would of accidentally ate him due to having cannibal
---
Nope.. I know because I did 2 in one day and then the third the next day.
---
Got two characters over 200. The game is amazing.
---
I did it at around level fifty by myself. It‚Äôs a complete ordeal and drains so much ammo, but it is pretty cool too.
---
It still made the sound. And as far as I'm aware stealth boys work in Power Armor. If they don't then why did the sound play.
---
good stuff. thanks
---
How much do they go for?
---
Perhaps I am just unlucky then!
---
Need a better build with some defense, it‚Äôs not the Tesla rifle being OP it‚Äôs you just trying to one shot everything with damage perks and not looking into much defense.
---
Yeah, you doing it solo? It only counts if you get in the killing blow/shot, not if you‚Äôve just contributed to the kill..
---
I had followed the steps on there and none of them helped as they related to software issue and not connectivity issues
---
Not everyone's thing but riflegaming has many video on YouTube where he covers the benefits and minuses of nuking certain locations, including the quantities of flux, and whether there are enough enemies to get the other needed ingrediants. The ones he did on the palace of the winding path and fort defiance are particularly good.
---
I‚Äôll check him out, thanks!
---
Yeah I killed all of them myself. Not even hostiles nearby.
---
Beth actually responded on another post regarding walls. I think they have something nice in store for us :D
---
 if I pass the xbox game pass I would love to :)
---
I've only lost resources to building because I scrap things instead of save them on accident sometimes. If there was a bug or glitch in 1k hours I haven't experienced it. 
---
  I have moved probably 100 times and rebuilt my camp in many places but I have recently kept coming back to my one spot near monongah. other places annoy me. Considering making my next camp look like a sideview of Fallout shelter Vault with a water room, dining area, and power room. doubt I'll keep it but it should be a fun build to try and get right. for me destroying everything and rebuilding is part of my endgame. Currently I have a pretty cool red rockety looking power armor garage. but it has grown stale so the fallout shelter look is next. 
---
   Its all in how much you enjoy it for me building is part of the game.
---
Dear god please Bethesda.
---
Why the fuck it took me 3 hours to build a fence around my fucking garden?
---
Why the fuck?
---
Submitting Technical Data to Camp Venture is one rare plan route I know of.
---
Ya, maybe you're right ....it's more of an express elevator!

There‚Äôs a search feature on their support page..
---
If you're lucky you might be able to find the plans and masks from the event for sale at player vendors
---
Yup your home screen top right corner.
---
*raises hand since beta*
---
And if all else fails send a support ticket
---
my blue prints never snap. annoying AF, I thought if I made them even smaller but I still cant seem to place prints even 1 foundation with 4 turrets on it.
---
I had to look that up. Now I have a new word in my vocabulary. Thank you.
---
I was finding it truly irritating when the endless stream of repetitive, inane posts that could have been condensed into three simple 'Megathreads':
---
\- What is my reward for playing this?
---
\- I am playing this and I love it. These devs are the best.
---
\- What end of the weapon goes where?
---
Dwarved the 'is it now a good time to come back' lark but now it has died out considerably and we can go back to business as usual.
---
Happy days.
---
every other game has text chat and allows chat window to be permanenty hidden or autohide.
---
You are only thinking on yourself here, and not even correctly as it wouldnt affect you if you didnt want to.
---
Also, if there is no text chat is mainly due to an US legislation, not your preference on voice chat.
---
I will make 1000 account on metacritic to give this game 10/10 if they listen to you and make hardcore mode.
---
ya that sounds like me too. damn near die, use up tons of ammo or break my fav melee weapon and get some stupid 1\* level 30 anti-bug leg armour that is below anything I'm wearing ...OR have stashed
---
It's basically five waves of low level scorched that you have to defeat in 15 minutes. You get event awards which sometimes includes a legendary armour piece, plus caps and xp. Then a cargo not drops more loot too. 
---
Don't worry about the scorchbeast that circles overhead as it isn't hostile. 
---
I've been doing this event to help level my new character and it's working lol.
---
Remove contents to new folder, rescan to new folder. That should work
---
I would really love to enter the atomic shop when I‚Äôm on, let‚Äôs say, a trip and ain‚Äôt around my PS.
---
Congrats!
---
I suspect things will get back to normal next week when the novelty has passed a bit lol
---
didn't know that paid off so well! Thanks (I ran it once and it gave me crap ...must've been an off day!)
---
no shit its my preference. I don't know why its not everyone's preference. voice chat is easier and simpler in every situation but a global chat. makes no sense why peeps want text chat when a mic is so much better. and this is coming from a guy who grew up on text chat. as much as you guys are wanting text chat we used to gripe about voice area chat. its nuts. you kids make no sense to me.
---
Even tho it doesn‚Äôt I always turn it off anyway üòÇ
---
Hmm sorry don‚Äôt know then :(
---
That's your first 5 scrip of the day then. Shits random. Dude ive been playing since beta and within the past month found my first Two shot Explosive weapon! Actually got a 2* Bloodied explosive combat shotty from the Purveyor, so I can confirm, there are actually decent drops in the game, Sometimes üòÇ lol
---
Same here, add a few random spawn locations I like to visit to that list.
---
Companions may help with some events like scorched earth or any event like that maybe.
---
Been here since beta... Been addicted the entire time
---
HUZZAH ! gj, hes a creepy dangerous little perv gj man.
---
What decor were you looking for and what platform are you on?  Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have any plans left but I can build some of the items for you if that‚Äôll help?
---
Could you link the thread
---
Same! I didn't play with the same zeal as FO4 when the game came out, not because it was buggy but I kept running into jerks. Survivor mode came out (gave the jerks someplace to go) and I started playing Explore for real again and loved it. Tried NW on a whim (bec I don't like the PvP shite) but ... here i am, loving it!
---
Hardest part I found were those assaultron. like most fights take mutiple weapons and plenty of ammo. also having hacker3/lockpick3 perk can speed things up. If you have any troubleshooter gear that can make you less of a bullet sponge. taking circuits and steel with you can speed up part with repairing circuit boards.
---
Been here since beta. Not going anywhere.
---
F3st3ringPlagu3 is my gt I'll probably be on for a good part of today, I'll have to find my mic though.
---
Smh
---
I‚Äôve stayed more over loyalty and because I love Fallout.
---
I still feel insulted that Bethesda charged me ¬£45 and shipped the game in the state it was. Also they dropped the price by half a week later and are still charging ridiculous amounts for the atom shop items. 
---
But i trust they‚Äôll make it better with enough time. Plus I used to sit on fallout 4 for hours making adjustments to my builds and I have literally just moved over to 76
---
That headphone bug happens in every game for me except Quake.
---
Sounds like your problem.
---
I suggest you stop unplugging those there headphones.
---
Also, this isn‚Äôt an issue in PS4 either.
---
76 playable content isn't free. At launch it was full triple A game price, now it's gone down because it's not in high demand because it was... what it was at release. It's still a paid game without a decent amount of content and what's there is pretty shallow anyways, on top of that they have a constantly rotating Atom Shop with tons of stuff that're semi-permanent.
---
A good comparison for this kinda thing is Sea of Thieves. The game launched in an iffy state, not nearly as bad as Fallout 76 and they didn't have microtransactions in the game, and still don't a year later. They will have one, but they're adding it when they feel the game is in a good place with plenty to offer. Meanwhile Fallout 76 launches full price in a joke of a state and has a fully fledged microtransation shop with more consistent updates to that than the game itself.
---
Raises hand. Only even was really upset with Bethesda for one thing (But boy can I rant about it), the repair kits. To be fair, I expect a janky running game from them, it just never has stopped me from enjoying what I like about their games. So not sure why people expected any different from them.
---
Pre-ordered the xbox/76 bundle. I've enjoyed it.
---
I am really superstitious about that fight though
---
Bethesda twitter:  [https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1139554707763093506](https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1139554707763093506)
---
got some got photos out of it
---
Awesome! Wish I‚Äôd seen that..
---
I believe you get Brotherhood of Steel Power Armor skins for the T60 but it's really rare.
---
I loved game from beta and still playing
---
This is way too true. I'm sure we're not the only people thinking this!
---
I don't play everyday like i did at launch or BETA, mainly due to real life and other games I play. But I do try log when I can even if just to check store for free items. Currently on around 400-500 hours played and on 2nd character, levelling is a lot slower these days but that's not a totally bad thing, levelling was insanely easy at launch.
---
But what about the constant punching?
---
The assests are in the game so it would be silly not to monetise them.
---
They will put them on 'ice' to give those whoe purchased them a vague sense of exclusivity and create desire and expectation for their return then they will bring them back during a 'dry period' of new asset availability.
---
Td;dr: Yes, they will.
---
Good on you! 
---
Been here since day one as well. Got around 630 hrs into the game and I just hit level 146.. oops?
---
I didn't mind having a human companion except I'd have to give up dogmeat. When I built a computer for Fallout 4VR and discovered the joy of mods (PS4 before, you had very limited mods o that), one of the first I installed was the one that let me have dogmeat as well as one other companion.
---
Yeah the only problem right now is the Tesla, a solo guy destroyed my whole team in seconds and won the match using that fucking thing and we didn't even have time to react, it needs a nerf asap.
---
Yup, never left, been playing since launch. Still going now and I love it!
---
Ha ha, thank ya, hope to see ya in game. I purchased it
---
Tanks the shit out of weaker guns. Pipe rifles and smgs do pretty much nothing, was able to take on 2 guys and survive.
---
Yup over here (waves hand enthusiastically)
---
Been playing since the closed stress test, never stopped
---
Stay ahead of the leveling curve, that way you can just go past the laser grids and avoid the aggression
---
Exactly what I've been thinking. He was in fo4 so he might have come back for 76.
---
Also his aim was just plain bad.
---
Nuke White Springs if you are going to nuke and not kill the SBQ.
---
If you are just killing mobs to farm then that‚Äôs the best way to go. 
---
Prime isn‚Äôt as good of a nuke zone unless you want to kill SBQ or farm violet flux.
---
Thanks anyway!
---
Yeah that's what I'm trying currently
---
been playing since release day but I also play other games, i‚Äôm about level 50 on ps4 and 30 on pc (:
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs not as satisfying as actually taking down another player, is it? TBF, that‚Äôs pretty much how I‚Äôve made it to level 18, certainly hasn‚Äôt been on kills..
---
New players are great for my vending machine. I don't have much high levels would care for (cept maybe a little flux or hard/glowing masses). But I have a lot of stuff newer players might want (healing stuff, ammo, food) and I don't overcharge for those (I only purposely overcharge for one thing, faschnaght (sp?) plans).  I tried one time to put together a really nice sniper rifle for a newbie (with mods they probably wont find/afford for a while) but I had to put it so cheap it wasn't worth it to do it again :(. And the kid who bought it spent all his caps on it (I swear it was like 20-40 caps) and begged me for ammo for it.
---
  
---
Too bad I won't be back from vacation until a week or so.
---
Doesn't have to be adventure mode this happens in survival as well
---
I love it when that happens, you feel like you've accomplished somthing helping someone out
---
Pre-order gang
---
It's not as satisfying but dont you want that PA skin?
---
I got it at launch, well within the first weekish, I've loved it such a day one. Cannot wait for the next big change! New quests and npcs. Fucking jazzed mate.
---
Oh yeah working my way to it, but don‚Äôt want NW to just be a grind for more cosmetics..
---
Ghoul Skin Texture, just copy paste from Fallout 4.  This is all i want, no matter the atoms i pay.
---
They are Nuclear bombs of course they are  overpowered!!
---
Same as me ive yet to launvh a nuke 
---
Troed solo a while back but ran out of ammo 
---
Im from ireland so time might be a prob 
---
Think my gt is swiftie505
---
My camp is perfect except for a single small floor piece sticking out the side of the wall, doing absolutely nothing.
---
But I can't remove it of course, because "PaRt of tHe STruCtURe wOULd Be iNaCcessIble"
---
Bitch the piece itself is inaccessible.
---
Played since Beta, can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs coming next!
---
Been since day one here, the game is darn fun to play especially with friends.
---
I'm only level 76 due to having to maintain my destiny 2 character.
---
This is a NW related post lol
---
I've got a full edition pre-order of BF5 sitting, waiting on me.  I think they launched a week apart, and all my time is over here....
---
Can't believe i have to point that out but it's more about immersion than being scared or whatever is implied.
---
Look mate, as far as i know there was no alliance or annexion between *fallout* China and *fallout* Japan - therefore it's not me being scared it's you being wrong about culture. But thats fine.
---
On top of that let me tell ya - if we get chinese stealth gear, that would be awesome and as far it concernes immersion, with Mama Dolce we would have a great existing set up for it.
---
But if you really, really insist that samurai gear deserves to be in game gear because China is part of the game then i vote for german dirndl and lederhosen or a french beret because of the swiss related town Helvetia. 
---
Both close enough yet so far apart.
---
I went one up and got power armour edition. I don't regret decision one bit. was annoying to see price drop so fast, but I have more than got my money worth, having clocked well over 400 hours in game.
---
I personally agree about Tricentennial edition wasn't worth the upgrade over the original. the weapon skins were for weapons ( 10 mm Pistol, Hatchet, and Laser Rifle ) that you barely use outside the first few levels due to everything else being better. Power armour skin is decent but a lot better one to use for every PA type, would take the free nuka skins you get in game over them. the posters and outfit probably only thing people would use in later levels.
---
This sounds like my life...level 64 beta starter right here üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I actually hate having to wait that long in Vault 51 eveytime. But maybe you should be able to join a Vault 51 lobby where you can walk around as long as you want (kind of like the COD WW2 HQ); explore, create blueprints (it feels weird having to go to adventure mode and having to scrap half of my CAMP in order to make some NW blueprints) etc. 
---
Then one of the Vault boy cardboard cutouts could have a ‚Äújoin game‚Äù feature.
---
I'm with you. Get over your insecurities and get a damn mic already people!
---
It says I have 2/5 survival challenges complete but none are checked off and iv'e never played survival lol.
---
Happening to a friend and I quite often. AMD cards.
---
Even a pip boy companion app like Fallout 4 had would do
---
Tesla rifle is too strong. It's defeated without doing anything. First of all, the Tesla rifle is too strong in the survival mode. Have Bethesda test players fought against stealth boy and Tesla rifle players? It's a one-sided slaughter. You should lower base damage for Tesla rifle.
---
Damn literally exactly what I was looking for but I‚Äôm in the US lol have fun though!
---
Same here. Have never set foot in survival. Says I have 2/5 but only 1 is ticked off in the list.
---
I think we could still play but may be a challenge with the time difference as I only get to play in the evenings UK time
---
RaisingHand.gif
---
F
---
Reviving in PA is a mess.
---
So you want longer to explore the vault but then contradict the matchmaking times
---
I'm okay with the long load times if it means better stability for the match. I am more survival too, but this PVP mode is way more leveled out and helps me work on my aiming. I'm enjoying it.
---
Why in the world did you ever think the bunkers were hard, they are child's play
---
bought that game end of november, because a friend of mine wanted to play it but not alone. Now i'm lv 178 and i play it more than my buddy with lv 102, although i never was that much of a fallout can. :)
---
Yep, it‚Äôs happening to a friend and I like clockwork. The odd thing is that I played the game a bunch on release and never had the issue. Pretty frustrating.
---
Never left and have been playing it almost everyday since release.
---
I have God of war and red dead 2 since Christmas and have hardly played them lol
---
My girlfriend managed it solo at level 43 with excavator power armour. Though by the end she had no ammo and weapons left.
---
Played the beta then red dead till full release nothing else since.
---
2 days ago, a team mate, me and another guy left (so, total 3 player).
---
We started to build a fortress, inside the very middle of the ring, so we were safe. Then we heard a sound: nuke. We can not move out from the fortress, so we died. The last guy survived, a tiny, tiny portion of the map was the safe zone... where he stood.
---
Well played!
---
Wait untill you have to go into a nuke zone and the final 2 people are in hazmat suits can you say bye Felicia PA and a 50. Cal for the W they never stood a chance
---
I left after completing the main story back when the game launched. I have no desire to return to the game because even with bugs fixed and new story-content the game is just not for me. I'm actually revisiting Skyrim right now. After modding it in 2019 it's incredibly solid and much deeper storywise than fo76.
---
Good deal.
---
I bought my copy from the same place
---
Yes, thats true and not even hard. If your team know how to survive, then you get a ton of xp.
---
That‚Äôs very nice of you man.
---
I'm just not keen on battle modes, although they do have to be there. I just want paint etc for adventure mode, more clothes and world bosses in Adventure would be nice. At the moment I see the Sheepsquach event once a week (if that) and the same with SBQ. So this NW DLC hasn't really benefited me, apart from a nice Powder Jumpsuit
---
Personally I think in AM you should be allowed to claim a workshop but not lock anything, so everyone can use it on the server if they want to come by and get some fusion cores or uranium ore etc
---
Sames. In it from BETA, but only 300ish hours, and about to hit lvl 80. I guess I spend too much time futzing with my camp and taking pictures. Love the daily and weekly challenges, too.
---
I had the same experience, but it's worth the wait. If you can just use a secondary frame to get around Appalachia in this way you're stronger and your carry weight improves.
---
Been here since beta, loved every minute, level 436 and level 78, 1600 hours in
---
When is that supposed to?
---
I am a filthy casual myself and apparently i have been luckier than you.
---
I play for two months now and had only one "negative" encounter with an other player on my journey from 1 to 50.
---
In my experience this game and its community is super tame and friendly compared to other titles in this genre.
---
Nuclear Winter is a godsend for the casuals because we don't have the time to risk loosing junk, caps, camp resources in the normal pvp fashion but in NW we can just jump in for a round or two without consequences for the "Apocalyptic Sims" mode character ;-)
---
Level up yourself and fight him or just leave them be. Those places are made to be fought over.
---
Holy crap!!! I went to bed thinking I made a casual post about loving the game. This escalated quickly! It's amazing to see how many people hung in there!
---
LOL Allfather give me sight!
---
Yes, team up. I like defending workshops.
---
Yeah my friends have tried getting me into them and even bought me PubG and I've got more time in NW then all the others put together
---
If you want to sell them, or give them away. There are *plenty* of reasons why.
---
Nah, it is just the "new toy". Give it a week or two and it will balance out. I for my self played almost exclusive NW but am now "sated" and coming back to adventure.
---
I will always appreciate Fallout 76 for its environment. Very beautiful. But good lort. It needs NPCs. Maybe character choices like Fallout 2. It seems Fallout lost its soul after 2. New Vegas was close. But each Fallout after 2 seemed to take more away.
---
Nope, that's a rad storm. The nuke you'd die like in minutes if not seconds from radiation if you didn't have power armor on or a radiation suit. And it's more an orange hue. And you would die instantly if you were there when the bombs hit.
---
I‚Äôve never thought of that - that would be so convenient! As it is I have a little checklist I‚Äôve made myself, but an integrated app would be so much better.
---
yeah it really feels like some vault tech simulation like we are all those pod people who keep dieing over and over because of a vault tech crazy ai
---
I just wanted cool gear.
---
Just sneak when you're there and it will save you from 95% of encounters.
---
Same!
---
Challenge completed here on different servers with more than one character. Did you definitely get the killing blow as that's what counts?
---
That's very impressive!
---
hey I was enchanted by my first legendary (hugs it) my precious.....
---
Was looking for this comment, with even a decent gear set you can solo a nuke zone for like 2 stimpaks and 200 5.56 ammo haha
---
Been playing since beta.
---
You should take some moremetamucil, g-pa. Your constipatuon is making you fussy.
---
pray to rngezus for the frog legs and goat legs perks.
---
they make getting around so incredibly fun.
---
It's quite easy to play on your own. There are a few events that won't be so easy but usually you can just join in with others if they are there (like the sheepsquatch one which will gaurentee to have some one else there cause I think it has to be started by some one to occur). Most people in the game (adventure mode at least) are pretty friendly (one of my favorite things about it). NOt sure how easy it is to get people to join you for quests.
---
As for repeatability, I don't know. I am 500 hours in and only now getting close to finishing the main quest.
---
Don‚Äôt cheat. Sucks to suck.
---
Psst, *whispering* even in adventure mode?
---
I do too.
---
I don't want this, but I want you to have it less.
---
I feel really bitchy when I do it tho, lol.
---
its the responder commander at morgan town airport
---
Here here
---
Level 174 and been playing since launch, pretty much daily, and I don‚Äôt see myself leaving this game anytime soon. I love it!!
---
Clearly there is a solution to the  band. Add a box of tomatos at the back of the room. Let people fling tomatoes at the band, with an accompanying animation for said  baders dodging, or not so dodging the soaring vegetables
---
they also didn't die to radiation it was the scorch virus and they are messing with you lols

Grab an utter and squeeze üòÄüòÄüòÄ

I don't think many BR games have text chat (on PC at least).  I've played many hours of PUBG and there's no text chat, and unless apex legends has changed recently (which it may have) it didn't have text chat on PC either. I haven't played fortnite so I can't speak to that with certainty, but I don't believe the PC version of that has text chat either. I don't think it's as prevalent  a feature as you think it is in BR games (again, at least on PC).  Am I mistaken? 
---
There's nothing wrong with wanting or requesting a feature, but arguing that all these other BR games have it and so should fallout is incorrect I think. Maybe every other BR game out there, except these 3 I mentioned, have it, and I'm the misinformed one.
---
yeah but in a real fallout it would be turn based top down rpg
---
Then we're already two of that kind.
---
The only thing i just want to add that it should fit into the World with all it's lore and story.
---
You seem to have a strange interest in the sexual habits of these other players. It's always very creepy to see people making reference to other players' sexuality and sexual experience when talking about interactions in video games
---
Sorry bro, but i would really prefer to bring back some fallout to fallout. 
---
I want to see more wasteland post-apocalyotic stuff or something completely new. Maybe something with the cultists, they seem unique for Fo76
---
That would be meüòé
---
Thank you! Wish i could upvote more than once...
---
Yeah the way you go in to that event is horrendous. It gives no indication that the questline is over and you're about to do something suicidal.
---
Hand raised. *raises hand*
---
As a new player events need a level indicator on them, it's impossible to tell what events are end game and what events are easy unless you've tried them before
---
\*raises hand\*
---
Love the game, got it 2 weeks after launch. The only time I'm not playing this is when I feel more like some rounds of Star Wars Battlefront 2.
---
I love that feeling the first time I came out of no where killed enemies stimpacked 3 people back from the brink then jumped off a cliff disappearing into the irradiated fog made me feel like the mysterious strangers less successful cousin
---
Pretty ugly fight sums it up right. I feel for the poor people I see starting that event. Sometimes people at level 50 or even lower.
---
Well, I'm glad it turns out you were wrong about the same server thing. Which means it was what I suspected, the game is really bad about acknowledging you killing big creatures (and it's reliably bad... this daily/weekly never seems to have worked for me cause of that).
---
I've noticed something in games. Everyone who is higher level/better then you is a loser virgin. And everyone who is lower level/worse then you is a pathetic loser.
---
Since the beginning
---
Been here since launch. Used to go into r/fallout and combat all the crap they gave the game. Still a ton of die hard haters over there but a ton of them have either switched to this sub or changed thier tune.
---
Two weeks I was able to get the survival challenge without ever going in it so I figured it was a consistant. Then it seemed they fixed it... guess it's a random bug since it seems to be showing up again.
---
My bad, it was like 3AM when I wrote this
---
There is actually a basket full of Tatos on the balcony overlooking the band - they just need to make it interactable ^_^
---
I have almost all the plans on PS4  but I'm not reasonable priced on them (not even close honestly, think around 1000 caps, more or less depending on how desirable I think the plan is).  If you have one you really really really want and don't mind paying an exhorbant amount, I'll be back in a week and a half (I usually only put one out until it sells but I'm open for offering a specific request). I might be out of one or two of them (I think the recipe ones I've managed to sell but I won't know until I get back).
---
Never left since day one
---
I played since launch. Not on every day but do play a fair bit when I am on! Still learning new stuff every day! üòÉ
---
I‚Äôm really excited for this! I‚Äôve been really into the roleplaying aspect since I started (mostly... by myself, but...) so the concept of people with dialogue trees and romance (!!!) is catnip for me.
---
This happens when their arms get broken. K have a picture of it as well super funny.
---
I'm one of those newbies having trialled the game, and then having bought it. Had a blast, and the community around it is fantastic. I take my party hat off to you all!

It's quieter than ESO's menu music! That shit is deafening!
---
servers are not location based. They are cloud based I play from Asia and get minimal lag. It's likely an issue with your ISP.
---
Definitely, apparently it's not the first time it's happened either. Not sure if it's relevant or not but I'm on Xbox.

One point of this gamemode is that it's you who is being tested and not the quality of your RNG skills; when people win NW it's not always because they found a god-tier gun at the beginning of the game and stuck with it the whole way through
---
happened to me 0 times but it made my friend (free trial) quit and call it a shit game thats not optimized
---
Yeah totally agree with all of that! The only thing I really use is the PA skin but I just use my BoS PA now anyway so it‚Äôs kinda redundant although I‚Äôm sure I will end up using it again. 
---
I toyed with the idea of getting the PA edition and by the time I‚Äôd decided to get it it was sold out :( at least you get some sweet merch with that and not just in game stuff. The tricentennial in game content just wasn‚Äôt worth the extra ¬£30
---
That makes sense actually lmao
---
Does it ding for a teammate or all kills?  There‚Äôs definitely an audio alert when a teammate kills someone
---
Count me in. I'll take day off work just to do that, not even joking :p
---
Almost level 42 here, killed less than 20 people... I hate pvp, just not a good shooter, I rely on VATS waaaay to much in game with my sniper build, it‚Äôs like op said, placement and time in-game XP! How often you see people spawning at popular buildings only to die in the first 10 seconds and then having to wait 5mins for another game?
---
I saw some one who built his camp there so he'd have a reliable pet there. I almost thought of doing it myself but it's not in a good place for a vending machine (and I really like where I am too but having a cat is super tempting).
---

My little experience was chasing after a Level 3, who was being chased by the Grafton Parade Monster, had to run quite a ways outside grafton to catch up to and engage the Grafton Monster. Pulled the Aggro, but i don't know what happened to the level 3 in the aftermath. Didn't see him in the local area or the map , final sighting was his tag over the hill
---
Yes, I would love this! Something that takes the mouthpiece armor slot, maybe? I‚Äôd love to run around shooting shit with a cigar just hanging out of my mouth.
---
I hate the bunker, it‚Äôs boring, at least for me.
---
First impressions matter, something Bethesda should be fully aware of, and Fallout 76 had a very, very bad one. That shit sticks.
---
Same thing happening to me
---
Matchmaking is before you even go into the vault
---
You should try to make reason in your life, not excuse your decisions away
---
Not sure, but survival mode has been a ghost town all week.  I‚Äôve logged in on three different occasions and automatically landed as #1 on the list.  I like the game mode but hate being circled on the map.
---
Thats way more hassle, and I don‚Äôt feel like remembering UrMumMade911-69 over and over.
---
The ‚ÄúKeep playing as team‚Äù is an option in Rainbow 6 Siege... and thats much, much easier. Its a PTA to type everyone‚Äôs names in, and I don‚Äôt necessarily feel sending friend requests and like having 100 friends who‚Äôs names I‚Äôm not going to remember. Neither does the person I‚Äôm sending the request to.
---
I‚Äôve been seeing them all week, they‚Äôre good for the game and bad for sales.
---
Congrats on the run and finishing her with a few people.
---
Change the explosive legendary effect on energy weapon's to the burning effect from fallout 4 that's missing from this game, problem solved
---
PS4
---
Did someone at your work showed up after the indefinite suspension and arguing about it was not their fault, blame others or blame the Company for stick to their guidelines?
---
Yeah you're probably right about the servers being over loaded. Hopefully after the free week it will be back to "normal"
---
Yeah I see the same stuff. Been playing since launch and putting feedback out there and the game has come a long way! I think once this next update comes out with NPC's I'd say Bethesda has fully redeemed themselves for the most part if they haven't already.
---
People say the same about No Man's Sky and have either never played it, or never read patch notes and gave it another shot. People do what they think will make them look cool and get attention so they hop on that bandwagon.
---
I found mine at the Tea Pot - [there's a list](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgkq7y/tourist_location_masterpost/)
---
THIS. I have a stairway and two floor pieces just standing out in the front yard because they can't be scrapped, stored, or moved. ü§¨
---
Maybe u want Play together? Seems like a fun guy. MaarifaPL lvl 9 :)
---
But why? The game is completely different now. New game modes etc are not even included in those reviews. Should be similar to the Apple App Store where new iterations are able to get reviewed again, at least periodically imho. Year two is going to be a drastic shift in this game. Basically every complaint has been addressed at this point plus some.
---
You met your maker on your own terms, not theirs
---
Circle jerks have no real reasoning
---
I started last week very happy. All the guides seem to be outdated tho so I'm having to learn as I go. (Not a bad thing just saying)
---
Thanks for the master post.
---
I think it's based alot on very personal experience as well. My two best friends used to play but encountered every game breaking bug under the sun, so they quit. I have been playing since beta and experience almost no bugs at all, so I totally understand why some people hold this game so low. I still think it's a very fun game with some very rough edges and questionable microtransactions, but a solid game nonetheless
---
The way they are implementing humans coming back to the region we cleaned up is pretty neat
---
I‚Äôve gotten so much scrutiny from my friends for liking this game and they never even played it. They think their 5 second google search for the meta score means they know everything about it. Have loved every second of exploring Appalachia (from West Virgina), meeting new people, building my camp, slowing improving my character, and jumping instead of attaching a wire!
---
Right here man
---
He, who laughs last....
---
Gotta watch out for that Appalachili
---
I never left this reddit ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. But the game glitches out oddly at my CAMP and I lost everything so I haven‚Äôt played since.  It actually happened while ‚Äúshowing the game off to a friend.‚Äù  I‚Äôll come back and try again...
---
I met my end when i pulled the trigger and proceeded to pepper the walls instead of the dweller target, i know that pain. Ambushed him while he was trying to hide too sadly
---
Man... last night my buddy and I were teamed up, and started 3 of them in Flatwoods and I was in the military camp... I metal geared my way to them but they all got iced. Guess what? The circle was back where I came from. Took a couple potshots but remained as hidden as I could in my power armor. As I was heading away from flatwoods a nuke dropped. When one of the final circles was coming, ANOTHER NUKE!!! It wiped out a generous amount of people, but I decided to hunker down while a scorchbeast was out. I found this building that was pitch black! One way in/out and stairs that go up with a perfect view of the door. Found loot inside and had plasma mines and a nade launcher and the guy bum rushed in when I hit him with the launcher. Pulled my handmade rifle out and deep sixed him. That was definitely an intense game of hide and seek and my only time seeing nukes dropped. It's a cool feature to get people to move.
---
Joined before 2 weeks. Loved it from the start
---
Are you surprised?
---
Confirmed
---
I was watching Shroud play Fallout 76 BR but I must of missed that part. I really want to see that now.
---
I have never left but not because of BR. I go online to buy NSell items and help out random players to get their major quests done.
---
Thank you :D
---
Crouch while shooting. If you fire while standing, it's your own fault at this point.
---
It‚Äôs not an issue on Xbox either. Sometimes you may need to plug/unplug on older controllers but never need to do full on reset. Not an issue with the game.
---
Happening to a friend and I. I use to play the game with another friend all the time back on release, and never had this issue. After coming back to the game, it's crashing when I'm playing with my buddy nearly everytime I left-click on his icon to try to fast travel.
---
Been playing since the B.E.T.A.  Still loving it.
---
I hear you! I spend far too much time in my camp cooking and sorting my stash! I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs not just me!
---
I never had the issue on release, but came back to the game to play with a friend who is new. Nearly everytime we try to tp to eachother on the map, it crashes. Really hoping for a fix.
---
I love Fallout with a passion so I just felt like I couldn't give it up. Just a rocky launch and couple of months but it smoothed out.
---
I‚Äôve been a fallout fan since the first one. Although this game had has its low, I just love fallout way too much to not like it. But the game is really getting better by the day. So I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve been here since day one.
---
Just get it and queue up with friends, it's tons of fun
---
I'm finding that if you ditch the blue vault suit you can hide much better üòÅ
---
In settings tab there is a system update section
---
People still play it. There's been a new flux of people with the Nuclear Winter.
---
Pro tip.
---
Nuke whitesprings first. Get all your glowing and hardend masses, high tax fluids.
---
THEN nuke the spot to gather flux.
---
I think that's called Fallout 4...  üòâ
---
Got this game free with a new console for my wife about 4 months ago and we have both loved the game ever since
---
It never use to happen to me when I played for like a month on release. I came back to play with a friend who's new, and we're both experiencing the issue now when tp'ing to eachother on the map. I'm aware of the friendlist workaround, but this is just frustrating.
---
I've been playing as often as my busy home life allows me to, it's a wonderful game.
---
yeah ^^^
---
 I wouldn't be such a coward during the match if the loading/lobby times weren't so brutal
---
LOL just spanked 9 END on Ghoulish as I have zero DPS cards ... at level 30 FFS.
---
If they‚Äôre only coming to you for ammo, then no.
---
Fun, but feels a little grubby doesn't it ;)
---
Rad storms have a new sound to them as well. I like it. Sounds badass.
---
Or atleast a cooldown on fast travel if not a owned location or friend
---
True, people can look at it as being ‚Äúcowardly‚Äù, but me for it‚Äôs just smart play, it would literally take forever at the moment to rank up for me to play with a more aggressive style.
---
If by raising your hand I hope you mean giving an upvote
---
I would absolutely drop atoms on this, omg.
---
For reference you add this to your "Fallout76Custom.ini" file. Still has a loudass sound when you click "any button" but no loud music, is a godsend and should be a default option!
---
I was overweight for literally at least for months...no fast travel concerns and I was neat seeing places I hadn't been in a while but it was hard to do events, specifically the queen, without it.
---
in the simulation, you can have your pie but you cannot eat it
---
I raise my hand, but playing the battle royale gamemode makes me angry.
---
I really only play solo (unless i forget to target it when the game crashes), and ive won twice, but im almost always in the top 4 with 2-3 kills.
---
The best part is that im free to just cut&amp;run at the first sign of trouble without feeling bad. Plus, no sharing loot. By the final zone ive got a dozen+ extra stimpaks, and enough drugs and ammo to bring the CIA to my door. Unless its a squad of 3, ive got a fighting chance at just grinding them down and spamming heals.
---
Fast travel is convenient especially when you are on the other side of the map and someone launches a nuke on prime. Having already explored everywhere and done everything, I just don't feel like walking long distances to my destination. Also, I equip the Travel Agent perk card to reduce my travel cost. But it all just comes down to if you don't want to fast travel, don't fast travel.
---
Yeah,  even a cooldown would be an easy implementation... not a bad idea. 
---
Anything to make the game feel more adventure and less "teleport-kill-teleport-kill" is good to me.
---
the .45 SMG is pretty good against power armor. But the automatic laser rifle does absolutely fuck all, somebody survived like 12 shots from it
---
Loving this game has been a bit of a one sided, abusive relationship. 
---
Let's pat ourselves on the back for being stupid enough to stick it out lol.
---
It‚Äôs inside the museum at the Philippi Battlefield Cemetery! In one of the display boxes, I think.
---
Yes I have a sunroof because the last roof tile intersects with an existing object.
---
I pull up youtube and sit my cell by me...  lots of fallout mixes on there
---
Brother, I played this game since launch but I really go into it during Wild Appalachia, like playing it everyday and getting my charter leveled up very fast. During that "Event" of sorts I leveled 40 times and now i'm almost level 80 so yeah. Also I've always loved this game i'ts just so fun to play for me.
---
The funniest ones are the ones where the person makes up how buggy it is just for karma.
---
Every day this week I try to give at least one noob a full set of pocketed armor, a gun, ammo, a serrated machete, stimpacks, disease cures, and 2 vintage nukashines.  The last thing is an escape potion if they find themselves in trouble.
---
In a real fallout game, you'd only have 180 game days to find a water chip, and you'd spend the first hour trying to punch rats (but missing) in a cave.
---
NPCs are coming back soon though and it looks like it should be a really interesting quest line, fingers crossed on them reviving the Enclave and BOS.
---
I agree with the more frequent crashes. And I dont really care for multiplayer. While I very much enjoy Fallout 76, I feel that bethesda's letting down the core Fallout fans. Again, I love this game. I just feel they missed the mark by quite a bit. Thankfully,  its not as bad as ESO
---
Usually played the games for some days then stoped playing it until the next update came out. But is playing it non stop now to try and keep up with the big wastelanders update.
---
Aah didn't know it, thanks!
---
I got credit for 2 of the 5 tasks simply by milking a brahmin twice without entering survival.
---
I think youre right. I believe one of us scouts actually have to go to the camp to trigger it. Also right about not many people doing it. Completed it several times this week and all of them have ended up being solo.
---
You do get a squad, so there is some co-op.  Hoping NW gets some more story or co-op potential beyond just being a slug fest.
---
But yeah, more fun than anticipated.  I have never played battle royal more than 3xs, but the fallout one is more fun.  Only lvl 4 tho
---
Yeah, I saw that. There was a drunk group in the crowd whooping at everything.
---
Been playing with just one other buddy til last night, yeah when we were both shooting the enemy it seemed like he always got the kill, I wasn‚Äôt salty until last night when we got 2 more.
---
Holy crap, I got 2 kills over the course of 4 hours, but I probably did 40+% of the damage.  No one was intentionally kill stealing we just worked cohesively and one person fired the last shot.
---
We need one of 2 things:
---
1: shares do for kills, maybe that share based on damage done?
---
2: xp for damage.
---
Please?
---
imo they should come up with something in the wastelanders dlc
---
my idea would be to disable fast travel but use the trainstations as caravan stops were you can pay caravans to take you with them as a fast travel option
---
there could be interesting options as well like two or three vertibot stations were you can buy one way tickets for vertibirts that hover over the location you want to fast travel to and you can drop from the vertibot
---
maybe even some crazier things like one or two coaches pulled by a tamed megasloth you know theres plenty of interesting ways to implement this heck maybe even the railway that goes through the savage divide could be repaired
---
thanks brother ! , took it   a lot but I managed to do üòéit finally !
---
Please, no more PvP. We already have two game modes focused around it. I'm having fun with NW, but I really want some good PvE content.
---
Playing since beta. Lvl 102. Still haven't launched one.
---
It‚Äôs got me this far!
---
Unfortunately backpacks can‚Äôt be traded or dropped. So your only option is to do the quest for it.
---
Forget the beta, I‚Äôve been here since the stress test!
---
PS4 here so maybe?
---
Im pretty sure they are talking about npc:s as in the people you interact with.
---
I would consider hostile raiders/settlers just mobs, and you can even see in the trailer people shooting raiders out in the open.
---
And unfortunately that is why Survival is just a no-go for almost everyone that‚Äôs A) not suicidal B) not a masochist C) not doing a weekly or D) one of the OP people you mentioned
---
Cults. Unique. Not seeing the Children of Atom as a Cult 
---
*something seems fishy here...*
---
And sprinting.
---
Yeah, it's definitely more of a coop weapon. My experience is you die with it but the next person meeting your target has an easy kill
---
I feel ya, which is why I suggested things like vertibot travel grenades.   
---
It would totally suck walking everywhere,  especially once you've done it all... and at your level you could have a whole stock pile and never worry about walking I'm sure. 
---
I can respect people liking it the way it is,  though.   Maybe "hardcore survival mode" could be a thing and that do away with at-will fast travelling.  Id be okay with that at least.
---
That‚Äôs a shame. Thanks for the insight though. I‚Äôm totally up for the quests. Would just be more fun and a little easier at a low level with a friend though... üò¢üòÑ
---
Nope, PC
---
The hardest part will be finding the camera. Once you got that you can compete quite a few challenges.
---
I'm able to control most of these weapons at long range, like the handmade and .45 SMG are good enough for sniping. But with the radium rifle I can't hit anybody at any range.
---
Would definitely like some more apocalyptic looking walls, everything sorta sticks out in the world.
---
Need some floor panels that aren't made of wood either. Must be some strong fucking 2x4 to hold up Power Armor stomping around it!
---
I just loot everything and sell it. Junk, weapons, food, chems.
---
I don't know, should you?
---
sounds like you would like Survival
---
Most of the people hating on the game have been doing it since before it was even launched. Taking a traditionally single player RPG and doing an online only, multiplayer iteration has proven to be quite divisive. The rough launch added fuel to that fire and further entrenched negative opinions‚Äîdespite the many improvements since. 
---
People don‚Äôt like to be wrong and they don‚Äôt like to change their minds. Online echo chambers only further perpetuate this kind of thing.
---
Yes, yes it would.
---
Is another of those 'cumulative' bugs that contribute to the feeling of being ground down over an extended period of time.
---
I do or I could sell you 1 with 50 + limb damage for 500
---
Good to know the hate train is alive and well, sadly it‚Äôll stay alive until a new Fallout is released that they can go complain about
---
True.   I don't want to completely do away with fast travel, and getting to events might even be a good thing to keep it activated for.  Haven't really thought about that aspect to it.
---
I just feel like it might enrich the gaming experience a little by at least limiting it a bit.
---
Hmm, I think I'll pass on the offer. So you can help? My name is the same as on reddit
---
You can still fast travel in survival can't you?
---
Already tried finding one in a few places that were stated online. No luck yet. Done some of the exam tests already in areas I think I‚Äôll be able to complete the quickest and easiest. Waiting on some friends to re-install 76 so we can all play together again.
---
Maybe you ought to make your own decisions
---
Seriously, Imposter is literally a quest given to you by a quest line so it makes it sound like it‚Äôll be a walk in the park, but god it‚Äôs ridiculous if you‚Äôve never heard anything about it.
---
Do you actually have to have those in you character inventory?  Everything else I ever repair, I do so with no junk on me, just in my stash.
---
I would love to have my character‚Äôs name actually be used, or visible. Poor Charity :(
---
The problem is some of them (encryptid, free range) were added fairly recently during wild appalachia, and it was targeted towards those of us who are very high level with good legendary gear. So you can walk around the map finding events, and one of them will require you to fetch some insect parts, the next will want you to fight a level 80 legendary sheepsquatch
---
It has a use of stopping players in slightly less than half a second, lol
---
to hubs, which was one of your suggestions.  I figured you hadn't played it yet because what you describe for the most part is Survival...
---
Sorry, i'm not a native speaker. I meant the cultists we have in Fo76 are unique to Fo76 and have their own lore and look. 
---
The Children of Atom are cool but they won't be around for a while.
---
I feel bad for those over 50, I have yet to see a successful attempt even with several people over lvl 100.
---
Dude i just wanted to know HOW you fixed it...never mind
---
Initially I was put off by the game after playing all the games Fallout 3-onward, but it's growing on me. I started looting everything in new locations and it's helping with some of my gripes I had. Mostly the item degradation. I went into the game blind and had been trying to learn the ropes. Now that I'm more comfortable with it, it's been fun.
---
I did a video of me and a friend doing this during the beta, he bugged out too which is a real shame! Still cool to be among the very first being only 3 hours into the beta!
---
Are you having trouble with the discover locales challenges? For example Cranberry Bog. I have 4/5 the last is Cranberry Glade but no matter how many times I visit there it won't give me the atoms. I've also been there with my 2nd character but it still hasn't worked.
---
I've gotta hand it to the Fallout series; they have some of the most dedicated fans out there.
---
I never wanted PvP mixes in with my PvE, but having a separate mode is fun. Instead of penalties for dying, I am getting gold and XP that carries over. And it doesn‚Äôt feel like PvP designed for eSports. It feels far more casual and even has builds.
---
Doesn't happen all of the time, but I have noticed this at white springs because I usually clear the enemies and do a loot sweep afterwards. Noticed half of the bodies doing this.
---
Play almost every night for 7 months
---
Maybe I should check it out.   I was under the impression it was just a pvp mode,  which I wasn't so much into.
---
You know what sucks, that they will left the other game modes uncared, and all the attention will go to the BR it happened to fortnite, and it sucked.
---
When you're leveling up, I suggest moving your camp around. Once you've opened up the whole map and the game is more about grinding, you might want to have a more permanent spot.  
---
Google resource map for FO76, you won't regret it.
---
bro I spent 4 hours making a character and then the game crashed and uninstalled my operating system and sent a hitman to my house wtf bethesda :((((
---
edit: thanks for the gold kind stranger!
---
Level 170ish (haven‚Äôt logged into adventure this past week) played BETA on PS4. My friends were on the hate train so I put the game away for a few months. 
---
I got back into it around the time stash limit was increased to 800, by them I had purchased a PC and I haven‚Äôt looked back since. Crossed the 300 hour mark not long ago.
---
Like all the ideas,  lol.
---
Have love it from beginning
---
Crazy how all the people that didn't love the game from the start are downvoted. Real community spirit their folks.
---
You are amazing.  Maybe now I can stop muting my TV  while I wait for the game to begin. 
---
I wish you good fortune and a never ending string of NW wins!
---
Aren‚Äôt their arms tired at this point?
---
Never understood the criticisms. ( expect for the bugs) Played css go for a long time but I'm done with all the competitive gaming, love this sandbox game.
---
haha glad you like it i fear nothing like this will ever be implemented üòÖ
---
Oh awesome thanks so much I‚Äôll totally give it a try
---
Quality post. Yes
---
I managed to get all except Toxic Valley because Grafton Dam is bugged.
---
What OP isn't telling people is he actually wants to laugh next to a downed opponent before a shotgun shell finishes the poor soul off.
---
I get the feeling a lot of them are experts at this and have a lot of experience.  Hence why I find people saying any game without FO 3/NV exact 1:1 perk system in place it isn't an RPG.
---
I should add I was extremely skeptical and do have a problem with online only games in that one day the game will not be supported any longer (hopefully many years from now). I like the fact that I will always be able to pick up my single player games from the 90s and play them. I just had to adjust me thinking for this and enjoy the experience very much, knowing that one day it will end. Kind of like fastnacht!
---
Will probably have a discount too.  Just like that damn skull mask I bought on impulse.
---
Always happens @ the worst time.
---
Possibly not.  I like those better then the wrist teleportation method currently. 
---
It totally worked in single player, but for multiplayer I don't like it as much.
---
I don't know how I like this post but... Been here since BETA.
---
Do you think going to all the places again as another character would do the trick? Assuming you haven't already done that
---
F*cking h*ll yes,annother yes,yes yes yes
---
you can one of each generator plan from doing any of the ‚Äúpowering up [power plant name]‚Äù events
---
Sorry mate my bad 2 charisma point short sorry
---
i could but i wont be on for 8 hrs or so.  I assume you have the plan and just want the perk shared via team up?
---
I can't get in either they haven't fixed it yet I'm guessing
---
your right buddy
---
100% agreed.  I enjoy building my camp but it is the most frustrating thing to do and can sometimes be a turn off with the game since it can take an hour or more just to create 'work-arounds' when the game gives a b.s. reason of why you can't place something.  Unfortunately, I have to keep simplifying my blueprint more and more just for ease of use in the future when moving.  Kinda defeats the purpose of trying to be creative.
---
I found mine at the water park, but it took me a few hours of constant server hopping.
---
haven‚Äôt read all the replies so apologies if this has been said before
---
what i‚Äôd really like is the ability to send a message to people in my friends list
---
it is such a drag to get a team of friends together unless you find other means of communication, which often means swapping out discord nicks that are often intangible, and take several tries lol
---
or worst yet, have to join someone‚Äôs world, 1 loading screen
---
then fast travel to them, 2 loading screen and then ask them if they want to play together in a different mode lol
---
or waiting for people to get back to main menu to throw invites
---
absolutely horrible
---
i don‚Äôt mind no chat in the normal world
---
but not being able to chat with people you added as friends through either the bethesda app or the game itself is really frustrating and makes grouping up a whole lot more complicated then it needs to be.
---
That's about 15 min from where I live. Been on it a couple of times is very cool
---
Sounds like a dick move to be honest... Making funny traps is just clever trolling and mostly innocent, and when someone is trying to initiate PvP, you don't have to answer to it. Just travel away. Destroying someones camp is just wrong and stupid, even if they have flamethrower trap with door that locks behind you, not that I'd have one (cough! cough!)
---
I can see where fortnite got it from too
---
Thanx man
---
Yep - it's one of the most regular bugs for me other than server disconnects.
---
The thing is that I understand how invested people are in this franchise, and why they would dislike this game. However it seems that most of the hate is based entirely on reviews, and half of the reviews I've seen, have the reviewer stating they stopped playing or something similar. How can you give an objective opinion based on an hour or two of gameplay.
---
As a player of the original games around the time the second game was released, I understand the frustration. Bethesda has dumbed down many aspects of the franchise, but this coincides with the rising popularity of games in general, and making games that appeal to the 'masses'.
---
I played at launch and stuck with it, and I'm still playing everyday. There's just something addictive about this game, and I love having a fallout character that actually feels part of the wider world that you're playing in. 
---
Anyway I've forgotten what point I was trying to make lol. You know that many people disliked fallout 3 because it didn't feel like fallout. I disagreed and loved it so much. Without Bethesda the franchise would most likely be dead, and I can't imagine van Buren succeeding like fallout 3 did.
---
All power generator plans may be earned from doing the restarting the power plant missions at the three nuclear power plants on the map.  Doesnt matter which plant you do it at and its random which plan you get when you complete it but you always get a generator plan. There are 4.  The windmill one is among those.  Good luck =)
---
This happened to two of my teammates aswell, thought my game had froze or something when i saw them lol
---
Ohh mothdude people, alrighty.
---
Screw it, im doin it. Thank you
---
This is what I don‚Äôt understand. I read all the time about how hard the Queen is or the bunkers, how much ammo you need etc. I feel like people are playing an entirely different game than I am. 
---
To be honest, I believe they are too easy. I can solo a bunker in 15-20 minutes? (including the event at the end) while using maybe 2 stim packs and 0 ammo.  Full melee build, run around in power armour and you 1 shot everything inside except the assultrons.  
---
My friend and I have 2 maned the queen using full melee. For ‚Äúend game‚Äù this should not be possible, yet it is. This is why I believe it is too easy. 
---
When ever I post in response to these I always get downvoted, like people think I‚Äôm lying or some shit. Even though there a YouTube vids of people doing the same. Completely baffles me.
---
This! I've exited more times than reviving, whilst in PA
---
at this point i think i‚Äôm just gonna have to mod it into my game.
---
I like sitting in my overseer chair. The sound is reduced a bit up there.
---
look me up later if you dont get sorted
---
I played at launch and finished what there was to do at the time. I took a break to play Days Gone (totally worth it), but I might come back and check back in. I really enjoyed my first play-through.
---
I definitely left because the game was awful but I‚Äôm trying to get back into it. Jumped back in there‚Äôs still major issues, but it is better.
---
Already did.
---
This is just a helpful reminder that it's helpful and not helpfull ;)
---
I got my first win like this, 8 kills, one surviver, plus my team of four haha
---
*waves hand* You want to play fallout 76
---
Good luck with that quest, it's a serious pain, and TBH, not worth the effort. Getting tokens to upgrade the backpack are even worse!
---
Fair play to those that enjoy it, but I have zero interest in playing a dumbed PvP mode, however I understand it's popularity and why folks would like a break from adventure. Especially those of us that have been around for a while :-).
---
Yea sounds like you should give the survival mode a shot it's less fast travel happy and you can only see the top 3 players on the map so it's harder to find people
---
You could do this and then kill the final team ;)
---
I concur
---
Hey guys
---
Never played off the back of the harsh reviews at the beginning. Played f03 and f04, loved em. Worth it? 
---
Im a bloke who may get half hour to 1hr max per day, is it a game like the others where I can just keep coming back?
---
I cant believe you are a grown up adult and still need people to justify you why they prefer text chat?
---
well, when you make a team with randoms, one can be french, another spanish and another one german. They will always have it much easier to write some text, even with mistakes, than speak their non native language.
---
Also, people may have a milion different, and LEGIT personal reasons not to use voice chat, like not waking up the baby, the grandma, the neighbour, the student which he shares his flat, and a long ETC.
---
Not to mention people with disabilities or issues to communicate, be it physycal or psychological ones.
---
The world doesnt revolve about you guys, you must know it doesnt matter in the slightest what do you think about those examples I gave you, because its not about you, its about them / us.
---
Some quests when the game crashes need to be restarted

With fo76 you can set multiple instances to "always be on top" and they will all pick up the exact same inputs from the single keyboard and mouse. No need for input broadcasting. Also that may be against the rules on Eve but fo76 rules are like WoWs where it is okay as long as it is 1 input=1 output. So even if they input broadcasting that is perfectly within the rules.
---
Maybe. The Cranberry Glade one triggered on my first char even though they'd already been there though.
---
You'de think that, and to some extent your right.
---
But the social norm around alchahol consumption is well established and accepted in almost all western cultures and most eastern cultures as well, so doesnt cause as much of a stink as the big bad, cancer-causing nicotine products when displayed to kids. And atleast to the majority of people, if the drugs are fictional, from a burocratic standpoint atleast, they are infact better than the real drugs when it comes to giving a game it's ESRB rating.
---
If you don‚Äôt you‚Äôll always be curious as to what your missing out on so my advice...... start the install now üëç
---
It does seem like a hell of a lot of work for a backpack, as great as they look and might be. I‚Äôd rather have paid for it in the Atom Store! üòï 
---
Seems like more of an end game ‚Äúsomething to do‚Äù kind of quest line. Would have made more sense to have been able to earn a backpack or find one from early game. To fit with the ‚Äúsurviving straight out of the vault‚Äù story.
---
If they are duping they won't waste their time farming weapons they'd just bug their way into the developer room that has every legendary possible.
---
I for one am not looking forward to having to stand and stare at NPCs while they talk haha. I pick real people and holotapes ;)
---
Tonnes of players :) I'm Xbox too there's always people around, and most of the early day trolls are gone, most people I meet are polite and awesome
---
Legendary armor makes PvP in the normal modes absolute cancer. Everyone who wants to do PvP has a max sentinel assassin build, and your shots just don't hurt them. They then proceed to know you down with their automatic anti armor explosive handmade.
---
This is so spot on I raged for a moment till I realized it was a joke. üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Fuck that. I got no problems with setting traps but you can‚Äôt then draw the line at retaliation. It wasn‚Äôt innocent. He put hard work into devising a way to steal peoples junk. Clever yes. Innocent no.
---
Fortnite has text chat, apex has text chat, a 30s search was enough to call you out for lying. Only pubg doesnt, and the search shows countless threads asking for it.
---
Sorry, seemed like you were trying to be rude and  I just took it that way, whatever
---
Same issue.
---
Yay! If you‚Äôre on Xbox feel free to add me and I‚Äôll be more than happy to help if you need it or just want someone to run with for a while :)
---
They should probably make changes to discourage this tactic though, or at least balance it so a blaze of glory start is also valued.
---
I was there since launch and I will nerver give this game up, I love it!!
---
Know what? console users have had that since day one, and if you are part of fallout 76 groups on fb or similar, you will often see screenshots of that, people messaging each other for trade stuff, salty stuff etc.
---
Fast travel could be while in power armor only. The character could launch into the sky in full view of everyone around them. The player could see a 3rd person animation of their character flying in the armor as a loading screen. They could drop out of the sky when they arrive, since power armor eliminates fall damage. I think that would keep fast travel and add to immersion
---
Having just restarted playing FO4 again, yeah, rads are weak in FO76. Just splashed through a river for +40 rads a second.
---
I have something similar!

Jokes :)
---
Wait whaaaaaa?? Where did you read this?
---
Survival mode actually does have it that way, can only travel to train stations, 76 and camp/workshops
---
But also everyone there is going "kill..kill..kill..killl..killl.."
---
Found mine laying against a car in the waterpark parking lot just last night
---
I don‚Äôt pvp, but I think it is ok to have rewards for playing each mode.
---
I launched my first nuke with the help of my friends, when I was level 10. We actually started the mission when I was level 3 but then I got 7 level ups during the mission.
---
I can honestly say this hasn't been a problem for me except bugs in grassy areas part, but then I use my camera to "echo locate" the corpse.
---
Teams do share loot, if they are close enough, even without scoring a hit.
---
yeah, better than nothing, the text chat mod has many users and its chat is kinda useful and non toxic.
---
Too bad theres lot of people that would also use it, but they dont know it, cant install it, dont want to risk using any mod etc.
---
Always liked the game, hated the bugs.
---
I'm on if you still need me.
---
Lore shouldn't be a reward though
---
This reminds me again why I wish Fasnacht was a permanent event.  It's a low level oriented event in the game that is better aimed at newer-to-mid level players, and after this burst of free players, it would have been perfect to showcase cooperation in our community. 
---
But instead, Bethesda made it temporary.  It's really disappointing.
---
Yeah we need this.
---
Inescapable. My goal is to one day see the entire floor and walls of vault 51 covered in blood
---
i go all the way back to the beta
---
Your comment isn't adding anything to the discussion. Go be useless elsewhere.
---
It's your place on the leaderboard. The top 3 are visible to everybody on the map. 13 is your rank of everybody on the server. You don't have to worry until you hit 3, because then most likely somebody is going to come spam you with a bloodied explosive rifle
---
Its their rank, i think it goes by points based on kills and time survied, i hate survival so i dont know exactly how it works
---
I always loved it but still left and came back
---
Happened to me with the behemoth at Twin lakes.
---
I‚Äôve always been around for it. I supported it. I anxiously anticipated it. I truly believed Bethesda would right their wrongs. I never could see them being like EA at all. I‚Äôm grateful I wasn‚Äôt wrong, and I feel rewarded for sticking around.
---
I can just make one for you if you‚Äôd like? Can mod it out too. Psn is Bizzology, some materials may be needed but i should have most everything. Should be on shortly.
---
I never fast travel during missions. No matter how far I hoof it. If I‚Äôm just putzing around sure I FT. otherwise walking to locations helps me explore, get a mental layout of the map, hoard junk, and just bump into weird cool stuff.
---
There's also people like me who left but still loved the game. Just played so much and I needed a break for a few months to play other games.
---
I'm with ya, been playing since Xmas. Just rolled with the punches and waited for Bethesda to fix what issues existed. Being as I've played Bethesda games since TES3: Morrowind, I'm no stranger to the launch issues. And if U was able to deal with backwards invincible dragons, I knew I could handle w/e glitched out nonsense came my way :P
---
Never left the game per say just had to for boot camp. Come back and it's way better than before. It was awesome before now it's way better. Can't wait to get back into it.
---
i‚Äôve been avoiding it too, level 175. i just don‚Äôt have the option to dedicate 30 or 40 minutes without interruptions to anything. i figure if i afk in the bunker i‚Äôll die and everything will respawn by the time i come back. 
---
i‚Äôll try it soon though, will have to go melee since the lockpick perks conflict with rifle perks, i‚Äôll do the most damage with a hammer.
---
my plan is to have lockpick*3 and hacker*3 on so i can skip parts (and put the turrets to good use), stimpaks on hotkey, and if i keep makeshift warrior*5 on my hammer should last (also i have a lot of repair kits i forget to ever use). and chew bubblegum. i came to chew bubblegum and hit robots.
---
You can already play solo. Before you load in, look at the bottom of the first menu where it asks if you want to fill in the team or not.
---
We need a flair for users who have stuck with it since the stash was at the 400. LoL
---
Yeah I do that but when he plays and changes it to his liking I have to change it back when I play again, it does not take long it's just a pain
---
Is it really fucking laggy on xbox? On ps4 the frame drops are really bad
---
Why not?
---
Melee isn‚Äôt nerfed like other play builds can be. I‚Äôm also melee heavy and it‚Äôs surprising to me whenever I see other ballistic and energy players taking significant damage trying to kill something when it takes one or two power attacks from me and barely a dent in my HP. It‚Äôs because players who like smacking things have been blessed by the developers and players who like to be sneaky have been forsaken.
---
I hate that the nuclear code crate also says "steal from" though, I'm not sure why that is as it doesn't make you wanted
---
And if it wasnt people would still complain that they cant get the new reward by not playing.
---
I don't get why PC players are so against voice chat. Voice chat tends to be much easier.
---
If you really want voice chat though I'm sure you could work around it with discord. Show Bethesda how much you want it by doing it anyway.
---
B.E.T.A., launch, 450 hours later I just like to find a nice camp and help newbs
---
Thank you for your reply. Where can I find these PvP builds?
---
Isn‚Äôt Arktos Pharma kind of like that already?
---
# Yes, the game has been fun, but I'm still frustrated by how easy it is to get stuck!
---
The first time I was going to win (team of four, full health, only one opponent left) I got stuck and the nuclear fire killed me because I fell into a room with no exits as I desperately tried to get unstuck from the roof rafters.
---
It should be easier to get out than to fall in to tight places or there should be some way to allow players to get unstuck.  I've gotten stuck SO many times in so many different spots, even behind things that only look about a foot tall!
---
All that does is turn off fill in the mode to stop the game from loading you in with randoms
---
yes
---
People have posted several times about stalemates, just do a search.
---
And someone will just come up and punch you.
---
in NW power armor doesn‚Äôt help a lot. i seem to die just as quickly and my stealth goes down to zero. kudos for figuring out the sabotage i guess? they should fix that. let the PA users klink and klank while you stealth shot them from the shadows. the PA ‚Äúexplosion‚Äù animation when they (I) die is pretty hilarious.
---
No one uses reddit anyways? Is that why it is the 5th most used site on the entire internet only behind the alphabet umbrella(google,youtube, etc.) And facebook?
---
Early on they seem ‚Äúhard‚Äù to find but you obtain some from some quest and events, after a while you‚Äôll realize you‚Äôll have 100+ out of no where, what system are you have I have a good amount I can give you
---
You have no idea what this means to me.
---
Were you maybe too close together?
---
My apologies then. Could you provide a source?  When I did Google for fortnite, I couldn't find anything indicating they have a text chat ability, but perhaps your searching was more rigorous. As for apex, I haven't played that in months, so it's possible they added it, though, again, my quick search didn't show that. 
---
As for lying, your original post does say that PUBG has it, but it does not :)  my intent wasn't to deceive, and I apologize for the misinformation.
---
Yes Bobby pins can be stupidly rare but you're able to buy them from vendors and they can a little expensive
---
You want to join the game mode with just you? Or just you and a buddy? No one else?
---
Should I make a cup of coffee?
---
once you have all 5 apparel items and the fixer plan there's not any point in wasting the time and the stimpacks.
---
Pretty sure there is no text chat in game though, so kinda yikes.
---
You realize majority of players suck at videogames, right? Only like 25,000 people are Diamond in NA on LoL, but there's millions of players.
---
Because it's something to be shared with the community and talked about, my guy. It gets posted online anyway, but I wanna read it myself. Flip it around, though. Why should it be a reward?
---
mate do you have a screenshot from the perkcards you need to use for that build you are talking about?
---
Pubg mobile does or did.
---
I walked past a randomly spawned 3 star legendary Sheepsquatch in Cranberry Bog last night... unfortunately I was level 25 and all alone chasing quest markers, lol.
---
This is what I hoped the burrows would have been, but I was wrong.
---
I‚Äôm on Xbox tho ;(
---
Have an upvote my good sir for adequately portraying the tenacity of us gamers üòÇ
---
im on pc. its depressing to pass so many safes you cant crack
---
Because it gives you incentive to continue playing the mode
---
Yeah, that's the problem with eliminating it.  There are too many aspects of the game that *expect* you to have it.  Scorched Earth is obviously one of them.  If players had to physically hike all the way over there from wherever they were, no one would do it.  Events on the map would just become a tease, because there's no way you could get to them in time.  Same with player vending, if that player decides to logoff.
---
I don't mind the concept of fast travel *only* to train stations, but if that were the case, I'd like to have a couple more train stations - particularly at the northern end of the Mire and potentially around the Bog Town / General's Steakhouse area.
---
Shoot, I‚Äôm level 171, and I‚Äôd quickly walk past it too. Those bastards are tough lol.
---
It is a bug everyone I play with experiences
---
I'm beginning to fucking hate Nuclear Winter because in 20-odd matches, my team gets placed #3 or worse. I haven't won a single match, and here comes streamer Shivaxi who won his first match of Nuclear Winter ever. What exacerbates the issue is how tons posts like this keep popping up in this subreddit.
---
Unfortunately you're going to have to wait until next week to get a lot of the low level free players that won't return out of the system. Even then, you should hop around to servers with a higher average level.  maybe even send a xbox message to a few of them ahead of time to say "hey gonna nuke sbq, will you help kill her?"  there's also a discord server that you can post a message to when you're gonna nuke. people use those notices to jump to your server and help sometimes.  best of luck. don't give up
---
Whooosh
---
*she* is at the train station in Berkley
---
Took 2 weeks off since the beta.
---
Yeah so I‚Äôve heard, I got slaughtered when I joined the fake Sheepsquatch event just out of curiosity, actually got stuck there a while after because a Scorchbeast decided to visit the area and hang on top of my loot bag for about 15~ minutes...
---
Then you want adventure mode or survival? What‚Äôs the point of nuclear winter (battle royale) if it‚Äôs just you in it?
---
Been here since day one, stayed despite the problems, and still play almost every day. It's still got bugs and I doubt it'll ever be perfect, but the story is solid, every update brings more things to enjoy and the gameplay is addictive. I'm happy to still be playing, and I'm really hoping that new and returning players will come to enjoy the game as much as those of us who never gave up on it.
---
Especially when you find one in a radiation feild where theres a bunch of barrels that regen his health making him invincible ..
---
It's not like people wouldn't find out anyway, but it doesn't seem like a good idea to go out and announce it regardless!    
---
@Bethesda: even if you're not very good, you should still be able to spend more time playing than waiting in the lobby and waiting for the game to load!
---
Please reduce the load/wait times!
---
And yes, the XP for killing other players seems stupid low.
---
Really doubt that, that's already in the game. There's things people can't get unless they do the content. Don't see many complaining about Backpacks, Cameras, or Brewing stations do you? Well cameras a little bit
---
The cosmetics should be the incentive
---
the pie should give you god powers in NW
---
Because lots of pc players don't have or can't stand headsets. Not to mention players who are deaf. It isn't that they are against voice chat, just that It would be nice to have the option to use text chat for those of us that don't want or can't use voice chat.
---
They aren't
---
She reminds me a lot of my grandma. Makes me smile each time I spend some scrips.
---
I like that idea.
---
I could have sworn I saw a message pop up that said I unlocked a medium sized loot box, so I logged on to try to swap out my small loot box next to my vending machines, but I dont see anything. Now I've got no idea what the message actually said..
---
I got those perks too but never tested them, is melee realy that good?
---
No what I am saying is a mode where there is no teams only you and the 51 players to battle it out that is solos in duos it is you and a teammate and the other players
---
Apex had text chat since release, Fortnite BR doesn't have text chat. (Fortnite STW does obviously, but not the battle royale mode.)
---
You're a lunatic with a mad man's¬†dream¬†of¬†a¬†milk-proof¬†robot!
---
that is endearing and adorable, I love it!
---
No cryptids in arktos except Sheepsquatch this would more so be all the cryptids all once coming in waves
---
Being able to look back at what we have unlocked would be cool as well
---
This bug is the single reason the majority of my characters use the Good Doggy Perk with Canned Dog Food on my favorites wheel. 
---
Played for a while yesterday on a character without Good Doggy and twice in two hours I had my game completely freeze whilst using boiled water from the Pipboy. 
---
It‚Äôs one of the few game breaking bugs left, so I‚Äôm sure they will figure it out soonish.
---
They're all pretty snazzy
---
Yes, that too!
---
Had it since it came out, left it alone a few months after launch, came back occasionally, only started playing more recently after the bugs were ironed out.
---
Still doesn't change the fact this should have come out later. It became worth buying around April/May IMO.
---
Meanwhile I keep yelling at my friend's to stop buying from my vendors and just tell me what they need.
---
Because people's attention spans are ridiculously limited these days.  You see it with a lot of critically acclaimed games too - it's this giant thing everyone talks about for a week, and then boom, it's like it doesn't exist anymore.  Movies are the same way.  There is too much competing over same limited attention span.
---
The sad part is that it encourages the whole "Why bother fixing it?" mentality.  You think anyone will hold Anthem's failure against EA in a year?  Nah, they'll all be lining up for the next generic Star Wars Battlefield.
---
My mistake--i thought apex only had that cool ping system. I guess I didn't play around long enough to utilize any text chat. Thanks for the info!  I guess I should only speak to the one BR I have played extensively, and not speculate on the others. :)
---
Don't have? Surely almost everyone has a cheap pair of earphones with a mic lying around. If not if you can afford a decent modern pc you can afford a headset.
---
Why can't stand? Sounds like a cop out.
---
I've seen the disability argument mentioned a few times but given people with disabilities are more easily catered to by consoles anyway and console players aren't complaining I don't think it's a big deal, sounds like an excuse.
---
Exactly! I unlocked the crate too, but thought maybe it was just a calling card or something, so now I have no idea what I unlocked and nothing to review either. This addition would be a ton of help for players to figure out how they did last game, and what they‚Äôve unlocked.
---
I found mine at whitesprings
---
At a quick glance, I thought it was Cousin Eddie from National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, taking a crap in his yard.
---
Honestly, I‚Äôll admit, before I tried the game this week I was totally a part of the hate. Thought the game was still a content-less broken buggy mess... but man, it is definitely not. I got hooked in the second I stepped out of the vault.
---
I guess they‚Äôll probably never go away - but I think this week might have made some good headway in showing a lot of people it‚Äôs not as bad as they thought.
---
Circlejerking off hard tho
---
Vote for new hardcore mode!

---
I never gave up on Todd and his developers. I knew this was there first multiplayer game and of course there would be problems.
---
Thanks for the validations everyone. Still looking, but patience is key.
---
Take as many stealth boys and fury as you can find and melee is insane, throw in a melee bobble head and you‚Äôre doing some serious damage
---
If you play stealthy you can win fights by charging in but if you can get the jump on someone there is almost no hope for them the people I have killed probably more than half don‚Äôt even realize what is going on before the second swing. The hardest thing is when they are backing up as you try and swing just making you further from them while they continue to shoot.
---
Only tried two games I think with practice it could be quiet good. I was solo for this game as well.
---
It‚Äôs like tilted, centrally located lots of loot and action. So it really attracts the young teenage population looking for trouble.
---
Nah, she just sits in her lil' Kiosk waiting for Vault Dwellers.
---
Are you using the faster swing speed perk card?
---
I have an entire arsenal of similar weapons and have no problem proving. I've played since BETA and have done a lot of grinding just to get them.
---
it's always there, but I heard there's code in the files for other locations
---
If you go south from the scenic overlook along the road by the disposal field workshop (south end of savage divide) on your right you'll find a camper and picnic tables where it often spawns either a deathclaw, muties or a megasloth. GL.
---
Well, duh! Of course you are!
---
Just grabbed my first PA in NW.  I was literally killed by a single shot.
---
I live longer in my underwear
---
I... have never experienced that headphone bug and I accidentally pull mine out all the time (cord is too long and I end up moving my foot onto it by accident). I‚Äôve been playing nothing but 76 all week with the free trial and I have yet to experience any serious bugs more than annoyances with some actual game design problems, but those can‚Äôt really be helped too much
---
Uh no deaf people do much better gaming on pc thanks to programs designed specifically for them that aren't available on consoles. Not to mention not everyone wants to play on console with shit graphics compared to pc.
---
As for the headset thing, I have over a thousand bucks tied into my 7.1 atmos surround system on my pc. Why the he'll would I want to downgrade to some shitty headphones? Even sennheisers suck in comparison. Not to mention lots of people get headaches from wearing headphones both over the ear and in the ear cause me migraines.
---
So why not add the option for text chat? Why do you want it to be voice chat or nothing? Becausr playing on pc ive seen what ends up happening, no one communicates on pc. Almost everyone has voice chat turned completely off. So even if you were to use voice chat on pc yous be one of the very few.
---
Just found it. Water park, if anyone needs it On Xbox I‚Äôll be on here for another 30min til work.

There's million games where you run &amp; shoot. I waited whole life for this type of tactics in shooting game. It's really amazing.
---
Its absolutely pure garbage. 
---
Kill feed is atleast 10 secs behind, no minimap, red triangle still on top of enemys head. Audio is as messed up as in the normal game mode. As laggy as the main game. Gun play is ofcourse utter shit
---
On top of this all it has perkcards that gives you unfair advantages. Something no respectable BR should ever have. 
---
Its amazing how they fail at everything related to this game. Just an absolute shit show.
---
You can start on the quests? Otherwise travel, explore, find cool stuff, meet other players?
---
Tried it yesterday..and it was a stupid thing to do at level 50...didn't get killed n even managed to go upto fixing the pipes..but all my weapons got broken and most of the stimpacks gone..and it was 4.30 am...my eyes swollen..head hurting..finally shut it down n went to sleep..
---
Maybe it's just because I sort by New, but I see an awful lot of "I didn't think I'd like it, but it's actually awesome" posts in the past week or so.  And you still have the same handful of users who feel the need to add their vitriol to every post, whether it was asked for or not.  But I'd like to believe they look increasingly shrill.
---
I would love to play adventure mode with no fast traveling except maybe to events.
---
I haven‚Äôt read anything for a few years, but I bet if you [check nma](http://www.nma-fallout.com/forums/fallout-76.26675/) you‚Äôll see more salt. r/fallout are but children, nma have been riding the hate train for 20 years, lol.
---
I‚Äôve played since Beta, but I‚Äôve been in the hospital a lot here lately. Their internet isn‚Äôt strong enough in there, I could hardly scroll Reddit.
---
No I wish I had it that would complete the build

You're not wrong, but I'm still gonna take the opportunity to tell at them. Hell, if they want to pay for them that bad they can pay me directly so we can cut out the tax
---
I love adopting low level players, and beefing them up with chems and ammo, crafting weapons armor and power armor pieces for them, gifting legendaries and running a few missions with them as the muscle.  I'm working on getting the mutation recipies so I can hand out some of those as well.  It makes my day when they look in the paper bag of goodies and watch them react or shout with joy.
---
Of course it‚Äôs more hassle, I was just letting you know it‚Äôs possible to play with friends and make your own group.
---
Man im a NV fanboy to the very core , but even those guys overe there are tards doing their circle jerks. 76 is solid and it keeps getting updated wih new stuff, but nooo a bad launch is a capital punishment worthy sin apparently.
---
The reason why I left is cause I got bored. I made it to lvl 6 and then just stopped playing.
---
I will try it with all 3 perk cards maybe its a good build for me :)
---
It‚Äôs possible that they may have forgotten about it or maybe it‚Äôs teasing something.
---
Ah yes with a bobble head and med-x/psycho really help when attacking someone who is aware of you and shooting
---
Cool
---
The ghouls in the burrows do this very consistently, I'm pretty sure certain ghouls always end up in specific places when they convert to a meat pile. Some of them even start walking through walks so you have to loot them before they pass through.
---
Alot of them are probably returning players too. I guess the word is out that 76 is finally a playable game.
---
Vats has always been an integral part of fallout. Removing a system vital to so many builds in a mode that‚Äôs already been released would have a hugely negative impact on a lot of players. 
---
Vats is fine the way it is, NW is fine without it because you know going in you can‚Äôt use it.
---
Its funny cause its so much worse than any other BR, not even a dcreecher would play this garbage
---
It‚Äôs over to an extent, there‚Äôs still a lot of diehard hate train members, but for those that actually have an open mind, I think we‚Äôll see a lot more joining especially with the trial and the half off.
---
Ah I see, as I suspected it's a pc master race sort of thing rather than any actual issue.
---
Why not add it? Because only a minority of PC players want it, and PC players are already a minority. Why should Bethesda spend their time catering to tiny minority instead of adding features everyone can enjoy?
---
Consoles have text chat. So why would they complain when they already have it?
---
Didn't find a lot of fun in PvP myself. Just create a build with 2000+ dmg/s to handle PvE, maybe killing SBQ in a minute is a good direction.
---
use fury you get damage resist and +50% melee damage. Fury, stealth boy then run in there with grognak axe or sledgehammer you‚Äôll 2 hit everyone even if they‚Äôre in power armour
---
Start with the overseers quest lines follow that first. You get to explore and get useful items. I started thus week and that helped me a lot. Also look on the maps for events and go to them, you get to earn xp to level up.
---
Was there from the very beginning until my ps4 took a shit. Have finally bought a new one so I'm back into the grind
---
And PCs already have text chat. Why not just use discord or one of the million other text chat programs?
---
Should I power attack?
---
üôã
---
Still the hardest encounter in the game.
---
Pc is where the majority of the players are on fo76 and the majority are asking for it. It is why you see it daily on this subreddit. So once again you've completely ignored the reasons why it should be added.
---
If I follow the timeline right... Rex hasn't been born yet, unfortunately.
---
Yeah I'm at rank 20 rn but I'm more looking at the holotapes and terminals that are at 140 and all. The cosmetics only go to up rank 100. Holotapes are apparently the real reward even though the transcripts have been datamined already lol
---
I think I'm going to cancel my trip to the resort tonight.
---
No one did, and then they actually made it feel like a Fallout Battle Royale and it‚Äôs actually incredibly fun to play.
---
Cant be used in game.
---
Let me know
---
At that level it should be doable unless they ignore one mechanic that there is.
---
Neither can console text chat
---
I love it. Fallout 4 told us exactly what to expect from 76, so there were few surprises for me.
---
Been here since the beta.
---
Launched a total of 1 nuke,
---
Taken down 1 scorch beast queen.
---
A handful of scorch beats
---
Finally found my camps permanent settlement. And have been there since November.
---
Its just you. Its terrible tbh. I knew it was going to be bad. This bad though... But atleast it confirmed to me that everything related to this game is a failure
---
Maybe highlight the loot instead as I‚Äôm pretty sure the bodies de spawn fairly quick
---
Me too.  I'm interested in survival since it sounds close to that... but the pvp is almost scary since I'd start at level 1.
---
Yes it can, you can text chat in your friend list inside the game with it running. To use text chat on pc you have to leave the game.
---
Yeah bobby pins are in quite short supply early on but it doesn't take too long before you have an abundance of them. Anecdotally speaking out of all the enemies Ghouls seem to drop them more frequently than any other.
---
You know I came up behind a guy and tried to and nothing was happening and I also didn‚Äôt throw a grenade. So the numbers I speak of are with out power attack I‚Äôm not sure why I couldn‚Äôt but if you sneak up on someone and can get it to work for sure you might honestly one shot someone depending on there load out and build. After first swing though it‚Äôs a little too slow and risky
---
Funny how you edited the other comment lol. What did it originally say again? "Apparently they're not the reward?"
---
Just use a head set ffs
---
BF5 is pretty good for that also, but it's a lot more intense.
---
The pie is a lie
---
Gosh I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if you could one shot someone I think this might be a pretty conditional strategy but it is a lot of fun and feels great when you slice someone down
---
And now we will see 20+ players trying to fit into a corner of a room, should make a good photo op.
---
Pc is not where the majority of players are. Games always sell more on console than pc. Seeing it daily just means it's a vocal minority.
---
üôãüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
No you can't.
---
I said "they aren't" and then edited to be more understandable? as in they aren't incentive for me ?
---
Correct! I always grind this quest and I recently received the "Knights" paint job.
---
That's your opinion and I respect that.
---
But it's not a failure to a lot of us. The game failed quite miserably in the beginning, yes, but over time things have drastically changed for the better. This mode is no exception.
---
Was it me? I like nuking the final zone a lot and once got 11 kills from 1 nuke
---
Only thing is that the audio is so terrible that you Haven no idea where an Enemy is coming from Even If you hear them
---
I agree, I also use the Anne Frank style of PVP gaming. Hideous in a cupboard until the men with the machine guns turn up.
---
Does anything significant happen ? Is it double nuclearized ?
---
I put it down a few times for other games but never gave up on it. More just got bored between content updates. I got a lot of good games for my birthday so it get periodically sucked into them hard and then get bored go back to this and then vice versa. I‚Äôm balancing between this, subnautical, no man sky, and Jurassic evolution because I‚Äôm weird.
---
We won, so I have no idea.
---
Bethesda has stated the majority of sales were on pc. So you are just flat out wrong.
---
Where did the nuke land?
---
Sadly I do not remember the name.
---
Survival is still to much fast traveling for me and the fast travel locations are the only spots for PvP it feels like.
---
I still not digging thos game made because it seems fastest internet and most twitchy player wins...my internet is very slow and I hate up down up down up down side side up down up side down side up down game play...but.. 
---
I did feel bad for this one guy.  He was just wrecking people.  I mean like every kill that was announced was him.  Kept thinking oh crap hope I do not meet this guy.   I saw him first and I was in PA with 50 call and just lit him up.  He casually turns and one shots me to the head and his team then just uses my team as a speed bump.  I watch after and as he gets to the end some level 3 when only 4 people remain.  The lowly 3 pops up and ends him with a couple shots.
---
Props to the guy wrecking face.  Annoys me that I emptied a 50 call right at this guy and nothing.  I honestly think it's my internet though.  He was probably wondering wtf I was shooting at nothing 50 ft to his right. üòû
---
So that's what that was. I'm also trying out the game during the free period and a high level player came to me and did the gift emote. I figured he might have wanted to gift me something, but he just stood there with the emote staring at me. I was staring at him. It was really confusing. I didn't see any brown bag. I didn't even know brown bags appear when you drop items.
---
I read earlier that rad resistance is broken, it's misslabeled and should be poison resistance?
---
I quit doing them for this very reason.
---
Source please
---
LOL, yes you can just checked with a friend who streams ps4 games. You absolutely can bring up your friend list and send a message while in game. You can't do that on pc, you have to alt tab out of the game on pc to send text chat.
---
I never like using PS Plus for a game. Makes me feel like I bought it twice.
---
I'm playing it right now on ps4. Tell me how I can do that.
---
I'm getting more xp in Adventure mode while playing NW, than I'm getting when I'm actually playing Adventure mode lol. 5-6k Adventure mode xp per NW win is pretty sweet
---
i‚Äôm really happy this is the way it is played tbh
---
it is actually scary to me to sneak around and hope you don‚Äôt accidentally run into a group of 4
---
it‚Äôs ‚Äòsurvival‚Äô at it‚Äôs finest
---
plus i LOVE that you can sneak up to people and snipe them while they hide in bushes.
---
we already got fortnite and players unknown battlegrounds for rambo battle royale, i‚Äôm happy this one is different
---
Pretty good job. I solo nuke on the regular,  but recently had same fears regarding SBQ with the lowered amount of hardened players lately. But the other day said "Screw it." And tried SBQ anyway. Ended up all by my lonesome but stood my ground. 15,000 bullets, 20 stims, over 30 varied Nuka-Cola products and a buttload of Psycobuff I downed her with 6 minutes to spare.
---
Felt like a pretty awesome badass.
---
I watched a streamer play and say 4 glitches and bugs still in the game within 10 minutes of watching. It doesn't look like anything has changed other than PVP for those that love pvp.
---
Well.... Just well next for them is to try to do a 360 no scope
---
Neither have I.
---
Doesn't matter.
---
Tons of fun in the game, with frineds our without.
---
&gt; Jim Sterling literally made a video this week reminding us that Fallout 76 wasn't very good at launch. He discussed basically nothing new, didn't touch Nuclear Winter and just ranted about how bad it was
---
I saw this in my feed and just shook my head, added him to my list of gaming Youtubers to never watch, beside LegacyKillaHD, Yongyea, and a whole list of others. Gmaing Youtbue has become complete trash. But at least many of them have shown how useless they are with, to me at least, so I know not to bother with them for any useful information whatsoever.
---
I am in the same boat.  Multiple zero wins...zero kills even when I unload auto rifle into a guy.  But I think my issue is my internet being slow üòû
---
Damn, 42 in NW? I'm just under 30 and thought I was crushing it. Well done
---
The lore has already been datamined so it's not really an incentive either. Unless you're more interested in the voice acting? Might even be able to rip the sound files.
---
I play solo as well and usually end up with a team rating of 5 or better and a player placement above 12 or so, had my first win just yesterday, [here's the screen cap](https://imgur.com/BFXxaLc)
---
Use the touch part of the controller and bring up the friends list or w/e it is called on ps4 social or something and then click on friend you want to message.
---
That's what I was going to say, lol.
---
As everyone else said, explore and do quests.  Events can be fun to do and are often a good source of XP when you're trying to level up. Could even build your C.A.M.P up if you wanted to
---
Never stopped playing since first day of beta. I've played some really buggy games over the last 30 years, and this wasn't as bad as some made it out to be. My only qualm about 76 is the graphics. If looks great on my friend's PC, but on Xbox console and a 4k TV it's just *meh*. But I lived through Zork, so no worries. I just hope it survives into next gen story line as promised.
---
So new players who don't want to play Adventure, the foundation of this game, should get some kind of preference over actual Fallout players? 
---
Sorry, acccept it, play it for what it is, or go back to fortpubduty.
---
oh it‚Äòs a doozy for the experienced player, at least for me. :D but i like to play conduit
---
You have become the thing you hate. :p
---
You use the options button to bring up that menu, not the touchpad.
---
The in game social menu lets you add them as a friend, which takes you out of the game. There is no text option there.
---
Why are you lying so persistently?
---
o LADY ELLE o
---
Marine armour is the best, you can't really stealth it in PA.
---
I ran with ada modified to be my pack mule to carry all my crap, I had Hancock with me once and he pulled out the rocket launcher with like 4 rockets I had stored with him and wasted them not killing a single mirelurk that we were facing
---
I‚Äôm loving it so far. No bugs, only a couple of disconnects. I‚Äôm already level 30 with full sets of T45, T51, and T60 waiting for level 40. My house and farm have come along awesome. All in all minus the lack of human npcs, which thankfully are coming... it‚Äôs a really fun game. My brother and I have spent the last few days just tearing it up. I‚Äôll probably buy it after the trial. https://i.imgur.com/U99Q17Z.jpg
---
WOW, thank you soo much melee is actually pretty good!
---
Hard to get stuff sold as a high level palyer right now with my vendors, usually a swarm of level 4 players raid my house and i give them some level 5 recon rifles instead
---
Been there since launch. Played an hour, refunded.
---
You are going to be suprised. Every other BR is so much better.
---
Ah, to be launching my first nuke again. Why, way back in the olden days, we.... 
---
heh heh congratulations
---
I have a tower camp I place on hillsides. However as I absolutely suck at NW I always did. And always leave the match. 
---
I wondered if my camp left with me or not.  Glad to read in here that it does. Lol
---
Understood what mean about passing up locked items.  The thing is that many of the lvl 0 and lvl safes litterally have just a couple pieces of junk.  Lvl 2 safes sometimes have decent items, and I never bothered getting lvl 3 lock pick.  Now that my build is set at lvl 53 I might get the last lock pick card.
---
I get the same feeling about passing up ammo and weapons.  After 40 years of scrounging everything, it just doesnt feel right lol.
---
Unmmmm pain should be good? I think you have to sell each peace and not on a frame but I could be wrong in thinking that.
---
LOL! We need a Steelheart up in there to maintain order
---
Ok short version, find overseers camp and follow her logs until you find the Responders. You'll follow their story until it sends you to the Top of the World to learn about the Raiders. Then after that you'll get sent to the Free States area you'll do their missions. You'll get the option to learn about the Brotherhood of Steel, but there  no technical reason to do their missions. After Free States missions you'll get access to the Enclaves bunker under the White Springs hotel. There you'll do some missions restoring the computers power. You'll gain access to nukes.  And finally you go nuke something. That's pretty much the main mission. But there are side quests everywhere, events everywhere, a dungeon under the Arkos pharma building.

Total fo76 sold 1.6million copies total 300k on ps4, 200k on Xbox. That leaves 1.1 million sold on pc.
---
I like to hop in and move the PA somewhere where itll act as a decoy, THEN pull the fusion cores out lol
---
? Random but ok.
---
No you just need the stuff in stash. 30 circuits and steel I believe. I find you can gather those mats easily on way in tho,  just loot the turrets, they often have military grade circuit boards, scrapping Assaultron heads and blades helps to.
---
Been playing since beta. Even bought a second copy on PC, when I sold my Xbox and restarted there. LOVE this game!
---
Ps4?
---
Idk why you're getting downvoted, they're super similar to the slipstreams
---
You need PlayStation Plus in order to play online on PS4. Not just PSN.
---
Yep it's glitched. It doesn't even show what the game considers you done. And it can be done in adventure.
---
When I got it, it was displaying the milk the brahm done. All others are still not displayed as done, but the challenge is done.
---
Im sure I've not taken the workshop or killed anything with a farm tool.  I would imaginge during the week I've collected plenty of plants, fungi and very likely wild crops too. Several fungi should be guaranteed, not 100% sure on wild plants. I do have like asher on my camp and those expoding berries near too(the ones that give you extra crit damage as made into tea), which I all the time collect.
---
But I wonder if it was just milking my brahm 5 times that did it. Since that's now greyed out of the challenges.
---
I'm not lying, as I said i checked with my friend who plays ps4. I don't play consoles. So I don't exactly know what buttons he presses to do it as all I can see is his screen, not what buttons he presses.
---
People will spend absolutely stupid money to customize Dogmeat.
---
That's not what that link says
---
I imagine in time they will have a private server. I think they said something about not offline mode a while ago, but they are open to the idea of the private server.
---
Yes you are lying. I'm done with you.
---
I don't think people would see what you've renamed the chassis too either. You best bet is selling the parts individually but that would impact on your stash weight limit heavily.
---
I'm from Brazil and play with my wife just fine. But we play on Xbox. I think u are on PC, did u check if the problem is with your connection?
---
Wait, so they charge you for PlayStation plus and psn?
---
Uh, if you already own it....why not? Well, maybe wait until free week is done; sever DC went from 0 to a handful over a few days.  Hoping they will decrease as the player numbers drop.
---
I call being a tree!
---
You'll know it's me due to sometimes moving erratically sometimes :D
---
That's what I always did in CoD then flashed 'em and run (Uh leaf?) away.
---
Anyways yeah I'd definitely LOVE Prop Hunt for Fallout! That and Faction Warfare are two of the main PvP things I'd like!
---
A little tip for fighting it another time: it seems to really hate Molotovs! They‚Äôll eat it‚Äôs health like crazy.
---
No, Just PSPlus. They don't charge you for PSN.
---
The link shows the sales on each system. There have also been plenty of talk of how many has been sold total. It isnt hard to do the math. ROFL.
---
If you were both killed simultaneously, it actually ends in a "Stalemate" - an interesting game decision (and one I didn't expect).
---
Had it happen yesterday when someone M79'd me - I thought he killed just me until I saw the "Stalemate" text pop up on screen and realized he blew himself up as well.
---
I wasn't even mad, it was a fitting end in the Wasteland....
---
Since Beta; not the most hours, or levels, but chip in one or two sessions a week where I can.
---
I've been here, I've just decreased my playtime because I haven't really been getting anything good for my time investment, and I've got lots of other games to play.
---
People like to hate on fortnite because it's popular.
---
At the very least we should be able to send a text with a friend request to explain why, also avoid the accidental friend requests that get sent all the time by clicking too fast to travel somewhere and clicking on a player instead.
---
Yeah i must admit that for me personally hackers on PC is one of the reasons why i tend to prefer console gaming.
---
After 50, you stop getting points to use in special, and get points to either move a special point, like from luck to endurance etc OR pick a perk card
---
 Very, in fact I just woke up üòÇ
---
What platform
---
BioShock did it, though things probably have changed since it was released. I know the Obama administration pushed through some stricter regulation, but nothing of what I'm seeing restricts depiction in entertainment. Otherwise, we'd never see a cigarette, pipe, cigar or even hookah in anything. 
---
That being said, I know you can't advertise tobacco with anything flashy or catchy, like a jingle. I'd imagine it'd be fine if there wasn't a name drop, so say like, "MARLBORO REDS: AMERICA'S FAVORITE FOR &lt;9999&gt; YEARS!"
---
See, I'm doing the same, level 1 and 5 modded gear for 10 to 20 caps and the ammo is the cheapest it'll go, but all I get is window shoppers. Some are too skittish to even look. I watch them circle the perimeter then eventually take off for the next town.
---
You just gotta find those places that give mats the most. no adhesive isn‚Äôt scarce there‚Äôs actually a lot of sources for one if you craft it yourself from crops at your camp you can actually keep a large supply on yourself. Knowing this I might try crafting a lot and selling it at my camp for low level players
---
Yes, you can. But it takes a very long time. You can either move a perk point or buy a perk card once per level after 50.
---
&lt;types response&gt;
---
Once you reach 50, you can start moving 1 perk point around each level. You'll eventually get every perk you want/need. 
---
At 200 I have 50 levels banked, so I can swap builds at will.
---
Too bad it is only delusion of power.  I see it as pathetic weakness like most people.  These guys just have not realized how pathetic they appear
---
It's too easy for folks to just jump over melee, and if someone has Frog Legs it renders your melee build essentially useless unfortunately. 
---
I had a Stalemate yesterday - 1v3 at the end where I downed his two buddies and he launched an M79 and blew me up. I thought he had won it until the "Stalemate" text popped up and I realized he blew himself up as well. Interesting game mechanic.
---
For future, Granton Monster has blow holes on its back which is its weak spot.
---
That is mildly atypical.  Bullet's are semi rare early so that you will try different weapons, now I drop 100s of rounds at random bases to get it out of my inventory.  (I play solo too).  
---
Where is your base?  So Do you have a vending machine?  Those middle levels took some work, that is for sure, but once you get over that hurdle it gets a lot more fun.
---
But it isn't everyones bag.  Hope to see you again though, the wasteland always has room for more.
---
Do you have any recommendations for a lvl 11? I wanna git gud^TM
---
No I'm not look 4 comments up. I clearly stated i asked my friend who streams himself playing ps4 so yeah I don't know exactly which buttons as I gave my ps4 pro and psvr away like 2 years ago because I prefer pc gaming as I have an uktrawide monitor atmos surround sound etc. On my pc that the ps4pro couldn't compete with and the psvr was just a gimmick.
---
So yeah I don't know the buttons he uses, just that the friend menu pops up and allows him to send text messages while the game is still playing.
---
Damn ok, if u were on Xbox I would have some stuff for you :/
---
Congrats!did my first couple weeks ago,level 148:)also on sbq,killed her with 1,3 min remaining,was a close one pvieeuw
---
Actually, I think you just stated both of them. Fair enough, though, I assumed that most players would want to learn every plan in case they decided to change weapons/armor etc in the future. Plans have never been worth less than they are right now, barring a few jet pack and ultracite ones.
---
Dunno, doing the hunter and mamologist badges were fun.  Turned on area chat and kept my mouth running like Elmer Fudd, asking people if they rabbits, etc. Good times.
---
I'm that idiot melee build that runs straight at them.  Nothing ventured is nothing gained.
---
If I get 9 kills and 9 downs, it should be way more xp than surviving for X amount of time. Stupid...
---
Someone, like me, will start arguing with you simply because you are wrong. Ofcourse some builds are stronger than others. Non-automatic rifle and stealth builds are inferior to automatic rifle, heavy weapons or explosive builds. They simply stand no chance in a 1v1.
---
Choose your spawn location wisely, and you will have the weapon that suits your build 9/10 times. I am having difficulty calling this 'luck'.
---
Reach the final circle a couple times and you will change your mind lol :\
---
Interesting to know. Maybe I will grind for it after all. Thanks for the info.
---
You can make ammo in the tinkerer‚Äôs bench.
---
Don‚Äôt see the problem with paying for online security and given Sony history with online related problems, I‚Äôm shocked it took them this long for it.
---
I just want to turn it off entirely, every Bethesda game I have ever owned on PC has serious issues with the sound bugging out and according to crash logs it has even been the cause of many of my freezing, not responding and CTD's.
---
Yes. It will take longer but you can do it.
---
Deaf players can't.
---
It's probably the best game ever made, and anyone who said it was bad was just a troll and hater who probably never played the game!
---
I've bought every item on the atom store so far, and can't wait to see what else they bring us!
---
yes in game paints are fine but each part needs to be sold independently. the problem I had was the weight of the parts I would sell legs W/ shocks fast but arms would hang around forever unless very cheep.
---
Ok I just started and came across a bug in the first 30 mins. After i was done using the tool bench I pressed tab for exit and my character just stood there. No hud just standing there. But so far i think the game is fun minus that one glitch.
---
I you wasn't aware you can tag components so when you're out looting every item that contains one or more of those components it shows a little magnifying glass next to it. Definitely helps with your scrap looting efficiency.
---
People defending Bethesda for not having text chat are weird. Every modern social online game needs text chat. Why hold your game back by being stubborn
---
My camp won‚Äôt show as a vendor either. You have me scared now, I‚Äôll have to check my stash.
---
90 is the best you can do on weight reduction items.
---
I'd prefer to play Fallout, but okay.
---
Take the pharma farma, and scrounger perks early. They're a good way to stay stocked in meds and ammo early on. You don't need to max them out, just a few points in each.
---
Be aware that these perks add an additional option to search med/ammo containers, so you need to search each one twice.
---
If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

---
Grafton monster sucks man
---
I like sitting in that little park area. Band is muffled enough to not bother me.
---
Mode*
---
You're not insane, I've noticed this too -- whats interesting is my GF loads in faster than I do, but she also has all the graphic settings on low while I'm running everything maxed.
---
That said, I've noticed assets like creatures and camp buildings aren't loading nearly a minute after I load into the game. If the longer load time is to alleviate that issue, I'm all for it. No more getting sucker punched in the dick by a molerat while loading in.
---
Been ride or die since day one &lt;3
---
As one who just broke into lvl 50 after 6 months of owning the game, I couldn't play the game without FT.  I just dont have the time to spend walking everywhere and would find it annoying trudging over the same ground.
---
Regarding the ignoring people aspect, um, the servers have a ton of empty space with only 23 other players, and many if not most of them tend to ignore folks they run into.  This isn't too social of a game.
---
The grind for basic necessities goes away once you‚Äôve built up reserves. I‚Äôm at a point where I‚Äôve got 100s of cans of dog food and so much purified water I could refill Summersville Lake. Ridiculous amounts of ammo too.
---
No xbox one mate sorry
---
Yes same. I don't even see a mic indicator letting me know if anyone could hear me.
---
true, now that you‚Äòve said it. but i‚Äòve noticed having the speed demon mutation and running too fast into whitesprings can still hold some nasty surprises. not often, but yeah .. :D 
---
and i‚Äòve noticed the vendor resetting bug has returned, which irks me the most ..
---
They aren‚Äôt even that rare. I just started the game, and the amount of junk that can grant cloth and lead is ridiculous, meaning you can craft ammo. I think this dude just sucks at managing his resources
---
Yes just get over being deaf! So simple, why didn't those deaf people just think of that...
---
By at least an inche.
---
Tell me if I'm wrong with this, but wouldn't new players who are mainly interested in NW have the long term advantage here? Getting adventure xp in NW means you could just hop over to adventure and allocate your specials based on the cards you're getting or are aiming for in NW, rather than having to fit cards into a build you already have.
---
You can change it one stat at a time after 50 instead of getting a new perk card, but if it will take you a lot of levels to fix then you'll probably have more fun starting a new character. I like the early part of the game, personally. I'm on my 6th or 7th character (there's a limit, so you have to delete the unwanted ones). You can always pass on any good legendary gear you want to keep. This also means that you can choose which playstyle you want to do by choosing your character, rather than having to respec every time you fancy switching weapons.

Retribution is the way of the wasteland.
---
Just because its datamined doesn't mean I've read it. Im just interested in leveling up and unlocking the lore
---
measured it; exactly 6.3cm
---
I tried every way possible to place down a chemistry set for like an hour. Loging out loging back in. Pulled the cailing down walls went flying.  Nothing would get me around " can't place object needs support"
---
I switched over to the other type. Still nothing so I had to rework and entire floor plan just to find a spot to accept it.  All other craftiing stations would snap just fine in the same damn spot.  Smh.  Ferious
---
Well where I see your point, I've leveled up twice playing NW and I'm level 150+. I'd imagine that you've leveled quite a bit and could increase your special in adventure mode and therefore use more cards in NW.
---
I acquiesce
---
My mate shot with a two shot MRV Fatman at some guy's right outside vault 76, it was quite funny how they runned

Please don't mention NMA it makes me feel old...

Same unfortunately mine passed last Monday
---
I think the issue would be resolved if jumping cost stamina in NW. Apparently the whole justification of making it have a stamina cost in adventure/survival mode was so that people wouldn't be jumping around spamming VATS in pvp, yet now it's totally fine in NW?
---
a seperate sub would serve fine
---
I'd rather just have access to the vault in Adventure mode and therefore be able to go areas with my earned Overseer rank, so I can explore without a time constraint.
---
Im level 278 and still have no idea what it's about apart from a lot of being killed
---
üôãüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I also like to ride the third rail. 
---
That sounded a LOT less dirty when I first typed it out.
---
You don‚Äôt need stimpacks to revive, to compensate it just takes a longer button hold.
---
The point could not have been any more clear, hence your clueless, stupid, garbage response being downvoted.  Reddit works better for people with basic comprehension skills.
---
A little crotchety, I am too about it but in sure anywhere between a week to a month it'll be focused on wastelanders hype
---
Personally I'd like for PvP to disable VATS in survival, but that's just because I dislike using it (come on, it's meant to be a "harder" gamemode. All I ever see is people walking crouched everywhere...) however I'll side with the majority when it comes to actually keeping it or not. My personal preference shouldn't affect anyone else.
---
On another note, I'll argue to the end of time to get rid of the top three players appearing on the map. It's damn annoying to be punished for simply existing for long enough, if people want pure PvP: go to Nuclear Winter. Most of the time when you find the people who are unlucky enough to be on the map, they're a poor sub-level 10 who is just wandering in the middle of nowhere with their meger amount of junk.
---
A simple indicator on the compass would be good. Like an x that stays until you loot him.
---
If you're fresh out of the vault, you should definitely do the initial overseers quests...they'll set you up for success in the game and also show you some gameplay stuff that is unique to FO76.  
---
So, head south along the road towards Flatwood, be sure to stop at the overseers camp about halfway between the vault and the town and then continue south and get to the church. Be sure to read any notes and/or terminal entries and listen to any holotapes you come across.
---
They could probably start by being less stingy with the mode experience calculations and also add damage to players as a rewarding stat. I also don't understand why downing and finishing player exp isn't shared on the team, because you lose out on experience when your teammate does something to help your team. Also people leaving the game as soon as they get downed also cheats you out of some potential experience.
---
All they have to do is hop over to adventure mode and level up from the xp gained in NW and attribute the points. Pretty simple.
---
Man literally my favourite game of last year I think. Sunk so much time into it. Second favourite Fallout game.
---
I need this handmade rifle that you speak of.
---
It's more than a bit ridiculous. With the RNG for cards, and no VATS, it's extremely OP.
---
Not to mention having NO DAILY QUEST HUB to easily get some of these damn things. Biv/Two tadpole quests in the terminal set this up perfectly to just throw in start triggers to all the other daily quests in the game.
---
It‚Äôs pretty clear on Project Paradise, but only on the elevator. I think a ‚Äúsuggested level warning‚Äù when you mouse over or attempt to travel to the event would be good. For events like Encryptid, a warning pop up before you start the quest wouldn‚Äôt be bad, either.
---
Play sunless seas for a spell, it'll stop phasing you and you may find yourself singularity atavistic in your wording for quite some time
---
You won't regret it!
---
And yeah maybe see ya around!
---
Keep in mind you need other materials besides Flux to make stable flux. These materials don't degrade but can be harder to come by... particularly the high radiation fluids.
---
They have? They still don't even have text chat on the pc version. Arktos pharmacy still crashes for the majority of players after being there for more than 10 minutes. The NW BR mode is overrun by flying aimbot hackers and Bethesda has zero anticheat software built into the game. It is why people are still able to dupe. Why do you think servers keep crashing again? People are back to using the server rollback dupe.
---
To say every complaint has been addressed sounds just as circlejerky as some of the stuff said on r/fallout only in the opposite direction.
---
We can have both
---
Bahaha thats me! I love being The Law on the map! Clear those bounties and help them to get started on their own afterwards. Like a Treatment program after prisonüòÇ "Bro, I had to do it! Im sorry!!!! come back and get your junk and these stims!"
---
This!
---
This would be good, but I'd also like the compass. I like seeing the degree numbers instead of just ticks.
---
Ammo for the conventional weapons is pretty easy to make - you do it at the tinkerer's bench, and it usually requires steel, gunpowder and lead, which are all somewhat common. You can boost the amount of ammo you're getting via the Ammosmith perk in Agility (40 to 80 percent more depending on level), and Super Duper in Luck (10 to 30 percent change to get a duplicate item when crafting). Both unlock at later levels though, I think. 
---
Early on, I used the hunting rifle (308s) and a combat rifle (45s) because they had different ammo types, but still had the same perks for increasing damage. Make sure you have a decent melee weapon too - probably a spear at this point of the game for you, although the Blade of Bastet is very nice too, if you finish the Order of Mysteries questline, which should be doable at your level. 
---
If you have a good amount of space caps, you could also get the lever action rifle plan from Grafton, Welch or Lewisburg stations - It costs around 1,500 to 2,000, I believe, but it's a pretty stellar weapon as far as rifles go. Base model uses 45s, so that would also pair well with your hunting rifle until you get proper mods for it.
---
Ouch. I need to apologize to a lot of people
---
I keep thinking NeverWinter every time I see NW.  Oy, it's so confusing!!!
---
Lol I‚Äôm sure they already forgot by now.
---
I haven't had any issues with people messing with me in the overseer chambers. Drastically fewer people, lots of reduced noise.
---
yes, dont worry about it. You can start swapping round at level 50. once you get into the hundreads you actually stop using the skill points you get and accumilate them. most late on players have 40+ points to use and can swap an entire build over.
---
Well could be.. All except Miguel and his spouse the delivery guy.
---
$30 for a physical PC copy on Amazon/BestBuy if you want to stick around and watch the development of the game first hand.

This PA is just going to make it harder for **you** to level up. The more people who do this, the fewer people die, the longer matches last, the more boring the game mode is, the fewer people play it. This whole mentality is bad for the game mode despite giving you bigger rewards right now.
---
Since he said he fought the SBQ, I'm going to guess fissure prime
---
I saw a post on there yesterday titled "I'm furious with Fallout76" and body of the post was like, 'everyone told me this game was awful so i went into it expecting a buggy ass mess, but 2/10 runs too well, too much fun and wayyy too not buggy for my taste.' üòÇ everyone was like Awwww Fack ya got me! Lol
---
Yeah I dont care about that. By the time everyone is doing it I will have the armor skin. I'm 1/3 of the way there already.
---
There are mutliple cards that can make NW way easier to win, which is just dumb. It's annoying that I get 10 duplicates in a row while others get perks that let rifles ignore armor etc.
---
Yeah the dailies in this game are horrid.
---
I‚Äôd say just do the ones you need for platinum trophy, and don‚Äôt do the rest. Not worth the headache most of the time
---
It's saved my skin more than once. But it is pretty weak.
---
The next time you are in there, try to hear the sound of the narrator when you zone in. He‚Äôll give a brief run down of what you are doing and why, subtitles might help. Then grab a conduit if you haven‚Äôt before. You‚Äôll take minor damage that you can easily Stimpak through.
---
Once all three conduits are activated, the boss is then vulnerable. It‚Äôs an Assaultron on steroids. You can easily angle/strafe tank her. Her laser also does burning damage, and can easily one shot a good deal of players in conjunction with her melee. 
---
Watch out for the Gutsies, and kite the boss in a circle, and you are all set. 
---
Sneaky types, squat on the barn and aim for stuff that‚Äôs aggro‚Äôd on melee/cqc, and of course the boss when she is vulnerable. 
---
That‚Äôs basically it. As to WHY, there‚Äôs a pretty fun story line that I won‚Äôt post here because of spoilers. The narrator sums up the basic fight, though.
---
No, if your in an enemy thick zone like the Whitesprings, which is what I feel like this post is about, your compass will just be littered with x's.
---
Unless they have changed something recently, you can get the pie from those machines. I have gotten five since I began playing. You have to point your reticule at the small metal door to the lower right of the glass dome and it will be in there. Again, something may have changed of which I‚Äôm not aware or you may have encountered a disappearing loot bug.
---
They are random in my experience
---
Only launched my first one to complete the quests and celebrate level 100.
---
So I do share your emotions. 
---
This is my first char, since beta, played almost daily - just slow pace (literally: did a lot of traveling, always encumbered, never outgunned).
---
As far as I‚Äôm aware it‚Äôs all random. Though not sure if it‚Äôs a case of being randomly anywhere, or if it‚Äôs specific spawn locations and power armour spawns in a random number of those locations

(I spent way too long doing this I don‚Äôt know why I try)
---
I've been here since launch but been back and forth because I've wanted the game to be more than it was, and I'm really happy to see it evolving back so I'm back for the long run (I'm also getting back into ESO so good bye time)
---
Yeah I suppose. If there was a minimap my idea would work. And I stole it from RDR.
---
Well you're fucking it up for everyone else by supporting this kind of play style. Also I wouldn't be so sure. This isn't some cutting edge thought, it's a natural conclusion that most anyone with an IQ above 50 is going to come to, but it's also bad for the game mode in literally every way.
---
RIP CAMP budget
---
I mean I left but just because I like to play other games. I've probably finished a dozen or more games since I Platinumed 76.
---
Always remember, never forget...
---
Where was that?
---
Lmao. So offended. It's a game, calm yourself.
---
Yeah I just kinda stopped caring about launching a nuke. Lol
---
Know exactly where I have to nuke to get the most of those?
---
There is also a bunch buy the nuke plant south of Flatwoods.
---
yeah i'd love to bring my Firestarter Uniform and policeman shades into the BR so i can look my part
---
Take off the vault suit and hop from bush to bush. If you find a naked ginger with a cowboy hat thats me
---
I'm not offended, I'm trying to let you know the reality of the situation.
---
Don't feel bad. I've been here since beta and I'm level 27... First and only character!
---
Asshole
---
I have a love-hate relationship with this game.
---
I have been around since Day 1 of the BETA on PS4.
---
It doesn‚Äôt fix the problem every time, but pressing E to make the connection (start with space) does help.
---
If you don't find it there ft to other locations, i found mine at the miners monument after going to the tea pot.
---
‚ÄúAdhesive is scarce‚Äù ... what? Tato‚Äôs, corn and mutfruit are in easy locations early on. Tatos and mutfruit are in Flatwoods and corn is near the silva homestead. Combine those with easily obtainable purified water and BOOM, you have yourself an adhesive farm. It‚Äôs fallout 101
---
Like the other poster mentioned hit whitesprings ( maybe even twice) for the fluids and mass. Don't worry too much about the Flux on those runs. After that do a dedicated flux run with green thumb equipped to get the type of flux your looking for.
---
If you feel you were duped into buying it, that's your own fault. You got to play it a week before release. There's no way you didn't know what you were buying. If you didn't that's your fault. The beta was broken as shit. Everyone knew. Even if you hadn't played, if you had watched one video, you would've known the state it was in. You made a poor consumer decision. That's not my fault nor Bethesdas. How could you possibly not know what you were getting?
---
FaLloUt 76 is PaY To WiN!!111
---
and the reason for that? repair kits allow you to repair your guns ... its not like there is another way to get literally BETTER repair kits.
---
I had that conversation in the fallout radio chat earlier ... also fallout 76 is bad because it has bugs, what bugs you ask? well he dosnt know either.
---
If you want to feel young again pay them a visit, the place is a time capsule.

Ok, just making sure someone didn‚Äôt know some super secret nuke spot. Thanks!

If anyone who‚Äôs ‚Äúreviewing‚Äù something,  or ‚Äúinfluencing‚Äù the easily influenced,  they‚Äôve immediately compromised themselves the minute they ask for likes and shares.  If you‚Äôre actually curious what was meant.  No critic who‚Äôs ever wrote for an accredited publication has ever asked their readers to share if they ‚Äúliked‚Äù their review.  
---
Shaking them off and thinking for yourself can be extremely liberating‚Äî but that‚Äôs the influenced people‚Äôs decision to make.
---
If only there was some way to periodically force all the players to move towards each other until they're so close they can hear each other's breathing...
---
You can already switch between 2 favorited weapons with the ledt D-pad.
---
I would like a way to exchange duplicates, but in some instances I like them.  For instance I have Lone wanderer in 2 and 4 stars that I swap when I am going to fast travel so I can add travel agent and hard bargain.
---
You can add me tinmuffin94
---
That's how it is which is why I still don't encounter this problem but others on pc do some how.
---
Just stay in and around whitespring, less than one full run will level you up. I‚Äôm building my second character and went from 15 to 51 in a only few days, fast xp and Legendaries, what not to like.
---
No, I dont have those cards yet
---
And I'm letting you know that all I care about is getting those sweet sweet skins.
---
I am... lazy. I find ways to use things inappropriately to improve my quality of life.
---
Yup me to dude,nw nw nw nw...but glad its positive tho!
---
üôåüèª since beta (although it has definitely gotten better)
---
I couldn't love this game at launch. It wasn't finished. I can't love a $60 beta. Not a chance. I like it more now, but there's still a lot of work ahead of Bethesda to finish this game.
---
I wonder what would have broken its arms?  I had just arrived and no one else was near
---
I feel like people of all levels across the board don‚Äôt understand this event. Seriously, I rarely do the event as is, but I feel bad for the person who wasted his/her recall card and the imposter was barely down past a quarter of their health
---
Saw my first one go off last night. Went from a dozen players down to like four üòÇ then a damn mob took my last bit of health. Snuck up behind me I made it so far only to die in a dumb way.
---
I too have trouble with the scotch beast, especially Dalwhinnie
---
 I am sure more will becoming since that is how Bethesda is going to make money going forward.
---
The Scotch beast is known for having the Drunken Fist
---
special points in NW are tied to your adventure mode character.  
---
you gotta move em in adventure mode and theyll change in NW
---
You have to level up I'm adventure mode
---
I assume you're also recording holotapes while hiding?
---
What does that mean?
---
It's a doddle with a melee build, solo at 50 no problem, no weapon breakage. I was worried, but once done you wonder why you waited.
---
Sheepsquatch is harder...
---
Same here, played a couple of days without crashes, but yesterday twice.
---
Anywhere that has a lot of enemy density will work but I think whitesprings would be your best bet.
---
 We few, *we happy few*, we *band of campers :)*
---
a cool feature would be a friend chat in PIP-BOY, since it would even fit the games setting and not be imersion braking
---
Note to add I mean the scortch beast queen sorry wasn't clear what I meant
---
Just returning the favor usually!
---
Since day one of the Xbox stress test. I still love it
---
What's the level your trying to fight or is it the queen?
---
Yeah, same. I've only got a few kills so far, but most of them were done from a rather large distance and from the safe end of a sniper rifle. The minute I start going full Rambo, I die.
---
Get 3 points in every stat. Then decide what you want to do. Respeccing special points in this game sucks :(
---
Have fun...I love the shit out of this game!
---
I‚Äôm on PS4, but if you‚Äôre on the same platform I would definitely play with you. You won‚Äôt regret buying the game, it‚Äôs less than $20 in most places right now.
---
Dammit I couldn't get my joke in üòÇ
---
I Think you accidentally wrote scotch and not scorch my man. 
---
Sorry but it‚Äôs a little funny. They‚Äôre just friendly fkn with u üòÜüòÜ
---
Yup, validated that many times over the last couple of days. Win smarter, not sweaty harder.
---
I‚Äôve not managed to live long enough to even figure out how to launch one. I think I found some codes once.
---
Every mod has a disclaimer, but I wouldn't expect audio mods to ban you.
---
yep, yep
---
I got it earlier today.
---
Oof. All roads always lead back to editing the .ini file with this game.
---
Ahhh yes, bugthesda hits again. Hope you weren‚Äôt dancing around like a fool like me
---
Yes...mainly about my annoying family and my periods
---
You need 4 nuke codes and the nuke briefcase then you use the briefcase from your inventory to launch it
---
Oh yeah I knew that was coming üòÇ I am gonna re post it I just noticed I am a reddit newbie lol
---
Fortunately I started playing again about 3-4 weeks ago. Got absolutely addicted, no chance in sight of this kinda update so I know I was playing for all the right reasons. Just coincidence I guess that these updates and announcements came rolling out like crazy. I‚Äôll still play the base game over the BR.
---
I agree. Think I did this quest when I was just over lvl 70. I thought I could handle it, seeing as how I've already managed to survive multiple Scorched Earth events. But damn, I got my ass kicked every which way the first time I tried it.
---
Thanks buddy
---
Me too brother.. me too üòÇüòÜ
---
Well, punctuation is import, especially when... Oh wait, you mean something else. Nevermind.
---
Placebo effect slider. Bethesda is ridiculous for this game.
---
Just caught out by this as well since the blue shows up too much and I don't do naked or clownish costumes.
---
Different weapon types use different stats so it's difficult to do a base build without having to reassign points later. Weapons work as follows:
---
Strength: Melee, heavy weapons, shotguns
---
Perception: Rifles, autorifles.
---
Intelligence: Explosives
---
Agility: Pistols, autopistols.
---
There are perks in other stats that fill out a build but those are your basic ones to start. Also whether you plan on using power armor heavily will play a part as they use quite a few perks too.
---
From the location I assume he ran up on the rocket launcher mole miner. The splash dmg killed the miner and broke the mutants arms.
---
What now?
---
It was meant to say enhanced actually lol but I was too lazy to change it.
---
Thanks!  The problem I foresee with swimming is that I don't play with other people so it would be a challenge to revive someone in the water. Thanks for the suggestions!
---
This is good to know.
---
I've done the same. I think because it isn't an "outfit" it doesn't count. Wish that was made clear.
---
Thank you all for lesson üòÇ I heard reddit was brutal to people who don't spell stuff correctly so I am grateful to get off lightly
---
I can, but do I want to?
---
In general, the western revolver does a good bit more damage. The .44 is good until you are able to get the western Plans/find a legendary variant. I think both sets of plans are sold at the sunnytop station bot, at least level 20 (?)
---
That is a spawn point for a two faction battle, have seen super mutants, scortched, sheepsquatch, deathclaws, gulpers, and sometumes robots there battling. There's also an event there guaranteed to spawn scortched, it can get chaotic especially for lower level players
---
Alright, thank you.
---
Same(ish) areas on a random chance, but lets not spoil the pleasure of grinding the discovery process by publishing stuff.
---
Referring to the latest updates since Dallas is doing the main work on that, no?
---
I enjoy your sarcasm, but that doesn't stop the intervening 15 minutes from being boring AF and reducing how fun the game mode is in general.
---
Currently unless you have something along the lines of a two-shot legendary with some other beefy modifiers, there‚Äôs no point going with any specific build. I had a two-shot western revolver that was good on paper but was a waste of time when used in combat. 
---
I went rifleman/stealth sniper and without a perfectly rolled legendary, I‚Äôm next to useless. If you want to RP a gunslinger then it has its place but if you‚Äôre interested in killing anything, I‚Äôd look into a different build.
---
They‚Äôre like little Bambi‚Äôs, shaky legs and just eager to get shooting.
---
How do I accumilate more points for this?
---
Does it tell you anywhere if i've got any to assign?
---
Thanks for the response.
---
No, you don't need stimpaks for it
---
Well, it forces you to be completely still and has a limited range, as well as moving very slow... it‚Äôs probably a non-issue.
---
Sell them for 10 atoms for 5 tomatoes.
---
No smoking, please. Alcohol in small doses is good for your health and drugs in game are fictional.
---
PS4! Depends on the server I suppose
---
I'm not that much discovering anymore. I notice i'm avoiding spawning at places that everyone seems to choose to spawn at.
---
But it would sound logical that pa's spawn around certain points on the map.
---
You were handing out stimpacks like candy then huh, it feels good
---
There's a bigger chance of you getting killed doing this than it actually working out as intended.
---
I also preordered this version and love the game to death, only taken breaks here and there. However the perks of the 20 extra dollars was not worth it. I don‚Äôt even think I use any of it
---
I get so mad when teammates emote in NW. Yes everyone, as of now emotes are seen by all, not just your team.
---
*stands up* Hello, my name is Nihilatr, and I am a returning player. I left fallout 76, my game of 4 months, for a more attractive game, which was nothing but an Instagram filter. Please take me back, I promise not to leave for another game. I hear you're getting companions...
---
front page yesterday was literally a post about how he decided to try the game for the first time, and in the FIRST 10 MINUTES OF PLAYING, he got stuck in the ground, fell through the world, had the game crash and about 5 other game breaking bugs.
---
The comments are even calling out his bullshit. But that didn't stop it from getting front page.
---
I don‚Äôt mind it being disabled if we get to carry a camera but it would be a shame not to have the ability to capture pic‚Äôs, I took a pic at the edge of the fire ring trying to get something artistic and tbh I didn‚Äôt think there was much range or advantage to having it in terms of spying what‚Äôs around but I guess it depends where and when it‚Äôs used.
---
I have achieved level 26 so far using this method. Also take your vaultec jumpsuit off. better camouflage.
---
To do the free states you must do rose. I believe you can do brotherhood by getting to fort defiant. You can skip straight to enclave however
---
If you're on ps4 I'll take that offer lol
---
Just don't emote in NW.
---
Ever.
---
Pretty small circle, but we were pretty spread out, rocks between us etc.
---
I've seen that at the white spring. They're in their sleeping on the floor position but sliding around dealing damage still. I've seen this with players who nap at my camp too. They slide all over my camp, doing stuff while "sleeping". It's pretty funny to watch sometimes, lol. Otherwise I've had the disappearance thing happen a bit lately, especially when trying to collect bug parts.
---
There‚Äôs a chance! Did you fast travel back to a very sad looking camp where I dropped more loot?
---
Hold touch pad down, pull right stick back
---
Hold the button that switches you to 3rd person and then move the right thumbstick to adjust it.
---
Heyoo!! Still playing it in my down time even if that isn't a lot but never stopped
---
Have fun! If you ever need a buddy to explore Appalachia with, make a post about it. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have a good amount of people willing to help out their fellow Vault Dweller. :)
---
Yawn.
---
You just need scotch guard. Keeps painful stains away too.
---
Hold in the touch pad button and pull back on the right stick. Cold be the left stick? Try both sticks :D
---
Right? Kids watch the dumbest shit these days
---
Thanks for the info. Guess il just stick with my stealth commando then.
---
Do special points affect your stats in nuclear winter, or just access to perk cards?
---
I did this my first time this week too. Definitely worth the time and ammo but my entire server was made up of free week newbies so I got squashed by SBQ
---
And now we can't use the mod either because of Nuclear Winter
---
This post could only come from a true responder :)
---
Is this going to become another "only 90's kid will remember" kind of thing?
---
Most of the stations would just be people screaming slurs or playing meme music.
---
Feel free to add me: phinfan007. I'm always willing to help!
---
This would be more dope than a good hit of jet.
---
Read it again man.
---
We should have the text chat on the pipboy as a separate tab. I think it would fit well within the game.
---
I'm using a custom ini file whit some optimization and since then it does not really crash
---
I‚Äôve been running a VATS Gunslinger/Shotgun build since launch. The western revolver deals better damage but has less mods available for it, while the .44 has more mods and is easier to find so you can collect mods from scrapping extras. Gunslinger builds work, but the key to using pistols is sneak and VATS for full damage potential, otherwise you will be spamming a lot of shots.
---
Bummer. Any lost items/phantom weight?
---
This sub in a nutshell right here.
---
"Oh, what, personal preference? How about you just stop having that personal preference and just like the game?"
---
I am playing the tuba as loud as I can for your enjoyment!
---
This is why they're are explosives. Puts an end to the bunny hop real fast. Leave it in the game, it's just another factor to deal with imo.
---
Yes if you like grindy games, you‚Äôll find plenty to grind for in this one. I‚Äôve been playing since release and made it a goal a long time ago to collect all plans. Here I am, 970hrs later and I still don‚Äôt have them all. But the hunt for all the loot is fun and RNG is fair. Not always, but mostly
---
Text chat would make it *so* much easier to find people to run events and trade with.
---
That‚Äôs awesome! The one thing I‚Äôve built up is my camp, it‚Äôs a beaut.
---
Because it counts as under armour it‚Äôs not currently available in NW, if you‚Äôve only just purchased it contact Bethesda support under atom shop - I did not get my stuff and see if they will refund you the atoms, just explain it was purchased for NW and it was unavailable to you in this mode and that was the only reason for buying it, you never know you might be lucky and get the atoms back. It‚Äôs always important to do it ASAP after purchase though so they can see it was a mistake or the item wasn‚Äôt what was expected, good luck
---
Ron Swanson when he's finally turnt
---
Yeah, I see your point. But I have to admit I prefer a sneaky play style. Did the same in the few matches of Fortnite I played.
---
But I think the odds are pretty good that not all 52 players are going to be sneaky campy bush-dwellers so as long as enough people are actively hunting the other people, I think it'll work.
---
Love to!
---
Well done! Welcome to the wasteland
---
You can have your personal preference, but why should Bethesda cater to a minorities personal preference?
---
I just cannot wait until all these new guys are 50+. Then the game will get super fun. Once they can take part in nukes and high level events.
---
Literally would be amazing ! Except for the creatures that come out of the fog üëÄ
---
Played from day one. Been playing less over the past few months, but I ordered the new Scuf today and can't wait to dive back in when I get it üòç
---
I don't like talking to people on mic, personally. 
---
I also hate to be that guy, but most of my female friends who play games prefer text chat because as soon as they get on mic a bunch of sexist shit starts getting thrown at them. 
---
I'd like to think this community is better than that, but I'm not sure this game is an exception to that.
---
The more played the stronger it is from my understanding
---
Go to the challenges menu, it should list how many hours out of 7600 you have.
---
I‚Äôve always supported the game. Only times I left was when I was playing other games with friends, like battlefield for MC
---
I‚Äôm lvl 234 and still haven‚Äôt personally and manually launched my own nuke yet..
---
Yeah i found three and god im just tryna farm a BoS Underarmor plan but no luck
---
I did some searching and found this website:  [https://downdetector.com/status/fallout](https://downdetector.com/status/fallout) 
---
I wonder if enough people reported connection problems here, they would eventually get more attention from Bethesda?
---
Saw another post with the same thing happening to the slocum's joe PA paint, so probably an issue with all the NW paints
---
Bought on launch day but never made it out of the forest. Started a new game with my friend who got it while it was half off and we're having an absolute blast. Level 16 and climbing
---
I'm level 107 and I, too, am afraid to try a bunker run üò≠
---
If you like grindy games, and the feel and tone of Fallout, then absolutely! FWIW, if you can wait a couple days for shipping, you can get the game pretty cheap now - It was on GameFly for $10, and I've seen it on Amazon and eBay in the $15 to $25 range. Now that it isn't $60, and they've fixed almost all of the major bugs, I definitely feel comfortable recommending it to all my buds.
---
How about a brewable drink that gives the glow effect some FO4 mods did? I only run into the problem every once in a while, so a drink or drug you can pop seems fair.
---
I‚Äôve seen 4 or 5 static spawns in watoga, and it seems there is always at least one active (with pieces and a core). Fort Defiance has a spawn for a set upstairs, as well as a mod. Trainyards (not the stations) seem to often have at least one set somewhere. Those are all the of frequently spawning areas I can think of. Hope this helps!
---
You need to scrap, not store, your vendors. Take note of how much weight is in your stash, as this may change for some reason. Then you need to remove each item from your stash that was in a vendor. You'll notice that anything in a stack which was split between the vendor and your stash will now be in two stacks in your stash. Pick up the biggest stack first, and it will take the small stack (lol, I know). Then take the remaining stack and they will (hopefully) combine as normal. Rebuild your vending machines and hook up power before filling them. Depending on how much junk/aid/ammo you had, this can take a while. Check your stash and compare your weight with what you had before. You could have phantom weight now.
---
Only your access to perk points, I believe.
---
Idk actually i think settlers
---
Been here for all but 3 days due to a ban
---
I sell you a quad western pistol on the cheap if on PC.
---
Been in it since beta and bought it for $80 so I hoped it was worth my money. You have to just roll with it and finish the early low level quests and level up and than the world starts expanding and the experience is truly better.
---
If you've been playing NW a lot, it also earns EXP for your character in adventure mode. So, pop over to that mode - You've probably gained a couple levels, with a couple of points to spend.
---
People can play however they prefer. That's what happens when you play again actual people. There is nothing inherently bad about a different style of play.
---
You can add me too! PST as well, on PSN as ezra_marcel.
---
Can't wait for wastelanders. Battle royale is not really my thing. But I'm super psyched for the wastelanders Update.
---
Rad-x  for the rads, and stimpacks counteract the dmg
---
Yea but I can't switch to a psycho or a radaway I have to either deal with the wheel or go into pip boy. All I'm saying is reimplemented the option for the same D-pad that was in FO4. Just keep the emotes on down and a wheel since those are time/combat sensitive.
---
The lack of self awareness in this sub is incredible.
---
I dont think its a server problem by itself, just that the inbuilt protection to stop multiple people from using the same account is poorly programmed.
---
There is no reason to discourage a valid play tactic.
---
Meant to reply to OP's offer of 5k caps and a free gun
---
Their hate-roided forearms are mighty
---
Thanks! But it‚Äôs been my week off work, and this week (so far) I‚Äôve put more hours into NW than my regular job lol!
---
Greetings!
---
Just so you know if you don‚Äôt have rank two if starched genes you can lose these mutations with radaway or gain unwanted mutations from rad exposure. I don‚Äôt think you can get that rank perk card until around 40-50? Anyway, just a heads up since you said you were low level.
---
Same handle as this one.
---
We‚Äôre just a big ol‚Äô family
---
When the punching stops thats how I know its map selection time lol
---
Absolutely!
---
Will do!
---
What is a diffused stimpack im lvl 95 and still dont get what everybody is talking about
---
Only if you think so
---
Are you on PC ??
---
Sounds like it would be an advantage on paper, but in practice it would be more detrimental than helpful given the range and having to sit still while doing it.
---
Seems it
---
Might I have been me. I have a video. I‚Äôll link it [here](https://gamerdvr.com/gamer/omaha-beach/video/76009843)
---
I've been defeated often by Lagavulin the Destroyer of Memory
---
I love the game but it run like crap on my computer T_T I wanna play it T_T
---
Fo4 had the car capsule mod too. I'm really missing mods in 76.
---
Hello,I've got all the Serums availables for 200 caps each.
---
I'm in Ps4 
---
Psn LosXorbos if interested.
---
Hah, I did that.  My wife was like.  Ahhh its not big deal. When it starts people will come help.  So I figure like the SBQ.   
---
I start it LASERS TO THE FACE!!!  Dead...dead...dead...  Two people came and died too.  WTF Hun???
---
Gotta ask, how do you manage it? I‚Äôve never bought the game and frankly I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôll touch it with a stick of any length, but I‚Äôve seen full playthroughs and tons of video‚Äôs of 76. How do you find any pearl of joy in the empty oyster that is 76?
---
I know, I'm just preparing to have the right ones when I get to 50. Been hell finding them. And thanks a lot for the response.
---
I have luck finding serum vendors up by the Hunting Lodge.
---
Also check in for free power armor skins
---
"Valid" is whatever the devs decide to reward to improve gameplay
---
Yes, I agree somewhat, not everyone is great or even ‚Äòok‚Äô at pvp, so this style of sneaking and buying time does work, I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt nerf it, BUT do increase the kill XP by 4-5 times what it is now, that way all play styles can be used to progress no matter what your abilities are.
---
He‚Äôs talking about nuclear winter.
---
Totally! There is a middle ground here which is highly tactical. You run out guns blazing and gain attention you die...sneak, assess your enemies position(s), and wait for the right opportunity. I usually end a game with 1-3 kills, each of which are highly planned and satisfying.
---
My favorite so far was last night - was in a tiny safe zone with 2 vs 1 against me. I was riding the edge of the flames while they were distracted by the scorchbeast. Waited until one of them was very low on health from that fight, popped a single shot and downed him, then backed into hiding leaving him alive as bait. Waited until the sb flew a little away and popped my stealth boy. Sure enough, his partner went for a revive, and I was right there with a Gatling to end the game.
---
So much more satisfying than any other pvp experience I‚Äôve ever had
---
I am indeed, edited to add that.
---
Well there is a none functioning time machine in the game already. So it could already be part of the long term plan.
---
In the FWIW column, I have a suppressors explosive 44 w/ scope.
---
Melee build, no pistol perks, not under the influence of any food/drugs, no vats.
---
  Was at my camp when a pack of glowing mongrel dogs decided to attack same.
---
Took 3 shots to take out a L60 glowing mongrel.
---
Kills should be worth more and damage given should be worth exp. Maybe even damage taken?
---
I completely missed that..oops. Well, do with my info what you will. My bad.
---
I find most people leave me alone there as well. punching seems reduced
---
Don't nerf it, no. But we don't want everyone to be passively camping because it rewards better, that's all I'm saying.
---
Settlers. My 2 characters so far are good guys and would like to help Appalachia. Seeing settlements survive and grow would be good.
---
Might make another character who likes chaos and anarchy if a raider faction comes along though.
---
No, valid is whatever reasonable and logical tactics are employed by the players to achieve the goal of the game. It's all about being the last to survive.
---
I‚Äôm just trying to find a way to introduce new maps in either the same time or in the future to get the factions from other fallout games into the game without breaking too much lore
---
Nah he won‚Äôt get downvoted because it‚Äôs true. Any reasonable person knows this game has had issues but that doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be enjoyed
---
Well done at level 8 üëç The first time I saw it I was like level 15 and I ran for my life...
---
Exactly this, me personally doesn't like it and find it very hard to master, specially the full "construction frenzy shit". 
---
However it isn't a bad game, and the developers hit the jackpot by appealing to the best target audience (10-18 years old and streamers).
---
That's what made it popular, and at the same time the most hated game, without any rational reason.
---
Is there a proper reason why they don't want to add text chat in survival mode? An official response or something, because i would like to see their response to it.
---
Played beta, didnt like the bugs, left, played free trial and love what theyve done so ive bought the game. Fucking love nuclear winter
---
I want this too.  It's annoying having to comb thru thick grass for the stingwings youve julled with your mini nukes.
---
Awesome accomplishment. 15k bullets is rough though. Are you shooting her in the air or only when she lands? I run a melee on the queen. Must have been 150 levels and 100 queens ago since I last shot her with a gun.
---
Yes it was, but in the end the feeling not accomplishment was whelming.
---
Give us spawn points damn it!
---
You can add me, same psn as here.  I play a few times a week, I‚Äôm in central time zone.  Currently level 90, but more of a casual player so open to helping out.
---
Have a play style in mind. When I started it was heavy weapons build. I wanted to be power armor tank. So I built my special around this.  But then moved in perks more toward two handed weapons. Because ammo problems in the wasteland at first. 
---
At this point my special is stuck where it needs to be to maximize my two handed/heavy weapon combo. But I have since switched it up to an unarmored sneaky sniper build to have fun. But I‚Äôm able to keep special going the same. Because I love my heavy/melee goto
---
So my thing is think of the optimal play style for u to have a good time. Because frankly all different play styles are needed and can be very good.  So do u want to be solo blaster, team player, pve, pvp, etc. playstyles. Then choose a weapon class and go for it.  This is how I planned it out. (I told my self. I wanted to run in power armor with a .50 cal machine gun). 
---
So tell us what playstyle/weapon you are thinking and then some people can help with a SPECIAL setup based on perks and stats needed
---
Oh okay! Neat information. I hope they‚Äôll use it for this then üòÜ
---
Do it!!!
---
Yeah, FO76 has done a serious 180 in stark contrast to Anthem. I still don't like it, but I understand why some people might enjoy it.
---
Just do it!!!
---
No prob just didn‚Äôt want you spending all your caps on something you might lose with your next dose of radaway!! Good luck finding what you‚Äôre needing!
---
Killed two low level bounties, I dropped their junk so they could recover....but I did keep the screws...sorry, need to finish my XO1.
---
Who are you going to believe? This sub or your lying eyes?
---
Ever since unlocking the first room I haven't dealt with punches once. There's like some unspoken bound that the higher Overseer ranks don't attack each other in the lobby
---
Watch out for ancient bowmore of the bog and smoke
---
IGN UCHITH
---
Add me and ft to me ill get them free
---
Id say 6k is way too much, realistically only a jetpack and calibrated shocks would be wanted by people, and shocks go for like 1-2k for both, and a jetpack now like 500 since theyre easier to get
---
Of course they don't, there too busy posting on reddit about how to avoid getting punched!
---
Absolutely, the way I suggested about buffing kill XP would balance it all out, if you want to progress a lot faster... start shooting! üëç
---
Honestly, I've played fortnight and CoD. Don't care for them. Haven't played apex or any others.
---
I see you are also a master of the grenade launcher jump and shoot
---
If the legendary effect doesnt show up In the stats then it wont work
---
Sent
---
On console its pretty slow I noticed, it's pretty smooth on PC though.
---
Ive used it as a sort of surveillance for CAMP while the vendors are on &amp; it's use in versus immediately crossed my mind. Not so much I'd use it but that it could be used advantageously.
---
Woop woop!
---
Yeah, I was one of the people who thought the game was total shit when it came out. I'd never played it but everybody and their grandmother was talking about how terrible *everything* was. 
---
Maybe it was, but as somebody who started playing during the free week I don't know how a lot of these complaints are still kicking. After Morrowind this is my favourite Bethesda world space. I've had more fun exploring 76 than Oblivion, FO3, FO4 (or NV), and Skyrim. I still can't be fucked to muddle through terminal logs, they're a bloody chore, but holotapes are actually worth listening to. 
---
The story is nonexistent but let's be honest, as long as Emile (sp?) is the lead writer we might as well just do this. Every story he works on is unmitigated fucking trash, the only thing it does is give you markers and reasons to wander around the map. Guy can't write his way out of an unlocked room. The quests in 76 do the same job and we aren't subjected to his drivel, so honestly I'd rather they do this if the alternative is him penning the plot. 
---
I should say though the only reason I gave this game a shot (and I think a gigantic part of why I like it) is because of the NPCs coming. Without that I never would have tried it.
---
You're in the minority not players who want text chat. That is the point.
---
lols I miss those moments
---
I hope there is a way to do both, Ill make a second character if I have to.
---
I'm not a techie but I think what people commonly refer to server crashes in here are weaknesses in Bethesda's software. Software can be fixed. The site I linked to would be a way to give better feedback to Bethesda. Maybe that would help them fix their programs.
---
It is fine for people to not enjoy a certain iteration of a game, especially one like FO76 where it is a drastic change in how it plays compared to past games. The franchise has been around for \~21 years now and the 10 games based around the universe have been made by three major developers (five total), which has lead to a variety in gameplay which not everyone will enjoy. I have read some really good discussion on r/Fallout about changes people would have like to see made that would help soften the transition between previous games or to expand some aspects back to their previous robustness in past games (like dialogue options). Though there will always be people who will hate the game for what it is or their delusion of what they think the game is because they heard some person on Youtube say it was trash once. Hell, I even saw a comment today saying FO76 was clunkier than FO3 and NV which I found quite comical...  
---
Game ratings are often static meaning they get whatever they get on launch and the site usually just leaves it that way and moves to the next new game. There are a few game rating sites that have running reviews but most people just look for a number on Metacritic or IGN and make a decision on that or word of mouth. I doubt FO76's tarnished launch reviews will be lifted unless a major re-review comes out from a major journal or something. This leaves them somewhat reliant on word of mouth reviews of the game getting better, hence why marketing did a free week event to let people see for themselves at no monetary risk.
---
PvP build?
---
Posting on reddit while waiting in the inner chambers of Vault 51 is a rite of passage
---
I've actually renewed my driver's license at the Charleston DMV in real life before.  I found that quest to be accurate and unembellished.
---
I think i've figured it out. The levelling up screen in adventure mode looked to me like I was just swapping cards out when actually it increased my stats. Kinda bullshit system imo coming as a complete newbie. So does it assign you a random stat point from levelling EXP or is there a method to focus on increasing one specific stat like perception?
---
Is it? You don‚Äôt see the icon above peoples head if they‚Äôre not in your team in the lobby, thought it was the same in game.
---
*Raises hand!* Pre-ordered and have been playing almost everyday since beta. 636 hrs in!
---
I am definitely a hide and seek type BR player and only play solo. Last night I finally won a solo game!  Came down to me and a guy in power armor who must play the same way as I do. It took forever for one of us to kill the other. We just jumped around shooting and slashing each other, mainly missing... It was comical.
---
That‚Äôs what I thought.
---
Glad to hear you for sure have to change your play style but people saying it isn‚Äôt viable I disagree with
---
You have been reported
---
I just add chems/grenades together on the right side of my wheel. Makes selecting them a bit faster.
---
For what? :‚ÄôL
---
I found 3 codes and a briefcase once. My teammate gave me the last code needed. Then I died. :(
---
Witch hunting
---
Breaking several rules of the sub. Go read the rules.
---
LOL
---
having said that, game needs text, but really a LOT of folk are being shy and 99% of the time it is unwarranted. I'm pretty outgoing and would LOVE more people replying :)
---
Please buy mics, and although Lloyd here made a funny, the 20$ wal mart headset is trash and will make you sound like a serial killer. Def pay 40$+ if you can afford, it's an investment that will last a few years and enrich your playing! of anything online, not just FO76
---
About a speed. You can find mutation that makes you move faster, yi think 50% faster or more. About the aim, can't help you here, maybe he is hacker or maybe he just had that mutation for speed
---
Quad westerns are great. It's what my gunslinger uses.
---
I saw the Stalemate notification. On the post fight summary report it listed me as coming in second. 
---
I had assumed it was a tie for second. Which is weird, because usually you‚Äôd tie for first and the next folks would be ranked third. But now I‚Äôm wondering if the Stalemate notification was a bug and it wasn‚Äôt a tie at all. Or maybe, we died simultaneously but they had more kills?
---
Power armor has always been kind of iffy especially when a scorched can scratch it's way through it.
---
all my friends dipped and i was already at pvp endgame, then all my stuff got nerfed. Been fun to check out every once in a while though, glad to see where its going
---
*removed*
---
I was up by the house of scares
---
just general play, probably some pvp but not specifically.
---
We at r/76raiders are very much looking forward to paying the settlers a visit.
---
That sounds intense! I love moments like that, where you just pull together and do some crazy lone survivor stuff haha.
---
Idk I have the same question
---
Nah probably a hacker. The amount of hackers in NW is insane. So many flying people with aimbot. It is Why I quit even trying, easier to just find a place to hide and go afk since you get the most xp that way since kills give very little xp.
---
It's a skin, no one knows if it goes to just one armor or all. You have to reach overseer rank 100 to get it.
---
Because I want it! Gimme gimme gimme!!!
---
I only have some diffuser (100+) that I crafted. I sell them cheap (25 each). Buy then and resell tgem for higher price if you like.
---
I even could craft more (60+).
---
PC player, I am online right now, ign same as reddit.
---
Get rid of long shot and put something else on in a different category
---
Then this would be "Yes, you don't need stimpacks."
---
It's a new thing from Project Paradise you can get a plan for, they're basically stimpaks with AoE team healing.
---
I love the game, but I wish they would un-nerf the ballistic weapons.
---
One might call it... A Hellevator?
---
I'd prefer concentrated fire in Perception. More damage and accuracy in vats. Target heads for lots of fun.
---
Is there no lvl cap?
---
It's a stim that heals you and your team. The recipe for it has a chance to drop from the new event at Arktos Pharma. Best bet might be to look out for them on player vendors, listed under Chems.
---
Bethesda, fix bugs, nice joke m8
---
You can still use VATs on creatures just not in humans..?
---
That's interesting. I wonder why.
---
Playing since beta never left game just keeps on improving.
---
  We had a rocky start but they have stuck by this game worked hard and its really showing.
---
Ye cannae tek me ya nooby sassenachs!!!
---
I've literally just posted to say I'm launching one right now. Come join, GT is Golder7
---
No Bethesda FAQ states they don't support mods because they may cause instability on your client. But not a bannable offense.
---
We'll be waiting. A good way to add more pvp to FO76.
---
It‚Äôs a weird choice of words on Reddit‚Äôs part to call it witch hunting since that implys lack of proof but yea no names are supposed to be shown to prevent mobs forming
---
No way to join a server specifically with a nuke. The issue is that the game stability has been pretty bad in the past week, probably due to all the new players, so it's not worth launching a nuke when there's a decent chance you will get disconnected before finishing it. Also far more new players means far less people capable of launching a nuke, and if you try to start a scorchbeast queen fight there will be less people to help out
---
A multiplayer game that just relies on voice-chat and emojis is not accessible. Deaf people and people who are hard of hearing exist, I wonder if Bethesda ever heard of them.  
---
I am only a bit hard of hearing, but with some of the bad headsets I can't understand anything at all. And I'd rather text people, than having to hear frantic screaming, yelling, burping, whispering and other's crying children/music/TV in the background.
---
Or you could just take down everyone in your path and win, that's how I've been going about it and it's actually fun.
---
Haha same, I went away for two weeks during the holidays and couldn‚Äôt play on my PS4. After a few days I had enough and bought another copy for PC. No regrets!
---
Okay thanks for the straight up answer . I haven‚Äôt don‚Äôt much research but remember awhile ago there was a thing about people being banned for mods .
---
Strength perk cards are where you'll get most of your weight reduction perks, your melee damage, and tankiness.  
---
It's too good to not have, imo rank it up to 11 minimum.  
---
Agility gives you more AP, endurance gives you more hp, strength gives you more carry weight and melee dmg.  
---
The perk cards in each category follow those general themes but also can grant seemingly unrelated benefits.  
---
In my experience, if you have 4 points minimum in every SPECIAL, you don't have to sacrifice much and can do just about any build you want, in adventure mode.  
---
Non build specific perks you'll likely want at some point:  
---
Strength: Blocker, all the weight reduction cards.  
---
Perception:  Glow sight, concentrated fire, green thumb  
---
Endurance: Radicool, Fireproof, LifeGiver  
---
Charisma: Inspirational, Lone Wander  
---
Intelligence: Batteries Included  
---
Agility: Evasive, Dodgy, Adrenaline, Action boy/girl  
---
Luck: Starched genes, Bloody mess  
---
Last but not least, the best piece of advice i can give for a fresh start is this.  If you can mange getting to level 50 before opening any of your perk packs, do it.  When you open up your perk packs at level 50, the perks you receive are much better and will save you a lot of time in the long run.  You'll get less duplicate cards and more higher level req cards.  And because it takes longer to level up later, you save a lot of time in getting to your preferred character build.  With this method you can be full build at like level 70 rather than 130.  Makes your early level not as convenient but it pays off big time.  
---
Battle royale mode is different but still uses one of your character special stats, and has some card that require 9 in a stat to equip some of the best cards.  So it's probably worth having a build in adventure that actually meant for the other game mode.
---
possibly a nuclear blast on top of a rad storm
---
I saw one with a level 9 with a bounty as well so I killed him and then I team invited him and built his camp up with some sweet stuff.
---
I bought the game on black friday but I've been playing steady since then.
---
Jumping in general should consume AP, frog legs jumping should consume more. The whole thing is ridiculous. I‚Äôve been loving the overall feel of NW, but when I run into a whole team bunny hopping all over the place it just looks so dumb‚Äîand they do it with or without Frog Legs. 
---
I understand that‚Äôs a common tactic in other BR‚Äôs, but Fallout should have a unique feel.
---
It‚Äôs called a Stimpack Diffuser and the plan to create it can be randomly obtained by doing the Project Paradise event at Arktos Pharma. When used, it heals you and any teammates within a certain radius of you.
---
I'm at 47 wins now and I'm only fighting when I have to. This is working just fine for me.
---
I don't know if it's the same thing, but I've noticed that if I'm jumping in third person at the point when I'm reloading, it will sometimes cancel the reload, which is rather annoying when I'm dealing with Mole Rats.
---
Nice, nothing going on in adv. mode this day's, so good to see someone creating some fun :)
---
Could you drop us a line and tell how it went wen you are done, did people show up and help you against her majesty ? 
---
A few hours to early for me, if not i would have been there with my firestick :)
---
Jampie1980 @ your service!
---
so you‚Äôre saying you dont like VATS. I do t think there is anything wrong with the way it‚Äôs set up now... three different game modes with different experiences. Adventure is chill, Survival is a bit more tense/dangerous, NW is full on pvp. VATS usage scales accordingly
---
The Home Depot in so long on the nice things about m  e
---
A have a nuke key card but idk how to nuke hahah
---
Drop long shot for concentrated fire. Lets you target limbs and stack damage/hit %. Even if it's 1‚òÜ, you'll appreciate it.
---
Will do :)
---
Ah sorry XB1
---
Doubt
---
Bought the game in late November and it's still my go to game on PS4. I loved it since my first day playing and I'm excited for the last announcements!
---
I'd love to participate but I'm on pc
---
What you just said, I pray is true, Beth's track record would have my assume otherwise
---
I was seeing 1-3 each day before the free trial. 50%+ of every server now is low level players, so less nukes.
---
I was talking about NW (Nuclear Winter) :P
---
But kudos for the effort!
---
What platform? I drop 3x back to back to back all the time... so do another 30+ people in my group
---
I always laugh when you die with no clothes on under your armor. Especially when its a melee death. Your armor gets automatically unequipped on death and makes it look like you got hit so hard it knocked your clothes clean off. 
---
Kind of like when you see someone wipe out and both of their shoes come off!
---
We should have one. Wow has it, FO4 had it, Destiny has it.
---
No, don‚Äôt get me wrong I have no issue with vats, just want to start a discussion. VATs works fine for me in Survival, I can two shot most players with VATs so I won‚Äôt complain, but I like not having it in NW and was thinking it might make Survival a bit more balanced and challenging..
---
Right this is basically the ying and yang to the circlejerking of this game.
---
Just??
---
Welcome to the Responders. :D
---
Been playing since the Beta. Glad i kept with it because it helped me meet some really good friends we play this game and other games together. We also have started our own Mercenary group that we will. Advertising soon for hire in game.
---
Taking zero damage outside of the safezone? Yeah that's invulnerable glitch/hack. Go check videos on YouTube of other hackers.
---
ok, usually forget to use VATs since usually I just click heads in shooters, but since it does increase damage output not just serve as an auto-aim I can see that, would you suggest dumping to rank 3 or just 1 point and put 2 elsewhere?
---
It‚Äôs a minimal advantage for camper type play styles. Not game breaking or worth it. Found some one crouching in the bushes, at least he got a good look at my shotgun before he died.
---
You got this!! I did one at 80 you‚Äôll be finnneee
---
It's mainly because most of the server is populated with low-level players, which makes launching a nuke on the SBQ of dubious worth unless you've got some friends.  That and, yes, stability isn't great this week, probably for the same reason.
---
Do it!!! So fun, not very difficult
---
Same here! Could not be happier!
---
PC. I'd love to help out.
---
Nah you‚Äôre good! *pats on back*
---
What is ‚Äúrule 1‚Äù? That got removed? Are we not allowed to post locations?
---
::raises hand:: beta baby!
---
Just because there is 1 or 2 videos of someone using hacks doesnt mean there is am epidemic.  Was probably either a glitch or what the 2st guy said.
---
Yup, tedious, just like the real DMV.
---
Keys to the past annoys me more the Recruitment blues, simply because it is bugged and keeps sending you a couple steps backwards
---
This would make more of a purpose in hacking terminals
---
Hey, we can play sometimes if you want I am like lvl 21 or something. I have finals this 2 weeks so I wont be on much but we can play sometimes when we both have time if you want. You can add me on discord Breakdown#7100 if you wanna play sometimes together :)
---
Solid post
---
Combination of air and land to keep agro, just burst fires into air tho. Bullet count was abit high cause I was kinda testing a new gun out (Zealots rapid prime Gatling plasma) it turned out to be wildly inefficient as far as hit rate. So like atleast 5000 rounds were from that. Also alot of ammo used quelling the mobs.
---
I just use 1‚òÜ myself, you can keep longshot at 2.
---
I shouldnt say this but hacking terminals has the same weapon loot pool as scorched beasts
---
I‚Äôll sell you a ton of serums for 200 each.
---
If you play with in team, that means you don't have to deal with three more person. Always play with team.
---
I lost a scorchbeast body yesterday
---
Delete this now no one must know
---
Cool idea, but requires tons of effort on the development team.
---
I‚Äôll sell serums for 200 to those that ask nicely.
---
This mode has enough casual appeal that new players to the mode are goung to constantly pop in and out. People will inadvertently pick the same hiding spots, which will spark shootouts. You can also have your plans ruined by the sudden arrival of some super mutant hounds that can force you to give up your position. 
---
It'll be fine.
---
probably because most players that were dropping nukes regularly are playing the battle royale mode. I know this is true for me.
---
Just as an animation to make fast travel feel more immersive, not for flying around. Sorry, I thought that was obvious enough for everyone
---
Cheers!
---
There are 7 terminals in the flat woods area
---
I've only seen 2 this week. 
---
I'm suspecting it is simply down to the new players. Lots of times I've played this week there has been an overwhelming amount of lower levels, so this leads to a lower chance of nukes.
---
Add to that everyone trying out the NW content and it is a recipe for a quiet time on the nuke front.
---
Location can be really important, setting up next to a pre existing farm will mean you don‚Äôt need to repair damaged crops just pick them, doing the daily‚Äôs at Camden park will award RadAway stimpacks or purified water along with the 3 mr fuzzy tokens, down by the river where Ohio river adventures sits is a great camp spot. River adventures has a ton of steel in the form of buckets, there‚Äôs life preservers for plastic, rubber and spring, a shotgun and shells, snaptail and bloodleaf. To one side is billings homestead with a field of razor grain then just up the road silva homestead with corn, the church at the cemetery there has rat poison (3 tins) that contains steel and lead plus a spawn for a cap stash and magazine, in the other direction going to wards nuka cola there‚Äôs a greenhouse with occasional bobblehead spawn, corn and melon I think, and the barn next to it has lots junk for matts, P.A station, scorched that drop weapons you can scrap for mats. It‚Äôs easy to burn through ammo so I never shoot anything I can smack with a melee weapon, conserve ammo where you can and the perk scrounged will let you search ammo containers for more. Food wise the mutations herbivore or carnivore will give you more bang for your buck and eating will be less of a chore, just make sure you‚Äôve reached the level where you can equip starched genes max level so you don‚Äôt lose the mutation. The other thing you could do from that location is walk up to Poseidon energy as that has a lot of cap stashes and no ghouls so you could then use the caps to buy ammo from player vendors, most players sell ammo in their machines for 1 or 2 caps per bullet. On the subject of ghouls there‚Äôs only 3 weak ghouls at Ohio river adventures so they shouldn‚Äôt give you too much trouble. It can feel like a bit of a chore at the start but once your levelling up and getting access to perks like scrounger, pharma pharma, cap collecter, can do, etc it becomes less intrusive to questing and adventuring
---
&gt;it's better to ride the edge of a nuke than the edge of the ring
---
explain pls
---
I've been fairly close to edge of fire ring so that I don't get surprised from back or one of my flanks, looking forward to your reply!
---
Since day one of beta, closing in on 1k hours with no intention of stopping anytime soon
---
They aren‚Äôt even good
---
Wait really that's a lot
---
Dang, I'm on xbox... someday they will probably cross platform....
---
Did you even read what Op said? He was taking zero damage at all. It is classic part of the hack bundle all the hackers have been using. Chances are running multiple hacks but not using the clear as day hacks to avoid banning.
---
Enjoy mate
---
Ya sorta what I thought. And like you said, with rdr minimal the idea works great.
---
I haven‚Äôt had a server crash in a few months.... maybe it‚Äôs your internet? And not sure about these NW hackers... it seems pretty fair to me. I‚Äôm always in top 10. Just haven‚Äôt seen whatever you‚Äôre referring to...
---
They are spread out but yes
---
Oh I know, but the end product would be a phenomenal experience far harbors atmosphere the design of the creatures the layout of the island was perfect
---
The grind is real between level 25 and 50. Before that you just kind of use everything you find. After that you have a good supply of everything and plenty of caps to just buy what you need from player vendors.
---
Welcome back!
---
Yep, but trying to convince more people to sit afk in a bush for 20 minutes is detrimental to the game if enough people listen.
---

---
My suggestions of changes for longevity. I swapped out some less useful cards for more useful cards. The most notable change I did was take your intelligence to 5 - Weapon Artisan can be swapped in as needed. I also took out limb damage, and increased Lone Wanderer. There's actually quite a few small changed I made, but kept the overall build the same. If you like it, great, if not - no harm done.
---
This would be a time when camo paints and clothes would probably actually be quite useful. Bethesda might make a lot of money on the Atomic Shop by adding NW-usable camo skins to everything right now.
---
I also prefer a sneaky playstyle. OP isn't talking about that, he's talking about being passive/afk to farm xp. The more people do this the longer matches go the less xp we can all farm because our placements will go down due to people being afk in hard to find spots.
---
Gives buzzblade damage back!!!
---
They do. It‚Äôs called fallout 4
---
Great feeling, isnt it?
---
Grafton parade or Poseidon?
---
Ha
---
lol every single one of these issues are one platform
---
I did this and then helped him build his camp from a shack with a bed to full crafting stations, instruments, purifiers etc.
---
Nah. I think he is embellishing the truth because he wants to be right. 2 or 3 hacker videos doesnt mean they are everywhere.
---
&gt; You can also have your plans ruined by the sudden arrival of some super mutant hounds that can force you to give up your position.
---
This will never happen if you're smart enough to carry a crossbow or good melee weapons.
---
The AS is entirely optional. There's no milking going on. You either want cosmetics or don't. So the milking point is moot.
---
And of course there's more frequent AS additions than content. Cosmetics require significantly less work than content so that statement is an absolute moot point. 
---
I paid full price for 76 at launch. I experienced limited but frustrating bugs. I'm level 97 with a level 77 alt. I've yet to finish the main quest line, and have a bunch of side things to do. I still have plans and locations to find. I still rebuild my camp regularly. I still hav most of the newer content to play through.
---
While buggy at launch, though no more than other BGs games, at least for me, it's matched almost any other game I own for time played vs cost of title. 
---
So yeah. I get being unhappy with its launch state. Otherwise, I'm chalking the rest of anything you have to say up to a "I shouldn't have to pay for anything, BGS owes me, it should all be free" type of attitude.
---
You know the kind where you consider an entirely optional premium shop as "milking"
---
Probably any of the Grafton quests, back when their trigger included Grafton Station, and it was impossible to go there without having to listen to the stupid mayor twice.  Honestly, I just want to smash that machine.
---
But the thing is, after Borderlands: Pre-Sequel, you become immune to it.  Now, *that* game not only had tedious quests, but it *knew* they were tedious, and it was downright insulting in the way it gleefully wasted your time like it was funny.  "Oh, yeah, I sent you all around the world to collect these things, turns out I didn't need them after all!  Hahaha.  Go away."
---
Search on YouTube. Tons of videos of hackers flying and aimbotting in NW. I can't share the links due to the no witchhunting sticky that was added because of all the hackers.
---
Hand raise!!
---
I can give you one if your are on PC.
---
If you're on PS4 I can give you one if it's definitely just a quest reward I should have 3.
---
I hope so
---
always announce beforehand, on here or discord or something, you will get people to help.
---
https://youtu.be/Q3LE15AyT5g
---
Dailies? What kind are there? Sorry I played the game for a bit when it came out but left due to constant weight issues. 
---
Been playing more a little recently and I seem to have missed stuff. 
---
Also any leveling tips would be appreciated. Still level 22.
---
A prestige system called "legendary" is being developed that resets your character and quests.
---
Ah, I didn't think about it like that.
---
Well, then let's at least hope they're just a little too bad at hiding and I can snipe them all.
---
No, they are in fact obnoxious. BGS had the beta before the actual launch. Days before the actual launch. 
---
There was almost no difference between the state of the game before and after launch.
---
If it was too buggy for people pre launch, and they still bought it? That's on them. Not BGS.
---
But always better then wood armor ;)
---
I completely agree!
---
I like to grind them for power armor building materials and xp. 
---
I run a power armor melee build so the only thing that bothers me is the turrets. . .
---
Some vendors also have the plans.  
---
When I first started, a high level built one of the windmills generators for me - blueprinted/stored it so I could use it if I moved.
---
Used that until I bought the fusion generator plan from Graham.
---
What? The arktos issue is a major issue on xbone and pc. The text chat isn't in any platform of the game. Server crashing is an issue on ps4 and pc. What do you mean by one platform?
---
PC, yes indeed. Keep an eye out for 'Wakshaani'.
---
I'd be in your debt!
---
Where does it tell you how many wins you‚Äôve had?
---
I couldn't believe I made it to the top 6 by hiding under the bridge near the overseer's camp. Then standing next to it when I started taking rads too much from stadning in the water. No one saw me until these two teams duked it out right in front of me, I got a kill in but someone downed me immediately lol
---
Cool!
---
The placement XP is weird cause you your placement is right when you die not your whole team dies ( which needs to be fixed)m but here's my data from testing.
---
Placement
---
1st place 525 xp
---
2nd place 325xp
---
3rd place 275 xp 125??
---
4th place 125 XP
---
5th place 125 xp
---
6th place 125xp?
---
7th place 125 xp
---
8th+ place 0 xp
---
Player kill 20 xp
---
Down 10 xp
---
Nuke 50 xp
---
AI kill 5xp
---
Elite AI 20xp
---
Revives 20xp
---
Obviously wins and high placement will get you the most XP but kills and revives will definitely add up.
---
It's a game about finding and killing people while surviving. Literally nothing about taking a stealthy approach is ruining the game. There are plenty of other BRs out there that you can play if you have a problem with people playing in a valid way. The whole point of the storm circle is to force people together anyway.
---
Entering PA is really broken from another player's perspective. Yesterday I spotted enemy entering PA and waited for his animation to fully finish, because I know that they dont take damage while entering it, but he stayed still in a frame for something like 3 seconds and then teleported behind me and killed me. So actually entering PA just made him lagged for server in invulnerable state, but he was able to freely move in this lag window. Felt cheated after this, but not reportet him, that was 100% not his fault in exploiting this, just laggy servers.
---
"(because adhesive is artificially scarce to encourage people to pay real money for repair kits üëåüëåüëåüëå). " No lol... I am constantly having to sell adhesive and have only needed to use a repair kit once (during Encryptid).  I repair my armor maybe once a month on top of that.
---
Did that one at level 12. Didn't make it.
---
Which every player isnt going to be able to do in a single game.
---
Hell yeah
---
Have you seen any hackers while playing?
---
Yeah one side is full of hate and only ever says negative things and the other is optimistic and gives positive and critical feedback.
---
Its like Poetry
---
PC Lvl 166 playing solo since launch. Ready for continued content for adventure mode
---
I'm having trouble meleeing with a weapon in my hand for some reason. Not sure why. I go to shoot the mutant hound, realize shooting is bad for stealth, go to melee and nothing happens. Game Must have reset my key bindings or something
---
I'll be online in a few. IGN isolationtomb
---
I hear you, but you may want to just hop right in as it is very arcade-like, fast and fun and hilarious... all the pre-match anxiety didn't amount to anything once I was in there having a good time. TBH it reminds me of a Gauntlet like arcade quarter eater than Fallout PVP! If Survival mode is your image of all FO PVP, def pop in and check this mode out. Nobody will remember your name, you can't mess anything up, none of your stuff gets worn down for when you return to adventure mode, and even if you die instantly you still get some XP and caps, it's a no loss situation :)
---
I don‚Äôt think you can remove it from the main game modes. NW has a very small number of AI enemies, so it‚Äôs not that hard to get accustomed to not using it. The regular modes are primarily AI combat, so shifting gears like that just wouldn‚Äôt be fun. Especially when Wastelanders comes out and we potentially have human players running with NPC‚Äôs. 
---
Personally, I think VATS should be available against players in NW too. It‚Äôs Fallout, not COD, and VATS is part of Fallout. Perhaps it should come with a lower hit probability or a damage debuff to counter it but it‚Äôs a mechanic a lot of players have learned to rely on.
---
Yeah, I was having no luck server hopping to milk one either and came upon that detail. Cheers!
---
God dude people can play however they want to ffs. The high level players will always find us anyway, no matter where we hide so what are you worried about
---
It's been great to see. I think I've spent more time looking at the map than playing this week. Seeing the pretty much constant stream of new dots heading from vault to Flatwoods, searching the map to see the lowest level in a high level area etc. 
---
Great to see!
---
I don't think its -that- tricky, but you do have to pay attention to the on-screen prompts. Namely: 1) You pick your SPECIAL point and then 2) you pick a card. The card \*doesn't\* have to be in the same SPECIAL category as the point you used. (This is because every couple of levels, you get SPECIAL card "packs," which give you five new cards at random on top of the ones you've picked.) 
---
Also, in adventure mode, you can swap your cards at ANY time. For most people, it means that they have a certain build for when they're exploring the map and killing stuff, and a certain build when they're at their base crafting and improving weapons / armor. 
---
Thankfully so far, it seems like the best point usage in adventure also works pretty well in NW. Meaning - Most people load up in Strength, Perception, Agility and Luck, with some token points in Intelligence and Charisma for the useful cards there. My personal build, IIRC, is something like S 14, P 15, E 4, C 4, I 5, A 15, L 7. (Don't have the game loaded right now, so I could be off.) You want 4 in Charisma because Lone Wanderer is a very useful card, and 5 in Intelligence for Gunsmith and the ability to create the best stuff crafting, but most people don't put more points than that in them. You might have slight variations in S, P, A and L, depending on what weapons you use. (Perception has rifle perks, Strength has melee and heavy weapons, Agility has sneak and critical buffs, Luck is useful all-around, for combat and crafting.)
---
Private servers, mod support, and Creation Club integration will come in time. These are things that they have talked about or hinted at.
---
Funny how only players that currently like Fallout 76 are just those who bought it and have played it like 5 min. Then they come here and write several hours to praise how good the game is. Once people reach level 50 there is like 1/100 on them anymore who like it, because they see what the game really is. Empty, generic, boring and without no real end game content at all. Game is also constant lag, frame drops, server crashes and stuck to the objects. There is no really AI in enemies, they are dumb as fu\*\* without any proper path finding. Enemies stuck to everywhere or just don't respond at all even you shoot them. Some fanatic Fallout fans love these features and think it is ok, which is really sad because this game would have been so much more with better design and polishing. FO76 was designed as cheap as possible by reusing all Fallout 4 elements and take cash from idiots. I hope Bethesda learn in the future to make more polished and designed games, because Fallout as a brand deserves much better. If not I hope they can sell it to another game house who can do it better.
---
Reading this I decided to install the game once again. I played at release, and like most others quit less than 10 hours in. 
---
I hope the game isn't dominated by hardcore players :/
---
&gt;not even stephen hawking could miss that way
---
upvote for Hawking line XD
---
I'm on PS4, and noticed that sometimes it takes the vendors a couple extra seconds to "refresh" and actually show you what they're selling. I've found it helps if you toggle the categories.
---
I play solo all the time... and the last game I played I surprised and annihilated a team of 4... it's 100% tactics, not numbers üòâ
---
Yes, it‚Äôs the only one I could milk for the challenge.
---
It shouldn‚Äôt but mods used to be scrapped automatically, e.g you repair the uranium fever thing that needs steel but you didn‚Äôt have enough scrap because all your steel was bulked so poof your jet pack x01 mod would disappear and it wouldn‚Äôt even warn you that was going to be used for the steel needed. After they stopped mods auto scrapping the bulk auto scrapped when scrapping all but I‚Äôd rather that than lose a P.A mod that‚Äôs hard to come by.
---
There was another thread about this earlier in the week - A Bethesda employee said it was a graphical glitch, and not like a new "double nuke" mechanic or anything.
---
Raiders.
---
Since drop day.
---
I'm going to just let the drama and hate go.  The game benefits all of us with more players.
---
No most people do not they are usally to busy smoking bowls to actually form thoughts
---
***run***
---
I agree it's very frustrating to know you have something you want to use but can't get to it without the wheel,  super hard to use,  or pipboy menu,  takes forever and can't do it in battle.   Setting d pad to 4 items would be great.
---
Definitely down because of the new players, and the older players being mostly in NW. I launched a nuke this week to fight the SBQ and to collect some flux, and only one other player bothered to show up to the nuke zone. I checked the map after - There were around 20 players in my game, but there were only 3 that I saw higher than level 50.
---
Are you sure? People still keep quoting Thanos like he's the Guru Yogi.
---
Rest.  Rest hourly.  That's 5% exp bonus right there.
---
Go get Cranberries from the farm in north west part of the map, near the ferris wheel.  Cranberry cobbler is another 5% exp bonus that stacks with  Well Rested.
---
Events.  Do every event that pops up near you, the are a good source of enemy and completion exp. Especially the one near at the lighthouse near 76.  If you complete it (which can be hard if there isn't someone else there), there is another exp bonus that stacks with Well Rested and Cranberry cobbler.
---
Settlers
---
I hate power armor because:
---
1. Doesn't allow you to equip fist weapons.
---
2. Overpowered. Especially in nuke zones.
---
3. Noisy.
---
4. Looks like crap when you run.
---
Literally saw this in the middle of a NW match. Thanks man.
---
Lol, I have 20 kill games solo, it‚Äôs definitely not a bad idea to go it alone.
---
Kudos! Took me awhile to work up the courage to try taking one on alone.
---
Then I was in Grafton when an event started and suddenly I had to fight a Level 40 Diseased Parasitic Grafton Monster AND its...
---
...robot minions?!
---
Luckily I had on my Excavator armor and a level 10-ish player showed up to help, so it went well.
---
But I'm a rifle player who had a sword out when he attacked. VERY shocking. ;b
---
Ha. Was killed the same way last night by a dude named EffBethesda.
---
It's definitely an option for PC, however Nuclear Winter won't let you into a server with any modified game files.
---
You'd have to run two sets of .ini files, one for Adventure/Survival Modes, another for NW.
---
Good for you! You will have a ton of fun expanding your exploration. Some of what I say below is based on me assuming you are not super confident (as I am not), so if this does not apply to you, just ignore this.
---
You can start the badges, but be aware that they can take you into difficult areas. For example, you need to visit two robots very early. One is fine but the other is in the mire and there is usually a very challenging situation outside the cabin. You can get around that difficulty in various ways, but just be aware that enemies really amp up in mire. However you could work on the world badges part and do activities that are in your comfort map areas. 
---
Another bit of advise is to go ahead and fast travel to player vendors now regardless of where they are and check out their products and fast travel right back out (you may have to kill a few enemies first but I dont seem to get many bad enemies at camps). If you have been repeating the pattern you mentioned for a long time then you'll have amassed lots of caps, so start looking for a good weapon to buy because good drops are so rare (im not talking about god rolls, just very good).
---
I cant tell what kind of player you are but if you are rifle build and are less confident, then ill be glad to build you a handmade. I have pretty bad eye/hand coordination, and it was not until I got my handmade that I really felt good in my late teens/early 20s. I like people helping low levels but my mission is to help keep 15-30s playing because that is when the game can suck due to high level enemy spawns when a high level player is near and because of lack of in game guidance on where to go for your level. I am on xbox if you need it. Good luck!
---
PC or console?
---
No sadly, that would be ridiculously op. :(
---
How do I shot web?
---
Rule 1 is the post must have something to do with Fallout 76. This post does abide by this rule as it shows the inspiration for a well known landmark location in Fallout 76.
---
dude bethesda bethesda only wants money.
---
if it isnt a basic essential or something that brings money they aint gon do it
---
Anyone have any recommendations for a new player to FO76? I was one of the herd who bought the game at launch and quit soon-after. 
---
I reinstalled the game so hopefully you guys are right that it's changed for the better...
---
&gt; You have to reach overseer rank 100 to get it.
---
Count me out :(
---
Enjoy!

#truth
---
Your argument could be mistaken as trolling it's that bad. The only people who could play the beta are people who pre ordered it so they'd already made thier purchase.
---
People who hadn't played the beta wouldn't have had first hand experience with the dumpster fire that it was at release. I don't know why you possibly think it's OK for a compony to release something that absolutely fucking terrible and still charge full price for it. When you hold consumers to a higher standard than businesses you open up the door to exploitation and shite loads of anti consumer practices.
---
What? I do it literally every game without fail.
---
Been here since beta and only level 57
---
Just go to water park and server hop til the tourist is laying by the car. I made a post a few hours ago when I was on letting people join up with me. Took me an hour or so to server hop until I found him. Good luck bud.
---
You‚Äôll find most players are helpful and very friendly. Most will help with quests or give ya stuff to help you on your way. 
---
Every game has jerks. Don‚Äôt let em ruin a great experience for ya. This game is well worth the time for ya.
---
I would recommend sticking to one weapon type since each has different perk cards.  If you mostly like sniping make sure you have rifleman perks, sub the shotgun for a Combat or assault rifle until you can get a Handmade.  Bloody mess in luck is a great perk for additional damage. as well as covert op in agility. 
---
 I like to carry a BP rifle or The Dragon for a first high damage sneak attack on strong enemies, instigating is a nice legendary.
---
Just keep leveling up and stick to it, what kind of armor are you wearing? Handmade rifles are probably the best for taking out those types of enemies as they can lay waste up close pretty easily unless you are able to one shot with a super sledge. Also- what perks are you using? That can be a huge factor.
---
Easiest way I've found to get stimpacks is to run quick, easy events and you can often get like 5 stimpacks per event. Taking workshops is a good way to go too. That, combined with diluting stimpacks and you should have a decent supply rather quickly
---
WAIT WHAT GOD DAMNIT OOPS
---
has she watched you play it? cause being online is kinda moot IME, so far (lvl 26) i don't really run into many people (unless i go to them)
---
i could understand if it was like red dead, where she doesn't want to get shot while fishing or something.. but not much 'bad' will happen to her online or offline. most are off doing their own thing.
---
I was having a great time until I built out this little nice cabin for myself with scavenged supplies which took several hours and then it got nuked by a super high level before I could blueprint it and couldn't afford the repair costs. That was the day I quit and never went back because I'm too old to deal with BM and griefing.
---
Ideally i'd wager the way it should run is that the Emote symbol is only visible to team mates and the emote itself is silent. Even better if it had variants to allow emotes while crouched. Emote communication set up like that would be invaluable for coordination. Hated having eyes on a group of three moving past our position, but no way to give a heads up to the last man of my squad so he'd know
---
Shoot I think you're right.
---
You don‚Äôt even have to be good at pvp... just survive
---
My main recommendation is to start in adventure and take your time exploring. Once you get through the Morgantown airport quests it really picks up. Don‚Äôt try and blow through main quests, take time to level up and improve gear/perks. Honestly I tried to hold off on doing any main quests until over level 50 since there are some pretty cool legendaries that scale but that‚Äôs just me.
---
you keep saying multiple but you only provide one example, yeah I too have the controller audio issue, but specifically what other bugs are you experiencing?  the majority of launch issues have been patched, new patches have brought new bugs, sure, but aside from the audio bug, what specifically are you experiencing that was there at launch?
---
I hear ya. It‚Äôs a shame though. I don‚Äôt agree with Reddit. You can‚Äôt use the same policy as a cover-all. 
---
The policy works when it‚Äôs pertaining to real life people, names and addresses etc 
---
When it comes to video game ‚Äúavatars‚Äù it‚Äôs no different then posting the clip on YouTube or reporting to the game client. Looking at twitch / streamers ... you get the point. 
---
God forbid we call out cheaters / exploiters to help keep the gaming community fun for everyone
---
Sorry...it was a joke.  ‚ÄúThe great imitator‚Äù is slang for a medical condition that was aforementioned as being the mechanism through which Senorita Chavez fatally f****d her victims.
---
ü§ö
---
it def is if you play with a controller and plug your headphones into a controller
---
I would love that, if each year was a new place, almost like eso. Could really tick those "who would like a fallout set in..." boxes in an easier way.
---
Didnt work, the download just restarded from 0
---
lmao that band drives me nuts  it sounds horrible..they need to put the band in the nursery and not so close that everyone can hear it
---
Get some legendarys from white springs runs don‚Äôt forget to trade in trash legendarys for purveyor gear at train stations.And stims packs drop like crazy if u get the pharma pharmer perk also the one night event drops a lot of stimpacks and legendarys .
---
Happy cakeday Dweller
---
I'll make sure to do that, thank you! I do see a lot of events up but generally it seems like not many people do them, unfortunately.
---
We aren't rebuilding anything yet. We start Nuclear Missiles for fun and pure enjoyment to kill stuff that looks dangerous but really isn't!
---
Fallout 4? Like foreal though, the game is first and foremost a multiplayer game, what does it matter if a random player walks by and off into the distnace.
---
If it continues to have bad ratings, Bethesda will abandon the game and everybody looses. I like the new N.W. mode, it's a blast.
---
I just stand behind the bar using the sick emote.
---
Again, this isn't a stealthy approach to the game. OP is advocating an afk approach. That isn't stealth it's not even participating. And as for the storm circle argument, it takes 15 minutes or slightly more to bring the afk's close enough together to do anything. It creates a substantially more boring first 15 minutes of the game.
---
Once more, I have nothing against a stealthy style of play, it's my own approach. We're not talking about stealthy, we're talking about running away from other players entirely and avoiding all conflict because it may result in your death.
---
Mm yes indubitably
---
Just started my second character yesterday.  Been playing since launch.  Nice to play through missions with no bugs  (so far).
---
&gt; That‚Äôs basically it. As to WHY, there‚Äôs a pretty fun story line
---
One point in the story (you know the one) actually made me laugh out loud. Great writing.
---
I've thought about doing this but does it work? Doesn't it say in the description of the item " might cause blackouts?" I remember when I got my first nukashine I saw that and immediately knew what was gonna be up with it
---
Snallygasters- don‚Äôt fight, just run like hell
---
Wendigos- get the high ground, then either wait it out, or fill it with bullets
---
Radscorpions- Wendigo tactic or circle it and whack it repeatedly
---
If there is no high ground, do the snallygaster.
---
I think OP included that to stress how successful hiding in a tree is. 
---
...again I really don't see an issue with running away. Just let people enjoy the game and don't let it mess with your blood pressure so much.
---
Yeah, there's certain events that can definitely be ran solo though. I play almost completely alone at this point after my team quit playing lol
---
Weird flex, but okey.
---
Anyway maybe his teammstes died before so he was solo.
---
It‚Äôs doable without hacking with enough Stimpaks, Rad X and Rad Away. I spent too much time messing with a safe and getting pinned by a rock wall. I spent a decent chunk of time in the storm by the time I hopped around the cliff. At least a few minutes.
---
I leveled up 4 characters and I think that level 20\~35 is the worst. You're stronger than normal stuff in the forest and they don't give a lot of exp, but you'll have a hard time with anything else. The lack of ammunition is seriously annoying too.
---
First tip: don't buy stimpaks from those machine vendors. If you need to buy them, look for player vendors. But stimpaks are easy to come by just playing so don't go wasting your caps on that.
---
Second thing is that your perks make all the difference in combat. If you're having trouble, focus on combat perks. I would advise to decide what kind of weapon you want to use and get the perks for that weapon. Melee is great for leveling since you won't use ammo. You don't have to worry about screwing up you build, you can change everything later, you'll just have to level up more.
---
So yeah, pick a weapon and focus your perks on that weapon. Also remember that strenght increases melee damage as well. Oh, and make sure your weapons match your level.
---
I just use whatever armor I can find, honestly. I have a couple with legendary effects (a level 10 leather chestpiece with the "crouch and you turn invisible" effect, a leather arm piece that makes me turn invisible when I get hit sometimes, and otherwise some metal / raider pieces with no actual effects). Most of my crafting perks have gone into gunsmith atm. I'll grab a screenshot of my perk setup in a minute, but it's mostly spread out with no long-term thought to what I might need.
---
I'm level 40 and still have trouble with level 16 mutants.
---
well its still not as good as it could be.
---
bethesda really added a battle royale to it to get more players.
---
i like 76 but it makes sense people still hate it
---
This would be your base build, you'd have 12 points to play with in whatever way you want.
---

---
lol :D
---
When people in r/fallout are literally arguing that 76 is a looter shooter because of the perk system because RPGs can only have the perk system like 3 and NV had.  Or that the scorch beasts are stupid and don't make any sense. Kind of forgetting the antagonist of FO 1 was literally a human that fused with a computer because they fell in a vat of magical ooze.  Or they complain that the main story of FO 76 is stupid and inorganic in terms of development and ignore the sub reddit's favorite game is literally about a random courier who gets shot in the head and survives then wonders into Las Vegas and becomes the god emperor of the waste land doing what literal entire armies were incapable of doing and becoming the leader or second in command of the victorious army in the space of about a week.
---
Should be treated like other items that need to be manually scrapped
---
That's correct, that's how it is meant to work, the second download is actually a verify, which will take 15 mins average and it will be ready to play
---
Upvoted for text chat. Really would love to see it implemented in game!
---
I started a few weeks late because of all the hate, but jumped in anyways and have loved it ever since.
---
Look at it this way. Folks talking about the game and asking questions means people are playing the game. Which can only make the game better for everyone. 
---
So suck it up buttercup.
---
I had like 90mbps but I had a small table, so we're kinda in the same boat.
---
Since we're kinda in the same boat, (and if you're on pc) we could add eachother?
---
I did get kills, 1-2 per game but every time the team had been shortened down into 2, and occasionally there was a team of 4 that had somehow made it into the last combatants. Pretty unfair gamemode, at least in my experience, overall.
---
Multiple
---
This game has a lot of NPCs. You cN find them on r/fallout. 
---
‚ÄúFallout Man Bad!‚Äù
---
The language fix actually worked, thanks! I still don't understand why I can't play the game in italian...
---
so the download speed and progress bar is just a fake? When it's verifying?
---
ye im new too.
---
since the whole "free tryout thing" i see why people still play the game, it aint that bad
---
Bug, usually fixes if u leave team and reassemble or quit out of app and restart it .
---
have this all the time, sometimes 1-2h, sometimes everytime i use a consumable.
---
This bug is around since release, i hope they fix it soon.
---
(PC, fallout76.exe process goes inactive in taskmanager)
---
So I have always loved the game, but I don‚Äôt find it wholly different than it was in concept or content or gameplay or lore than in the beginning.  Which is to say that many people never stopped supporting this game, they just waited until some of the technical stuff was fixed.  And actually, supporting it from afar is much better than criticizing it while not playing it, (because then maybe it will never improve), or playing it but getting frustrated.  There has been a ton of content added so I didn‚Äôt mean to advocate that things are the same...it‚Äôs just knowing Bethesda I expected this world to really blossom with tons of added content so for me that concept was there from the beginning.
---
nope i never had them at this point i was living from water xD 3 big water "things" idk the Name, in my super Small lake
---
Yup it feels pretty OP hehe
---
i stumbled into that quest the other day.. i'll give it a shot with ya (lvl 26, first run)  never knew it gave me a backpack. only did 1 part kinda accidentally. 
---
helping an ally seemed a feat solo.  shoot me a msg with your GT if you want  :-)
---
Gathering resources is ‚Äú different‚Äù in fallout 76 than it was in say fallout 3 or 4. As with any mmo game it‚Äôs always a crap shoot on rather your the first person in that area or the 100th. Personally when I get to a new area say Flatwoods or Morgantown for example I like to scavenge the whole area first, bulk down the scrap, then do whatever quest related objective is there. Yes that sounds a lot like chores lol, however I am never never short on mats, ammo, meds or chems and I think it adds a certain level of immersion because its probably how I would do it in real life lol.  Plus you find so so much lore, funny notes, holotapes, PLANS, ect ect. that one might miss if they just zip through the area. As far as crafting goes there are quite a few perks to help you out. Green Thumb is a must have early on in my opinion. 2x plants harvested = 2x adhesives made 2x healing salves made ect ect. Chemist, Super Duper and Ammo smith also help. 
---
Hope ya change your mind. The game has a lot to offer and is lots of fun once you get the initial learning curve down.
---
I want Arizona.
---
People who pre ordered it did not in fact make their purchase. The cost for me to pre-order 76 at EB Games? A whopping $5 dollars Canadian.  Even if you paid full price at launch.... You can get a refund and not take the title....
---
Consumers, not just of video games, need to start taking some responsibility for their purchases. 
---
In Fallout 76's case let's look at the red flags tons of people ignored:
---
Bethesda has a long, well known history of releasing extremely buggy titles.
---
The BETA was a clear indicator of the state of the game about to be released.
---
There was an absolute fuck ton of reviews and such from BETA players and outlets that people could have read/watched if they couldn't play the Beta.
---
They could have waited mere days to make their purchase and would have seen the entire internet blow up about how bad a state 76 was at launch.
---
This was the first online Fallout game. There was bound to be issues (This is about the only thing that I could forgive someone not heeding)
---
The idea that people wouldn't have known how bad a state the game was in prior to launch?  Absurd.
---
Blasphemy! How could you kill our lord and savior?!
---
Honestly, my best experience was encountering an exploiter and one of my teammates kept saying "Yeah dude!" whenever he did some very obvious cheating:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c09o08/guys\_what\_serum\_is\_this/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c09o08/guys_what_serum_is_this/)
---
The SAT is strong with this one...
---
Gratz and kudos, I kill it for revenge still... on both toons... they are both over 150! I don't think it's healthy... lol But it must die!!!
---
Here since day 1. Even with some of the flaws, it‚Äôs still part of the Fallout franchise and I love Fallout. The recent updates have just made it even better. And honestly, I‚Äôm finding that I really like community in 76. I always play solo but have had some fantastic encounters with random players. The other day another player and I randomly hopped in to help a new guy clear out a tough event, and both of us left him with bags of goodies. I loved it.
---
I don't know about the cursor thing, but I do know that if you access a vendor at the same point when their inventory is refreshing, you can get that empty menu syndrome to happen.
---
Yea I thought I lost until stalemashowed up as well
---
So, we didn't beat the queen... There was in average 4 of us in the blast zone. But, that's way to few to realistically stand a chance against the queen so we focussed on everything else. It was still fun, lots of enemies and flux materials. Shame about the queen though.
---
Scorchbeast hands down for annoyance lol hate trying to see through their ranged and fire at them mid air not too difficult just annoying to fight
---
Been playing since launch. Over 800 hrs in. Play it cause you like it should be the ‚Äò76 slogan.
---
I might come back (PS4 player &lt;.&lt;)
---
Yeah most of you are full of shit. I checked this sub a couple weeks ago, it had barely any new posts that day and the top posts were about how people were sad this game had died. You don't deserve a medal for playing a garbage game that might be getting better. Stop trying to segregate the community, that's just as toxic as rage about how bad the game is.
---
Got my bag a couple of days ago and it went right were the other bag is. In a box.
---
Wow that‚Äôs a high level!!!!
---
Also the fps issues, like come on it's 2019 I should at the very least have 30 fps in this game, it looks no different to Fallout 4 aside from some extra god rays
---
Think we would need longer than 2min to get out of the area lol
---
This sub is no different.
---
I use PA as bait. I'll walk it over somewhere and wait for the schmucks to come rolling in. Gotta start taking the fusion cores though. That's brilliant. 
---
I mean.... PA standing in the middle of a road? And you think that's normal?
---
Don't count on it. Bethesda is staying away from the West.
---
Not really rare. 
---
Common place for easy exp
---
I mean people playing FO76 since launch. But anyways, PA is trash and so are a few weapon styles. Tried it myself, can confirm what most people are saying. Metas exist. Film at 11.
---
Playing every day, minus 2-3 since the first BETA Thursday.

I accidentally deleted my main character trying the new mode:( I will admit complete fault here since I didn't read anything when I was going through the menus.
---
Lvl 39 here, multiple 15+ kill games. Never had a gun even reach 50% CND :\
---
Prime example of my point here. You aren't even making a point. You're just rambling on about things you don't like. Incredible. Typically, "When x," statements are followed by a, "then y." Noticed you couldn't even keep your train of thought through the first friggin sentence. It's like you're trying to prove my point for me.
---
I've tried jumping and it hasn't cancelled it sadly :(
---
I have the exact same issue. Targeting HUD shows in mod list but just won‚Äôt install.  Recon sensors did install.  I was trying both on X01. 
---
I‚Äôve also logged in and out with no success
---
I use the nuke and the question mark emotes and that seems to work quite well
---
Try it. It doesn't remove the arrow above your head when you're firing.
---
I don't mind either way tho lol
---
Awesome man! I‚Äôve only done a few of the exam tests in areas I thought would be the easiest and most enjoyable for the rest of the tasks. Archery, Hunter, Athlete and Mammalogy. 
---
I‚Äôm not online right now but will be within the next hour or so. 
---
Maybe do the exams for them in the meantime? (Tip, use Google for the answers. Some questions are easy, most aren‚Äôt. Takes a while).

---
The thing is... FO76 does have an empty world, with no story, almost no end game content, and almost no meaningful npcs. The problem with the "haters" is that's all that they can see... because those elements were what made Fallout, Fallout, to them.
---
What FO76 has is a ton of lore and exploration. This is not story. Story is what happens in game, lore is what happened before the player entered the game world. There's no interaction, there's no choice, there is no story because everything that was interesting happened before Vault 76 opened its doors.
---
And as an online game, it kinda has to be, but this is a prime factor of that "empty" feeling.
---
This is compounded by the lack of npcs. The only true npc I can think of is Rose. And she's funny, she's got a questline and actual dialogue that gives the illusion of actual interaction, and she's got her own radio station (for all of 10 minutes... sigh. She totally should have been the DJ for the entire wasteland).  But she's the only one in a game that's "4 times" the size of FO4.
---
And really, the SBQ and two events designed for high level players that are over in 15 minutes... is not acceptable to be labeled as having end game content. 
---
But here's the thing. That's not all FO76 is, and this is what they're missing.
---
It has great lore, great exploration, the refinement on the FPS gameplay is a welcome addition, BGS finally fixing their engine, legitimately one of the best communities around a game, and for me, what makes me keep coming back to FO76 is that I can go get lost in an online game where I don't feel punished for playing solo. I can just do my own thing, at my own pace. I can interact with others... or not. I don't need to wait for the rest of my guild to get on so we can go raid.
---
I can go into almost any direction, poke my head into a house, hear an audiotape, read some notes, or maybe find teddy bears making a cooking show. This was something that was integral to my previous experiences of Fallout. This is what makes Fallout, Fallout, to me, and FO76 gives me that experience.
---
Maybe someone got really excited about FO4's settlement system, and so the C.A.M.P. building is their jam. Not my thing, but FO76 has this.
---
Maybe someone got really jazzed about finding every book and bobblehead from FO3. Completely not my thing, but  FO76 has a metric buttload of collection achievements to keep them occupied for years.
---
But if what made Fallout, Fallout, for others, was to see what happens next? To have meaningful interactions? To have a world react to the choices you make, and those choices having consequences? Yeah, FO76 has none of that.
---
It's a selection bias... people judge a thing based upon what is important to them, and not by what that thing is.
---
Which means celebrate FO76 for what it is, but do not defend it for what it isn't.
---
Anthem players feel your pain
---
Bloodied melee with power armor
---
I‚Äôm sorry about that. Are you PC? I‚Äôm on Xbox. Anyway NW is new so I am sure they will address as they have with everything else
---
Added some screenshots for my stuff! Hopefully that'll help. I really need to figure out how to respec, lol.
---
Yes, only at the last 5% will it say it's veryfying, but it will download in 15 20 mins as opposed to a day or two
---
Probably not a lady
---
its rough starting out but have to give it time, if ya walked out of the vault on a new character and were given absolutely everything in the game what would be the point of playing? tatos corn mutfruit and purified water = vegetable starch = adhesive, plant 10 of each in your camp, and a couple water purifiers and in a few days youll stop looking for adhesive because you will have too much.  
---
gunpowder is fairly easy prewar money with acid breaks down into gunpowder, lead since your low level find a couple nodes around the forest and farm gutsys, also tag it in your pipboy to put the magnifying glass over anything that breaks down into lead, steel scrap all weapons from things you kill, you will learn mods and build up a ton of steel.  
---
when you hit 50s it will get a ton easier with ammosmith and super duper perks giving you a ton more for each craft.  
---
corn plant tons of it, corn soup got me through the first 30-40 lvls of the game on all three of my characters, and gourd soup as well once i started growing gourds to make cranberry relish, plants refresh so fast you dont really need to worry about picking up food.   
---
where are you camped at? one place i would suggest is down by the nuka cola plant along the river, go down there next to the plant you will see a house between the plant and the fairgrounds.. you will see north of the house the "island" comes to like a little V drop your camp thing at the tip of the V radius should touch the big tree giving you plenty of crop area, and the ability to put down atleast 12 purifiers.. i camped there for close to 180 levels across all my characters and have level 1 mules camped there and very seldom if ever get attacked by anything, at most 2-3 lvl 5 mutants or robots once a week shooting at my generator from th other side of the river.  
---
the ghouls in the nuka plant are lvl 3 to lvl 9 and i used to kill them for radaways, also quite a few med boxes in there to farm.  
---
nothing in this game is forcing you to buy anything from the atom shop, repair kits are not needed, and once you get to where you can fight the queen youll be sitting on 20-30 advanced repair kits (one found in game that are better than the atom shop versions) in just a couple runs.  
---
to me this game is the same as fallout 4, grindy and slow at first because you dont know everything but once you get leveled and know where everything is and where to farm what it goes to easy mode. my main is over 280 now, i made a melee character as my second and got it from 1 to 120 in 3 weeks since i knew where to farm and where to level. my third is a gunslinger (pistol) build and just hit 82 with it, took a lil longer to level since its one of the most lowest damage builds out there and uses a ton of ammo to kill anything, so had to move slower, plan fights a lil more, and farm a lil more resources than i did for the melee.
---
when i first started playing in beta i camped outside the garden at morgantown airport, outside the fence close to the train station, easy access to the food in the airports garden, and close to all those low level scorched that i could farm 10mm and shotgun shells from, by time i was 20 i knew every mod for shotguns and 10mm and had tons of ammo, ya might try there as well if ya dont wanna go to the south by nuka cola plant i mentioned earlier.  
---
also might wanna post your platform ya playing on i am sure someone in this reddit would offer a helping hand and help ya get on your feet or check out  r/fo76FilthyCasuals alot of helpful people there as well.. if ya on ps4 i could help ya (psn silune) i would even make a new character to level alongside you, been toying with the idea of doing a heavy guns build for awhile now.  
---
anyways what ever you decide good luck to ya hope ya take some of the advice in here and try again cause ya missing out/giving up on some fun.
---
Lol
---
Thanks karen! I just got lasered to the face by a face laser.
---
Would like this but it‚Äôd probably destroy the FPS
---
I only do the horde modes where I know the AI won‚Äôt randomly die
---
Played at beta. Played off and on again. Restarted the day before yesterday and I‚Äôm loving it
---
Haaa haaa
---
I quit playing for months because of that quest. At the time it was super glitchy and would restart itself if you left the building and the actual calling card system didnt work at all.
---
I think the saddest thing of all is people legitimately getting angry/bothered by people expressing their enjoyment for a game.
---
It was supposed to be removed after the 17th. But because of how many people are playing and loving it, they opted out of removing it and just updating while its still live.
---
It's Grafton day! Again!
---
That‚Äôs confusing
---
Probably not dumbass.
---
Yes pc, and they will address it? I've been playing since beta, there are still hacks and dupes in the game that have worked since beta. You can still glitch your way into the dev room... They have zero anticheat software on this game. So there is no way for them to ban them except players reporting them. So if they hack smartly they won't be banned.
---
It is why I don't even play NW any longer after running into the 4th flying aimbotter.
---
Ok. Is EVERY player in that game going to be able to get a crossbow or a good melee weapon before they get picked off? No. Your assertation that EVERYONE is going to be able to play that way simply isn't possible.
---
Yes!!!
---
His older angrier brother is waiting for you at Arktos Pharma
---
Ew your attitude is gross
---
Oh no I'm making a point about the circle jerk nature. They actually use logic that makes all the other fallout games they like look like shit with their arguments.
---
It is called multiple supporting examples my dear. It is how you form a coherent argument.
---
Yes totally. When I hear wings flutter, I'm like, oh shit.. better dive for cover
---
Not really.
---
I think they stopped doing it but I dont know why it was helpful for people just coming out of the vault
---
Try to check out my newest post m8. 
---
I tried to explain a little better
---
The different animations harsh my zen. How you swing an axe in power armor ....
---
mr Handy the handy companion app
---
Thats not what im asking or disputing. It was never going be removed permanently btw im saying why is it referred to as a pre beta not just a normal beta

I'm thinking.... [Tsar Bomba!!!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsar_Bomba)
---
Theres the challenge in game called ‚Äúplay for 7600 hours‚Äù. Its a way to track time as 7600 isnt possible yet
---
It‚Äôs funny that people think it‚Äôs this game-winning mechanic. You can survive for a while in the nuke zone if you weren‚Äôt in it for impact.
---
Team of 3 built a shelter leaving a little zone to not be hit by it. I had escaped the blast zone by going into the fire. Back in the radiation. Team was just sitting with the windows open. Hello Mr. Grenade Launcher
---
He wants to be right? What? He is asking what is going on, not making a statement. So why would he embellish when he is just asking what is going on? That doesn't even make sense. Lol
---
You can see it in the challenges. There is one challenge where you have to reach 7600h playtime.
---
In the challenges, under character. It will say hours played #/76 or #/760
---
you mean using tactics like frog legs to get arcade Call of Duty kills? nope lol
---
You open with an incomplete sentence and claim this is how you form a coherent argument. Totally self aware.
---
It's been seven months not a year
---
I dig them and grab them regularly
---
Love combat, it's why I play, and the regions are small enough I have no problem hitting their areas
---
Sometimes the area instantly registers as where the boss is/isn't saving me time
---
Legendaries reward the level you are at regardless of region so is a great way for you to equip good gear while leveling to 50
---
But ye said he was taking zero damage. So that rules out stimpacks. Dude was probably hacking. Invulnerable is a hack people been using since survival.
---
No idea why Bethesda isn't selling 'radio packs'
---
Id drop 10$ for 15 songs added into the pip-boy in a heartbeat
---
How strange. I love the hoard events and go to almost every one I see. It is by far the most consistent way I get three stars, much better for me than say white springs.
---
Throwing up emotes in survival and NW will get your ass killed. Bethesda please note
---
Us OG's from Vault 76 should get a skin or title for being the first to leave and stay in the wasteland.
---
The lord makes all my decisions, but I guess he was busy considering he hasn‚Äôt responded to my last 7 letters
---
Thank you
---
Whenever you do, there‚Äôs this really cool place called Whitesprings. Idk if you‚Äôve heard of it but it‚Äôs a nice place to nuke. I‚Äôve seen it nuked once or twice...every time I get on
---
I miss the old music from fo3 and fo4 I had some favorites and some weren't in the game because when I first started I just was wating for one song from fo4
---
Agreed!!
---
Definitely.
---
I actually can't listen to the in-game music or the radio anymore without going insane, so I play the soundtracks from other Fallouts and Skyrim outside of the game instead.
---
Thank you for your input! Feedback is always encouraged! Perhaps, you should be quiet though if you're not going to bring positivity to a large group of people who just enjoy the game. I'll consider your topic closed. Have a great weekend! :)
---
I'm not sure what the matchmaker is doing but levels and total card points in play would be nice to have. Other BRs use Elo, other methods.
---
Unsurevifvtherecarevenough players to be that granular.
---
Quality stuff op. Thank you
---
The servers have been terrible this week.   Prior to the past week the previous weeks I could play for hours over several days and not get the "Controls not responding" message.   Now I am getting disconnected multiple times a day.
---
I love that more people are playing but Bethesda had better do something about the servers.   They are not responding well to the increased number of people.
---
in terms of frames, it runs beautifully for me but I'm on pc
---
It will work like the rider PA sets, they change the appearance of another PA, but isnt its own
---
Server chat would be awesome. Especially if we can hide it when we want. I want to be able to tell people i just started FREE RANGE etc OR-- " I JUST NOW LEFT 10 legendaries in the suitcase at the WS train station" yeah man we need this
---
If **only** there were some way to communicate other than emotes! What is this, the 18th century?
---
Sheesh Bethesda!
---
Yeah wish there was a slider for this, the atom shop and voice chat with players.
---
correct they've been broken since Wednesday unfortunately. Hopefully they fix it soon. Need those perk cards
---
I'm not going to level another character to 50. It may take 4 or 5 just to get a decent build. I am going to wait for them to fix it. Then I will bring in a another lvl 50.
---
Eh but atleast we gave the game a chance right?
---
The radio is streamed from (or is at least queued off) the servers.  In its current form, it wouldn't work if some players had access to songs other players didn't.
---
Ive played single player for over 300 hours lol, most play single player as well
---
And I‚Äôm the naked elderly man with a bright pink sun hat in the next bush. I won‚Äôt tell you what I‚Äôm doing in my bush though...
---
Yea it gets stored 
---
In the start it used to bother me but what i used to do was try and find a better spot to place my camp 
---
If i couldnt id leave tue world but if i did id move it for free 
---
See it as a way to save caps 
---
I was afraid to move but like many say move a lot where it suits you
---
This would actually be extremely cool. No sense from a storytelling perspective. But still, very cool.
---
I don't even own a MP game that has no text chat
---
started playing a while back and just passed the 76 hour mark as I got an achievement for it haha
---
I've been telling everyone I know that shows a little interest how good the game is and that playing fallout with buddies is so much fun
---
I did the same twice. Once in flatwood I saw 3 low level near the restaurant cooking stove. They had a mic on and were talking. One had a bounty so I Smacked the crap and he went down. He called me an asshole. I laughed and fast traveled out. Second time I saw a low level east of Morgantown with a  bounty and a friend. I thought why not, popped a berry mentat and gave chase. He ran like a scared bitch but I did catch him. Dropped him and took the bounty. His friend gets pissed and shoots me. I smack the crap upside this fools head with my ski sword and collect his bounty. Felt like Boba Fett, stopped and smiled and the fast travelled out!!!
---
i wont be on till a bit later, if that's alright.. got some chorin to do first  ;-)  maybe 2-ish  (PST)
---
i'll add ya and shoot ya a message when i get on  :-)
---
Too late. Someone already posted an image of every NW loot container in the circle on the 2nd day.
---
I really got pissed off hearing about the tea break and almost shot the stupid robot üòÇ...its kind of satirical and funny I think ...
---
Oh cool lol
---
If they wanted to they could give us the ability to leave holotapes for other players but that would be too complicated I guess, still, would be fun
---
Apart from seeing it my own testing, this isn't even contested anymore:

Why debate against common knowledge?
---
Cdkeys .com i got a copy for about $20 xbox one version. Its good...the battle royal is also a lot of fun.
---
It's true, that self-deprecating joke made me laugh once.
---
A beta typically indicates a more finished mode. They still only have one option which is 4v4, its far from beta
---
You're supposed to find them as you explore. Do other quests and you will find them as you play.
---
If you‚Äôre on PS I‚Äôd be willing to play with you. I don‚Äôt tend to use a mic as well.
---
Been here since launch, recently just left it because battle royale.
---
Not everyone can use voice chat. What is this, 16-18th century where ppl burned others different from them?
---
Not anymore.
---
And I also think it's a great idea to have radio hosts like three dog or travis so when you completed an event or mission like when the moonshine place opened they could of said
---
Like this  place has opened and they would talk about it
---
I killed them both when I was done. I never felt so satisfied in a video game.
---
Different channel that is themed and only appears in your pip-boy if you paid for it isn't doable under the server stream-source model?
---
True. I don‚Äôt discount hacking at all, but the right combination of those drugs, at the right time would make it look stagnant. Also, I‚Äôm guessing it was the end of the match based on his story and it could be burning inventory. I‚Äôve been in matches that ended like that. I just don‚Äôt jump to hacking. It‚Äôs possible though either way.
---
Correct they're pre determined locations they spawn. But not all of them spawn. It's random which ones every game. Same with NW loot containers.
---
Off and on. Play till I get frustrated then put it down for a week or 2. Busy life lol
---
Im on ps4 and have never had this issue nor have seen it before, try resetting the game/install or also check your internet
---
Burn the mutes!
---
Much F
---
Xbox here. Inviting people is a loan and need to be way better.
---
You can try it for free right now until the 17th.
---
I think the basic problem is that farming the event wasn't their intended design.  Much like farming One Violent Night.
---
Why not give a tutorial in this sub? I mean, I mod the shit out of Fallout 4 but this game is a little different. I have vortex installed, do I just do the same as I do with f04 mods? Download, install, use LOOT etc?
---
No, but it doesn't spoil anymore which is nice
---
Same here. I am really bad at the game so it took me a while to progress and I but the game down but after nuclear winter I could practice and now im progressing great
---
I like this idea. Doesn't break immersion because you'd be using your pip boy. You'd have to stop and open it up, so you'd have to think about it...
---
Whatttt?
---
It's really pretty hard to get though.
---
I do think that there should be some benefit to being extra lucky
---
Dude you are missing the point. We are all generally aware of Beth's problems and mistakes. But as fans, we want to see them improve. So when they do improve, as fans, we want to commend them for it so that hopefully they can build their reputation back up again.
---
I'm on PS4 and encountered both of these bugs upon booting up fresh sessions over the course of two days.
---
I had to reinstall and update before playing the game again.
---
My PS4 has a direct connection as opposed to WiFi and I have good internet, so that's not the problem either.
---
I'm guessing that they would need to pay some people to do this and they don't want to. That or they can't figure it out and don't want to admit that. OR
---
they know how, and spotted a potential for using text chat to dupe somehow
---
Been here since the beta! Loved every minute
---
I only play with one person and he's rarely ever on. For the most part I'm playing alone and without voice chat and I still really enjoy myself. 
---
There have been times when I've grouped up with some people without voice chat. In that case we emote, or sometimes when necessary send each other direction messages through Xbox chat.
---
Echo this myself, around 600 hours &amp; teamed up for the first time ever last night heh
---
Been here since beta only lvl.20
---
That‚Äôs cool man. I‚Äôm UK time, so not sure what time that‚Äôll be for me. Either way, hit me up when you‚Äôre on and we‚Äôll give it a go. üòéüëç
---
I've had the second issue probably once a day.  It usually comes with an audio "pop," and then the screen just fails to fade up from black when you arrive at your destination.  It seems like it's more likely to happen if I fast travel to player CAMPs, but I don't think that's a requirement.
---
Oh, you are mean, shame on you, lol
---
Flying above the map and below the map, aimbots, 30+ rounds in a revolver, invincibility, wallhacks, etc. Basically any hack you can think of due to the fact there is zero anticheat software on the servers.
---
as others have said what you rename something wont show to other players it only shows to you what you renamed it to.   
---
6k is too high plans for em are everywhere i see people selling the jetpack plans for 500 caps in their machine everyday, and since most can build all the pa parts they need about the only thing i could see you selling are calibrated legs and jetpacks since they are the most sought after but ya looking at alot of weight being used like that in your stash.
---
You have a higher chance of legendary adds spawning at arkos pharma than the queens adds.  Both the queen and the alpha spawn three star, the alpha can be killed in 10th the amount of time as the Queen.  Arkos is better all around than the Queen, I just server hop there.  Nuking the Queen is boring nowadays
---
Not in my experience, no.
---
Grab Gunsmith or the melee version of it, depending on your flavor. I run rank 3 on two of my characters, who both use explosive legendary, and I'm still not running into this supposed repair frequency issue.
---
Alright, thanks for the info. Any other consistent bugs come to mind?
---
Pc masterrace am i right?
---
Other players.
---
I have been playing since beta on ps4 and I dont use my mic or have people to play with. It's still fun. I use the emotes to communicate with other players. 
---
The only time I have used my mic is in nuclear winter to tell the other teammates I had the last code so we could launch the nuke. We ended up winning the match so it was worth it.
---
Good for you!!!!
---
Nothing more satisfying taking down a big bad enemy!!!!
---
Been here since launch as well. Love 76!
---
noooooooo!
---
Thank you so much. You are a godsend
---
90 percent of the PC players I run with that don't use mics don't use mics because they don't want to wake up someone sleeping nearby, like a baby or a family member. The others, let's see: one has kids that make a LOT of noise and demand attention all the time and the other says English is not his first language and he is very hard to  undestand over mic.
---
We are getting decision tree dialogue, more NPCs ( there are quite a few beyond rose at the moment but yes the conversations are 1-sided at the moment).  Let‚Äôs not pretend like story has been exceptionally strong in previous fallouts. 3 and 4 were pretty stale when you compare to something like ‚Äúthe last of us‚Äù.  Anyway it‚Äôs all personal preference. My main point is people are still complaining about things that have been fixed and are still calling the game ‚Äúa broken mess that is unplayable‚Äù. I mean.... come on.
---
It's the # update needed. Would be nice to be able to bull with other players on the server or coordinate farming and nuke strikes. Even better for helping new players. Type out "come to vault 76 for free stuff!" In chat
---
I wouldn't mind like another game mode with no fast tracks outside if some specific places, like rail lines. I'd play it.
---
Yea im only now considering a headset so id say yea def get it
---
You honestly can't put yourself in anyone else's shoes can you.
---
How about depleted uranium inflicts some rad damage aswell
---
It‚Äôs possible but you need crap ton of people, stimpaks and a genie so the system doesn‚Äôt crash because of the crap ton of people ü§£ü§£
---
I haven‚Äôt had a chance to test it cause I have no PA but I‚Äôd try to find out if my Pink Sprinkles paint does this.
---
The map is huge, and there lots of empty space.
---
I'd much rather see that filled in before we move onto a new setting. But a snowy region with radioactive blizzards would be really cool.
---
Are you still there by chance?
---
IF you had a disability you'd know why.
---
Dosent them and us also include him
---
Which is a good idea.  There is a lot of lore in the West and any prequel set there would be highly restricted in what they could do story wise.
---
There are lots of east coast places that are still perfect for Fallout or specifically 76 expansions.  The Secret City in TN, birthplace of the Atomic bomb, for starters.  They wouldn't even have to make new environmental textures for the most part.
---
I guess I‚Äôm just glad this isn‚Äôt an issue on Xbox.... and they close exploits constantly. Sorry you are having such a bad experience.
---
Hellz yeah xD the frame rate drop i was experiencing on PS4 wasn't nice!
---
Always loved the game. Mob mentality going on with all the haters. Love the Battle Royal also. Occasionally a game crash, hardly ever. I wish when it crashed it puts your progress back, ie: having to restart a mission from scratch.
---
Yeah I just unlocked it because I thought it would be great in NW.. gimme those atoms back Bethesda there should be a disclaimer or something
---
Bethesda for some reason elevates console gaming and does not elevate PC gaming DESPITE the fact we buy more games, and we keep and fix the games with MODs.
---
I play solo and it has been just fine. Occasionally you can tag team the community events when you see people on the map near it. But other than that, I've done other objectives on my own with no issue.
---
None that are bad enough to require a restart of the game.  Mostly little quirks, like enemies spawning in weird positions, the store UI lagging behind your cursor, the CAMP being super slow to load it at the beginning of a game, etc.
---
What system are you on?
---
Exactly. Also text chat on personal terminal. üòä 
---
For the immersion!
---
üëπü§òüèª
---
Not a big consol fan
---
I used to use consol for everything but after i got a gaming pc i rarely use console
---
Haha beat me to this comment
---
I'm totally ok with this.
---
Yea I get this all the time, hover over a name to fast travel, crash, FUCK.
---
I need your clothes, your boots, and your nuclear codes. &lt;/Austrian accent&gt;
---
How does this happen?
---
Must be nice, i had the exact same position as you except one level 100+ showed up and a whole bunch of level 20‚Äôs. Needles to say I‚Äôm out of ammo and stimpacks, and the SBQ got away
---
I remember when they took it out but just wanted to make sure I didn‚Äôt miss them reversing it. Thanks anyways!
---
Gotcha. Guess I might have had some bad luck getting the ones that require restarts then
---
Considering that there is far more to the game than BR, that no one seems to be talking about anything else, it sure does make the game look shallow on content.
---
The faithful to Fallout really feel like Bethesda needs all the help they can get advertising and selling the game, and making ALL the myriad of flaws the game has in unplayable or uncompletable content and its infuriatingly frustrating glitches get lost in the 100s of exactly the same posts of "I can't believe I love NW so much, OMG, Bethesda is awesome"
---
Considering the rest of the game is also free, all the new players don't seem to be talking about any of it at all.
---
Apologies for the bump, rather than making a new thread, I figured I would mention another bug I came across. This is an older bug that was patched some time ago. If you alt tab your game, and then tab back in, there is an invisible "box" your mouse becomes stuck in within a menu system. This prevents you from moving the mouse all the way to the right or all the way to the bottom, making it impossible to select certain menu items. If you exit the game and relaunch it, menu functionality is restored.
---
I actually held off buying the game BECAUSE of the bad reviews. It really did teach me something though, gamers do not understand what makes up a good game. Haters try to justify why it's such a bad game, most of whom have never even played Fallout 76, and yet I could list tons of games this size which fit the bill for all flaws mentioned, of which never received the same level of hatred. People just like to exaggerate the negatives, they revel in the false validation, that what they have to say is fact, when actually it's a subjective opinion. 
---
You either love the game or you hate the game. But unless you're a professional game developer or critique, you do NOT know what makes a game, a good game.
---
This used to happen when you try and fast travel immediately after loading in. They fixed it though. Maybe something got messed up in their recent update. If so, I would file a report and they should be able to fix. Hasn‚Äôt happened to me though.
---
I don‚Äôt care about the story telling point I just wanna fight in the glowing sea
---
Ghouls and all?
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. No one I know even plays video games, but I‚Äôve gotten by just fine.
---
He flew so far! That‚Äôs awesome!
---
Yep you're welcome
---
Since day 1 in beta
---
Where does brief case spawn
---
Some armors with rad resistance actually work, and I've been told that the non-functional rad resist is actually just a mislabeled disease resist.
---
I waited for literally half an hour last night when it happened right after I claimed a workshop and set up all the collectors. I gave up and turned my Xbox off in disgust.
---
Baby mirerlurks... OI YOU STOP BITIN' MAH ANKLES!

Restart your bethesda launchet

Yea but imo gameplay &gt; story for NW

**Issue: Wood Armor Reverts to a 1\* Legendary**
---
This  is an issue that's been reported since the B.E.T.A. so many times there  are almost not words, and now the Legendary Vendor is teasing us with  3\* Wood Armor that reverts to 1\* when you log out or switch servers.
---
The wood armor, unlike any other Armors found, only had the "Prefix" AP
---
ap\_Legendary1 \[KYWD:001E32C8\]
---
Effecting:
---
Armor\_Wood\_ArmLeft "Wood Left Arm" \[ARMO:0012C3B0\]
---
Armor\_Wood\_ArmRight "Wood Right Arm" \[ARMO:0012C3B2\]
---
Armor\_Wood\_LegLeft "Wood Left Leg" \[ARMO:0012C3C2\]
---
Armor\_Wood\_LegRight "Wood Right Leg" \[ARMO:0012C3C3\]
---
Armor\_Wood\_Torso "Wood Chest Piece" \[ARMO:0012C3CB\]
---
Fix:
---
Add   the following Attach Points to the Wood Armor, or make it clear to the   community this love "Niche" armor is not intended to always be  inferior.
---
ap\_Legendary2 \[KYWD:004E89A8\]

They did a good job making this game fun solo or in a group. I like teaming up with random people occasionally to keep things fresh and also replay old missions. It‚Äôs def worth checking out.
---
Try remodding it with the .308 receiver?
---
What platform are you on?
---
I‚Äôve loved it since launch, yes some problems here and there but I love all fallout and elder scrolls games!!!
---
Xbox One.
---
There is a big differnce between if this was a mod and a feature you say that the community isnt that toxic and a whole it isnt but that only counts us here on reddit not face book groups where it dosent matter if its the minority it is about how loud you can hehaw
---
The area voice chat should be added in nuclear winter battle royale.
---
You have the diffuser recipe??
---
Laun checked ed my first nuke last night level 50 lost like 40 stims and all my bullets had to switch to an assualtron blade i found towards the end but i did it
---
I launched the nuke on the sbq and no one came then the fame crashed...
---
At least i finished the quest
---
Tell me about it as it's doing my head in as I'm farming steel for my railway rife.
---
I‚Äôm hoping we get more time after sneak peek is done.
---
you're fine.  i voice chat with one irl friend, and play solo 99% of the time.
---
The only reason I left was because my PlayStation Plus membership ran out and I had to focus on graduating. Came back at the beginning of the month and its even better than I remembered!
---
Try putting all your 308 in your stash, and then reloading it.
---
I have a disability, one which at it's worst means I can't speak at all, so I'm the target market. I'd still rather they spend their time on something else.
---
But id gladly assist you in 76 once i get home
---
Im away from home until the 18th or late 17th
---
I have never had an issue with them, they're fun little distractions. Only one that annoyed me was the one near Watoga, 9 super mutants, 12+ cave crickets and a sheepsquatch. That took alot of ammo.
---
It was the Parade.
---
Yes. And the "Scrap all junk" option should scrap empty beer bottles too.
---
There's ten times more console players than PC.
---
i have this issue now everytime i log in to the game
---
try changing to another weapon
---
fire a shot and change back to your hunting rifle that worked for me
---
Yes, but what if it worked like other elevators in the game and just teleported you upwards.
---

Maybe it's a fire weakness. I wonder what a flamer would be like?
---
Really? See my other reply.
---
I'll give that a shot, although it isn't even showing .50 as an option for loading.
---
Level 20 player here.  Can you explain this a bit further.  Camera? Echo locate?
---
Have they ever explained how they have a radio station? Like is it a perpetual loop on an emergency broadcast system? And you‚Äôd think a couple decades after the bombs there‚Äôd be more playable music around ..not like it‚Äôs been over 200 years where things decay ...
---
I did. It's saying "6.99 GB / 6.99 GB @ 1.15 MB a second", almost like it's downloading but now showing the correct download info or something? Man, we're already off to bad start here.
---
Seriously?  The diffuser is listed under ‚ÄòMeds‚Äô and not ‚ÄòStimpaks‚Äô ?
---
Personally I think that 51 is a simulator vault like in 3.  New maps from various locations would make perfect sense.
---
I found a suit (1000 rad resistance) did not do much still died lol
---
Okay, I'll try this too.
---
I've been playing since day one I haven't stopped playing yet because I love it.

At that point close the game and re-open it, ive never heard of a match taking that long
---
Weird. I always find a match immediately but I‚Äôve seen others making similar comments. I‚Äôm going to try and log on now and see if I have issues...
---
It's funny because the lack of a simple text chat is what's been keeping me away from the game recently and not fully interacting with others. I don't always want to speak, and I don't always want to listen to people moaning, yawning and just talking non-stop. A simple text box, either proximity activated or global is enough to give us the needed connection between specific players.
---
A tie.. we will make the live together.. OR DIE.. then we will have no NPCs so that wouldn't work
---
My dad experienced that id recomend restarting your device and try again it worked for him
---
let me know if it worked üëçüèº
---
It worked, thank you!!!
---
Yeah.. or if you pick up a holotape, let it stay in your inventory instead of having to pick it up/find it again

focus on your damage perks and armour penetration.  so more rifleman/expert etc.  tank killer in perception for rifle armour penetration, and martial artist (swing speed)and  incisor in strength for armour pen.  all that str and barely any damage perks for melee... are you on PC?  i can craft you some stuff.
---
I also like how it says ‚ÄòKill Three Huge Creatures‚Äô but actually means ‚ÄòKill Three Different Huge Creatures‚Äô.
---
I thought it was funny. I live quests with humour. I kind of feel that dark humour is a big staple of the fallout franchise.
---
I don't believe I've ever had options of what to reload. If that doesn't work I'd put the rifle itself in your stash, relog, and pull it back out. If that's still not working then I haven't the foggiest.
---
You used an onion article to prove a point? you lose....
---
‚úã. Been playing steadily since BETA. Only level 140, but I enjoy wandering around and occasionally chatting with new people.
---
Those are just opinions, not proof.
---
Yo!
---
How would with PA be best when theres unyielding armor?
---
So?
---
Been here since launch! 
---
I‚Äôm just really bad at playing it seems cause i‚Äôm still level 11 lol
---
But i really like this game and how it‚Äôs slowly getting better and better.
---
Like server stability
---
Check Youtube, there are quite a few tutorials about the ‚Äúrules‚Äù of building camps.
---
Helped me out a good bit.
---
I just use the music to dance.
---
I put on the Leather cap, strip naked, and then cycle through photo mode poses in rhythm and it kind of looks like dancing.
---
This has been my favorite feature of NW so far.
---
It would make sense for pre war but having a map like Diamond City be in a simulation would be strange. But still would love different maps
---
If you are hopelessly adventurous than this is the game for you.
---
Just...let it have it‚Äôs moment. The sub‚Äôs interests will wax and wane. I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a positive thing that‚Äôs being well received for being in an alpha state, and bringing in more players is good.
---
This feature would be nice for sure. Especially if you can just set your buy price like you‚Äôre saying.
---
Server stability is ok, I'd rather they worked on new quests
---
some one has a spread sheet on mod chances
---
Also, testing since novembet? On a mode that's less than a week old? How's that happened then?
---
So they spend their time on things which benefit the most people
---
Try a scan and repair. I have never had this issue.
---
Been here since the beginning . Every day.
---
Yep, this is exactly what they did with the Blackbird skin recently.  I doubt any atomic shop item will ever go away permanently.
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúvault‚Äù
---
Love/hate, but I still stuck around throughout.
---
Is the Grafton Mayor voiced by Nathan Fillion? I swear it's his voice.
---
Ive been here the whole time and i have always loved it. Sure it had its issues but bethesda has done alot to reconcile many of them and wild appalachia was amazingly fun. Not to mention i was hella skeptical about NW but thats highly enjoyable too.
---
How dare you
---
Mantle probably
---
Amazon has the physical versions for all three platforms for $17, FWIW.
---
The wagging tongue.
---
Items a  breaking faster only for you... And somehow.. You are also the only player who can't win repair kits like everyone else. Or repair your gun to 200% instead of crapy 100% that the kit offers.
---
Also also you can no longer repair at benches. Not all of us.. Just you
---
So yes in your case. They did it specifically to your account only to pressure you in to making the important purchase of a repair kit.
---

---
He has always been a fame chaser.
---
Ever since his terrible assassins creed 1 and 2 reviews, where he basically ripped on completely optional content and mentioned nothing of the core gameplay just so he could jump on the haters band wagon and make a name for himself. 'Jim doesn't sugarcoat it'... but he does take everything out of context just to prove the point he has decided to make when looking at the trending tab.... he is the definition of a hack.
---
Thatd be ok.  Perhaps make survival mode the mode without lengendaries.  So if people want to play with they can play adventure, if they want to play without they can play survival.
---
Ive yet to even try survival mode, but of they did this Id be on it.
---
Hunting rifles are easy to craft. Plans are common. Not much grinding.
---
Once you unlock the actual camera (not camera mode) and you "shoot" it at an area it will show a name in the upper right corner "diseased feral ghoul, scorched cave cricket" etc. By looking around through the eyes of the camera you can see when the name pops up and move in that direction, when the name disappears you passed the corpse up or moved too far in one direction so you stop rotate the camera and move again. It's like a divining rod for finding corpses when the terrain is messy.
---
You will listen to our music and u will like it
---
I raised my hand. Lvl 151 and played since the beta
---
I pre ordered on announcement.  I played for a month and stopped till 4 weeks ago.  I played so much in 1 month I got bored of the game.  I loved it for everything it was on release, and I saw the potential, but I felt like I was forcing my self to play something I loved after a while.  I needed some time away from fo76, so I nodded the shit out of NV on my PC lol.  But when I did come back it was such a big difference, I was no longer checking my map every few minutes to watch for someone greifing my base and stealing all my water and food.  
---
Even coming back I can see the leap the community took, every post on release was filled with so much hate towards the game and everyone involved.  But now I see people helping new players, people telling stories, and the occasional bug or glitch which is still a good thing!  Honestly Bethesda is still my favorite gaming company and even more after Todd came out and took responsibility ON STAGE at E3.
---
Not future established settlements for sure, I was thinking more like geographic areas. 
---
A Glowing Sea BR would be interesting in that you have to manage intense radiation on top of the regular combat.  Nuka World was a prewar park and would also work.
---
Hit and run, allow the enemy to go back to their routine and then strike again.
---
Anyone know what's behind the level 100 door?
---
Yeah I did something similar with a combat shotty vs a team in PC
---
Thus is what I wanted hordes to be. Rarer but hard
---
I joined this sub not just to sit here and kiss todds ass. But to find out content info,stories and lore of the game. Something /r/fallout was a haven for but has turned into a hot mess.Some of that does exist here and is why i continue to stay subbed. But  It tends to be overshadowed and  seasoned with cultist qualities.   You can enjoy something but still see its flaws, its perfectly healthy.
---
Mirelurk Kings evil fish sticks
---
It's a meme at this point. People are either spreading the hate because they think it's funny, and people who are complete butt monkeys, have no interest in giving the game a go, but support and rant on about how crap the game is even though they probably don't even know what a vaults purpose is let alone anything else about the fallout universe. 
---
I loved Fallout 4, and a few hours into 76, to me, it felt like fallout 4, that was the biggest thing I loved about it at the time. I was massively disappointed with ESO, because I came straight off of Skyrim and it felt like a big step in the opposite direction, it felt like a clunky mess. But 76 stayed true to it's predecessors mechanics. Also, the world is absolutely beautiful, and packed full of immersive lore, the camp building is more fun and useful than in Fallout 4. The game does a good job at not making it too difficult for solo players too, which is another thing I love about it. I could honestly keep going.
---
&gt; When people in r/fallout are literally arguing that 76 is
---
He specifically says right there in the first sentence that he's describing things that people in /r/fo4 don't like, and repeatedly says "they" in his post. How did you turn that into him talking about things he doesn't like himself?
---
Flying insects
---
What do you mean by "mantle" ?
---
Are you on PC? I'll play with you, and I'll turn off my mic to fit your style.
---
I don't even get this post. Where are people supposed to talk about it?
---
God forbid Fallout 76 content gets discussed on a fallout 76 sub.
---
The real challenge is viable non-combat builds.
---
 I just want my fasnacht man mask in NW
---
OP's explanation is sound, but you are suggesting the problem is Bethesda's? That's insane, his ISP is giving out dynamic IPs, no software company is asked to deal with that.
---
OP needs to set his gaming rig up on wireless. Even if the IP changes at the ISP level dynamically, the wifi 'step' on the datagram's journey should solve his issues.
---
Further, and it takes some knowledge, OP can set up a VPN with full knowledge of the German ISP he referred to. This would totally solve the issue and would give ethernet connection but would require buying a VPN client device, assuming the ISP doesn't give them out.
---
To suggest software companies have any burden here is crazy talk!
---
Food build ain't the way to surviving out here
---
Been here since launch and love it, though the last two dlcs haven't been my cup of tea as I hate when content gets gated behind group/pvp play. Can't wait for wastelanders!
---
What do you mean by ‚Äúwhat‚Äù?
---
From my observations you get more xp for lasting longer, more caps for killing things. So if looking for xp find a bush and hide, if looking for caps go on murder sprees.
---
 Here since the Beta. Bought it the first day it came out and have loved the game from the beginning. ;)
---
Server stability is NOT ok for me OR any of my PC friends, just so you know
---
‚ÄúShitters full!‚Äù
---
Scorched radroaches purely because you'll be focused on killing the queen and all you can hear is that bloody knocking sound from one hitting you.
---
The biggest pain of the bunker is the ridiculous amount of turrets. They dont hurt but god they are annoying
---
Wait you can't repair at benches anymore? Is the kit the only way to repair?
---
I play solo but i do group occasionally. I also help people as i see them as well as play events and the queen. Its fun i love this game.
---
I learned it, and did not get a second one yet. But I can sell you crafted diffusers cheap and you can sell it more expensive if you like.
---
Been here since beta and only have single week breaks when I get a new game then I come back to Appalachia
---
I want to like ESO, but everything about my attempts to play it just rubbed me the wrong way, it didn't feel right to me.
---
Been here since beta, only lvl.69
---
at $17 its a serious consideration, but I did read in some of the reviews people were getting codes that straight up didn't work.
---
I play on xbox and almost never lag, crash every once in a while but never lag
---
Um you can't kill anyone level 5 and under unless something has changed
---
I have a issue where it won't let me buy anything. Keep telling me I'm  at max weight????
---
I completely agree.  But in certain circumstances I feel it should be allowed to an extent.  If someone's cheating in a way that is effecting people in the long-term (getting others banned). Bethesda can only do the job so fast, and someone could be effected before they get to fix the problem.
---
I thought it was going to be absolutely terrible but I really enjoy Its been a while since I've played adventure mode because it's that fun
---
I run a none PA build. Really depends on what you're going for. Mine is built around stealth. I have about 390 DR and 550+ energy resistance.
---
In endurance there is a perk card called iron clad. You'll also be wanting evasive and white knight perks from agility. But honestly there are so many different builds.
---
I have noticed though that despite having near the same amount of resistance as I do in PA I still take more damage out of it. No idea why this is.
---
Well I can only speak for myself. It seems ok on PS4, and I played a few hours on PC during the free week and had no disconnects, but obviously that's only anecdotal data.
---
The dupes work on xbox just as on pc and ps4, same with the dev room still being in the game even after they know people have been accessing it and taking items from it.
---
I'd hope they actually would fix some of these exploits instead of just ignoring them. Same with text chat, I have friends who are deaf, they won't play this game because they can't communicate with anyone. It is disgusting that they completely ignore deaf players and basically tell them they aren't worth taking 10 minutes to implement text chat.
---
Nah, your progress in the bunker saves kind of. Just dont afk more than like 20m or you'll get kicked from the server then you'd lose your progress i think. Find small rooms and use escape artist and your fine or fast travel out or hide In the entrance elevator
---
I like the atrium or whatever it's called (has lots of plants) if you go to the 2nd level and jump out onto the rocks you probably won't even get punched and the music is pretty quiet.
---
Only the team leader quests are shown to other in the group.
---
I agree with this, always liked the concept
---
I think they're all broken... At least I can't get the kill huge beasts one to register.
---
I just wanna see my reticle on my western revolver while in stealth mode and sneaking!
---
He was sniping with a pipe auto lol. But his crossbow game wasn‚Äôt half bad
---
Silo runs arent difficult if you know how to do them efficiently.  Honestly, I run them solo and can do it in relative ease.  I engage/kill only the robots I have to, the reactor/mainframe is the most lengthy part but I just run through those areas repairing/destroying until the bars are complete.  Can do a whole silo run in probably 15 minutes.  Never timed one, but its not too long anymore
---
And you shouldnt need to repair but I do recommend bringing some sort of an explosive weapon (auto grenade launcher for me) to speed up one section
---
They said on Twitter they're temporarily disabling them
---
Why escape them when you can JOIN them
---
Never had a reason not to.
---
He said survival, there is no level cap for pvp in survival.
---
It‚Äôs kind of annoying that they don‚Äôt have any kind of stat trackers like enemies killed and caps collected like fo4 did
---
Perhaps he means jump.
---
Damn man. That chick is hard core!
---
Add me if you like, I wont team up straight away, but i have my mic on and area chat is pretty good in fallou. Your more than welcome to tag along with me and grind some xp or find new locations and so on. My help is free lol
---
I'm a UK gamer if that matters for time zones and so on. I'm also a mature gamer, I'm currently being followed around the wasteland by a 12 year old kid who I've kind of taken under my wing lol but thank God hes a good lad and not completely annoying lol. The more the merrier :) 
---
I'm on most days.
---
I think the luck stat or intelligence stat may affect this.
---
I'm guessing at some point there will be an update that targets CAMPs. We  might get something then or they might sprinkle stuff in randomly.  Idk just my thoery
---
Wouldn't need a text chat if their voice chat would work all the time.   Another thing they should improve on.  Many times the voice chat would wig out and you can't hear your teammates.
---
Server crash Russian roulette
---
According to your statement. Apex isnt in beta yet even if the game is released because they only have 3v3.
---
Yeah, I've been enjoying the free weekend, too bad I can't be able to play it after that, its not available on my country, or I think it is.. I needed a VPN to play it so I guess not, I really want that game but I cant buy it..
---
&gt; i dOnT iDeNtIfY wItH bRaNdS

https://www.reverbnation.com/thedregsdetroit
---
I've been playing since the B.E.T.A. and I'm still going strong.
---
Wait we talk about fallout 76 here thst explains why my rage 2 post have been falling flat
---
Just use Action Boy/Marathoner if your playstyle calls for a lot of sprinting.  I personally don't use either and I rarely have issues with running out of AP.
---
They need to fix the hacking first
---
Sorry, I'll spoonfeed it to you okay?
---
&gt;You're just rambling about things you don't like [hearing from others]. 
---
Not even the point but leave it to you freaks to cling to any 'gotcha!' you can invent in your head.
---
Beta player here! I‚Äôve had fun with every glitchy part of this game
---
Apex isnt designed to ever be a solo BR anytime soon, completely different case
---
also jump is the same as the connect the wires key ..very annoying trying to connect things at a workship before they attack
---
Yeah, cause people can just solo the SBQ, if you've not been paying attention no one has been running her for like the last week since the BR came out.
---
Should up the XP for kills &amp; downs, give XP for damage and give XP for assists. Would encourage a lot more aggression.
---
PS4?
---
PA is decent honestly, you can get pieces destroyed in one fight, meanwhile I can get marine armor to last the entire round most of the time
---
you do not get special points after a max of 50 total and 15 per Special at most
---
Doesn't seem that way to me. My gun last hours of game play before breaking. Sometimes I go days without repairing it. Bearing in mind my hand made is semi auto and has high doubled durability.
---
You stop getting points after level 50.
---
I can 2 shot PA guys with some melee weapons and chems B)
---
Single player here!
---
That quest pissed me off mostly because it wasnt that much of a one-off tbh.  I maybe would have found it amusing if the rest of the quests that led up to it didnt have that kind of ‚Äúgo here find this note to go here now repeat‚Äù tedium.  I dont even remember what I was actually there for besides the fact I was overleveled and already bored of the fetch quest string.
---
It's limited to I think 50 total, but with armor chems food etc you can boost it. My bloodied melee is up around 32 STR with unyielding x4 pieces.
---
WastelandEstatesHOA on Twitch has some amazing build shows.
---
Fences. Sweet baby Jesus give us new fences
---
Alright, now is there a way to remove points? Or if you mess up and get the wrong one your build if fucked?
---
Don't you mean "it just works"?
---
*EXTRA THICC*
---
Nice thighs, take my arrow.
---
That really sucks man.
---
Woops I missed the survival part read the post to quick
---
If you got the right perks and chems, your best bet is honestly meleeing PA, I can 2/3 shot PA depending on the weapon and possibly which PA pieces they have
---
Well theres the issue. Go play adventure level up then play survival.
---
Sneak attacks with a suppressed hunting rifle are as good as anything for killing higher-level enemies, but you haven't taken many combat perks. At level 24 you should at least have the second rifleman and/or shotgunner cards, and one or two points in Sneak if you want to use stealth.
---
At this point you really want to pick a weapon type (or one and a half, at most) to specialize in. Start taking some of those +5% damage perks when you don't have anything great on offer.
---
As for specific enemies: Snallygasters are pretty easy if you spot them at any distance. Just pop them in the head a few times. That's usually not an option with wendigos, so I often ended up kiting them around scenery at lower levels. For radscorpions, keep moving and listen for where they pop up.
---
Agreed. This world is a "protect the cheaters, liars and thieves" sad example of a society.
---
GT BLUNTERNOTE571, doesn't tell anyone anything about me unless they go to my xbox profile and I have /allowed/ my name to be shared (and that's an Opt In Feature, not an Opt Out so it's disabled by default). If I cheat and someone wants to spread the word and call me out then good for them. As a human race we need to start calling bullshit when we see it. If that gets a sub, or myself, banned...then screw it, it would be worth it. Otherwise we are left with a subreddit that has cheaters all over it, ruining it anyway. 100% Legit or 100% Banned.
---
That's a good method and sounds successful. 
---
I personally run heavy perks due to what the cards gave me.
---
What plan and were to get it?
---
The band is on purpose so to make sure everyone whats to get into game so they don't hear it anymore.
---
Pretty clever.
---
Other games doing it doesn't seem like a good enough reason, I like the limitation of people either emoting or actually talking. Having a text chat window just seems annoying in this game and would discourage the voice and emotes when these are some of the best parts of the social aspect.
---
I have found 1 good use for it, though it is a very specific situation: the bridge. If I see PA on there, I jump in. Has saved my ass in a firefight a few times, since if it gets hairy, I just hop off the bridge if I'm outgunned or out numbered.
---
Yep, if you click leave and say "yes" to are you sure you want to leave, it doesn't count.   
---
Only counts if you wait until the end and it disconnects you. Dying doesn't complete the match, just concludes your life.
---
I advise playing Adventure before logging into survival. Even if it's just to get out of the area and get a few map markers for spawning.
---
I‚Äôve always loved the game. I work a job that took me away for the past 4 months I‚Äôm glad I came back right when the BR hit, it‚Äôs been a fun time, especially with friends or teams who value comms.
---
Me and my buddy clear nuke silos in less than 20 minutes without power armor and we use bloodied builds
---
*hand raising intensifies*
---
Been with it since launch, work schedule permitting of course.
---
My god thats abysmal &gt;&lt;
---
If you haven't already, submit a support ticket on the official Bethesda site.
---
Sounds pretty useful as of my expierience as a bait so far... Might give it a try
---
Thank you so much. Can't believe I still didn't know this and I'm level 97.
---
Thanks. That rule makes sense....but i agree that id soesnt make sense for this post. Its pretty obvious how your post is related to Fallout 76.
---
Pretty sure it's just adventure and survival mode. Be cool to get more adventure mode exp from NW matches though.
---
IMO a large amount of quests in this game are exactly that, running around fetching things. 
---
It made me realize that if you don‚Äôt care about the end result of the quest, you‚Äôll find it boring.
---
If they went to the one in Kanawha city, yeah, probably.
---
Instead of dying from the fog your character would go mad and become an npc
---
I'm currently on the free weekend, first time player. I love survival games like DayZ and Subnautica but I struggle to play once I've completed the story or seen everything the game has to offer (like with dayz!)
---
I do love fallout4 especially the settlement building, although again, only when there is a point to it.
---
Should I bother with this do you think? 
---
Is there much of an endgame?
---
I've actually still to find information as to what the point of fallout 76 is precisely!
---
Happy cake day
---
After level 50 you can choose to move a point or pick a new perk.
---
Each level after 50 you can choose either a new perk card or move a point from one special to an other.
---
just got here and making demands already..
---
Where did you get maxons coat?
---
It's barely a step up from the nylon bag. It's thin cotton canvas, still single stitch and while the nylon bag appeared to have a screen printed logo, the new one appears to be iron on.   
---
It pretty much matches the material quality of the Helmet and that's not that awesome.   
---
I opened the closet I left the entire box in (inside its original shipping box no less), shoved the bag into the helmet right next to the original nylon garbage bag and closed everything back up and closed the closet.
---
Yikes!  If you haven't already, submit a support ticket on the official Bethesda site.   The more detailed the report including time and timezone of disconnect, the better.
---
Every level after 50 let you move one point from one stat to another or pick one new perk card.
---
when you reach above level 50 you can move 1 point from 1 spot to another. but it consumes that level and you get no  perk card unless that level gave you a card pack
---
When I launched my first nuke at sbq only one other person came but around the ten minute mark he left leaving me alone so I just went and collected flora
---
You like it? Mine won‚Äôt be here until Tuesday.
---
Tank killer perks should be coming up soon and id highly recommend the full 3 if your running rifles/commando/pistols. anti armor makes a huge difference.
---
I got a faster fire rate combat rifle so i put away my handmade for a bit. With the swift mag and 3 tank killer cards it's a semi auto that hits hard like a rifle and almost as fast as a comando spray. Combine with sneak and i can ger 3 or 4 shots that count 2x or more on every mob.
---
Not run into this issue. I have had a weird colour bug that usually corrects itself after a few minutes. ( Everything gets a purple hue)
---
Make sure your drivers are up to date. I know it sounds simple but you might be surprised at how many issues this fixes.
---
I feel that, he was playing the Fallout BR like it was H1Z1
---
Fallout as a franchise is dead to me. I hate what this game become and how people treat it like it's fine. at this point you could just slap a vault boy on a pile of shit and sell it to new fallout fans. ridiculous.
---
I will not play or buy any future Fallout or Bethesda game. 
---
**Fuck Bethesda**
---
It could spawn anywhere on the map
---
I too have been sitting on my first nuke for 8 months yet to fire one. I'm not sure I want to push the big red button.   
---
Unless someone was there to turn the key with me, then i'd feel more confident that I could handle the hell unleashed.
---
well the endgame is just finding better loot so you either have the "diablo" mindset or you don't
---
T51.  Best all around.
---
Ooohhh okay, cause i was using Nukesdragon for a build i got, and i accidentally pit an extra point into perception so it 2 when it was only to be at 1, and i was worried i messed up everything üòÖthanks for the clarification.
---
Appreciate you reaching out, but I don't player vendor so no attraction for reselling for me. 
---
I spend like mad and lvoe visiting player CAMPs and spending :)
---
If I saw 25 cap diffusers in any store Id buy them all, in a heartbeat. Id use a few myself for the Tadpole badge and then hand more out to my pals to do the same.
---
@25 caps, you may as well DM me your PC Bethesda name and I can join your server and buy a stack of 20 :)
---
Lol.
---
Awesome.
---
Please keep up the good work. This is genuinely funny.
---
But I've wrapped my whole identity up in being better than people who don't like some stupidass video game. What will I have left if I abandon that?  How will I convince myself I'm above somebody else? Do you know how difficult it is to just find any arbitrary bullshit to validate myself with?
---
It never occurred to me to mix them :/
---
Nice
---
100% a fan of the game! Been here since day 1 ‚ù§
---
...to the knee?
---
The BR mode is still brand new, so of course it's going to be the most talked about right now.  Although they could perhaps add more specific flairs for each game mode so you can filter by which one you want to see posts about.
---
None. It's too clunky and it gets in the way if my ghosting. üòÅ
---
Excavator. I need that extra carry weight
---
OOOHHHH SHIT SON, didn‚Äôt even realize that unintentional pun, nice stuff friend.
---
That defeats the point of creating a Survival character.
---
Around here we call them pillbillies.
---
I like to use X-01 with Excavator arms so I don't have to swap sets when I go mining.
---
Yep.  Happened to me today.  Be sure to send in a support ticket.
---
I'm thankful I haven't came across these guys yet in fo76. Hated them in fo4
---
Not had this issue myself. Perhaps a bugged out server? Have you tried both exiting and finding a new server.
---
Yep. I've got over 500 hours in, and 99.9% of that has been solo and silent.
---
Did it work?
---
I think i fired my first nuke at around level 45, it wasn't so different after all. Just need to have a ton of stimpacks
---
&gt;Do many internet service providers use dynamic ISPs that change often?   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Could that be the real problem behind some of the "server crashing" posts we see in here?
---
I'm sure there are plenty of life hacks I don't know yet and I'm level 297...
---
That happens you get used to it.
---
I keep seeing youtubers trying to shit on it but it‚Äôs just cringy
---
moments like that need to be captured!
---
T-60 brotherhood of steel all the way ad victoriam.
---
Well that's not really how it works. It's just unrestricted PVP with any old character. If you want that sort of gameplay then NW is your best bet.
---
I found that the corpses go back to the spawn point, and are no longer lootable.  Sucks killing a 3-star, getting there quick enough to see the loot just before it poofs, knowing whatever it was is gone.
---
T-51b, better stats, and now I can put PINK SPRINKLES ON IT FUCK YES.
---
At this point, I think they should just permanently price the game at $14.99 to attract more players. 
---
Then give everyone that bought the game before the $14.99 price drop some goodies to keep us happy.
---
I am absolutely loving all the newbies. I forgot how fun it is to help someone out or group with people.
---
The free trial worked wonders. Now make the game super cheap to entice those on the fence.
---
Yes please, far to long, far to many.
---
Make building smoother and easier please, also a wall pass-through for electricity please, tired of having to glitch wires through.
---
And some of them are really fast at setting up their shops, came across a bunch with canned dog food priced at 2000 capsü§Æ
---
Boo wonder why
---
So the best way to get it is to just randomly go to all these tourist sites until I get lucky and find it?
---
https://i.imgur.com/bppHKpA.png
---
Seems like long odds. Supposedly there is just one per server and that is if someone hasn't grabbed it yet.
---
Last night I had to change servers 6 times to find a Morgantown highschool where the science room had not yet been looted of its microscopes.
---
Maybe that was just bad timing with it being a free trial going on and that being a low level area people go to early in the game.
---
Text chat yes please for the love of god.
---
How about a perk card that'll let us do this? Under Perception, maybe?
---
Also don't forget to check back often for free items. These get rotated in and out.
---
Same on Xbox on Adventure. Feels like the old days where you can‚Äôt run for more than an hour without a ‚Äúserver not responding‚Äù lock up, or a crash and dump.
---
Wait Khadgar is in borderlands?
---
What about a cryptid arena were cryptids fight each other (all named with fancy nicks like Slam Sloth vs. Steve Squatsh) 
---
And we're able to bet on them...?
---
Same
---
Welcome to the other side !
---
I don't play survival at all. Was just answering the dude above how people were killing level 1s. Maybe try telling that to the free 2 play noobs getting killed.
---
Ya but the tend to skip over that part
---
Yep.
---
Has Bethesda ever said they have plans to add solo or other types. 2v2, 3v3, etc
---
Haha he was asking me to launch him! To be fair I crafted him an entire set of lvl 25 Excavator Armor after it was all said and done. I was so stoked that he had such a great time.
---
Yea it shouldn't show enemies, but don't disable it completely. There are some good photo moments.
---
1 code away.  1 freaking code, and I had the briefcase.  Gahhh
---
Loved it since the begining!
---
Where did that info come from?
---
Thanks for the warning. I thought items in the stash were safe.
---
THIS
---
I have at least 30 tins of canned dog meat üòÇ it's coming out of my ears I have that much.
---
I'll do that now
---
NW is full of hackers.
---
*Red Death flashbacks*
---
The whitesprings was the first place i ever looted
---
lol sounds really healthy üòÇ
---
Spruce Knob maybe?
---
Also, electric gates, aren‚Äôt the code pads on the wrong side of some of them üòÇ FIX IT!
---
...up with you.
---
Cool. Be patient with them, the site could use some serious improvement. ü§™ üëç
---
Is it the one near vault 76? I can't remember exactly but from vault I think its headed towards point pleasant, but close to vault.
---
Been on since beta. And have been on at least one day a week since then. Never left even when I got into other games. I've enjoyed the game from day one and have always known it had great potential. I'm glad so many people stuck with it. And I'm glad to see the community is growing.
---
What
---
I stopped for a few months bc of how janky it was at the beginning, but I've played since launch otherwise!!
---
how is a boring game the players' fault
---
like it's june and somehow players are still being blamed for the way this game is designed
---
you know apex has the same problem but deals with it by offering a range of incentives
---
that game came out in february and bethesda decided to ignore its lessons on game design
---
psa: blaming players is toxic
---
What‚Äôs your tag?
---
Multi-kill bonus required. Every kill in quick succession should be multiplicative, like the Adrenaline perk. That would help and make using nukes a bit more rewarding.
---
Spike Board Trap! You should be able to find it fairly easy, keep checking vendors!
---
XboX1 here... loads me into vault 51 staging area in under a minute every time. Sounds like a NAT setting or network error on the O.P. side maybe?
---
Making the habitat doesn't give you completion for the requirement.  You can make the jar, you can collect a frog, but putting them together does nothing for you.
---
Breck Losner
---
Nice :)
---
Crossbow is silent.
---
Couldn't resist - thx for the assist lol
---
Im down for that. Actually would be cool to add other locations from FO4. Like Nuka World too!
---
But i would also like to see some inside or underground locations as well. Maybe smaller 24 player maps in Watoga high school or Robco.
---
Console gamers rise up
---
Surely somebody must be over 100...
---
My character is dummy thicc, so much so that my teammates mock and ridicule my character's thickness. Does that affect hit box? He looks so frumpy in a hazmat suit I love it
---
Fire fighter excavator set with vault boy head, or t51.
---
T51 for its damage resistance. Excavator for the lulz
---
Been there, done that. When reviving in power armor try to be a little closer and duck and make sure the revive progress meter is moving or let go before you exit.
---
Don't actually know. Time for an experiment?
---
I don't like when people prance and caper in front of me either.
---
It‚Äôs due to all the new people. Putting strain on the servers
---
The good ole days of spamming the trap disarm glitch for ten minites and walking away with 800,000 aluminum and twenty level ups.
---
I too am lazy and still haven't complete the quest to get the camera.  Some other visual indicator would be super helpful.
---
I've played with a lvl46 once and fought against him a few times after that as well, so if not now theb soon at the very least
---
I am on PS4. None are broken except for the daily
---
Yup and it‚Äôs actually pretty good. If it had better sites it would be the best sniper in the game probably
---
I'm brand new to the game. Can you tell me the difference between survival and adventure modes?
---
Never left. Took breaks but never left.
---
They could really go all out there's a lot of iconic landmarks and places over the years
---
Unfortunately server hopping is the best way. The body is always in the same place, so that helps.For example at Wavy Willards when you fast travel or load into the world it's in the car in the parking lot straight ahead to the right a bit. I server hopped there probably 20 times and gave up so started server hopping at the miner's memorial (body on the stairs) and got it the second time.
---
Since the B.E.T.A, loved it a lot. Put it down for a while because I was very busy. I always wanted to play
---
I feel like I take crit hits wearing a top hat, but with no kill cam in NW. It's to hard to compare but. Hat vs no hat, with a character with the smallest head possible. I feel like I die more wearing that top hat.
---
As long it's not red (indicating stealing) you can take anything anywhere.
---
Random Road Spawns (like those marked on that map) are only active if a player is in the area. Once that "chunk" is unloaded and devoid of players it starts a countdown timer similar to the "cool down " period of events and then whatever road spawn was there will vanish.
---
Idk a out 1 per server, but even if that's the case that 1 road spawn will trigger the quest for EVERY player who finds it. When that camera was first launched in game it only took me server hopping about 6 times in one location before I found a server with a Spawn.
---
I would never suggest server hopping and then fast traveling to ALL possible spots, that's not time effecient. Pick a spot, server hop it...you will find him/her and start the quest.
---
I don't even visit camps anywhere near lowbie areas anymore. Every time I do it's a bunch of hunting rifles and 10mm pistols.   
---
I feel tricked when I travel to Watoga area and find a player vendor selling low level weapons and armor and will never visit them again.   
---
Just adding a Legendary counter would help a lot.
---
Did it have a crashed vertibird nearby?
---
I usually buy C.A.M.P items. I see my mothman statue more than I would see a power armor skin. If you're not sure what to buy just hang on to them until something releases that interests you
---
Wish I had 2 accounts,  it's my wife's bday today so no experiments for me
---
So that's what happened to all my bulk junk...
---
Getting shot in the gut is just the price we have to pay for beauty
---
You can see the names of things you've unlocked via the "challenges" menu. As usually not very discriptive, but it helps.
---
No clue but it would be a good idea to include, as to make getting up mountains and things easier and making frog legs not so busted.
---
How do you get the melee version? What Special is it under
---
Mules, mules mules mules.   
---
 I often find great items for sale on vendors with low level characters. I just find them on the map before quick traveling. However with the recent influx of new players, its hard to tell the mules from the players so i'm not sure adding player level to camp description would help much.
---
Nah. That's not how the game works. Its not even alphabetical. They're just going to shove that tape you need straight to the bottom. Not the actual bottom though, that'd be too easy like 9th from the bottom.
---
Day 1 beta got over 600+ hours in
---
It only took them a year to fix the bugs. Oh wait, there's still bugs....
---
I fired like 6 - 7 nades at a group of people and it seemed to do nothing - as if the blast radius of my nades was about 5 inches?!?
---
Did you even read your own comment before you posted it? Perhaps you should be quiet as nothing you said carried any weight.
---
I noticed in jims new video , he said he gave it another chance before making said video, but then says the stash is still 600 . Evidence that he lied. His journalism credentials are poo. I hope more notice that he lies, I wouldn't attack his opinion, but that misinformation is not opinion based. The stash limit is in fact 800 . And was for a couple months before he says he tried again for that video.
---
Ah well. When you get the chance to play with someone in adventure mode do a little testing with the PvP helmet on and helmet off.
---
Might be they are used to having marsupial and usually jump significantly higher, but it doesn't work in NW. Habit maybe. I'm glad it doesn't work, I hate bunny hoppers.
---
yea I wanna use letters and signs more but they consume so much budget.
---
And then you need to read them carefully to make sure you found the right one, and then you can‚Äôt find it so you start again from the top until you finally find it on your 4th try
---
Is playing every day since launch (and Beta before that) an indication of addiction? üòâ
---
Been here since beta and really always believe that the game was not bad, despite its launch was terrible and really deserved a delay. I also really think Bethesda Game Studios nailed it with the Wild Appalachia update and most of the fixes.
---
Like literally anywhere ? It must have at least some number of spawns I feel like
---
We are huggers actually.
---
Take a good look at the black bird PA skin. It'll be fine shortly, IT WILL BE BACK, but not sure when.
---
Include mantles?
---
Save them for sales.  I've bought a fair amount of things on sale that turned out very useful for build projects or outfits.
---
E3 atoms bundle in the atomic shop.
---
Is it still available?
---
The good boy perk means I never go hungry üòÇ
---
Yup. There are a ton of specific advantages to other power armors, but if you want to endure 20,000 hits from any creature t51b is the way to go
---
Those are used to make explosives.
---
Pressing "E" to Befriend a Deathclaw...
---
I have a camp dedicated to new players, and would love to put in the description "New player gear, food and drink"   
---
I feel bad when high levels show up and leave because of the leather armors
---
I just completed the Morgantown plastic run and got 178 molded plastic
---
To level up I often go to WS and shoot ghouls in the clubhouse . Here is how I do it. 1) sneak up to the pool area and get up on the wall using the hedges. Get up there and blow up the bus in front of the clubhouse. Watch out it will blow up the other cars so be careful of that. 
---
Once the bus is blown up you can jump up on top without marsupial. NOW, practice jumping up on top of it. You have to run at it from the front right bumper. Get up there a few times to get the feel of it. 
---
Now go in the clubhouse and listen. Soon as the ghouls start waking up run back out and get on that bus. Get as many shots into the ghouls as possible. Someone will come along eventually to kill them. It might even be an hour later when all the CHA CHINGS go off but they will happen.
---
The ghouls will leave you alone eventually and you can fast travel away. Rinse, repeat
---
Nuclear Winter isn't a quality replacement for what Survival needs.  Don't get me wrong NW is fun!  But it's not story mode, and having NW doesn't solve the big issue.
---
I think Survival would do well with Seasons, keep the regular unrestricted Survival mode, but add one to where only new characters can join.
---
I doubt Bethesda would hand out the cash to get new songs. Just my opinion
---
Apparently there was an issue with the "place 4 CAMPs" daily challenge a few days ago where you could do it infinite times.  They probably disabled them until they can fix that bug.
---
Well they definitely don't need to take survival out of beta. The whole point of a beta should be to test things right?
---
So why don't they make a major change to the mode, test it, and see how it works, since the mode still is in beta?
---
One finale I watched had the winner expertly navigate the thin slice of space between a recently fallen nuke and the encroaching ring of fire. Level 22, he'd already bene thru his share of both.
---
Like what?
---
The most annoying quest for me is the one where you have to get samples of blood from a few creatures.
---
I‚Äôve been stuck trying to get the blood sample from
---
A Feral Ghoul since I got it because I never get the prompt to actually collect it when I kill one.
---
LOL sir yessir *puts away cane* yeah yall are right it is good over all for the game Ill quit bitchin.
---
I have participated in that 7 times now and only once was it successful. In fact the last time I did it I activated all three pylons, kept spamming the stimpak button, shot the legendary sheep squash a couple times to tag it, and ran through 40 stimpaks.  Then I died. I went on speaker to tell everybody to leave me there because I was still on the pylons for the 30 second timer and told everybody to shoot the Sheepsquatch. I respawned and did it again. Respawned, did it again. Just wasn't enough people causing damage and we failed.
---
That's not a bad idea. A separate game mode. Like Hardcore survival. New characters only. No VATS ect.
---
Definitely an improvement and actually as advertised this time.
---
Ive done like 10.  I hack the terminal and deactivate the turrets or restrictions.  And I keep the mainframe cores.
---
Killed by him a few times and even killed him a couple times. The nuclear wasteland is brutal.
---
agreed
---
üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è 
---
I love this game I‚Äôve played it almost 800 hours. Kinda crazy to think about that sometimes because I‚Äôm siting  in front of a tv but the friends I‚Äôve made and the fun and laughs that I‚Äôve had make it seem like I‚Äôm actually being social. It would be a whole other story if it was all a single player game with that many hours for me. 
---
It displeases me when i see hate towards it. I think hate is too strong but many saying it‚Äôs frustrating is a better use of words. Admittedly I can say I have been frustrated with it but you have to see that as a developer they are seeing feedback and for the most part seem to try and work hard at updating and fixing issues. They also have think about producing income and making their user base grow. I always talk the game up because I haven‚Äôt put this much time into a game in a very long time. All time favorite games are half life diablo 2 team fortress classic and team fortress 2 counter strike fable a few other random games. 
---
The new nuclear winter mode is a lot of fun and brought a refreshing exciting level playing field into the game for me and made working with others even more necessary. 
---
The friends I have made through playing the game is awesome and something I look forward too just playing the game. 
---
So yeah I love the game only put it down for a few days at a time and I will continue to play it and hope it gets ported to new platforms so the over all longevity lasts.
---
It's great you're making a 76 comic series. I used to read solo play all the time before Stormblood came out I should really catch up.
---
Once you leave a server you lose the base(workshop) and if you‚Äôre in a squad it‚Äôll pass on to one of them.
---
aaahhhh Thanks!   
---
That makes sense.
---
I love saving up for sales. Finally reasonable prices.
---
my only thoughts are with the guy who drew up that concept.
---
"hey boss, look at this"
---
"Jerry this is great but seriously what the fuck"
---
I initially hated the game and put it down but I picked it up again and really enjoy it. I don't play it much as I don't have anyone to play it with, my friend only has the E3 trial that ends on the 17th. I'd play it more if I had a constant group to play it with.
---
Huh? I play fortnite erryday and I‚Äôm pretty damn sure there isn‚Äôt text chat‚Äîonly in the lobby. I wish there was text chat in a match!!
---
Haven‚Äôt played pubg in forever, but I dont recall any text chat in it either.
---
Apex with both text, voice, and a ping system is fucking sweet; I very much hope 76 will implement pinging and text chat!!!
---
Apex made me want every other game to have sliding lol.
---
This mode is no different the levelling is based on rng in a weeks time probs less all the players who grind will have all the damge perks and be more skill then its over for you. Have fun then.
---
Yea.
---
Same.
---
Then a slap in the face, dupe card :-D
---
Have my upvote just like Bethesda has 450+ hours I‚Äôll never get back
---
It‚Äôs speculated material. I should prolly edit it
---
Wouldn‚Äôt say loved the whole thing but I would say I‚Äôve not left.
---
Succulents I think are currently on sale.  The vaultec camp bundle is on sale too, it if looks good to you. I've gotten hats on sale as well.
---
Best one was the classic column. I got it simply because it was on sale, and when I went to build a pirate ship camp, they made great masts.
---
Might be the one SE of point pleasant. There are some cabins on top of the mountain there, the pond is a little further south east
---
Helvetia church has been pretty consistent with having power armor in it. Helvetia in general has had power armor in that location a lot of times for me
---
I wouldn‚Äôt think it to be put quite yet
---
It doesn't help nothing really exciting is happening in adventure mode.. its the same ol' same ol'...    Fortnite went the same way once the BR launched.
---
I have a old PS4, but not having these problems might just be your system.
---
I literally found one under a bed behind a folder as if the folder was placed on the ground to block sight of the brief case. They're hard to find.
---
Not sure I understand.  So my friend and I claimed a location last night, then we both got off Xbox for the night.  When I go back into Fallout today, I won‚Äôt have the base anymore?
---
Don't know if anyone else has had this but sometimes I get a weird colour bug that makes the screen have a purple hue. Sometimes it corrects itself after a few minutes.
---
Same, solo'd it.
---
I don‚Äôt bother getting the best armor since it‚Äôs useless inside power armor and just adds weight. Instead I just have some lightweight leather armor to provide some protection should I need to get out of my power armor.
---
South of Vault 76, inbetween the lumber mill/farm houses? Think that pond has a small dock
---
Both hands raised. Have loved this game from the beginning.
---
Me too.
---
*"my last 10cps on CLAWDIA Death-Schiffer! GO FOR IT BEAUTY!!"*
---
Hopewell Cave has a Deathclaw inside that is always a boss and seems to consistently drop a treasure map, and it respawns relatively quickly.  Otherwise, just run around to different locations killing boss enemies and checking large chests and locked safes for more maps.  You can also try farming random encounter locations, since there is sometimes a "Treasure Hunter" corpse that will have 1-2 maps on it.
---
Evan,  before the patch. That was an insultingly stupid game design failure.
---
I‚Äôve been playing since it launched and love it. Wish I have more time to play now.
---
Plot twist: Quest wasn't buggy at all and was doing exactly what it was supposed.
---
Playing since launch and still looove it!
---
No, the saddest thing of all is people making assumptions and then spreading ignorant incomplete thoughts as if were fact. I'm not angry or bothered by people expressing enjoyment for a game. But this is exactly the same type of circle-jerk mentality that destroys communities.
---
Better yet give us free atoms for the inconvenience.
---
I'm stuck with this game and defend it since b√™ta :)
---
Here since day 1 but still only level 25
---
I bumped into a high level sheepsquatch west of Watoga while wandering back to my camp.  I killed it but they are no joke.
---
Okay thanks a bunch
---
Who says he was camping?   And there's nothing wrong with letting all the rambo types thin each other out.  I usually stay to the woods creeping along not looking fire fight. Around 15 people left is when I get aggressive and take more chances.
---
You will win some this way but in the long run you lose far more, if you always hiding and avoiding fights you'll never be as good as you can be in gun fights. It's far better to take as many smart engagements as you can and learn something from each fight win or lose.
---
i took a small break during the ban waves but i had been keeping my eye on the game, i think i came back when they added back packs, and have been still enjoying myself
---
Once I got going in there, was loving using the fire ring for some wall protection, but Im so bad a few times I caught fire and ran for my life, shit goes to hell in BR so fast lol
---
Heck yeah, that‚Äôs what I was thinking. Fallout 4 has a mod called The Good, The Bad and The Ugly that could let you do this. Had it for corpses all the time, lol.
---
Indeed. Been here since start, loving the game more with each update. Right now I'm having so much fun looting low level areas and leaving gifts for the newbies. Rebuilding Appalachia!
---
what are Random encounter locations?
---
Wait. You can‚Äôt remake it?
---
I usually go with outfits and paints. I have recently bought the survivalist outfit. I've not seen a single other person wearing it. But I think my character pulls it off pretty well.
---
Re build it
---
You need one to make one.
---
Are you on PS4 by any chance?
---
My first attempt I jumped in and we successfully completed the event.  The last two times?  Not so much.  For what you get (loot) it‚Äôs just not worth it.
---
I'd recommend trying NW even if it isn't your thing. I don't care for BR, but playing extreme hide and seek is way more fun than I thought. One time I got to third place without even finding a gun so it's entirely possible to place high without firing a shot
---
You said it. I never left ü§òbeta till now
---
just finished a hot drop, i had a scoped western revolver, i shot a guy with 3 hip fire shots from 10m all hits (he had power armour so i guess his hit box was better), i ads'd his friend who was slowly walking towards me shooting a 50. cal  aimed at his chest and shot 3 times before i died, no hit marker and he had full hp. the hit reg is fucking ridiculous your best bet is to find any automatic gun and use that, if the game only registers 50% of your hits then just spray and pray.
---
You seem pretty upset. A lot of the duping exploits have been closed and when new ones pop up they work to address them. The text thing is something I think they are looking into. They have already acknowledged it.
---
I "left" because I didn't have time but luckily my time came back here recently so I'm back into it
---
Unfortunately you need one to build one.
---
people don't have to justify it to me I am no one special. I just don't get it though. all of the examples given are all a minority of the population as a whole. Like an extreme minority of the population. yet the majority don't want to use a feature that was asked for for over a decade. I work night shift so on my off days I have to speak quitely so I dont wake everyone else up. but and a slightly lower than normal voice I make less noise than the clickity clack of my keyboard. As far as the language barrier goes I cant say I care. Most of the rest of the world disrespects and trashes the US at any given moment so why should I give a crap about their concerns.
---
Lol bought it for 60 on release :|
---
You don‚Äôt see me complaining...*grumbles under breath about reimbursement wishes*
---
I think not. There would be no reason to search for cool weapons and armor if it had no effect in combat. The reason the combat is so much better is because of the lack of vats, not because nobody has nothing
---
Pretty sure shotgun perks do not work with the M79 anymore.
---
I have mixed feelings. I hope they see both how many people came back after the really rough launch to see what it is now, and how many stuck around. 
---
I‚Äôve been around since BETA and I‚Äôm almost 200, and I hope this spurs more modes (eventually). I‚Äôd love to see vaults get older format pvp, like quake, doom, original goldeneye, but with randomly generated spawns and timers.
---
Coming up on 800 hours since beta,  Zero atoms bought.
---
Rip that sucks :P
---
AWS is the software tech that the 24 man servers spin up on, being in tech I know they aren't going to cause an issue with Dynamic IPs.
---
Since our earlier posts, I did do some googling, and I found lots of forum posts outside of gaming about people in Germany finding solutions for this, so it seems like a legit issue for Germans. I mentioned a wifi solution but didnt see that mentioned, I did see people offering the VPN solutions so there is a way out for OP but it requires a VPN client and any solution requiring purchases is not much of a solution.
---
I hope this topic gets updated so we see a final solution!
---
You‚Äôre talking about a workshop...? 
---
Those are temporary. You‚Äôll have it as long as you‚Äôre on the server, but other players can kill you and take them from you. When you leave the server you give it up, though you can always grab it again. Your stuff just won‚Äôt be there anymore. They‚Äôre good for gathering resources but aren‚Äôt intended to be permanent CAMP locations. 
---
Your CAMP is different. When you place that the spot will always be yours. If another player has a CAMP in the same spot when you log in you‚Äôll be given the choice to stay on that server or find a new one where your CAMP can be placed. 
---
If you choose to stay on the occupied server you can move your CAMP for free, but it will be a permanent move, so don‚Äôt do that unless you really want to.
---
I'd recommend saving for a power armour skin that you like. Excavator skins go for 800 and usually look strange or interesting, while the T-series go for 1600. I don't use my power armour a lot (I run a berserker build), but I've found that it's worth the spent atoms for when I do have to take my suit out.
---
That said: some paint schemes are earnable in-game: the t51 has a red Nuka Cola paint and the X01 has the same for Nuka Quantum, the X01's prototype paint looks pretty awesome, and the skins you can earn in Nuclear Winter might work for you too
---
Some of the weapon skins are fun to play with if you either use the weapon type a lot or are just too impressed to let them pass (my character used to run around with a Zealot's +swing speed candycane for a while), some of the camp items are very worthwhile (the big red fireplace was worth my time to pick up), and some of the outfits are awesome too. I try to keep at least 2000 atoms saved up for anything interesting that they release for a limited time, but you can earn that in game pretty quickly if you try (maybe by running a few weeks of the 80 atom challenges)
---
It's good to buy for your character's theme, a d for things that will improve your own quality of life - you're going to be stairing at this character and their stuff for a while and you have the option to decide how it looks!
---
The best way to get XP is to kill certain mobs. When I need a quick boost of XP I makes runs through Blackwater Mine and Big Bend Tunnel killing all the mole miners and scorched. They give a decent amount of XP and are great for farming ammo types.
---
You have to find someone selling it. Ill sell you mine for 25000 caps hahahaha
---
What about the deaf, mute, hard of hearing, or those in places where speech isn‚Äôt an option? Emotes are not a particularly good way of communicating. Being unable to communicate speech via text cuts off a portion of people from enjoying the game‚Äôs community for sure.

SMDH ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I don't even have frog legs unlocked, and can't hit the broad side of a barn without Vats using Marsupial. In fact, I loathe CoD. Please, for your own benefit, don't assume. I hope I get the chance to crush you and your team using actual tactics ü§™
---
LOL mmm prunes..
---
It may be that technically they can not change it on the fly, just make the server disconnect it so that it does not count, they may come pre-established in the client program when they make a patch. Maybe that's why so much information comes in the client (even the screenshots of the atomic store when the logical thing would be that they were taken online).
---
I think the appropriate thing would be to download the images and info in cache only when we really could have access to it (for example, for purchased objects or current events).
---
Bought on black friday. Installed xmas day. 400 hours!! üëçüëç
---
Even if it was just server wide on weekends!
---
How is this topic 66% downvoted? It's a tech question!
---
What builds are decent then currently?
---
I recently deleted it off my system for the free download of Borderlands Handsome Dan Collection. They lost months ago.
---
Killing shit in the Mire is basically just a waste of bullets and time unless it‚Äôs huge.
---
I ctd nearly every time I try to fast travel to a friend.
---
Basically, there are lots of spots scattered around the map where a "random encounter" can spawn.  Some examples include Vlad &amp; Mia, the Insult Bot, the Mr. Prize Bot, Albino Deathclaw nests, random groups of enemies, etc.  They're generally located in the wilderness away from marked locations.
---
"The Messenger" event spawns in random encounter locations, so keep a mental note of anywhere that event is marked; you can check it later for random encounters.
---
 If you want to communicate you have the tools to do it that are engaging for other players. 
---
no we dont. not everyone wants to use discord and even if you do what good does it do? its not like you can use it to chat with people u meet in game which is the whole point.
---
text chat wont take away anything from emotes.
---
I'd pay for more music as well.  I had my PIP Boy radio on constantly in FO3.  Now?  Not so much.
---
Also, maybe some Five Finger Death Punch for NW?
---
Killed a 3 star legendary ghoul yesterday at Whitesprings and nothing.  Vanished into thin air. 
---
Even better, was winding down Line in the Sand event (last stage) and the system locked up and booted me out.  Goddamn that sucked.  
---
Don‚Äôt worry though at least they extending Nuclear Winter and updated the Atom Shop.
---
Bugthesda indeed
---
If you're playing in Adventure, there's no real penalty to death. Make sure you store your junk, and just do whatever you want. Go to The Whitespring, tag all the creatures, and if you can't kill them yourself, after tagging, get somewhere they can't kill you and let a higher level take them out. If you're in the area, you'll get EXP and can loot all the corpses. 
---
There's a lot of stuff you can't really do at level 25, weapon modding wise, as you need (I believe) rank 5 weapon smith and rank 3 armor smith. But you should be able to at least upgrade from level 10 stuff. Doing events in a high level area should be netting you gear that is more your level. Have you tried Uranium Fever? It's a really good event that has 3 guaranteed legendary spawns, and happens fairly often. 
---
As to a big ugly orange piece, many clothing options are available that you can't see your armor at all, so it doesn't matter if it's mismatched.
---
*gasp* your right.
---
I wish I had but it happened rather suddenly and I was too busy laughing.
---
Same.  I don‚Äôt use any of the included skins, but I‚Äôm still happy with my purchase.
---
hell yeah preach
---
It‚Äôs not funny when you spawn in and take damage for like 2 minutes and they are invisible.  Then they appear sliding and take a hell of a lot of damage before they die.  This has been going on for weeks now.
---
Honestly I want the 9mm handgun from fallout 4. You know the little makorov handgun.
---
Yup! Until July 8th I believe.
---
I think a lot of players get apprehensive when I, a lvl 220-something grizzled warrior that look like [this](https://imgur.com/Y7x8oO3), show up at Flatwoods.  A lot of them either ignore me or try and hide.
---
I think they're even more taken aback when they find out I was hunting down a lowbie to give them a small pile of health items, shelf stable food and a regenerating lvl 10 leather arm piece that I just got from a horde event, without any malicious intent at all.
---
That sort of thing almost *never* happens in other modern multiplayer games.  I was surprised when it happened to me when I was lvl 13 or so.  I was expecting Mr. lvl 45 to kill me and steal my Jordans.
---
I think they removed WeaponTypeShotgun from the M79, several patches back. So it no longer benefits from shotgun damage perks, only Demo Expert. Should also benefit from Bear Arms for weight purposes.
---
Craaaaaaaaaap
---
No you won‚Äôt. So you only keep a base until the point when you logout. The only other ways to lose it are if your base gets attacked by players and they take it, or if it gets attacked by NPCs when you‚Äôre not there and your turrets etc fail to repel the attack.
---
South-ish of 76 I believe if it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm thinking of.
---
Unfortunately, no. But there‚Äôs always today!
---
Ugh I am so sick of white springs. its just personal for me. I am really tired of that place lol. Your are right but I still will probably not go the whitespring route.
---
i think you can re fabricate one.  im not 100% sure.  talk to that terminal in the base and check.
---
Been playing since the beta I love this game.. I miss the old bugs they were hilarious. I'm glad more people are playing I want this game to live FOREVER!!!
---
Rest plus do the Feed the people event (gives you  5 stews that each give another 5% exp for 1hour) Then team up and use the charisma perk for another 5%
---
15% extra an hour makes a massive difference !!
---
randomly find plans for it here and there.  check player shops too.
---
My ign is LordVulpius.
---
I wont be online today (and it is 20:00 in my timezone, for the record), but tomorrow, I will ne online.
---
I always craft a lot, so, if you need anytime, you can buy it from me. I always turn my super stimpaks to diffusers.
---
Yes, you can but need one to fab one.  Checked again just now.
---
You guys are the verge of greatness it just pretty buggy rn
---
I spend way to much time in my camp tinkering and what not. I Have to remember to go and and visit the world all the time. Still so much to find lvl 80 from beta
---
You can get the plans for T-51b armor either from using treasure maps or completing certain events.  I've had a lot of success with getting T-51b and T-60 power armor plans from the Distant Thunder event in particular.
---
Here's a spoiler map of Random Spawn points:  [https://i.imgur.com/HzUrefq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/HzUrefq.jpg)
---
Oh my lol.    Well, id go 500.  What level is yours?
---
Save them until you see something you really want?
---
Haha thanks!
---
I'd appreciate that!
---
What do you need to communicate beyond emotes to complete strangers?
---
I was thinking about getting that one  for NW, as it's pretty difficult to see when you're hiding in bushes.
---
Personally I am stocking up on extra levels,equpiment, and perk cards so I can swap builds on a whim when factions come out. I am hoping there's meaningfull pvp content with the factions release and if so I want to be ready to jump on it.
---
A lot of explosive weapons received a nice damage buff with the most recent patch. I'm not sure if the M79 was included but I think it should be. You could probably still make a build for it or at least incorporate it into another build if you wanted
---
As much as I love the other power armor. I use excavator more then anything else.
---
In my favors are:
---
Excavator(you can make it a lifting machine using the right mods)
---
T-60(cheapest to repair)
---
T-ultracite/51 split between the two. 
---
Also I just love the northern lights paint in the t51
---
I'm currently trying to make a map of the locations. Right now I have most of level 2 (the main platform) done...but 2 minutes isn't enough time to draw out a map so I have to keep at it. Also since I'm only rank 11...lots of rooms are still locked away from me.
---
I imagine adjustments will be made but at the same time part of the point is to survive and make a deep run, kills only get you so far (and usually get you killed faster if you're getting too much attention).
---
Shia is going to make it to lvl 100.  Not so sure about Turtle....
---
The vault boy helmet is just so creepy to me.
---
Pre-ordered the Tricentennial Edition. Played a lot in the first few weeks, and then played a bit here and there. 
---
I really enjoy seeing the progression over time, and it's interesting to see all the Free Week players my C.A.M.P. helps out.
---
Directions, location, intention, sometimes people also like to chat and I‚Äôve had many situations where talking to someone has led to some sort of knowledge transfer/learning experience.
---
I think everyone and their dead grandma's use bloody or anti armor. I personally just play what feels fun.
---
Anything involving Rose.........
---
It blend Mickey in red/brown grassy areas. It's good.
---
are you on PC?
---
Been here since day one of the XBox B.E.T.A. and I have not had a single unenjoyable play session. I was one of those people who wanted to play solo and 76 let me do that in spades!! With the exception of the queen I can and have taken down everything else in the game. 
---
I feel like a lot of hate came from people's willful ignorance of all the Bethesda Fallout games that came before 76. We have NEVER  gotten a bug free,glitch free Fallout game from BGS not 3, not 4, and certainly not 76, 5 won't be either . So it's confusing to me to see people who claim to be Fallout fans moaning and crying over issues in 76. I mean come on you should be expecting it to be buggy and once your mind is at peace with the INEVITABLE bugginess of 76 then you'll be truly free to just enjoy the game!
---
Definitely not saying don't be critical and don't offer feedback and suggestions 100% we all should be contributing to the discussion but one of the things you HAVE to do when you are adulting is learn to enjoy the whole of something even when a part if it is less than enjoyable. I certainly hope none of the truly hateful people carry that same unattainable view of perfect into the rest of their lives because boy howdy your relationships, goals, career, etc you are all in for a WORLD of disappoint not just in Appalachia.
---
Me I'm going to keep offering my opinion here and on Bethesda forums but nothing short of work, and spending time with my kids and my wife will keep me from playing and enjoying this game
---
I've played every single day since beta and never looked back
---
Yeah tons of stuff can be looted not only the resort but also inside the MODUS bunker. The phones and clipboards are great resource for springs üëå
---
Invisibility with downed players regardless of time would absolutely kill the game, its not ruining a match when people thirst for a variety of reasons (need better armor, meds or ammo) that would only benefit players who are absolute garbage. I do however agree on most of your other points though, ping system is an absolute must for BR‚Äôs nowadays.
---
I play survival quite a bit.  It‚Äôs not only 300s in there.  I‚Äôm 202 but had quite the cat and mouse battle with a lvl 45 earlier today.
---
If they could just remove the top 3 players highlighted on the map you‚Äôd get a lot more people to play.  Since the leaderboard accumulates over time (without you being killed) if you are high enough you will make the top 3 pretty easily.  Then get ready for players to hunt you down.  Such a dumb feature.
---
Armor, under armor, and backpacks will all be removed upon entering power armor.
---
No, PS4
---
Of course you'll chalk my points up to that. You're clearly a massive Bethesda fan and are willing to defend them no matter what, what does a random like me on the internet's matter anyway, right?
---
Seriously though, just because the AS is optional doesn't mean they're not milking the Fallout fanbase. Hell, the game's release was milking full stop, they knew it wasn't going to do well. They released it knowing it wasn't ready, and charged full price for it. On top of the full price purchase they add desirable cosmetics for purchase which they know people will buy because they like fallout enough and they wanna look cooler than other players.
---
I used to love BGs, Fallout 3, even with it's relatively basic story and clunky nature, is still one of my all-time favourite games. New Vegas (which I know Obsidian did) was one of my other favourites. Fallout 4 felt like a step down from their previous titles in a lot of ways and then Fallout 76 comes out with arguably all the worst parts of FO4, lacking a compelling story, human NPCs and barely even playable but they're more than happy to throw micro-transactions on top of that... it's hard for me to defend them anymore.
---
Of course I don't think everything should be free, but I believe that companies, at least game companies should treat the customer with some kind of respect and make the customer happy to purchase from them. Too many games just release in a terrible state and promise that it'll get better eventually, then ask for more money for cosmetics but justify it by saying "it's only optional" - when they KNOW cosmetics and customisation are a massive part of enjoyment for a lot of people. They KNOW they can coerce people into buying things that in fairness with the lack of content at release SHOULD be available for free.
---
To team up, accomplish certain quests, discuss strategy, negotiate trades...
---
Actually agree with you here. I hate going into some locations without a couple of friends to back me up. It might have something to do with the world being so empty too.
---
I take long breaks a lot, but I do that with every game. Been here since beta
---
Which post?
---
All the corners they've been cutting for twenty years are finally catching up with them and people like you are here to create a false sense of credibility to their methods when in reality they're just a highly reactionary and unethical company desperately trying to adapt their monetization strategy to a changing market in an unregulated industry that increasingly sees their products as both archaic and irrelevant.

I had the same in FO4 but don‚Äôt really like to load in to mines or buildings. I prefer the places where I can see a nice blue sky ;)
---
Just don‚Äôt do a nuke right after code reset. I made that mistake once, but never again.
---
- Sleep in a bed for 30 seconds for the "Well Rested" XP bonus
---
- Play with a team and use the "Inspirational" perk for a 15% XP bonus
---
- Complete the "Feed the People" event and use the Canned Meat Stew for a 5% XP bonus
---
- Use Intelligence-boosting consumables like Broiled Scorchbeast Brains, Brain Bombs, Brain Fungus Soup, Steeped Aster Tea, and the INT bobblehead
---
- Clear out locations with lots of enemies such as the Whitespring, West-Tek Research Center, Dyer Chemical, etc. or farm nukes
---
Been here since launch as well! Not a daily but I play a few times a week. Still only lvl 29 but love it. The battle mode is fun too.
---
damn, i was about to give you one for free lol
---
Can confirm, immediately went "Did they just...?  Oh, they didn't.  Carry on."
---
Being post level 60-80 just means you‚Äôve probably finished almost all of the quests, don‚Äôt be jealous. I found my interest waning when the last thing to do was launch a nuke. I still pop back from time to time, but without the main quests it‚Äôs, well the end of the game for me. That doesn‚Äôt detract from the game. I think you have to be a particular type of player to love living in a world without too much in the way of quests. I can‚Äôt find my own fun like some.
---
Aside from Project Paradise, I've never seen a Sheepsquatch with more than one star.
---
[This was a quality fight](https://imgur.com/L98Z253).  Myself and a lvl 80-something guy took them both out without a moo-moo getting more than a light scrape.
---
I am only bummed by it because it means I will never see a Fallout in my area. The area was technically already covered, but Id love to see it as a Bethesda world.
---
Why would they? They never awarded atoms, just perk cards for NW.
---
Ey man are the xbox live code or game pass code given away already?
---
They turned me into a newt!!
---
....I got better......
---
I got it as a reward killing the scorchbeast queen before, other than that I do not
---
There is literally a tooltip on the loading screen that says survival is more important. I think it's intended.
---
I mean it‚Äôs how they designed the mode. To allow people who have geared themself up to have a full pvp server. You‚Äôre kinda complaining about torturing yourself. Not trying to sound like a dick. But if you don‚Äôt want noobie killed in survival then level up in adventure or accept that starting fresh in survival is just a bit more challenging.
---
I‚Äôm still trying to find the post. Haven‚Äôt had much luck tho... I‚Äôll post a link here if I find it
---
Would you like some Parmesan for that word salad?
---
I don't know how people can support multibillion dollar companies releasing early access games it's just disgusting.
---
Yes I encountered that problem a couple days ago. Tried it on both my characters multiple times, same result. I just ended up buying the plan for 500 caps from someone on the market.
---
There has got to be some truth to this, im on PC and have played since Beta and have experienced all the ups and downs. First day of the trail I got tons of new lag I hadnt been getting in months, assumed it was due to the free trial and influx of noobs in condensed areas, but as time progressed I found the lag was region specific, and consistent on different play sessions. For me, Charleston is like one frame per second, and if I walk North it clears by the time Im at the airport. Walk back top Charleston and BAAM lagtastic again, which seems to continue as I go deeper into the Ash Heap. If I then walk north, as soon as I hit the greener areas again it's clear sailing. 
---
I can easily find others saying the same except it's always a different region or city, can't puzzle this one out!
---
I literally had the Insult bot spawn in my camp just before I got off
---
Which platform?
---
Well thank you anyway!
---
Bruh delete this post, I don't want people catching onto my funeral home strat &gt;:(
---
For real though it's ridiculous that you get more XP just from staying alive then you do from getting top five.
---
That‚Äôs pretty good! We had our moo-moos running around in the middle of battle yesterday to go hide and it was stupidly stressful.
---
I have seen a two star Sheepsquatch in Free Range and in the wild. They do exist, but they‚Äôre definitely rare.
---
does it work if you start the game from the exe ?
---
crafting throwing knives will kill anything at low level easy.
---
üôå here for the long haul!
---
This would've been good to knowüòÖ I was aiming for headshots and it wasn't doing much different than a body shot..
---
Yea you're right so cringy. Where is he even getting his information. 
---
 https://youtu.be/kjyeCdd-dl8
---
The two Legendary Sheepsquatches I've run into have been seemingly bugged. They spent about 90% of the fight standing still, they attacked very rarely, and even at lvl \~20 I was able to kill both of them after around 5,000 shotgun blasts to the face and another 2,000 ski sword slashes. They're the only ones I've found so I just assumed they were all like this, is that not true?
---
I would love this! Maybe it just puts the icon used in scopes over the bodies but a different color. Perk card levels could be like the amount of time- 10s, 30s, 1m or something like that. I run a sniper build with bloody mess and sometimes it's near impossible to find bodies.
---
&gt; At least /r/fallout doesn't downvote anyone that has something nice to say about the game into obscurity. 
---
And the funny part is I think you truly believe the BS coming out of your mouth.
---
Man, I‚Äôm lvl. 25 and I have 6 nuke codes from the alpha silo. But no briefcase nor access to the silo /:
---
I wanna see cazadors added to the savage divide
---
You can add my brother and I.  JerryKiller and pacifichero45
---
I stream CONELRAD in the background, best FO music ever put together, I strongly recommend a google search if you havent :)
---
The part you put in brackets can't be implied. It makes it a completely different sentence.
---
k tho
---
If you have played it. Until the free trial seems like  half the people complaining about the game never even played it.
---
Isn't this thread for listing bugs that have existed since game launch and haven't been fixed, and not for crapping on the OP for mentioning that there are bugs?
---
Heres a few:
---
Invisible enemies that attack you while they take 60 seconds or more to render.
---
Half the buildings and furnishings of those buildings never materializing because the rendering is flubbered.
---
Slithering Ghouls.
---
Unkillable monsters.
---
Unfinishable challenges for Atoms.
---
Quest lines that are unplayable.
---
Armour Mods for sale but unusable or vaguely labeled.
---
Legendaries that lose prefixes/suffixes.
---
Legendaries that drop nothing (not even drills)
---
Server crashes when Nukes are used; or not used; or just seemingly random (likely as a by-product of glitched RNG systems that have manipulated kick outs to minimize highly-coveted items being dropped).
---
Servers that drop hundreds of Legendary items, even from non-legendary monsters vs. those that don't spawn any legendaries anywhere.
---
CAMP items unplaceable or unattachable or just impossible to build for no apparent reason.
---
Others?
---
That would actually be amazing to see!
---
They. There were 4 people camping in that motel room. Emphasis on *were* lol
---
I was so stoked to have the quest pop up and immediately complete for my character during the beta after hearing how much of a pain in the ass it is.
---
Then I saw that there‚Äôs a trophy for it and I have to do it anyway.   -_-‚Äò
---
Like how these mongrels downvote anything that isn't "oh wow fallout 76 is the best game."
---
I'm lost
---
I'm found,
---
I'm found.
---
The only youtuber that I‚Äôve seen actually play it is General Sam and all he said was that it was unbalanced but he tried wording it that makes it seem like it‚Äôs game ending or something
---
The game launches, but then makes me put my username AND password every time. The launcher at least saves my UN.
---
no, you need one to craft one, this person is telling you use the fabricator in the basement to remake it
---
Yeah it takes practice
---
Use proper flairs, dipshit
---
Which platform?  Can put on calibrated shocks if you have the material.  Free of charge.  Liked that you helped others.
---
My melee alt runs around in a suit of T-51b with a vampire/swing speed/block sledgehammer.  With the right perks and a tesla coiled torso mod, you can hold enemy aggro very easily and not take an outrageous amount of damage, while also tagging little zap hits on every enemy around you with the tesla coils that allow you to loot their corpses later.  You can also eat stimpaks very quickly while in power armor, and there's a few perks that can be stacked with each other to greatly increase the healing from one dose.
---
Why would you be telling strangers these and not your team? If you're on a team with people all of that is conveyed.
---
Well played my dude. I can't even find a briefcase
---
Maybe a stupid question but: 
---
What if a gauss rifles comes with the Anti Armor effect on it?
---
Ah.  Thought it was meant to be a base.  Thanks!
---
I had this happen last night after I killed my first Deathclaw Matriarch. Thankfully I looted it immediately when it died, picked up the legendary and a few other items before it vanished beneath the ground and I couldn't loot it anymore. I probably lost some good mats on it but I would've been SUPER pissed if I'd lost a legendary item due to this bug.
---
But the point of the game mode is to survive, not to kill more people.
---
I was actually debating buying that bundle they just added but didnt know if I would be able to use the camo in NW or not.
---
Ah ok.  Didn‚Äôt realize the purpose of it.  Thanks!
---
Are you the person who did the book on their travels? Similar in style to the Yao Guai you have on your twitter feed?
---
How much for the two shot explosive handmade?
---
Yeah.  It‚Äôs been really quiet on the servers these days.   It used to be that I could find one with at least half of players above level 100.  Lately I‚Äôve been lucky to see more than 3 or 4.
---
[In this area might be where you're talking about](https://imgur.com/a/MMrMELZ)

They. There were 4 people camping in that motel room. Emphasis on *were* lol. And I'm pretty sure they were exhibting the definition of camping.
---
I'm on PC, more than happy to provide materials and tip :)
---
What about the 3 hour video of every game ending bug found so far? Would you say it's acceptable for a multibillion dollar company to release a game like that? You people eat it up like pigs to slop too.
---
It‚Äôs a SBQ drop
---
50 but thats my primary melee in power armor....not really for sale
---
I see it as a good thing to be honest. We need more new players :)
---
for general play, none.. but I have t51 and excavator sets just in case I need them for nukes or mines
---
Was it Diresheep? He's a buddy of mine and we were playing last night and he did that. I died early though.
---
If you got zero mods from breaking down 50+ guns then you've probably already got all of the scrap mods.
---
There is a ScrapBonusInt table, but it's not clear whether it's used for mod chances or just junk output, and the difference between 1 and 3 int is only 0.75 vs 1. At worst you'd need to scrap 33% more guns for the same results, on average.
---
I want it so baaaaaaaaad!

[Front page, top post of the thread, FO76 is enjoyable](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fallout/comments/c0ut9w/how_is_fallout_76_in_its_current_state/)

You are full on delusional.
---
do you have the materials?
---
You may be getting mixed up with your C.A.M.P, that is persistent and will stay at its location when you log back in (unless someone else on that server has their camp in that location)
---
Little tip for you, if you really need one particular resource and you find one of the nodes to mine it from , then setting up your camp next to it will allow you to build an extractor as long as the node is in the green build radius. Good luck, wastelander.
---
I‚Äôd rather have just normal text chat imo, there‚Äôs a lot of other things in game that ruin immersion already
---
Ok yes no worries.
---
You can opt out of joining or filling your team when you initiate the game mode.
---
GIMME NIGHTKIN!

I'll 100% buy a big stack from you. Love to shop, Ive noted your handle, and Ill join your adventure mode and find your shop. if you arent around when I am, Ill keep trying a few times :)

How cheap will you sell a flamethrower for? For melting robots Pioneer challenge, its not in my heavy weapons crafting list for some reason and Id rather not fork out 1500 to Watoga vendorbots for a plan just to complete one challenge 
---
And let me know if you sell cheap serums, I have some new friends Ive been showing the ropes to, and I know they'd go nuts if i found a cheap serum vendor. There are many selling cheap but you have to randomly find them :(
---
Yeah I did it for the first time last week with a guy that knew how 1 lvl 180 character and a lvl 115 it was pretty easy.
---
Distant thunder will always reward either a t51 or t60 part plan or mod plan at random

I'm actually not sure if that is classified as ballistic or energy in fo76 so good question.

Non-insane and murderous super mutants like Marcus from NV.

---
Hih thats odd i judt cannibalized a moleminer on xbox fine. Must be a bug not effecting everyone or maybe certain servers.
---
no, people like it because there are no tse weapons or any legendaries at all. also there aren't people with 10 agility and VATS focused perk decks. because this and many other things drastically level out the playing field. that is why so many people enjoy NW
---
I nope out of games like counter-strike because if you die, you just twiddle your thumbs. It feels like it takes a thousand hours to play again. Haven't even tried NW yet for that reason.
---
It's usually the guy dressed in a clown suit or impostor outfit with a gauntlet or power fist that's dealing damage in the 2000-5000 range.  I can get a couple 1000+ damage shots with a sniper rifle, but the boys and girls with unarmed melee builds are the apex predators of 76.
---
My good pal Fez does 27,000 damage with a deathclaw gauntlet that has +50% crit damage.  Lvl 50 scorchbeast dead in one hit.
---
I don't think the Marsupial mutation exists in NW, or at least I haven't seen it yet (level 38 so far).
---
I found the Gatling gun last night and when I went to use it, I got shot :( il keep these in mind!
---
GIVE THEM THE LMG
---
I think they fixed the AA effect on energy weapons. I have a AA gatling laser that does pretty well
---
Ah, there it is. You know, its getting harder and harder to tell whether or not people actually care that much about communities, or if they are using the circle-jerk excuse to elevate their own personal qualms. Get over it, there are so many different ways a community can get destroyed over a bad atmosphere and you chose to trash on a positive one? 
---
I'm sorry OP for fueling this, I stop now
---
Not to me...
---
Helping noobs is the best.
---
Bro I beat that quest at level 33. Granted there were over a half dozen people over level 100 but still.
---
I was just waiting for the Clint Eastwood GIF saying, ‚ÄúGet off my lawn‚Äù lol
---
??? youngsters watching other people play video games... smh
---
What's your base damage and what is the damage you do to super mutant bodies?
---
Sorry I think I‚Äôm wording it wrong my bad. I‚Äôm talking about recently after all the updates and bug fixes. I‚Äôm not trying to say that 76 is a perfect game, dear god that is not the case. But it‚Äôs much better than when it launched and I keep seeing youtubers (like general Sam) making videos to shit on it. I hope I cleared up any confusion I may have caused
---
Haha a team of campers is totally different
---
Wow you are actually trying to put me in a box because you actually don't understand what I said. Jesus what a waste of time it was to respond to you.
---
Exactly this.
---
I can probably offer a build or two if you've decided on your style.
---
Ranged or melee?
---
Sneaky glass canon or tankier bullet soak?
---
It was too much for me! It ended up just pissing me off. I thought it was funny the second time you had to leave and come back. After that it was over kill, not looking forward to doing it on my alt!
---
Yep love that perk!
---
Yup. Since Beta......
---
yeah, was really wondering about this solo, but with 15 str and 12 per I blast trough it like nothing. I only do it when i see some high level players though, cause happends its only you and 1 other dweller on the queen, takes alot of time
---
It‚Äôll be saved you can replace it down.
---
Whatever you fucken want it's your money lmao
---
Every town needs a stable and a fodder silo. Why doesn't your game have a horsewhip store?
---
Yep, had it today
---
‚úãüèª
---
It‚Äôs in blueprints
---
I‚Äôve been a supporter of the game since launch, what confuses me is that although most of the additions are good, the game really hasn‚Äôt changed that much, so I wonder why new people are enjoying it so much.
---
For the first time, I had a similar crash happen to me [PS4] last night.   I traded in some legendary items and was storing stuff when I lost connection to the server.  When I re-connected everything was back in my inventory.   
---
In my case I didn‚Äôt lose anything, but the inventory management that I was doing went back in time by about 5 minutes.  I‚Äôm guessing that the server dropped and hadn‚Äôt synced with the network. 
---
So I can see where something like this could cause you to lose items that you had picked up.  The system would think that it never happened.
---
Gatekeeping?
---
You will you will
---
Ohh okay. Thanks
---
Did you click join new server or did you click stay on this world
---
If you didn't join a new server it won't place your CAMP down
---
I just bought the game yesterday, it‚Äôs a lot to learn.  I was lucky to have a patient player give me some buffs last night.  Yes, please be nice!!  :)
---
The pioneer scouts tadpole mission
---
I stayed on the world and thought I would just relocate
---
It's not Marsupial, it's a NW perk called Frog Legs. 9 Agility, jump height increased by 300%.
---
Haha there are other bugged challenges and plenty of them which are preventing players from getting their hard earned atoms. And with their limited time offer items in the shop it's causing them to miss out.
---
I admit I‚Äôve only played on-and-off since launch, but in my defense I do that with just about every game anyway LOL
---
I have no idea, I joined a world and saw this
---
pull up the pip boy and it will let you put down your c.a.m.p depending on the landscape.  Watch some of the fan youtube vids for camp building, they helped me.  Not just the mechanics of it but some cool ideas as well
---
Im not english, dont get the word, plz explain
---
How it worked before was if you chose that option, it would delete your camp, but I'm like 80% sure they changed it in a recent patch but I'm not sure.
---
If you look at the Pip-Boy and it says you can place your camp for free then there's a good chance something happened and your camp was removed.
---
I wish I hadn't even clicked on it to make it further trending on Youtube...  #9 Trending in gaming when I watched it. The creator should be ashamed of himself if you ask me ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
What's funny is how many people are like "yeah I mindlessly talked shit about something I never experienced but disliked because it's different but now that I don't have to pay money I'm lovin this shit"
---
Good to know it's not just me.
---
Cave crickets
---
He's referring to Nuclear Winter mode. To access a silo in Adventure mode, you need to complete the Enclave quest line and it'll walk you through getting authorized.
---
[Yup, I think that's the Bestiary Project up on their Patreon.](https://www.patreon.com/cutecomics/posts?tag=bestiary)
---
&gt;Not even the point and thus pretty irrelevant to the actual post but leave it to you freaks to cling to any 'gotcha!' you can invent in your head instead of addressing the actual point.
---
It doesn't matter if you're so hellbent on ignoring the actual point being made. This is really high up there for one of the most pathetic subs I've ever been to. Y'all give T_D a run for their money with your delusional nonsense and refusal to honestly address anything anyone says unless it's praise for your deity.
---
I just had scorched for lunch with no issue...
---
Why? Because he has a different opinion than you?
---
I think it counts as a energy weapon but does ballistic damage. 
---
But I‚Äôm not sure what to think anymore üòÇ
---
While that may be true, the post is talking about NW challenges.
---
im not high level but my username is MrComrede
---
So more like Grahms personality.
---
Yeah but I dont have all that yet, I'm just getting to a level where I feel comfortable participating in end game events and being able to actually do damage
---
Never left, will probably die here with only a holotape and a skeleton to mark my passing.
---
That's some great tips thanks for this.  I'm getting back into the game and felt a little lost.  These are the kind of tips I been looking for.
---
Some things I'm still lost on that are on the top of my head:
---
* Good way to gain caps for fast travel
---
* What weapons/armor should I be on the look out for while I'm leveling
---
* What materials should I tag for searching
---
* Is there any must have crafting recipes I should get and where can I find them
---
* Is there a good base spec build to follow while leveling
---
No, because he's profiting off of the hate bandwagon.... #9 on trending - good pay day for telling people what they want to hear.
---
I had some dude last night following me around and trying to bait me into fighting. It was annoying enough to where I just logged off, watched a movie and passed out. 
---
But he‚Äôs been the only one since I started last week.
---
Care to elaborate ??????
---
I'm level 50 and my sister is level 39 and we launched our first nuke. It was literally the coolest thing I've ever done in a game. 
---
All my weapons were broken by the end and I nearly died but we made it. I love this game lol
---
I've been on since BETA and haven't stopped since. Guess the new content that's going to be released has enticed old and new players to come and join. It's sad to hear that the game had so much hate.
---
I see. You're not wrong. My bad.
---
Yes because a front page now negates the last 7 months.
---
Lmaooo, this is how fake rumors start
---
What are you playing on? Pc, Xbox, or PS4?
---
üëçüèª
---
Are the rifleman perks not worth getting to tier 3?
---
Welcome aboard.
---
If you play long enough the circle will consume the entire map until every place gives you fire damage
---
You are missing the whole point.  I created a character for Survival.  Don't want to play this character in Adventure, that would defeat the purpose.  I literally walked out of the Vault and got killed by a level 67 guy just waiting for people to join, or use the free spawn.
---
I don't care if I get killed by someone in Survival, but I didn't even have a weapon, or a way to defend myself.  
---
Left the Vault and was instantly killed.
---
I play solo, have almost entirely since I started. It's worth it.
---
TEXT CHAT
---
Can you verify game installation on console? That kinda sounds like the problem
---
She might have had something redeeming if she gave dailies.
---
Same. I like wandering around on my own and in the beginning of the game no one would interact with you if they saw you and if you would try to talk to them you would get nothing. Now it seems like people are more inclined to interact with others which is great. I actually get to talk to people now while playing and they will talk back.
---
If you just moved, it'll be under the "stored" tab in your build menu. If you're having trouble placing it you can press a button while highlighting it (I think it's X on xbox) to "scrap" it, which doesn't destroy anything it just breaks the unit back into its individual pieces (walls, bed, etc) so you can rebuild to fit the terrain.
---
That‚Äôs makes me happy to hear, I‚Äôm from the free trial and when I hit level 5 so did another guy near my camp, I was just walking past, weapons holstered, then shot me, I killed him, but that‚Äôs all I have had to deal with. So I‚Äôm glad that this won‚Äôt be a problem I‚Äôll have to face often.
---
After the Burrows went live, ghouls seem to turn into fly piles almost instantly.  If you wander around the Whitespring and the Burrows a lot, you'll start to know where their spawn points are and it becomes less troublesome.
---
As far as starred enemies, you have to wait for them "emerge and grow" into starred enemies.  If you shoot them the second the crawl out of the ground or Fissure Prime, before you see stars after their name, your loot table will only register a normal, non-legendary enemy.  (yes, it will happen on the Scorchbeast Queen, too)  Even if it's just the first shot and they require 400 more to go down, that first shot registers your "tag" on it and overzealousness screwed you out of loot.
---
My hate for this quest was doubled because the first time through, my game crashed really close to the end of it
---
Was there a checkpoint? Nope! Had to wait alllll over again
---
I second this.  For some reason these little fellas are tougher than they look and can do a lot of damage if they get you trapped.
---
A lot of youtubers are cunts.  Not saying he is.  I dont watch him.  A lot of them just make videos that align with the popular opinion.  They were the leaders of the hate train for 76.  People were pissed about the glitches and disconnects when the game came out and a lot of youtubers fed off this.  Instead of making videos about the good aspects of the game, Every video was "worst game I've ever played", "Bethesda is ea", so on and so on.  Nobody had anything positive to say.  It's hard to blame them solely.  Most people are incapable of forming their own opinion without some kind of positive reinforcement from others.  Some youtubers are just trying to keep the hate train full steam ahead so they can make as much money as possible for views.
---
Add me. Henrykitchenman
---
Welcome to Appalachia! We hope you stick around and enjoy the carnage..also always drink Nukashine.
---
I hadn't noticed as I've never had a scoped weapon, will keep it in mind though so I don't waste my time
---
Been here since preorder! I followed Bethesdas odd  announcement of the game haha. I loved it day one. However hated the pvp mechanic. The only break I took was when my daughter came into this world. Now that I have a tiny bit of free time Im truly enjoying the experience again. Love the expansions. Keep it up Bethesda!
---
Yeah, who's the master race now bitches!! üòÇ
---
There's nothing to stop you going to the Bog or the Mire now. I've seen players below Level 10 braving it. You'll die, but the east of the map is a fun place to explore. You meet a lot of Far Harbour critters.
---
Thanks! I wish I joined sooner.
---
I am a regular cannibal. No issues.
---
Really? Great!
---
If I'm honest I think most of those players moved over to survival mode the second it was released. Adventure mode is main PVE friendly types who enjoy helping others.
---
My games been installed since November
---
I have the same issue too. No idea how to fix.
---
Thanks! I found that image! Now something like this but then with power armor would be great :P
---
Try out the nuclear winter mode too. That shits fun
---
I get upset for the same reason: they monetize their videos so not only did I waste time listening to their shit opinion, i paid them for it too
---
In the beginning I forced myself to like this game because I bought the Tricentennial edition and refused to say I wasted my money but now I love it!
---
Ive server hopped and restarted 3 times, it‚Äôs still a problem for me
---
It‚Äôs 2 button presses past already scrapping everything though. I don‚Äôt mind it as is, but it wouldn‚Äôt be bad.
---
Complete all main quests, drop a nuke on fissure prime, kill sbq. Automatic drop.
---
Does bulking your scrap lower the weight, increase value, or what's the benefit?
---
Uhhh no you are wrong. 
---
1.) your grammar is terrible and thus gives the impression you are poorly educated and have no credibility.
---
2.) my ‚Äúopinions‚Äù are of what Bethesda themselves have said... they did not just say ‚Äúyeah lol salty duper‚Äôs stay banned it‚Äôs 6 months since we said anything officially so ur so banned!!!! permanently‚Äù as you claim. How about this then for facts bro - dated March.
---
There no time like the present to get stuck in. 76 has never been in a better state and it's only going to get better from the looks of things.
---
There's a good handful of people like that. They're just trying to entertain themselves until new content comes out.
---
Seems its just you
---
Aliens!!!
---
Driving through WV I actually saw a fully automated DMV at a gas station. The robots really are taking over
---
And the storm only does rap damage but it does a lot. That would be so awesome
---
I‚Äôll give it a shot, I‚Äôm not a huge battle royal type of player, and I rather dislike them. But if it‚Äôs there, and free, I suppose I‚Äôll try it out. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
üëãüñêüèª yeah the whole 9 yards and Double Platinum. And been getting better ever since the Sheep squash came in the Game big turn around and Less Crashes
---
I am having the same problem on the PC platform. I got in touch with Bethesda support informing them of the error, they told me to contact the retail store I bought, they checked and said my license was okay, so the Green Gaming asked me to contact Bethesda, I made a second call per ticket and I was informed that they do not even know how to solve it, even after collecting my log data generated by the bethesda launcher.
---
Note: My error occurs after a good time playing, about 30 min I am disconnected and I have to log in again. I got the license in the pre-sale.
---
New updates will post here.
---
Regards!
---
How the hell is it only me?
---
Thanks for this! I have a hard time keeping track of the different percentages so this is super helpful. Revives are the same as kills!
---
Yeah I know, I was just replying to that guy. If you saw my comment in that post I'd love one for terminals, as well as power amour.
---
I have a feeling its because alot of the survival players are more interested in the pace of NW PVP. They are going to have to shake up survival somehow if they want it to be as popular as the other two modes.
---
It‚Äôs called survival for a reason.
---
Exactly!
---
You can't bash kill them?
---
Okay, thanks. I‚Äôll check it out.
---
Honestly, rad showers are an overrated waste of building space. IT takes way too much material to craft, and if it gets damaged it's expensive to repair. Having said that, building the thing takes over 3k worth of stable flux (give or take), so unless you've got that already I doubt anyone will take you up on the 2k offer.
---
Spend that 2k on Radaway, or better yet buy the plans from the modus medical terminal and craft your own. At some point later when you have more flux than you know what to do with you can try this offer again.
---
Lowers weight
---
I did UF one time, but someone who was like level 102 was there as well, so I just shot each enemy at least once to gain the xp. I got a pretty nice sword, but I have to be level 40 to use it :(
---
Good to know!  I've only seen one starred beasts in Free Range and during random encounters.
---
While killing various enemies in the Ash Heap for atoms a couple weeks ago, I ran across a lvl 50 Sheepsquatch just east of Welch.  I was surprised to see one down there.  It ate through a pack of lvl 35 super mutants in seconds, then killed the lvl 30-40 mole miners the mutants were fighting, and just hung out inside a house.  (The one where you find the Overseer's holotape)  The damn thing took up the entire hallway.  They're very large when you're forced to get up close.  10-12 mid-level super mutants and mole miners took away maybe 5% of it's health.
---
That‚Äôs great to hear. From what I was hearing from friends and public was that the game was abandoned, and they gave up on it. I‚Äôm glad they haven‚Äôt, this free trial was also a great marketing move on their part, I mean it‚Äôs getting people like me to buy it.
---
Threat level midnight on this post
---
I've been wanting to get the game for a while, but still haven't, and now I'm probably not gonna get it for a little while longer, because I don't want other folk to think that I'm only here for the new battle royale mode.
---
Are they in containers or just out in the world as junk?
---
Most people hate on it because of what you tubers say. If a YouTubed says something is wrong with a game then it must obviously be a bad game according to a lot of people on the internet. I have over 300 hours in this game and have spent at least 90% of that time playing it without real problems.
---
I had no money to buy/preorder the tricentennial edition, because I dropped like $90 for Shadow of the Tomb Raider. I ended up getting the regular version of the game when it got released and have been playing since.  And it‚Äôs been so much better with each update. Bethesda is really working their asses off with the game.
---
The D-pad on FO4 was once down to get a stimpak and then two more options for whatever you wanted and three options for the 3 other directions. It made drinking water, stimpaking, switching weapons/grenades so much faster. Just keep the emotes wheel and let me set the other 3 directions. I'd rather have less options that work better than a wheel that is difficult.
---
Clean up on aisle five...

---
Fingers crossed for today then!
---
Yeah, but like an entire community of them. We could have SM vendors, companions, quest givers. I want Marcuses, Virgils, and Grahms and everything in between. Like perfectly normal people that just happen to have been hit with FEV and stayed sane.
---
Hello  ScarySkeleton24  to the anonym Fallout Lovers. Come join the Circle! Anyone else want to register to Reddit and tell everyone who already loves the game how awesome it is? Don't be shy everyone is so nice in here!
---
In my game, the habitat part shows completed in the challenges, it just says I have to take the pictures.
---
How much for the chameleon marine armour?
---
So you're saying that limiting the ability to be social (through text) actually enhances the social experience? Hypothetically, you're sick and lost your voice (an easy scenario), how would you ask if your team wants to go to a certain location?  or interact with a random? or negotiate trades?
---
Good that you're suggesting solutions.
---
Also, text chat further penalizes players who don't use a kb/m.  
---
I play on PC, but I use a controller in solidarity with my console peasant brethren.
---
Same happened to me today. Guy was chilling outside safe zone with 20+ stimpacks. He waited till the bomb radius was as big as the safe zone and then launched the nuke. Wiped the game instantly and won. I tried running out of the bomb radius but I was low on health so i like insta died to the safe zone...
---
I am on that quest now, and it is not highlighted anywhere.
---
Can only one person per team pick it up?  If so, that's insanely dumb
---
Damn. On PS4.
---
Does Intelligence affect XP gains? I heard that it doesn't in this game, which I thought was weird.
---
I've played nearly every day since beta.
---
I would skip them immediately after getting the recipes or mounted head plans her daily quest might provide.  I still do the toxic waste clean-up from Pompy, because I can never have enough Mr. Rogers and Bob Ross in my life.  
---
Are you still a tadpole?  That's ok....even if you are the oldest tadpole I've ever seen.
---
Ghouls and wendigoes drop them regularly, maybe you picked up a bunch without realizing it?
---
PUBG suffers from the same problem, kills BARELY give EXP but living gives you an ungodly amount.
---
Power armour is great for an all rounder. Good damage resist and you never have to worry about those pesky rads. But it isn't great for a stealth build. Perfect for a heavy gunner or melee build.
---
None power armour you get to show off your spiffing outfit. In your gentlemanly attire. Roaming the wasteland in style whilst giving those mutated buffoons a right good thrashing!
---
I have a black powder blunderbuss and two shot black powder rifle. Cannot remember where I got them from but it was early game.
---
White spring vendor has some im pretty sure.
---
It runs pretty well if you disable their internal framerate limiter, sure. Otherwise it runs like garbage and capped at 62.5 FPS IIRC.
---
Never left ‚úã
---
I would like to add that jumping should cost AP like it does in normal/survival mode. Not sure what the reasoning is for the change.
---
Yea that would be awesome to!
---
If anything, Ohio and Kentucky are the only places I see having any sort of DLC and I'd imagine nothing bigger than Far Harbor.
---
Ohio *has* been teased a little with Ohio River Adventures and some of the comics lying 'round.
---
Check out the cemetary in the north central/east part of the map. Almost always a black powder weapon in the museum there.
---
I personally think power armour is better at younger levels as its easier to obtain than legendaries. 
---
The main benefits are that you dont take fall damage and you get a massive boost to rad resist without using chems.
---
However at higher levels i think legendary normal armour is better than PA as its more flexible and you can tune for various situations.
---
Ive never used power armour in previous fallout games, however i do use calibrated excavator for nuke zones and when i need that extra boost in carry weight
---
Right!?!? It's definitely a little bit infuriating know I just helped their paycheck.
---
I'll go check it out thanks!
---
I don‚Äôt wear it because I‚Äôm a stealth commando. But I‚Äôll put it on if im fighting the queen, sheepsquatch, or just hard events/enemies.
---
Holy run on sentences Batman!
---
Jokes aside, the Brotherhood in recent games have been made more militaristic than in fallout 3. In 3, Lyons was more mindful to the needs of locals and this was actually CONTRARY to the status quo of Brotherhood ideals. In fact, many hated him for it and defected, making the Outcasts. The Brotherhood aren't always the good guys.
---
Also, they didn't let the Brotherhood die. Brotherhood did it themselves by charging into the end zone.
---
Appalachia welcomes you, friend!
---
Nah. This has been like 10-12 at a time, even when I haven‚Äôt been in any kind of combat. It‚Äôs weird.
---
Exp event coming as well or is it already running? I got caught up watching Patriot on Prime... Binged like 14 hours lol.
---
Level 205 almost 1k hours played. I love this game.
---
Haters gonna hate. People often parrot this nonsense without even looking into it. It's almost like it's trendy to rip on fallout 76. 
---
The game has never been abandoned. I've been playing since day one. Servers are always full of people doing things and the Devs have been rolling out the updates and new content on the reg.
---
Edit: it's true it had a rocky start. But they're getting there.
---
&gt;This. Listening to someone chewing into the mic, family arguing in the background, and sighing between every cuss word isn't enjoyable. Text offers an alternative.
---
- For caps, one of the best sources is definitely completing missions. You'll also likely pick up a lot of junk; if you have your CAMP set up, find a nearby train station, go to the vendor bot and sell your junk. For me, I've found that a lot of chems I don't use that much, plus any extra guns/armor you may not want can also get you a few caps. It'll add up eventually. (Legendary items you should scrap for scrip on the legendary exchange machines outside)
---
Some clothing like the straight jacket and golf skirt/shirt sell for around 20-30 caps I believe at the vendorbot so those are nice ones to pick up too!
---
- Weapons/armor really depend on your playstyle. I like melee weapons a lot so i was cycling through ones that had a fast/medium range and buffing myself out with SPECIAL perks to increase damage, swing speed and repair on them. Armor I looked into what I liked, which was gaining health while not in combat and having a chance to revive myself if i got KO'd although those are kind of lacking now that I'm about 20 levels higher than when I got them. You'll probably be slotting in better stuff all the time. Due to the restriction of space you may find something that you can't use until Lv 40/50; unless its something really really good, you'll probably find something else that's far better by the time you get there.
---
- Materials you're gonna always want to be on the lookout for screws and adhesives. Most everything else you'll probably have in spades if you scrap. You can make adhesives by cooking vegetable starch (I believe that's mutfruit, corn and tatos?) so tagging those or grabbing them from friendly CAMPS is good, but you should make the starch asap so the veggies don't spoil.
---
- Recipes are fun to collect, i've ended up simply buying a vast majority of cooking recipes from players vending machines. I wouldn't spend more than 20 caps on a cooking recipe though. Most players also have cool building recipes like lion statues, or your own nuka cola machine so keep an eye out for those. Most other recipes like for some armors and weapons you'll get from the story but not every single one.
---
Done all that kill the queen a good few times now
---
Hey, i know this is an old post. Do you know if lone wander stacks with ActionPointsRateMult (like nerd rage and action boy) or is it added to ActionPointsRate (like AP refresh armor)? I know you stated it should be in the latter but I have a feeling it‚Äôs the former
---
Just a guess, maybe Superduper perk is giving you fusions instead of plasma.
---
Sadly no answer will come, this topic is dead :(
---
Sadly, I do not own any flamers, nor serums. But flamer ammo, I sell them for 1 caps each (like most ammos, others are free to take).
---
I‚Äôm just waiting for Starfield...
---
The brotherhood was trying to stop what the enclave made even though it was bound to happen the enclave sped up the process and the brotherhood fell trying to protect everybody

most tedious is keys to the past
---
This has been my go-to place whenever a challenge has called for one, it hasn‚Äôt let me down yet.
---
I can't remember the exact value, but I think it's around 2.5% to 3% extra XP per point of INT.  My main has 15 INT and a full set of Unyielding +1 INT armor and I earn noticeably more XP than on my other characters which typically only have 5 INT.
---
Had a similar first contact. I put so many bullets into him I thought he was eating them. Then someone told me "aim for the blow holes". Made it a lot easier next time. Happy Hunting.
---
Happened to me the other day. It was more than a few seconds before I actually started taking damage or rads, maybe 5-10.
---
Yupbuilt my camp close to a treehouse with a windego in it.  1 hit with my hammer and it usually falls to its death... into the tall grass...I have lost 10 or more so far because the creature does not follow the laws of gravity(flys really far sometimes) , and usually clips into the ground partially.
---
The philippi battlefield one?
---
It was hard to stay invested when my buddy and I explored all the wasteland had to offer.
---
But since they didn't abandon it, and are actually going forward with their roadmap, I decided to reinstall it.
---
One of the biggest things for me is the upcoming introduction of NPCs. I thought that was a huge flaw at release and I'm glad they're addressing it.
---
Yes, it defeats a good part of your enemies armor.  I have seen peiple talk about the perk being not worth it.  I have used it and not used it for long periods of time, and I can see a definate and significant edge in melee using this perk.
---
I would recommend fo76map.com. It's a good way of getting an overview of what's in a region so you can find a good spot for your CAMP.
---
Right here sir. Been here since launch, love this game so much my wife left me and I had to go to rehab but can't let go of it
---
No. It's only for adventure and survival.
---
Man I could not find it in my camp menu to save my life.
---
My friend started fresh yesterday and finished the main quest all in one day. He reached level 43.
---
Hmm. I wouldn't know I don't really do melee builds. I'll take your word for it.
---
Brotherhood fell, but it wasn't due to the age old conflict in Fallout games: Enclave vs. Brotherhood. Taggerdy saw thr Scorchbeasts as a threat not just to Appalachia, but to the whole world. In a sense, the Responders were at fault for the effort failing. And so were the raiders. And the Enclave. And the Free States. And even the brotherhood. Our Overseer stated that we could've succeeded -- if we had worked together.
---
Brotherhood ain't good at that.
---
That's OK, I'll get them :) Thank you though!
---
i haven't disabled anything. But I play with a gtx 1080, i7 7700k, and a 144 hz 1440p monitor. Runs great for me
---
I absolutely agree with you on that. It's incredibly frustrating. I've had to sign off a couple times just to get out before I died. I was referring to the players moving in such positions as being what's funny to watch.
---
Just got one first time, cheers guys!
---
No, they fixed that (and the Assaultron Head having the same issue) in the most recent patch.
---
I‚Äôm finding extra plasma cores not fusion cores. I do use super duper when I craft ultracite plasma cores, but it‚Äôs only ever 2 or 3 at a time, so it wouldn‚Äôt explain a dozen extra regular plasma cores. But maybe you‚Äôre right about super duper causing a glitch.
---
You will. It‚Äôs all karma. Best of luck!
---
The brotherhood didn‚Äôt know the enclave was in Appalachia they knew the scorchedbeasts were a threat and tried to deal with it and they fell because the responders wouldn‚Äôt give them supplies
---
The fertile soil event usually gives up 3 or more Stimpaks.  Plus, there are about 10 first aid boxes in the Flatwoods area and in, and around, the Agricultural Center.  Most enemies are level 6 so you could use Melee to save on ammo if you wanted, even without the perks.   It‚Äôs one of my Stimpak farming areas even at level 200+
---
The other location that I frequent is the Morgantown airport.  Again, there are about 10 first aid boxes in the immediate area and you can get a few extra by doing the supply drone event. 
---
Power up events at nuclear power plants also gives stimpaks.  You can double-dip by taking the workshop, doing the power-up event, then defending or retaking the workshop.   All of the rewards add up and you also get plans.  
---
Finally, if you have the Chemist perk and Super Duper you can craft 4x diluted stimpaks using just 1x Stimpak.   I used to go though stims like crazy.  Now I just use the diluted version.
---
I think the game needs more face lasers. Mole rats with fricken lasers on their heads. Deathclaws with laser horns. Brahmin with laser udders. Scorchbeasts with laser guano piles.
---
Oh thx
---
Got Unyielding Cavalier rad resist wood chest üòÇ
---
As a representative of Orkin‚Äôs hiring department I‚Äôd like to reach out to you. We have many opportunities open due to most everyone dying. 
---
Please submit a resume highlighting your big killing methods.
---
I always go for the cranberry relish. It gives more xp.  You can grow gourds at your camp. Then you just need snaptail reeds for sugar. There are a bunch of those along the river on the west side of the map between the mothman museum and hotdog stand. I keep my camp there. There are a few good spots with junk extractors, and it's on a river, so you can have a bunch of industrial water purifiers.
---
Does level 12 count as new??
---
I started a few days ago
---
Beta player never left seen a lot of crazy shit all I can do is laugh and love it.
---
Maxed T51 build with X01 arms for rad resist
---
I really prefer high frame rates of around 75 personally; you literally can't reach that disabling the internal limiter. There's also some serious janky input lag with that limiter turned on.
---
It's okay if you can't notice it, but a lot of people can and have a problem with it. FO76 just isn't anywhere near as smooth as Apex Legends, etc.
---
Yeah same, must be like a 3rd party program to get around the file check
---
Yes but the responders didn‚Äôt let them die. They were having trouble and fell out with the Brotherhood as the Brotherhood kept taking good responders. Also Taggerdy did not trust non Brotherhood when it came near the end.
---
Also the responders worked with the brotherhood on huntersville
---
Is the free trial for the game itself or for the nuclear winter mode?
---
Remember in the old fallout games that when you didn't aim your gun was lowered to your hip and when you aimed you raised the gun to shoulder/eyeline. I miss those animations.
---
Its exactly the reason why they shouldn't ever do it in NW. Because that would go back to pay-to-win issues.
---
Wow I didn't know it was that bad. Yeah if they are gonna have this mode they need an anticheat system in place
---
Have they responded to any of cheating?
---
Responders!
---
It only lowers the weight for aluminum and lead
---
Welcome to the game!  As a pre-order guy, it's nice to see the influx of lowbies who will hopefully grow into future scouts, responders and brotherhood knights.
---
I think I was around lvl 40 before setting foot outside of the Forest zone, and probably close to 70 when I finished the main quest line.  It accidentally worked out really well, because the good unique weapons and armor, like All Rise, Perfect Storm and Last Bastion were all max level by the time I got them.
---
I've been thinking about rolling up a fresh unarmed or shotgun character, just to try something new.  If you're on PC, it would be fun to have a traveling companion.
---
Oh ok. I'm only at 6 INT right now. I'll keep that in mind. So techincally, if I used berry mentats, maxed out INT, played in a team, and used certain foods, I could gain a huge bonus to XP. Or is it limited? If it's 3% that would imply about 45%-60% more XP based on the level of INT, in addition to 15% from inspirational, 5% from some foods, and sleeping. So about 80%-85% more XP. Maybe even 100%, if the right stuff is used.
---
You should not have to use a camera, so it has been a problem for you.
---
You always get it the first time you kill the scorchbeast queen.
---
And serums get listed under misc instead of aid
---
So random
---
Happened to me the other day in the middle of a fight we were winning. Lost my shit for a few mins, but luckily my bud was able to nab my armor and win.
---
I am on PC. It‚Äôs possible the patch broke the game or the influx of players during the free week is too much for the servers.
---
If you keep whacking them EVENTUALLY they will become loot able, they just won't become ragdolls for some reason and sometimes just get up and start walking
---
Let‚Äôs just stop arguing we all know if the free states with there scorchedbeast luring traps and the brotherhood with there ultracite weapons and power armor they could‚Äôve held them off till we launched the nuke to awake the queen
---
My bethesda user is crazylegoboy7
---
Feel free too send a fr while im away
---
Yeah Pa is crap in pvp
---
Yep, you can increase your XP gains pretty significantly if you use a lot of INT/XP boost consumables and rest often.
---
Played Beta every day I could and pre ordered as well. Never was bothered by any of the common issues stated on here. Never had crashing games fucking me over. Only annoying thing for me was when scorchbeast were everywhere and hunted you relentlessly and never came to the ground. Also the stash limit sucked ass for a while. Otherwise I was having a great time. Nowadays the game is what it should have been on launch. NW is really fun!

Really? When I first saw the page about this problem, I thought it was really odd, as that as I have some "wrong" copy of the game, at least something like this is written in this page. But I bought it in a local game store, retail version, it is 100% legit. 
---
Idk, the sutiation makes me rally sad. I hope they won't say to buy another copy of the game...
---
Let's do a metaphor:
---
You decide to walk into a desert in hopes of passing safely. However, you run out of water. A merchant passes by; you recognize the merchant as one that you have worked with friendly before, but ALSO forcibly taken his goods and his workers. He decides to not help you anymore and walks past you. He needs his water for the desert as well. You die.
---
It's not the merchant's fault for you dying, its your own fault for getting into something that was roo big for yourself.
---
I love critical dont take everything he says seriously he dumps on everything he used to be into league of legends and now he dumps on it the only thing you will ever hear him talk positive about is psychonauts its just his style of content and his followers are just his blind followers
---
also no legendary items, Armour or weapons
---
The red marker is honestly the second dumbest thing in NW. Sorry, I can see why some people like it, but it's just annoying that people can spot you for one second luckily and see every move you do for around 5 seconds.
---
I recently got frog legs where I can jump 3 times as high than usual and since then I kinda play more ninja Asassain style
---
Hmm, the name started with D! We started from the end of the big bridge. One of our teammates died early right there and another lvl 15 member headed out to flat woods and stayed there for most of the game.  I revived the good player once.
---
Its the pvp mode, you can't complain
---
Yes anyone under level 20
---
Eh, 10 for a down and 20 for a kill seems alright to me. There's a 20xp for revives.
---
But what would they do about the stranglers
---
Hahaha what?! Just because some people have mules doesn‚Äôt mean you have to. Just manage your stash. You don‚Äôt need thousands of pounds of junk. It‚Äôs a survival game. Black hole ffs
---
I've been working on a group for 76 called Enclave Armada, mainly xbox 1, but other platforms are welcomed. I want to make a "community", it's very low in members. Happy to meet you soon. I'm available weekday mornings, my gt is my username.
---
Same problem for me and my friend.
---
You can make different characters in you're same account I doubt they bought it multiple times
---
Been here since launch, still only level 33 because I‚Äôve been to lazy to go do the main quest line
---
Don't need stimpacks and also gives 20xpnso always go for those clutch revives
---
Never heard of this being done and it seems like a waste of money
---
I dont like br either i just love pvp when its a fair fight.
---
Do you scrap your junk?
---
Been here since 2076
---
How did you fix it?
---
Well next weekend is a double XP event, so you could start an alt, grind it up a little, and do the Mistress of Mysteries quest line fairly quick, then have a friend or reputable middle man transfer it for you. I‚Äôd do it for free, but I‚Äôm on Xbox. Good luck!
---
Hiding and kills thats all
---
"Measly 800 lb limit" haha funny jokes 800is a very genorous ammount
---
Was just in this about an hour ago. I saw it was a bunch of low levels, and thought I should help them. I became one the the pylons. Saw they didn't know anything about pylons (so I thought). I died. They took my junk and 3 of them jumped servers right away.
---
Can't wait for this free week to end.
---
I started a new character the other day (didnt play since release) but really enjoying the game again, if anyone wants to play and do stuff together hit me up :)   ( PC)
---
Pay more attention I have no problem with it
---
Can you transfer items from your main character to different characters on your same account, to free up stash space? Because I don't see a way. They explicitly told me they were multiboxing.
---
Eh sure why not PM me and I‚Äôll join you. Don‚Äôt worry I am pretty high level
---
Yep just been checking your all right I just haven‚Äôt got enough flux to build 1 gutted
---
I find the silo to be easier solo than with other players. I've done it a handful of times solo, and one time with 2 other players that showed up. The final part protecting the launch prep robots was wayyy more intense with more people. Hoards of bad robots coming out because of more players in the area, just chaotic.
---
Yah, I kinda do a lot of different things it seems.
---
Get l√§mp
---
Still my main game, has been since beta.
---
How? I must really suck at this game then.
---
I'll try, thanks!
---
You need another person to help you move them but yeah unless you have 2 consoles to meet each other up with
---
I feel like at least some of those posts are shills trying to distract from the basic bugs and QOL issues present since the beta. Or maybe people just like being used for free labor to fix a game that still isn't ready for release.
---
I like it.  That could give Grahm a little background too. He could be a wondering trader for that settlement.
---
Just the one? Say hello over at r/fo76FilthyCasuals you'll probably find a few :)
---
Yes!
---
I actively avoided Fortnite and the likes, and haven't played real PVP-based games since Counter Strike. I've absolutely loved Nuclear Winter.
---
It's not perfect, but the balance of already knowing the game plus dealing with new features and threats, makes for an enjoyable experience. 
---
It's probably worth leveling up in Adventure mode first too. I think a decent chunk of my enjoyment is because it's resetting me from a walking tank that doesn't care if the AI outnumber me 20 to 1, to "can I make it to that bush without being sniped?"
---
I have always loved this game since launch only reason I stopped playing was life got in the way lol
---
I say do old country town Lancaster pa , southern pa
---
It‚Äôs because of the nuclear activity
---
When you do build one, make sure and equip the contractor perk as you'll then only need half the flux.
---
Idk why I said fusion... But ya you can test it easily and report the bug to Bethesda's website if you want.
---
What would anybody do about the stranglers? What about em? Everyone's pressing need was the giant flying plague-spewing bats, and their mindless plague-spreading spawn.
---
Responders had medicial training and manpower, but not enough supplies and fire power. 
---
Enclave had fire power and supplies, but fell to in-fighting and had no one to carry their torch.
---
Brotherhood had leaders, manpower, and firepower. They lacked however, understanding of the terrain and were distrusted by locals.
---
And the Free States had that understanding, but did not trust anyone at all. Including government, which were Brotherhood and Enclave.
---
And raiders? Raiders give no fucks.
---
Everyone lost. And everyone shares the collective victories, and the collective blame.
---
If you don't like it don't watch it, pretty straightforward.   
---
Unrelated but I lost interest in his content years ago, his monotone voice and face-cams all the time got very tiresome.
---
Thank you. I guess I'm going to Whitesprings on some berry mentats then.
---
Both.
---
I absolutely cannot stand PvP, I frequently have problems with unloading entire clips into people just for them to take little to no damage and me to die (and I can literally see the amount Im doing to them, doesn‚Äôt line up.) Now I just hide as long as possible for those sweet rewards
---
I believe Qol. Add a map mini map option and make the map load faster. Everytime I open map it takes 3-5 seconds which is pretty crucial.
---
Ok. Sounds good. Thanks.
---
What level do I have to be? I‚Äôm level 25
---
This is fuckin‚Äô gay
---
Ranged commando tanky?
---
Yeah and it really makes no sense that even the under armor is removed. You‚Äôre telling me you‚Äôre going to get inside a big ass suit made of moving metal parts with nothing to protect your skin but a pair of crusty tightie whiteys? In Fallout 4 you can clearly see Danse‚Äôs neck hook thing on his BoS jumpsuit, it‚Äôs not like underarmor is really going to give you that much of a tactical advantage.
---
any word on the camp decorating ?
---
Battle royal games always involved do gain mostly from kills thats the point to keep you there if you vsnt hang don't play it sound like you're just maling excuses for you're incompetence
---
Will thanks for the tip
---
Big difference is Adventure=PvE Survival=PvP
---
There's more, but that's the cliff notes version
---
No. There is a challenge that lets you see until 30 kills
---
Bug. If you rev up then aim try minigun before it's starts shooting, it won't shoot.
---
No thats not the one. Just checked. ty though
---
Well sooner or later the stranglers would spread out of the more and if they didn‚Äôt stop it West Virginia and it‚Äôs surrounding states would look like the more
---
I use med X constantly in game. Not for the effects, just the role-playing factor. Scavenging every pharmacy/ medical building I come across desperate to find something
---
Honestly the Imposter event isn‚Äôt even worth the 2000 caps it costs for the recall card. 9/10 the event fails because literal dumbasses ignore the ‚ÄúActivate the Pylons‚Äù in favor of attacking the invincible, invisible Imposter
---
Hand raised and proud of it
---
I Recomend lvl 50+ well equiped.
---
Whaaaat?!? Bethesda is prioritizing adding content and advertising that fact over fixing bugs that have been present since BETA?!? *shocked pikachu face*
---
I knew something had slipped when I was posting! Added as an edit
---
And it certainly isn‚Äôt arbitrary. You know why you don‚Äôt keep a flamer and a chainsaw just for fun? Because unless you are perked out for them they are weak AF and therefore worthless. Only keep what you use.
---
Literally none of your thoughts about this are accurate
---
I'm playing since release (took some breaks though) and 800 is honestly enough. Back then we had only 400 which was nothing.
---
I have only one character and bought the game only one time; I can do most end game content without any problems. You don't need to buy anything to actually do something in this game, especially not a second account for your trash.
---
Whenever I see someone there I try to go give them gifts of stimpacks, ammo and food, but alas they usually ignore me and run past!
---
I love bushes
---
NW: BUG/Issue. While a getting in and out of power amour , the player is invincible. This has happened multiple times.
---
ok thanks! same map Im guessing?
---
There is a subreddit for this
---
r/Fallout76Factions
---
I'm addressing your call to action to "kill all responders" because they didn't respond well to Brotherhood strong-arming. Not the stranglers.
---
If the typical Brotherhood response is to KILL THOSE WHO DO NOT HELP US, then no wonder Madigan defected, and no one trusted the Brotherhood.
---
Is vats supposed to work in pvp? I've never been able to use it on someone but I've also only played a full session of survival once.
---
You can oversee a small hoard of toddlers beating the shit out of each other
---
Your link didn‚Äôt show.
---
Someone needs to craft a post on server disconnects/crashes that could be pinned at the top of this sub like that Guide to Returning. 
---
There is so much frustration, impotence, and hopelessness in many of those OPs.
---
I believe you can turn off controller in the launcher in the 76 options.
---
How much will nuclear winter cost?
---
Whatever you want. Check sales to see if like anything.
---
Loot is instanced on enemies as long as you hit the enemy you get your own loot from it. If you don't hit it you get nothing.
---
I agree with the horrible legendary prefixes. Some I just never use I'd like then to add some more cool legendary effects into the game that are actually useful.
---
And yes scaling the gear up from 50 to atleast 70 or so would be a nice change.
---
Why wouldn't I be upset? I paid over 70$ for this game and it seems like the devs ignore all the major issues that they try to brush under the rug.
---
The server rollback dupe has been in the game since the beta. It was originally done by spam crafting leather arms. Now it is done other ways, they still haven't fixed the server instability that allows it. It is why so many people are complaining about all the server crashes recently, due to it getting well known again.
---
The text chat they have acknowledged? Where? Every time it gets brought up the community managers either dodge it or outright ignore it.
---
If refusing to ignore these issues is being "pretty upset", that doesn't change the fact the issues are there. Just like how arktos pharmacy still crashes for the majority of the player base after being there for about 10 minutes.
---
Only a breif pause, 800lb brought me back.
---
Well it‚Äôs was a joke jeez their already dead
---
Yeah it's the same full map, only Nuclear Winter has a "different" map
---
Sounds like something a Unstoppables villian would do... 
---
Are you taking henchmen applications? 
---
Im qualified for goonery, thuggary, and i aced my clich√© avoidance courses
---
No clue what the key bindings are on PC, but that's the "back/cancel" button on controllers. Try that.
---
Hand firmly raised!!
---
Was there t launch and have taken it day by day for good or bad .. fallout fan regardless
---
I mean... it‚Äôs West Virginia.
---
It‚Äôs always a good day when Shia posts something new into the sub... can tell it‚Äôs you by the choice of characters üòÇ
---
&gt;Good way to gain caps for fast travel
---
Pick up meat from creatures you kill and cook it. Glowing Meat and some others like Mirelurk Meat cook up into food that'll give you lots of caps.
---
Be sure to pick up the Charisma perk card that gives you better prices at vendors and max it out. This includes getting more caps when you sell items!
---
&gt; What materials should I tag for searching 
---
**Screws**. My god, you can never have enough screws.
---
If you find yourself running out of Adhesive: plant Tatos, Corn and Mutfruit at your CAMP. Those, combined with Purified Water, will make Vegetable Starch (which counts as Adhesive).
---
yeah, just checked. With contractor level 2 on, it takes 1 crimson, 3 flourescent, 1 violet, and 3 yellowcake. Without contractor, it takes 3/7/2/7, so it actually saves you more than 50% of the flux cost. Also, if you're building a store too, please don't put the arch where someone has to walk thru it to get to your vending machines. Some of us don't want to lose our radiation.
---
The free items in the shop. Are they permanently free?
---
Nothing. It‚Äôs free as long as you have the base game.
---
Oh ok :( nvm
---
Stand by what you say and the points you make. If you are going to make a call to action to kill everyone, and then take it back when confronted with discussion, it makes anything you say lack validity.
---
Because suddenly "oh its just a joke!"
---
There are hackers on consoles too. It isn't like there aren't modded ps4s and xbones that can run custom software. I know of a few people hacking on console.
---
Read that it is just a visual glitch. The NW playable zone is getting overlayed onto the normal nuke zone.
---
Only the smaller circle is actually affected by the nuke.
---
no they arent forcing you to buy more for xtra storage space.  The limited storage space was so the server can have easier time to manage items for everyone.  The stash limit was even smaller before.  There may be  more increase idk, but they didnt put some arbitrary liw number just so they can greed you out of your money, thats what the lockboxes are for.
---
What about a melee stealth build ü§£
---
ok thanks again!
---
Just a bug
---
I thought the whole POINT of grenades was the ***area*** effect??!?
---
*Pete Hines has entered the chat*
---
Its flying and I'm using a silenced shotgun the point is it flying around hitting me with a sonar blast that gives away my position the time it takes for me to shoot it in the last tiny circle and have to reload I'll get shot in the back either way.
---
Probably was either nukacrypt.com or fo76codebreaker.online
---
Definitely pc players. 7.1 atmos surround sound, ultrawide monitors, 60fps...
---
Braun is mentioned in one of their terminal entries in vault 51 and was clearly working at the location prewar so it‚Äôs entirely possible and in my opinion entirely likely that vault 51 has some sort of simulation running designed to lure survivors in and test them in various combat sims.
---
They do that a lot in Burrows.  I've found that if they teleport and / or get bored and walk away like that, sever a limb.  You can loot the severed limb.  That's the only real workaround I've found so far.
---
Removing pipe weapons makes no sense. That's how battle Royales work. You have low tier and high tier weapons.

A ninja build works fine without power armour. Stealth reaper!

Much appreciated yer I know don‚Äôt want to ruin people bloodied builds
---
listen this is my opinion you don't have to like it. as for my incompetence i never made any excuses. i know why i lost. i lost because i couldn't take a 4 on 1 fight. if i could keep my team alive better it would be 4 on 4.
---
as for you go back to your bridge troll.
---
the responder vendors have them but keep in mind it's 220 caps for the plans
---
Been playing since late beta. Love it, I'll love anything Fallout related though. NW gas brought a breath of fresh air though, and it's making me work off some of that lazy VAT fat i've accumulated lately!
---
Managing the right perks to your build is key.
---
I love the Gatling gun but keep in mind the range isn‚Äôt great. It becomes very inaccurate, however at close-midish range it‚Äôs great! Lot of shots with minimal reloads!
---
I agree.
---
To be fair this sub is one of the most religious when it comes to blindly swallowing anything Bethesda throws at them.
---
This post is nothing but a circlejerk with a title like *"Raise your hand if you never left because you always loved the game!"* I mean.. wow. Good job enduring a buggy miserable mess??
---
Hand been raised but I've exhausted the content to the point where I think I need a major expansion to get back in.
---
This game takes place before every other Fallout game, so to explore places we've already been would be hard with the lore they'd have to follow, especially since most places don't really have much of anything going on about this time, I think. I personally would rather just see more of Appalachia, and if they eventually expanded it a little, that would be great, but it's already plenty big for me. There's a lot of space in the map where there's nothing and I love it.
---
Lmao thank you. For a second had me going there. Thought Bethesda was about to charge me extra for a game they just finished fixing.
---
You underestimate my saltiness towards those with no honor.
---
Same on consoles, I know of a couple people running custom software on modded systems.
---
My team and I were being attacked once, I had found all the launch codes and a briefcase, so I hurried and launched a nuke right in the middle of the final ring, killed everyone... I don't think anyone won that round.
---
Then shhhhh you don‚Äôt want them to ‚Äòfix‚Äô it right way ü§ê
---
That gave me an idea. What if you did a reverse BR where everything was shrouded and you can‚Äôt see very far and it gets more clear as the game progresses. Making it easier to find people the longer you‚Äôre in it.
---
True as it seems - first tought they might have changed something because of the "Take a snap while in a nuked region" or something.
---
Anyway - thx for the respond!
---
Thx!
---
Turtle here , SCIENCE!! and a dedication to truth , justice and the AMERICAN way as well as this Pioneer scout guidebook will help me usher in a new golden age for Appalachia!!  .....now if I can just get Shia to stop eating floor meat and drinking out of old toilets !
---
I feel similar but I find the game to be lonely.  All of my friends bought it at launch and feel burnt on that experience and there aren't any NPCs to interact with.  There's a 90% chance I'll buy it and that goes up after the new expansion with NPCs is released.
---
I think I've only found one bug (my guy doesn't show up on his ID card) and there are some mechanics I don't fully grasp yet (food spoilage/camp building) but overall it's been fairly fun.
---
I‚Äôm sure nobody of consequence is reading this üòÇ
---
Saw a dev say not this upcoming one.
---
There's a pond west or southwest of Lady Janet's Soft Serve that has a large rock face over half of one side with small boats and piers in it. I've ran across it once before. I believe it's in that area. Hope that helps. If I find it this weekend I'll post a picture.
---
You're asking for xp for trying like getting a participation award
---
This recently happened to me with days gone.  All the reviews said it was mediocre at Best, but I'm having a fucking blast with it. Is it the best game ever? Not even close, but it is SUPER fun for me, and I felt the same way about FO76 when it launched.
---
Whenever a new player lower than level 5 shoots at me I just say ‚Äúcome back when you‚Äôre level 5 with that same energy‚Äù lol
---
Problem
---
I'd rather have a perk card for NW or atoms.
---
Easy 2 second fix no actions while in the air and a half second landing animation where you also can't do anything or move that should fix it along with making the trajectories more fixed with no air control would alleviate the combat uses of them while still letting people use them to get into high places and have the utility of them.
---
Oh you can‚Äôt be more wrong, any glitch like easy ammo and caps got patched quickly, meanwhile three star ghouls are still dropping drillsü§Æ
---
Not sure about your budget or system, but I've seen prices as low as $14 on places like Walmart and Target. CD Keys has codes under $20 if you're a PC player.
---
You on Xbox friend?
---
I was thinking of something like this but a little different everyone starts in the middle of the map and say a nuke goes off, it's all the creeps outwards as you have to survive running away, to extraction points or vaults but there's x amount of spaces
---
Hey we've got a full team!
---
The more and the stranglers though
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
Yes they do have an area effect but it isn't very large, would be way too powerful otherwise. Besides, the grenadier perk doubles the blast radius (can't wait to get this one instead of a duplicate smh). Practice with it and your grenades will land right between their feet :D
---
I don‚Äôt really like the red marker I find it a little cheap but the use of bushes (that look like real shrubbery not a fkn round cartoon bush) I find pretty awesome. This game mode is all about stealth and strategy.
---
I still haven't even seen a nuke in NW. Closest I've been is a briefcase with 3 cards, but then I got killed by the circle cause I spent too long looting.
---
Its mostly there so you can sell the scrap. Anything you can bulk can't be sold as is to a vendor and anything you can sell to a vendor as is you can't bulk.

---
Stop hoarding. They've said it's not a hoarding game 
---
I have 50-60 of every junk item. 100+ of the rare items and one I use the most.
---
Almost every vanity outfit in the game.
---
13 weapons.
---
2 full sets of armor.
---
5k+ of each ammo type.
---
1 of each PA set.
---
Almost every magazine and bobblehead.
---
Some aid items to craft serums.
---
About a dozen mods.
---
And I'm sitting at about 643 lbs of weight. 
---
800 is plenty. At best, I'd take an even thousand but 800 is manageable. Just focus on what you actually use and don't hoard junk that only gets used every now and then.
---
No clue, they just say record them and report them. Basically do their job for them because they have no anticheat software on the servers.

Well leave the world and join another.
---
a) Fallout 76 is not just its BR mode, Adventure/Survival exist too and have very badly needed chat  
---
b) How is all of that conveyed if you have no means to convey it, or hear it, like I alluded to?
---
It's debatable. It's 5% per subsequent level, versus 10% for the first level. 6 points for only 30% more damage, and you'd have to sacrifice in other areas of perception to hold them. I find that taking first tier and using the 6 points elsewhere is more worth it, it allows for quality of life perks. You could drop Sniper and take tier 3 on each if you truly want to maximize damage and if your aim is solid and quick. I was more just providing a base framework for a non-VATS, bloodied explosive rifleman stealth build. You can tweak however you like.
---
I'm starting a new character with my friends on PC. So if all else fails you can travel with us.

if there is a blonde dork with bad manners and a know it all with glasses and horrible people skills it likely means you have run into art by Shia about Shia and turtle ( as shias boon companion I should point out I'm not a know it all , my glasses are not that big and everyone in the vault loved me ! I was voted coolest coffee technician  3rd class in the whole vault )
---
I played the game at launch like nobody else did.. I played days long and it I really loved this game. Then I took a lil break guz the game got boring (but I still liked it) now with all the new features and specially nuclear winter I'm starting to play it again and I still love it like the first day
---
these challenges take literally 5 minutes. theres no reason to glitch anything
---
Objectively wrong. You get 525xp for winning.
---
Great, Microsoft will ban them faster than Bethesda can.
---
I‚Äôve run into hackers on Xbox before playing apex. Maybe 1 game out of thousands, much less frequent and prevalent than PC.
---
I was under the impression that it was a simulation. Interesting
---
Use Antenna! I like it better than the full web client.
---
I agree, but I know a lot of folks dead set against even dipping. A toe into survival
---
It's a fallout game. It's just barely an RPG anymore.
---
If this is an RPG then so is Far Cry...
---
It's just a looter shooter.
---
I missed the old RPG days.
---
Oh that‚Äôs cool. I like that too.
---
Huh, a duo launched TWO nukes in my match which made it into a 2 vs 1. Until l I got kill by  mutant hound.
---
Allow me to say that those people you were talking to weren't likely giving you the full story.
---
I'm a level 100, and up until about a month ago I had no stash issues. Usually about a 100 on me, and 300 in my stash available at all times to hold weapons for the next days caps. Once you learn what mats you need most, which ones you need a fair amount of, and the ones you can keep little to none - stash space is very generous.
---
What changed for me is I got into trading. 800 stash is hardly anything for a trader, so I set up a mule. I *could* have made a new character and had my buddy help transfer everything, but I opted to use my son's xbox; thanks to game sharing and live sharing it would be silly to take time away from my buddy and I actually playing.
---
It's 100% possible to play this game without stash issues - you just have to learn what you need to keep and what you need to get rid of. Don't *wait* to play with something - play with it *then* decide if it's worth the stash space.
---
This game has increased my appreciation of a good bush.
---
Fallout is the 40/50s Americana Nuked to high heaven. So long as it fits that it‚Äôs still fallout
---
You're too kind
---
If you get the bug where you're stuck emoting while in NW mode. Got to atomic shop them back out. Fixes it sometimes.
---
It would give a sense of desperate you see a place only has x spaces left do you help ur team or do u run like a real fight or flight game mode obviously it would have to be done in a way that was fun

My girl friend is playing LEGO Harry Potter but send me a request and I play I‚Äôm level 7 just started

Agreed

I'd be happy to.  As a guy that started on BETA day one with a now lvl 220-something main sniper character and an alt at lvl 160-ish, I've been around the block once or twice and can offer a bit of wisdom if you need it.
---
In-game name: Shankwell
---
Yeah, been happening for a while.  Like a big invisible rock is there.  You can even partially climb it.
---
I love all the free stuff they give away. And how you can actually get enough atomic points in game to unlock cosmetics without using real money. Gotten 3 p.a. skins just from earning in game points.
---
Skilled? Of course it is. In all BR type games, it takes skills to be irrelevant. Always wait until the storm moves before you do. Always enter a new area at its most irrelevant point. Always stay down and use cover. Keep the storm boundary to your back and as close to your back as you can. Do not move unless necessary. Do not shoot unless necessary. Allow others to make errors. Works on Fortnite. Probably works on NW.
---
Call a priest, your game is possessed.

Counter: Spam M79 and use Frog legs.  Gets em every time.

Cool, I'll add when you get on next. Either tomorrow or the next day.

ROFL, the people I know have been running custom software for years unbanned so you definitely overestimate Microsoft. I mean they claimed the xbox was unhackable yet every single one has been hacked in less than 6 months after launch.
---
Are you at a chem bench?
---
All it does is make you invisible and last for 30 seconds. I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs to bad.
---
Blackwater Mine, Emmett Mountain Disposal Site, and Enclave Bunker are a few places with decon archs you can use for free.
---
Yes. Standing at one right now

Yes standing at one right now.

Okay that makes more sense now, thank you! The guy was a good distance away, in some power armor. I only got one or 2 hits on him and it didn't dent his health.

Leading up to the legendary vendor I had a mule to stockpile legendary items to trade in. I cleaned it out in 4 days and don‚Äôt use it anymore. I have over 650 hours in the game. Aside from that single scenario I‚Äôve never felt the need for a mule, let alone dozens of them. That‚Äôs just insane. 
---
This isn‚Äôt like the other Fallout games. You don‚Äôt need and won‚Äôt use every damn thing you find. You don‚Äôt need hundreds of pounds of junk, you don‚Äôt need to stockpile 8000 stimpaks or have an arsenal of weapons. Keep the things you actually use, scrap, sell or give away everything else.
---
You can also shoot while staying invisible. That should not be possible.
---
Really love your resource wars idea! And I agree, each game doesn‚Äôt have to play and feel exactly the same as the last in order to be a ‚Äòfallout‚Äô game. 
---
This game is a fallout game, it‚Äôs just different to the others. People might say BR isn‚Äôt a ‚Äòfallout‚Äô game, but vault inhabitants murdering each other to become overseer sounds a lot like fallout to me
---
You misspelled it OP, the correct spelling is Fah Hahbah.

You can create multiple accounts on your Xbox. All can access the FO game. I have 6 GTs I use as I'm a big trader of armor, serums &amp; flux. No need to buy extra copies of the game
---
Played since beta. Grew bored of base content on January. Pursued social interactions and PvP since. I have very specific needs that I hoped to satisfy with this game. Considering how these needs were satisfied, for me personally, its the best game ever. I'm not seeing how I could get bored with it in the next 1600 hours (twice my current playtime).
---
I see you haven't been killed by a scorchbeast or attacked by a mirelurk Hunter yet. they pack a punch in damage and can't be avoided sometimes. Also if you have to use guns that gives away your position.
---
So no, I think they're are fine right now. but I would love to see some more variety in enemies. 
---
I've only seen 7 so far. Dogs, mutant hounds, ghouls, mirelurks, mirelurk hunters, sloths, and scorchbeasts.
---
Could u imagine (furious two shot mini gun)???
---
At some point, you're going to have to eat that floor meat.  May I suggest this tin of "spices" that I pulled out of the pocket of a desiccated corpse?  I don't know if it's onion powder, cumin or the Colonel's actual secret blend of 11 herbs and spices, but it might "help".  KFC nuggets are probably floor meat anyways.....
---
if youre using a two shot weapon this can happen
---
Hmmm
---
Strange try relaunching?
---
This would require logical programming. That's against company policy.
---
She's immune to explosive damage and after a patch a while ago she is always scaled to maximum as if all 24 players are there. Need bloodied builds to take her out
---
I thought so too despite knowing damn well he wouldn't.
---
I have twice now
---
Not using 2 shot
---
lol me and my buddy were both like lv 130 when we wandered around to the quest and still got curb stomped.
---
10-4 good buddy.
---
Or spending on your SPECIALs, how much do you have in Perception.
---
Using a bloodied weapon or prefer high health?
---
I use the fandom wiki but idk waht others use
---
I loved this game on launch, but didn't continue cause it was pretty hard to play on my Xbox One. When I heard it was coming to Steam though I knew I'd buy it right away.
---

---
Ive been playing since launch and did not know this.  But ive also only encountered maybe 4 or 5 of the grafton monsters
---
Eh, that‚Äôs your opinion and I can respect that but I don‚Äôt know about you but I‚Äôm bored of the main game so having this occupies my time until wastelanders. üëç now I ask you kindly not to slander my post like that my man.
---
Lmao I remember when it was really low at launch and we managed. This new stash level combined with things like the backpack means you can keep an absolute ungodly amount of items. Stash size is really not an issue. I often end up bulking and selling my junk. Make a ton of caps and free up stash space. I only keep my main junk in large supply.
---
Its also highly accurate. And has a lot of empty slots
---
Well the art is bloody amazing :) Kudos!
---
Automatic weapons?
---
Like junk, and they have a green light and emits a sound but not as loud as the one from rare crates.
---
Somewhere there's a dude very, very excited about all of this.
---
Yesterday I scanned the map and found like 80% of the map is lvl 20 and below. And a handful of 100+ and one 600+ lvl guy.  I have no idea how much time you have to play this game to hit lvl 600 but it seems crazy.
---
Fuck that. Nothing says it's fallout time like my entire room shaking from the thunderous music. My vote is for them to increase the volume.
---
PvP or PvE?
---
Pve
---
Just got them. Thank you so much!!!
---
Nope a lever action
---
It would be if we wouldn't already have it implemented. I understand that wastelanders will most likely take most of development time for summer, but something like this in the future would remove at least some unrewarding stuff from the pool.
---
Thanks man! I do know if that, just trying to broaden my audience and I‚Äôve been doing his here for a few months now. 
---
Also there‚Äôs a discord called the hub, where a whole bunch of other factions have joined so we can organize some good PvP battles
---
My handle is Nocturnaria. Let me know if you need help.
---
Of course you do.
---
I never ever get anything good on drops. All my best gear has either been bought or gifted from friends.
---
War might never change but art always does.
---
than maybe your display is bugged and your accuracy isnt actually 95% maybe unequip and reequip all ypur vats related perks
---
FIXED: Turned off G-SYNC.
---
Maybe some more points in Luck, I run 8 in Luck and 10 in Perception with a TSE Lever with +1 per. I rarely miss at 95%
---
It's pretty doable, with enough hours. I crawled to 80-ish over a number of weeks, then went 80-260 in maybe 2 weeks just running West Tek.
---
I play maybe 1-2 hours per day, so if I wasn't working I'd probably have hit 500+ by now (or quit out of sheer boredom).
---
It's not a great way to play the game though, to be honest :/
---
If it makes you feel any better, these are the exact type of dudes that I mark the location of their C.A.M.P.s and wait patiently to ambush in their own home. 
---
Killing some fool in the one place he thinks he is 100% safe is the best thing that's ever happened in 76 PvP by far.
---
I‚Äôll try that thanks
---
Thanks for shopping :)
---
If PvP, vats doesn't 'home' your bullets, they just go the path they started until they land. If this path has somebody's head in between, you score a headshot. But if the target moves, it will miss, 100% of the time. If an enemy vats shoots you, and you do a 'snake run', you'll dodge 70% of bullets.
---
Are you new here? 
---
This has been an issue for PvP for a long time
---
Sur! Good timing.  I'm building a new sniper/rifle alt char and need to do the challenges (Nukashine, Tadpole, etc.) .  Currently level 45.  GT: Take8083
---
I have 8 luck right now
---
I play on PC :(
---
Oh ok...didn't catch that one.....
---
Oh wow, then I don't know...I tried! Lol
---
And please make Radium rifle good, it‚Äôs impossible to unlock all mods now and the little damage it delivers makes the effort pointless. 
---
And of course please make laser guns more durable, the new blue camo skin looks so sexy, please make the sexiness last longer than 15 sec üòç
---
Ahhh maybe that's the diff. Sry didn't see your PC tag.
---
No, most are free for a limited time. So get them when they become available. Once you got them however, they are yours to keep forever.
---
No, but I think I hold the record in survival for the Xbox servers.
---
150k score
---
The one guy who died early was me ha ha I'll tell him you appreciated his work!
---
So your solution for a brand new character who just entered into a Survival world, is to keep relogging until you find one without a dick waiting to kill you?
---
Again, you missed the point.
---
hope it works for you
---
otherwise ill wish you good luck to find a solution buddy üëçüèº
---
Then most probably lag. Are you a lagger? I am, and I attribute most of vats fails to lag.
---
I love m79s in this mode.
---
I'll give that a shot, though I'm a bit less than hopeful.
---
I think I remember seeing it at one of the overseers catches close to vault 76 area.
---
I was thinking about that as well, and I‚Äôm almost willing to bet that‚Äôs how they do it. 
---
Either the whole thing is a simulation, or maybe after you can actually access the level 100 areas you find simulation pods. 
---
From there you can access even more sims‚Äîthey could do anything. TDM Mode in Anchorage, visit the Resource Wars, go to DC, Vegas or other areas....there‚Äôs a lot that could be done with that scenario if it‚Äôs essentially broken free from the lore timeline.
---
Haha, this was such a longshot, glad I found you guys! Yeah he was incredible, great game! Thanks!
---
Fallout 4 was a looter shooter with a vague story. 
---
Far Harbor... is a different animal.
---
Fallout 3 is a RPG. Fallout NV is a RPG.
---
The original fallouts are RPG‚Äôs
---
BOS is...?
---
Fallout 76 is a MMO (I guess MO)
---
The feel of the game is all still there, it‚Äôs never been lost. The atmosphere of Fallout has been strongly felt in any game, even in the NW mode.
---
Sure, the material of the game has shifted, but the mind of it hasn‚Äôt.
---
Semi auto can have furious. I had it on a shotgun ... Too bad it was a double barrel.
---
That would be just incredible.
---
A "rocky start" is the biggest understatement of the year.
---
Pretty sweet idea but a lot of conditions would have to be brought into play.
---
Pro: better rad resist than anything in the game other than a hazmat suit. Increased carry weight (at least at low levels), and no fall damage. 
---
Cons: lots of useful perks like Serendipity don't work in PA. Decreased sprint speed. They chew through fusion cores if you run and or use VATS a lot. Can't use unarmed weapons like the deathclaw gauntlet.
---
I haven‚Äôt missed anything. How many times has it happened to you? You commit to a strict no adventure mode game then you have to deal with consequences. It‚Äôs a basic division: PvP/PvE. Not PvE/PvE till level 5 then PvP later on.
---
Despite my sentiment above I do admit I have a preference for greater RPG mechanics in games. It really seems to confuse me when people say its not Fallout if it's not a full blown RPG however. To me its like saying Star Wars can only be a movie series, despite the hundreds of extra multi-media products/stories that exist for it. Maybe I should ask more: should Fallout only be an RPG?
---
Switch to tri-barrel for more damage per shot. Ammo is not a problem. Put on all the heavy gunner perks and demo expert, it‚Äôs a real beast. Have fun you‚Äôll love itüëçüèª
---
If you're referring to the black people statues with green lines/crystals, those are actually scorched that have been consumed by the plague

Congrats! I'm about to start working on 'em hardcore myself. Badges and selling crap in my store has turned into my endgame at level 201.

Haha!
---
Fallout to me is being prepared to live in a world that is dying. Being ready to move forward in a world that tries to drown you. Anything that allows me to keep this impression is Fallout. World is Fallout, btw.
---
Don't click on NW  related posts, problem solved.
---
It's a new game mode of course it's the current Hot Topic.
---
Don‚Äôt blame me, blame Obi Wan!
---
Well I think the nukes we use are really small compared to a real nuke.
---
Isn't that a pointless mod to have? With semi auto you don't want your target to take many shots to die, ant 5 shots to maximise the buff is just too much for semi auto.
---
Ugh me too
---
I really enjoy single player. Yes, for now there is an absence of NPCs and the game does encourage working as a team with others, but the worldbuilding is really fun to get into. I love seeking out all the notes and holotapes by myself. Also building my camp was sweet because I was able to build it in my actual hometown. Also, it's so easy to find people to work with even without knowing anyone, especially if you're in the same area when an event pops up. Most high level players are also really helpful to newbies.  
---
If you're not sure though, I'd definitely get in on the free trial before it ends tomorrow. If you like it, the physical game should be pretty cheap at gamestop.

Just imagine the Battle of Anchorage in Frostbite. Power armour, mini nukes going off lest and right real war is hell type of stuff. Also I agree, a battle royal is the most Fallout'y feeling thing for a vault experiment ever.
---
Oh yeah, level 40. Sorry, at least you can scrip that stuff now? It's a great spot for steel at least.
---
There's one that spawns just outside of Poseidon, down in the riverbed. He's there -all the time-.
---
How do you get frog legs in NW
---
Hmm
---
Not sure then sorry i can check the wiki too see if theres a known bug tho
---
No problem :P happy hunting :)
---
That explains that, but what about vehicles on the road with skeletons in them as if they died in that specific location instantly? Are we to assume that raiders attacked them maybe? There are skeletons of couples in mid picnic and stuff aroud, it seems like they just died all of the sudden.
---
I discovered this by accident... i milked a cow at the end of free range on adventure and the challenge popped. I track what i plan on doing that day but i wasnt anticupating anything from the milking. I just milked it because i can? Lol.
---
Anyway. Tried claiming billings on adventure as i was curious uf all the tasks were busted  no dice.
---
Popped to survival. Claimed billings got the pop. But when i lioked at the list to see what the last three were again i not8ced the check for milking was gone... 
---
Went to bed and forg9t about it. I still has 2 of 5 tasks complete so i wasnt concerned.
---
Next day i milk another cow in adventure because its apparently something i cannot resist... get another pop 3/5...
---
Try killing a possum with a sickle on adventure.. nope. Hop to survival and i get that to pop. 
---
Milk one more cow while there bam 5 of 4 weapon earned
---
Lame sauce. Oh well, at least I know it's not just me, now.
---
How can i get it. Im lvl 31 amd havent gotten new cards lol
---
How many kills?
---
That could be, yeah.
---
if ur perception is high enough a red arrow will appear on their head when they shoot its really easy to spot someone in a stealth boy once u know what to look for
---
People use different strategies. You win by being alive at the end. You can do that by killing everyone you see or by being patient and observant and letting everyone else do the killing for you.
---
It is weird seeing the world populated with lowbies.
---
Keep the things you need and sell the rest at the train station. Get caps for crap
---
No, you're definitely not the asshole.
---
Pay attention to what you need for weapon and armor repair, and what you use for crafting. Everyone's stash is different.
---
Bulk everything up that you can, ditch/sell ammo you don't use, and keep extra weapons and armor to a minimum.
---
That I'll agree with, I always found that odd too, I try to chalk it up to radiation poisoning but some of them are too perfectly positioned for that
---
It's so annoying, but so accurate that you can't get mad because it's so immersive.
---
You're right but if you have the bodyguards park as well you have 6 more dr/er in marine armor than in PA.
---
As long as it has the setting and lore I'd say it's fine. If it break cannon then that's an issue. 
---
Many fans would think that way. But let's be honest fallout 3 was vastly different from the isometric turn based days of fallout 1 and 2.  But it did keep the aesthetic and the feel of the previous titles.
---
Then can I ask you why you think some people feel so confrontational when these changes are made. Ignoring the glitches for a second with 76 why do you feel the "not Fallout" line was passed around so much before and even now?
---
It‚Äôs a beta.
---
Yeah one of my friends who has difficulty communicating over voice chat (and doesn't have a mic to because of that) had no way to communicate in-game with me when we played at launch/beta.  Having to constantly switch to talking in Discord was annoying.  I imagine they aren't the only one turned off because of the lack of text chat.
---
Sorry it says nothing on the subject
---
Single player is pretty nutty too, the map is absolutely huge and after a good 400 hours I still haven't been to every location. 
---
The completionist in me wants to get every mod unlocked for every gun and boy howdy is that a tall task in 76. I have made thousands of guns in my quest for completion and the high end ones can drain a week's worth of foraging for a few dozen items. It's good stuff. In the previous Fallouts you eventually stop needing to hunt for scrap. In 76, it is eternal.
---
Okay, it eventually finished.
---
I just scrap everything I loot as I'm never really going to use any different weapons than what I'm currently using, and don't forget to scrap your junk aswell, it saves up a good bit of space.
---
I mean it finished at least
---
Good for the game though!
---
For me at least, that works until the game resets the setting back to default.
---
Also, changing the ini file to read-only only helps for a bit, the game can still overwrite it somehow.
---
Turn all your lead and steel into bullets and drop useless stuff line bone and cork, remove all mods of stashed weapons
---
Yes it's very pointless haha.
---
...and makes non-salable (e.g. wood scrap) items salable (e.g. bulk wood) to robot vendors.
---
Mostly solo. Though I do events in groups. Run NW half solo, half grouped. Just got my first solo win on NW.
---
Pro: bonus carry weight on excavator, medic pump for fighting imposter Sheepsquatch and SBQ, rad resistance
---
Con: cannot equip unarmed weapon class e.g deathclaw gauntlets, death Tambo, mole miner gauntlet, powerfist
---
Mount Storm would be the perfect place for this if it doesn't already exist. It's near Seneca Rocks (within an hour or so) in real life and during snowy winters that entire area becomes almost unreachable.
---
People are gonna hate me for this one: But that line is only thrown around by people who didn‚Äôt look at the game hard enough or played it to its extreme.
---
Not long if using exploits that were available before they ~~nerfed~~ fixed them.
---
 * Unlimited exp afk macro trap disarm.  Set character with macro.  Go afk.  Wake up in the am.  Level 100.
---
* Heli exp exploit.  1-50 in a few hours for 10 minutes worth of scrap.
---
* Farm white spring nuke.  10 levels in an hour or two plus 100+ crap legendarily.
---
* Rapid quest turn in by macroing a quest turn in each click you hit gave reward and exp.  Click is as fast as your PC can with macro until server crashes.  Log back in and gain 10 levels and 1000's of quest rewards lol.
---
I.... I.... wut
---
Perks don't work on stash, sadly. You're scrapping all your junk before putting it in the stash, though, right? Also, you don't need to hoard all types of junk. Find the stuff you use more often, and keep that, but everything else I normally keep around 50 of, so if I need it to repair something I have it, but otherwise don't keep. 
---
Also look at aid. I find I end up with hundreds of stimpaks and radaways, so it's good to clear those out now and then. But I've got Vampire weapons, and run Unyielding so don't need as many as people that don't use those items.
---
Go through and look at ammo, too. Missiles and nukes add up fast. Junk mods can as well, since they automatically go into your stash when you deposit your junk.
---
Exactly why i want it gone from semi auto only weapons. 5 shots to max damage is too much for weapons designed to kill stuff in one-three shots.
---
Yes, and DJs as well.  I usually wear earbuds under gaming headset at a lower volume with tunes or other soundtracks streaming (like Bad Company 2 -Vietnam). It would be perfect though, to have more music and a couple post-apocalyptic DJs always available in the pip-boy.
---
I agree. Even then I'm a bit softer on minor lore breaks: Jet in a pre-war vault isn't going to make me explode, its a mistake. Hellfire PA in 76 is pushing it but it's a paint, I can accept it.
---
They know. They said they need new functionality to avoid scrapping bulk via scrap all yet still automatically use bulk for crafting. It‚Äôs been in the queue for a long time.
---
Excellent point, thanks. Think I'll stay away from workshops until the free trial is over.
---
Yeah that's what I thought too.
---
They could do a Pittsburgh story, perhaps. It's minutes away from Morgantown in reality.
---
My main conser was if i can run the game i play on an old laptop still the game sttuters and frezzes frome time to time even after editing the ini file to lower the graphics a litle more but i like the game .
---
Have saved up a bit of money to buy it .
---
250 for quantum? that shit worth like... 5 caps
---
I mean I have 267 hours on the game for a reason
---
This isn't a matter of being against PvP.  This is a matter of being people who think the only way to prove their worth is killing people who can't defend themselves.  It's absolutely asinine to think killing people coming out of the Vault for the first time is Just!
---
If you track a challenge it will show up on the menu for you
---
Keep things you need.
---
I find lead, springs, screws, aluminium, adhesive and ballistic fibre are my most valuable junk. So I keep them in high stock. Everything else is either easy to come by or virtually useless beyond base building. So I bulk and sell them often.
---
If you find yourself getting full up craft some ammo repair your gear bulk and sell your crappy junk like bone and rubber.
---
Besides the above, check in your misc tab or aid.  There are items that you collect but never are able to sell like disease cure.
---
Welcome to the wasteland üëç
---
No, it shows up on the map. I want to see challenges from the main menu without having to join a server.
---
Would you say such people feel more of a personal, emotional connection with the RPG elements of Fallout in that case? They've gone to the extreme, they are the character and to have the ability to role play so hard taken away it feels like a personal slight?
---
Quantum nuka cola? I sold like 100 of those at 8 caps the other day üòÇ
---
Wow... 300 caps, that's ridiculous.
---
Griefing is a part of every online game. I can‚Äôt seem to grasp the appeal, but that‚Äôs just human nature.
---
It's half off on the bethesda store right now. $29.99
---
Some of your misc might have weight too check that as well like some ore's you collect will weigh alot only if you have alot of them tho haha
---
Fallout 76 had 2 problems, one the release was rocky (as you said) and two people milked the game for all its worth on youtube for views, and now everyone think it's bad.
---
dam you lucky as hell, I have 6k 5mm ammo waiting for a good minigun, someday I'll get one like yours.
---
That's ALMOST a great drop...
---
Can confirm
---
If you only have 200 caps why are you buying stuff like Quantum?
---
Same here! Bought the game after two hours of playing the free trial.
---
Would you know if rad resist is still boinked?
---
Seriously? Yesterday I ran into two 3* lvl 62 ghouls at WS within 5 minutes.  The reward? A level 20 drill from each lol
---
AA and TS are both primary, so you'll never see both on the same weapon. That's a beastly gun either way...
---
What even is Burrows? I‚Äôve never done it or seen anyone doing it.
---
Hey man! Welcome to FO76! Also... Sea of Thieves is now also really fun. I try not to listen to others about games and look into the game before making my own decision, sometimes it bites me and others it does not. I am glad you are now enjoying the game. I sure am!
---
You could do something similar to that in the Mire or Cranberry Bog
---
would be nice to trade for something fun, fusion cells, chems, or junk depending on what you have.
---
&gt;You could do this and then kill the final team ;)
---
Basically this.  You will likely get more XP solo than with a PUG.  Even PUGs that turned into premades have a lower XP return than my solo adventures.  
---
Finally got my full solo run win last night.  A team of two and one other solo player.  Manged to get a plasma grenade on both in the team of two, they went flying.  Then the solo player must have been trying to throw a grenade but they were out and instead they bashed which makes a grunt sound,  that is how I found her.  Managed to sneak around the tree the correct way and got her from the blind side.
---
Right after that game I made it 2nd again.... but an entire team was left.  I'll take the 2nd place in that case.  They were well geared and had stealth boys.  
---
I sort of mix up the games though.  The group play is different and a nice change of pace from striking from the shadows.  But most of my XP is from solo stuff.
---
Here is the official announcement from Bethesda dated February 21, 2019:
---
Where exactly was I supposed to learn from that what studio was working on it?  Why does the studio even matter?  Your assumption that two studios can't work on the same part of the game is fundamentally flawed from the beginning.  You are quoting this information that "everyone knew" but provide zero citations.   Sure that information might be out there, but I did a search for articles and the first dozen that I clicked on have ZERO mention of which studio, and in the end it is all Bethesda's (as in the parent company) to deliver the game they advertised.    Exactly how many times am I supposed to go read the same damn PR article rewritten over and over as the various outlets regurgitate the same shit to try and find an article buried in all of that that happens to mention the studios?   You are operating from an assumption that this information was just painfully clear to everyone, which is false AND you are operating under the assumption that only one studio can work on a part of the game at a time, which is false.  It is up to the parent company how their available resources are allocated. Period.
---
Shifting gears for a moment:  Announcing a game design pivot back in February for a game that was arguably in VERY poor condition for 3+ months at that is really shitty for the people that bought into the game based on what was announced BEFORE THAT POINT.  By now it has been almost 7 months since the game came out (including the beta period) and there are a number of bugs still causing problems that were present in November.  WTF?   I am not asking for perfection...I expect new bugs to pop up, but I expect there to be forward progress:  Not this piecemeal 2 steps forward and 3 steps back we often see.... or in the case of the reverted code for lack of a proper CVS repository, that was about 10 steps back and MONTHS to fix things that had just been fixed weeks prior to that absolutely terrible "update".  OR, do you enjoy having the best piece of gear you have get eaten by bugged quest equipment?
---
Your whole argument about the different studios is specious at best and quite frankly doesn't hold water.  You don't control the studios, you don't set their priorities or their workloads.  Bethesda does and they could have just as easily gotten help fixing what was there and delaying plans for all these new game modes.   The bottom line is their development road map and how they utilize the studios available to them is their CHOICE and I am allowed to be frustrated with their choices.   Nitpick the details and your perception of how the studios would be utilized all you want, but it doesn't change the underlying FACT that there are some pretty glaring problems in this game that have been present since November of last year that could and and should have been easily fixed by now.   With proper resource allocation, a good CVS, maybe a few people hired to specifically fix the "low lying fruit" of bugs that affect the polish of the game.  For fucks sake isn't it pretty normal for an online game like this to have a beta server running regularly (as in most of the time) where shit can be publicly tested before it is added to the game?   Some of the bugs introduced into the game would not have been possible if even the most rudimentary public beta testing had been done and cleaned up before prime time.
---
Someone made the point earlier that some bugs being fixed could introduce other problems.  Sure, some issues are more involved, but you cannot tell me that they've done the best job they could have done at this point.  Their shotgun from 100 yard away approach, their lack of quality control, the fact that they lost months of work because of not utilizing a CVS properly, and much more tells me there was a lot of room for improvement in how they handled this.
---
The idea that two sub-companies under the same parent company can't possibly work on the same part of the game at the same time is not based in reality, either.   
---
It is clear that you seek to win arguments by looking for anything to pick at and throw the most ridiculous assumptions about "it's been announced for months and months".   I've double checked.  All the articles that I can bring up with "fallout 76" "nuclear winter" with a time frame of 1/1/2018 through 3/31/2019 have zero mention of which studio is working on what.  When I add Dallas to the search terms it brings up article about how FOUR Bethesda studios have had to come together to work on this game without providing specifics about which studio is doing what....and quite frankly it doesn't matter to my underlying point that it is completely up to Bethesda how their resources are allocated.
---
So dig through all the articles you want and you find the one that I'm obviously a terrible person for missing in all the noise out there about this game:

---
It's not like I spend hours each day researching this game... so your "obvious knowledge that everyone else has" is just flat out bullshit.   It isn't that wide spread.  It is quite easy to see a lot of information about this game without seeing everything.  Get off your high horse and don't hold individual people to extreme standards.  You'll always be disappointed.
---
BTW:  Regarding your other reply "that's literally not how the games industry works.".... I'm pretty sure I did read an article about how one studio couldn't handle the net code by themselves and they had to get help from one of the other Bethesda studios and by working together, they managed to take a game engine that was NEVER designed with multiplayer net-play in mind and create a whole new version that works fairly well considering it wasn't designed from the ground up to be that way.   I've had far more rubber banding issues with other games than I have had with 76 at this point.  (There has been a little bit VERY recently in the last week or two, but I'm talking about since November overall there has been very little...  I've been more than a little impressed with some aspects of their online gameplay / engine.   There are issues in other areas that are quite painful, but it isn't all bad, either.)   So, yes even Bethesda has shown it is quite possible for their studios to collaborate when a goal is set.
---
Oh definitely I'm not saying it's the only option but I'd really love to go back to far harbour
---
Yeah it is, but $30 is what a College Student like me spends in an entire week in my country, on basic necessities. I was only able to buy Fallout 4 during a Steam Summer Sale in 2017, and that's splurging. It's fine haha, least I was able to get a taste of multiplayer Fallout :)
---
as much as i dont like the arrow and GT appearing on screen i guess we could chalk it up to it being a ‚ÄúVATS feature‚Äù, which isn‚Äôt totally nuts but i still find it a bit silly.
---
It's also because there are alot more low level players populating servers rn. B4 there would only be a couple now there is alot.
---
They don't have a fully kitted out character that hits like a train.
---
I do t know about that. But we should definitely be able to breakdown the thousands of useless bullets into lead/steel and gunpowder.
---
I've been thinking about how if fires could start in this game, the whole world would have burned down if only because of the Mr. Handy jets.
---
As a person with frog legs, no. I have invested all my perks in the M79 cheese. It is 2 shots to kill anyone, and I WILL ALWAYS hit my target with grenadier. So far, the only way I‚Äôve been stopped is by .50 cal spam or somebody who got 3 headshots off while I was looting something, and the occasional self inflicted damage.
---
Flair message ignore
---
Yes. 3 times since last patch.
---
Or the Citadel or the National Mall from 3, or the Strip from NV
---
These would never happen, but a cool thought nonetheless
---
Ha! I love the picture. I took over the food factory early on and spend a day defending it. Currently have a large stockpile Salisbury steak that I like to hand out. I personally found that crafting my own food is super rewarding now. It‚Äôs true though, this community makes giving the supplies and helping each other out the norm. I think that‚Äôs just one of the reasons the fallout-verse is such a great one.
---
This would definitely be awesome of them to add. Until then, if I have 30-50 shots left... I usually just waste them because reloading is what causes it, and reloading as the fight gets going is a pain.
---
there's 2 ponds near gilman lumber mill, one is directly behind it and another is between there and the isolated cabin to the east
---
Has it been a year already?  I feel like I've lost a few months somehow.
---
Welcome to the country roads of west Virginia
---
Maybe they had heart-attacks or strokes when the bombs fell.
---
Also no fast travel.
---
I had 12 for sale in my vendor at 5 caps...few days  later I got a notification that someone had bought 80 and got 360 caps...when I was using a plaz gat it took FOREVER to burn through all my cores.
---
Thanks my dude!
---
Thanks for commenting...   
---
**Questions:**   
---
Could you grab a screenshot or two?  
---
When do you see it occurring?   
---
Platform?
---
Yeah maybe. I probably would too. Lol
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm glad your having fun! Sea of thieves was like my ‚Äúfo76‚Äù public trashed the game, saying it was boring, but i have stuck around since beta, and honestly it‚Äôs funny how people started to change, apologizing for their comments on the game and what not. Honestly I‚Äôm not a huge fallout fan, I have only played new Vegas and 4, after I played 4 my first thought was ‚Äúman, I wish this was online‚Äù then 76 was announced couple of weeks later. And I was so hyped, then after release everyone trashed it, and I was really disappointed. Until this weekend, and wow, I love this game.
---
Yeah there's like four challenges for it, I believe its: 
---
* Take 10 Photos in Vault 51
---
* Take 25 Photos in Vault 51
---
* Take 50 Photos in Vault 51
---
* Take 75 Photos in Vault 51
---
Advertising, spread the good word around the server "have you heard of that guys camp?" "No I haven't but I'll check it out now"
---
If you go south of pleasant valley train station, go down the cliffs and you‚Äôll find it along the little river leading to a lake with Brahmin
---
Pros:
---
\- Extremely high damage/energy/radiation resistances without having to invest any perks
---
\- Immunity to fall damage
---
\- Boosts your STR to 15 if it isn't already that high
---
\- Useful mods like the Jetpack, Stealth Boy, Calibrated Shocks for carry weight (even more with Excavator), or Emergency Protocols for Bloodied builds
---
\- Lots of cool skins
---
Cons:
---
\- Bad for PvP: It makes your hitbox much larger and you don't benefit from legendary effects, so any armor penetrating effects/mods/perks will quickly blow you away
---
\- Bad for stealth, makes you much larger and louder
---
\- Removes all your armor and backpack so you can't make use of legendary effects or extra carry weight/refrigeration/etc.
---
\- UI/movement can feel clunky for some people
---
&gt; mods
---
What about sound/music replacers like a replacer mod that swaps out the Atomic Shop tracks for custom ones?
---
The one I use currently specifies that I have to slip the music replacer mod into ResourceStartUpArchiveList and the ResourceArchive2List.
---
So with ResourceStartUpArchiveList not being able to be overridden, would the music replacer mod still work?
---
This is literally the shit I'm looking for üòÇüòÇ
---
You should be able to create your own advertisement posters
---
Pick a location that gets considerable foot traffic, some of which might be event &amp; mission related.
---
Or, fully stock your vendor machine(s) so all would be patrons will see that you‚Äôre offering a full compliment of items to justify their expense in traveling to view the merchandise.
---
My 2 cents...
---
I thought their was only one nuke case
---
I thoroughly enjoyed it for its' self aware sense of humor. But if I were ever to do it again I'd probably feel the same.
---
#becausebethesda
---
Nope, not at all. Have had around 2 disconnects within the last week.
---
That person was being a prick. You can pick up quantum all over the map for free. When I sell it, I usually ask for 20 caps at the most. It‚Äôs not exactly a rare drop
---
Wait until all the newbies are gone and you're customer number will probably go up
---
Depends on what you are selling.
---
Most people are on the lookout for legendary weapons so a shop with a lot of weapons attracts more traffic. Serums are good too. Ammo is a bit meh. People may buy it in passing especially if it's a hard to come by ammo type.
---
OP is OP. I appreciate the confirmation - appears I need to checkout Challenges more often.
---
It's a random card drop, unfortunately there are duplicate cards, making it hard to get a lot of the unique cards.
---
I'm almost level 90 and had no idea.
---
How? Musician is still glitched for me
---
You know, now that i think about it, i dont think ive ever been to poseidon.  Been almost everywhere else, but not poseidon
---
Mood...
---
After seeing how much I love NW I just hope they continued support on it and I have just been thinking of all the places we could go if they wanted to and far harbor stands out
---
Only take or keep what you need. That's about it really.
---
Try going in to social menu and seeing if you can kick the other player and the rejoin...I've had some wonkiness with the team mechanic not registering correctly.
---
I'm on PC and next time it happens I'll grab a screenshot for you and post it here.
---
Dunno if that's glitched for me since it is a possum badge and i havent finished any possum badges.
---
Challenges are considered as personal data for each character on the server. If you have mentioned, the challenges won't even load until you have joined a server.
---
Good idea
---
Honesty I have no idea. But FYI sleeping and playing a musical instrument gives you a 5% exp bonus each. If you choose to do feed the people the reward canned stewed meat gives you even more exp boost
---
The server disconnect is odd though.
---
I couldn't even get through it, regardless of subject. His "personality" is too annoying for me to bother with. I don't understand why these over-the-top caricatures are so popular. They just annoy me.
---
I'm not surprised the content was outdated and inaccurate. Given the timing, title, and first few minutes it's pretty much just seemed a "hey guys, remember how bad Fallout 76 is? Like, subscribe" video for clicks.
---
That is awesome. I always wanted a online version of Fallout as well. I have enjoyed Fallout since Fallout 2. I am a huge Fallout and Elder Scrolls fan.
---
I really enjoy Fallout 76 not only because of online though, but because I really enjoyed the gun play in Fallout 4 and Fallout 76 is literally a online Fallout 4. I still think Fallout New Vegas and Fallout 3 are the best though! I am glad you actually got to enjoying it and also gave Fallout 76 a try. There are many people who see a game doing bad at the beginning and completely forget about it no matter how much better it gets over time.
---
My buddy and I have yet to get a team with mics üòî I can see it being a total blast though! I'd love to find a couple people that we can all run like a well oiled machine for an evening.
---
I've been playing since my husband got the friend codes on his beta account, and play most night and weekends. I haven't even tried NW yet because I always want to do the dailies first and then end up not having time to dive into NW (also I'm not great at pvp and it intimidates me a bit). I also love building camps!
---
Canon? we don't use words like that 'round these parts. 
---
And to speak of such things is blasphemy. /spits into a bucket. 
---
Seriously though, bethesda has been playing fast and loose with the lore for a while now.
---
You sir, are insane.
---
Bro its more llike every 15 min now for me !!
---
What version are you on because I honestly think it may have been me
---
honestly, this solution has the most substantial effect. i don't mind playing the game at 1/4 my native resolution if it means it makes it playable. it's not like i can't see or anything, i can still keep the other graphics settings high if i do this.
---
That thing said it was level 8 and i thought i could take it as well and I did, but it cost a lot and i wish i didnt do it
---
Thanks a lot fellas. This really helps
---
I've made quite a few friends on here. I'm over 600hrs invested at this point
---
I just submitted an error ticket, but didn't include the 4:7:2000 number on my ticket. It hadn't really bothered me until Nuclear Winter and hadn't paid attention to the error number.  I've been having this issue since original Beta as well.
---
How about a Grunkle Stan.
---
The one I shot at (not in clip) the bullets went right through that thing
---
&gt;Probably was either [nukacrypt)(nukacrypt.com) or [code breaker](fo76codebreaker.online)
---
Edit: wtf
---
Thanks! They are time consuming but I love the sound when one is completed
---
I like to see a fallout 5
---
Yeah I realized that in fallout 4, but this just seems like such a big retcon or mistake.
---
heard about this one, Nuclear Winter only or all formats&gt;
---
Sounds like you would enjoy survival. I got tired of the lack of danger in adventure and now only play survival.
---
And everything you've read about it is basically wrong. Just remember to store your junk often and only keep aid your willing to lose.
---
I also recommend making a new char for it. It was fun for me.
---
I don‚Äôt know those Mr. Haney‚Äôs are fast man
---
I'd buy the bundles. I just got the Vault Tec skin bundle and now I look like a vault tec commando. 
---
Also, if you want to look extra fancy they do limited releases on super extravagent power armor skins
---
My dweller buddy and I looking for ppl to farm this. Gonna add you. What time EST you usually play?
---
Reach
---
- Try to limit your junk items in your stash to a maximum of 100 each.  Bulk and sell any excess unless you really need a lot of something specific, you'll rarely need more than 100 of something unless you're mass crafting things.
---
- If you're storing a lot of weapons and armor that you don't actively use, try to put mods on them that will make them more lightweight and take less stash space (basic mods on weapons and Ultra-Light on armors)
---
- If you use a weight reduction perk or legendary effect, it's usually better to keep that item type on you than to put it in your stash since it'll weigh less while you're carrying it; there are no ways to reduce the weight of items in your stash.  The only items you'll drop on death are junk (or aid if you play Survival), so if you use a weight reduction perk for a specific weapon type you may be better off carrying your arsenal with you.
---
Couple nights ago my BE pipe bolt was missing 3 95%vats hits in a row!  It did this over and over; very frustrating.  Next day it was back to normal.  Hope it doesn't continue for you.
---
The only nuke that's been launched when I played was a teammate and it was so late in the game it took up the entire zone.  Everyone died and the game ended as a stalemate.
---
MAMA DOLCE!
---
Not a bug, well not entirely...   
---
The Invuln period is core, from Fallout 4, and ironically I noticed the same thing during the Alpha we played a few months ago.   
---
People are exploiting the 5'ish seconds you get when entering/exiting to result in tactical distractions or bait...  
---
It does need to be tweaked, but honestly can decide if this is QoL, Bug, or Exploit...  
---
Hopefully some more people can weight in and give some feedback.
---
Hope you have a camera and a friend
---
It‚Äôs almost got me killed so many times! My buildrevolves around vats so if it doesn‚Äôt work I‚Äôm outta luck
---
I have a few for sale for a bargain 9999 caps üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅ
---
Wait, how do I get a camera?
---
ps4
---
There was one a while ago. I don‚Äôt think one‚Äôs running right now, but a fresh one soon would make sense after the trial and sale.
---
You play Bethesda Fallout and still care about lore?
---
Yes for real!
---
Ditto
---
Now go for a glowing radscorpion! I tagged one in game and it bent the laws of space and time to burrow up behind me at my computer chair.
---
If that's a question, I believe all but I've experienced in NW
---
Ha.
---
Love her stew.
---
Ya survival is definitely a lot more intense and I believe you‚Äôll find what you‚Äôre looking for, I played it quite a bit, always looking over your shoulder, taking cover every time you hear footsteps, spotting players far away and watching them with binoculars, death isn‚Äôt as punishing now as it used to be, my only complaint about the game mode is how unbalanced it is, though NW feels fair
---
I don't even claim workshops anymore because of the disconnects
---
I don‚Äôt really come across people who constantly jump and shoot in fallout. But I think it would balance out for the people who do
---
Thats dumb kinda cause im level 31 and have the same cards. Like i keap getting the same ones
---
[Nukacrypt](https://nukacrypt.com/php/home.php)
---
[Codebreaker](http://fo76codebreaker.online)
---
Cheers mates
---
Unequip all your perk cards and try adventure modeüòä
---
I don‚Äôt like them either, but it‚Äôs a really fresh way to experience the environment.
---
How can games go longer when every match ends around the same time since each match is basically timed.  Sure maybe some games goes 5-10 mins longer or shorter, but that's it.  Unless I'm missing something here...
---
Also someone who plays on a team, and other teams surely do this.  We actively scout around the ring in bushes, trees, ect ect.  We do this to make sure our flank is clear, eventually the people hiding will get weeded out.  That's all part of the game mode and what makes it fun.  You have to have tactics, team positioning and be aware of possible positions of more stealth like players.
---
My main point is.  If someone//team wants to que up and literally just sit at the edge of the ring for every game, it won't make a difference for the rest of the players in the game.  Those players will be at a disadvantage loot wise, a big one.  If your not standing at the end of the game you lose out on a lot of exp.  The whole concept of an afk type player in a timed battle royal with a death ring doesn't make to much sense to begin with.  If your not godlike, you have to be somewhat sneaky to win games.
---
Ah right ok. I'm PC. Can you like verify the game files for a repair on PS4?
---
I knowwwwww I've wanted it since it got datamined ages ago, ughhh.
---
Do the power armor skins work on any set of power armor?
---
300 cps for a Nuka Quantum?! lol
---
I would call that many things but definitely not reasonable.
---
It gets more grindy at higher levels so spend wisely
---
I believe two or three possum ones are bugged.
---
The first issue was most likely a server crash.
---
Bethesda cant maintain a timeline so idk
---
1 bulk of each except steel ballistic fiber aluminum adhesive...no more then 50 of the things that can't be bulked (except screws, hoard the shit out of those) unless you know your going to use alot for a particular crafting....scrip any 1 or 2* item asap. Try to sell the three stars you don't use regularly until you need to feed them to the scrip machine. Scrap all weapons and armor untill you know a bunch of mods then sell to max your daily caps.
---
I have ALOT of meds for sale haha people buy them every now and then
---
We at The Institute disapprove of this message.
---
You can still repair things the normal way at a work bench.   You just need to choose repair with workbench or something similar, it is just an extra step to get to at the work bench.    You don't need to repair with repair kits.   Repair kits don't need work benches or materials is the difference.
---
they make a noise and are placed as junk
---
You can still repair things without repair kits. You just go up to the item‚Äôs respective workbench and press the button that‚Äôs displayed with ‚ÄúModify/Repair‚Äù. Hover over your item and it should give an option for a ‚Äúworkbench repair‚Äù. If this isn‚Äôt working then it could be bugged.
---
Same , I had no idea what to label it. Either way it has to be tweaked in NW. I lobbed 3 missiles at someone and he got out of power amour and was invincible.
---
There was a leak of new perks tied to NW a while back, one of them looks like it‚Äôs for finding nuke cases the same way you can get perks to ding caps, magazines, and bobble heads.
---
Battlefield cemetery. It's been her favorite find of the game.
---
Hoping someone has any advice, as this one is still bugged for me, even now. Not to mention a few of the regular challenges, like places in the Toxic Valley etc. Any chance u/Ladydevann can inform the devs?
---
If you don‚Äôt use it for say a week get rid of it. If you don‚Äôt have a build for the weapon or armor you‚Äôre saving you probably don‚Äôt need it, save the weight for more useful things for the time being. Don‚Äôt stash to many Stimpaks or other aid items they add up really quick. If you want what you get rid of later on down the line you can always buy it back again. 
---
I had the same problem with stash space until I started doing those things. I didn‚Äôt need a bunch of heavy guns or melee items when I never used them. Free up the space, get some caps and buy/upgrade your current build :)
---
You need to find a tourist corpse at specific landmark locations.  They don't always spawn so you may need to jump around locations/server hop to find one.  Some of the Scout challenges require you to take camera pictures of things so you'll need to find the camera for that.  [Here's a map of tourist spawn locations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bgln59/tourist_and_camera_all_possible_spawn_locations/)
---
A Perk is good too .
---
Junk is my biggest problem. Go into your pipboy in junk section and use component view and mark only the things you need or want so you dont pick up useless stuff for you. I keep 5 or less bulk of each item that can be bulked and 100 or less items of the ones that cant be bulked (except plastic). I finally got out of the habit of picking up everything.
---
I'm not really sure but I kind of just pretend that it isn't.
---
About this time. Today and tomorrow
---
Sooo not true. You need to pay more attention when at workbench. It gives both options, repair kit which uses 0 resources and workbench repair which uses your resources.
---
Even then, you don't have to buy off atom shop. Atom shop has regular repair kits. In game you can get them off events like scorched earth for free and they are improved repair kits which repair to 150% condition. Waaaaay better than the atom shop ones and free. I have like 30+ on me and never paid a dime.
---
Hi not really sure but i kind of just pretend that it isn't., I'm dad.
---
I usually get my team to hold up in the church. One way in/out, lots of cover at the back with the stairs, and a snipers post up top. Yellow house next door usually has a power armor on the balcony.
---
I've also found that flatwood itself usually ends up close to the 3rd ring when things get dicey.
---
If you sell it (for cheap) they will buy it.
---
First time play through? Probably the Raiders. I have a sneaky suspicion there is more than meets the eye with the Settlers faction. A lot of the holotapes and notes we have in game about the various Raider clans give them a lot more nuance as people than in FO4 or 3 for that matter, with them sometimes being driven to what they're doing and then later utterly regretting it before dying alone somewhere. 
---
Plus out of nowhere the Settlers have returned to reclaim their land, years after they already left and after we may have already settled ourselves.
---
I think I have an idea now what to do.
---
I remember back in my day when they had about 1000 atoms worth of daily and weekly challenges for the camera that wasn‚Äôt even released yet and we got nothing. Don‚Äôt hold your breathe
---
Yeah I couldn't find anything either. Appreciate you trying though.
---
why me
---
Oh man a nuka world map would be insane...
---
Well the tadpole one with the frog was also reported to be bugged but I was lucky. I guess we'll see :P
---
No idea, although I've been told that the armor pieces that have "rad resist" but it's not working/listed in the armor stats is actually mislabeled disease resist.
---
Gotcha. Trying to reach my buddy to get him online
---
My friend was joking last night when he got Aquaboy.  Saying he will just go hide under the water in the river to win.  It was more amusing when he said it though. :p
---
I make disease cures and sell them for 10 caps, haven‚Äôt sold tons but I use lots myself cause I hate rad worms, I don‚Äôt think you will get rich on chems but one thing I do is when someone buys a weapon or armor from me and if I‚Äôm around my camp I will drop a couple of cures in a bag for them most people grab them and give me a heart emote.
---
Your SPEC points do not matter in the slightest in this mode.
---
Another PSA: If you have the frog legs card you can jump on to the upper section without having to be a lvl 30 in NW
---
So happy about this! For people that like a BR mode, this is for you!  
---
  ...and for people who have never traditionally liked a BR mode in games, well...this is also for you because I can not tell you how many times I have heard, read, seen people saying they never really liked that game mode until they played nuclear winter.
---
It won‚Äôt complete for ‚Äúplay an instrument at...‚Äù no matter how many caps I donate to the the followers of Atom, forever may they glow.
---
Cave crickets, and in a close second scorchbeasts
---
Hacks are on PC end only. Use console users have to play fair.
---
Almost like it was planned all along...
---
Sorry, man. I‚Äôm on PS4
---
I just don't see this being a money maker.   I usually have more chems than I could use just from wandering around.    Alcohol I think suffers from the same thing, so much of it is sitting around for free.   Now maybe you could make some money with some of the specialty recipes but its a big maybe.
---
If there were RP servers I think this could be much more viable.
---
Just my two cents.
---
The challenge system isn't beta.
---
‚úãI never left the game because I always had faith that Bethesda would fix it AND THEY DID I can honestly say I‚Äôve stuck with the game and didn‚Äôt get on the hate wagon
---
Are you kidding?  I'm level 192 and y alt is level 45 and both were done solo. I like it better solo than in a group because I can do whatever I want whenever I want.  Team play is fun,  but I tend to play solo 90% of the time.
---
I almost never to voice chat except for team play.  I still leave my mic for area chat - but hardly anyone uses it in this game.
---
Its a skin for BR lvl 100
---
Just started recently, thank you for letting us know about this. I grabbed it! I'm new here and the community here is great.
---
Agreed, there is a perfect balanced of gorilla warfare and all out battles that happen at the start of the match and at the end of the match.  Don't understand what people are talking about how sneaky players can prolong games, that makes no sense in a timed ring battle royal game mode.  All games end around the same time...
---
Do events.
---
No, all DLC is free forever.
---
Level 190.  I don‚Äôt use voice chat.  You should consider getting the app for your phone for text communication if on Xbox. I don‚Äôt know setups for PC/PS.
---
That's just good advice for any Battle Royal, especially the real ones they hold in Russia that nobody really knows about.
---
[JC Bradberton hated that.]
---
[Sierra Petrovita hated that.]
---
[Dick Shale disliked that.]
---
I can't eat people in it and I have to constantly collect fusion cores, but I can't seem to survive without it.
---
And the extra carry weight is great if you're using the excavator armor.
---
that was me, i have it recorded as well, what's your account name? I can check to see if that was one of my nukes. I stood on the top of a small ridge and cackled as the entire zone "except a fingernail sliver" was left open for me and my partner. LOL.
---
It's that extra 5% thats doing it. üòÇ Nah, idk
---
It's pretty easy to launch, SBQ ain't worth it though. I usually hit whitespring or the mire cause it looks really cool and is fun to explore nuked.
---
I think cannon is going out the window now,especially the new skins for Hellfire armor and with the Elders Battlecoat.
---
I so agree with this. Hiding in the corner doesn‚Äôt take as much skill.
---
I need other teams to not see my emotes before I trust a new strand of emotes. üòÖ But yes! These would be very helpful in NW... as long as enemies across the map can't see them.
---
Can‚Äôt agree more.  Hand signals, stop, enemy contact, etc
---
They patched it a few weeks ago that‚Äôs why. It was bugged until 9.5
---
I would definitely tbag someone after they tried to kill me
---
Yes. That's what I do. The server populations are small enough that you can adventure for hours without even seeing anyone (besides the popular locations). You can communicate well enough with a friendly wave, and most players will return that wave. There's plenty of stuff to do, and all but a few events can be soloed.
---
Raised hand. Been playing since beta. I might only get an hour or so in a day but I'm wandering Appalachia most every day. I'm level 80 but still have a lot of story left as I only sporadically engage with the story. There's always something else grabbing my attention.
---
ye right?
---
its way better than expected
---
My wife swears it is Simmons from Red vs. Blue, but I don't hear it.
---
My normal rates (unless low). 
---
Healing salve at 5, Disease cure at 10, stimpacks at 20, radshield and antibiotics at 30.  
---
They move.
---
CONELRAD looks awesome.  Really, what a cool site.  I have never seen anything like it. I will have to take a listen.
---
Some of the lasers have burning dmg which starts a fire? On enemies tho :)
---
Wouldn‚Äôt you be moving as much, relative to them though?
---
I feel the same! I can't nab it while the sale is on, but I definitely want to own this game.
---
Just FYI to anyone reading this, the contractor perk lowers the flux DRASTICALLY.  I think it‚Äôs only 1 or 2 per type.
---
Depending on your build, keep what scrap you'll need; keep very little lead if your a melee type or store as much as you can if you like big guns but if you have a gun you really like press it into ammo.
---
Check your tabs, make sure you don't have a ton of missiles in ammo or gunpowder in misc.
---
You're already hip to the keyword: maintaining. Either loot very selectively or loot like it's fallout 4 and just bulknsell scrap, dump ammo, sell aid, and scrap gear instead of stashing.
---
oh i ment rl perception to see someone running around with an arrow on their head
---
You‚Äôre falling on deaf ears. Apparently they take pride in hiding.
---
I agree to a certain point.  You always learn something on engaging an enemy team.  Sometimes you overextend, or chase to far, sometimes another team flanks you because your plan was a bit flawed.  That being said, if your in it to win each and every game, than you probably shouldn't try to take EVERY engage.  
---
That also being said.  If your team/friends goal is different, your reasoning applies 100%.  I see nothing wrong with trying to engage every encounter possible and trying to win it with tactics and communication.  Like you said, you do gain lots of combat experience if your able to survive more than one encounter a game.
---
That was a guaranteed spawn...until the event ended :|
---
You have to do The Enclave questline.
---
It‚Äôs a pain in the butt, i had to sell literally god-tier drops back when it was 400, now at 800 I don‚Äôt feel it any easier since I‚Äôve got much more stuff to manage. Create a few extra characters and let them share your load, that‚Äôs probably the best way to mitigate this stash limit.
---
Mmmmm ok.  I don‚Äôt think you did but ok haha.  All good.
---
Ah nice!
---
You can order power armour editions off of amazon for 50 dollars
---
There is no spoon
---
Lol I dunno why I like it so much.  I think it mixed with the responders paint just looks friendly overall. Also really digging the eyes lighting up too
---
Isn't the sbq the only way to "complete" the story, though?
---
SBQ fight takes 30 minutes for a 3 start legendary. Whitespring you get 1-3 start legendaries every other minute. I would consider myself a regular at that golf club.
---
&gt;  probably close to 70 when I finished the main quest line
---
Level 73, still haven't finished it. Haven't even been to Watoga yet. There's just so much to do in this game. I spend most of my time exploring, farming, and doing dailies. Still thoroughly enjoying it after two months and 300 hours.
---
Yeah, if you need the critical damage then vats is a must; and I use it as well.  Are you using the critical perks in the Luck tab?
---
Too many hackers already on PC. Killed the hype for me. I hope you guys enjoy though!
---
Yup
---
Setup your shop right next to whitesprings train station, one of the better spots to vend from
---
Whats up Vault-tec rep ;)
---
Ammo is kind of like a steep learning curve in this game - it's really annoying to a certain point and then you just start giving it away. My best suggestion before hitting that threshold is to use EVERY ammo type; by rotating what guns you use you'll be able to conserve ammo. Resulting in surpluses of other ammo, which can be traded (if you don't like the guns that use it) for ammo you do like using.
---
Added as QoL with the disclaimer, thanks for reminding me about this one!
---
Not sure about ultracite vs regular, I thought it‚Äôs 30% more damage against the scorched? Furious is 50% extra while AA is less than 30%. So if I have to pick one from the three I‚Äôd go with Furious.
---
+1 for fandom
---
It does, but I think you have to find the relish recipe.  I think cobbler is automatic.
---
It depends. Towers can also be built empty to draw people in. Or you can design them to wait for people to breach. Or used to spot while rest of team is nearby. Or...
---
If you‚Äôre in the bushes, chances are pretty good that an enemy will randomly spot you while sighting their weapon into the horizon (I spot tons of enemies that way when I don‚Äôt actually visually see them, but their name pops up)
---
It‚Äôs due to the newest duping method.
---
*Hands Participation trophy over* here you go little guy you get a reward too for being ummm there on the battlefield?
---
AA does not work for energy weapons.
---
What? The stations are vendors.
---
Every train station has a vendor at it
---
How often do u play?
---
Boost strength. Each point gives you 5lb extra carry weight.
---
Also has perk cards like strong back, where it adds +10lbs per rank.
---
I wear the stalker outfit plus a bunch of grime and scars with black eye face paint. Looks pretty raider-ish
---
If everyone else is missing the point, maybe the point doesn‚Äôt make as much sense as you think it does.
---
r/entitledgamers
---
It's all luck. I do feel your pain though. I'm 49 and I haven't got a decent card since level 10.
---
Dude, no one is arguing you don't have a point, but if you think posting here is going to fix it, you're wrong. You have the tools to avoid that behaviour by a slight modification when you create a new character and that is go Adventure until you get away from the vault and then log in as survival. You can do that without killing a single thing or looting a single item, you just need to get to another travel point.
---
You want the single player survival mode in a game that can't cater to that unless it makes you off limits for a number of levels or somehow programs players though high tech subliminal messaging not to be dicks. You're pissing into the wind dude.
---
Yeah I mean there's nothing wrong with being stealthy but I couldn't imagine spending 15 minutes just finding nooks to crouch and completely avoiding combat like some of the people in here are bragging about lol.
---
they must repay us with their souls
---
Does the terminal save daily progress if you get DC'D? me and my buddies keep getting disconnected on pc. We have tried to complete the water treatment quest a few times and keep having to restart.
---
As a personal attack or something, that‚Äôs outlandish. Bethesda is a company. They need to sell a game for millions, not 10000 people who are diehard role players. Bethesda however, underestimated how vocal these 10000 were and had a series of unlucky fuck ups.
---
Well the other content has been out for a year almost and been discussed to hell and back
---
Yeah the stalker outfit is pretty nice. I love the tyre armour on it. I love anything that is like makeshift apocalypse armour. It's the coolest!
---
I feel like it's a valid question. When I first started spending all my caps on a Quantum wasn't even remotely on my wishlist.
---
I‚Äôm all for stealthy, but hiding is just embarrassing.
---
I will keep these Prices in mind..Do Non-Medical Chems sell decently?
---
I cannot believe this community. Todd Howard cracked a joke about how kind the community was during his E3 speech and I thought, "yeah, they all say that". Then I played for the first time this week. I only hit level 12 or 13.
---
I quickly grew irritated with the grind for ammo and ask for tips on this very sub. I didn't get a single "git gud" comment. everybody was very helpful and I even had one or two even offered to meet up with me to give me some ammo. 
---
I still don't think I'm quite ready to buy the game but I will be watching its progress closely. Thank you to all you guys that are level 100 and above that have been playing over the last year. It was very refreshing to see such a welcoming attitude as opposed to what I expected which was "slay the Christmas (E3) newbs!!1!"
---
That‚Äôs the X-03(Hellfire) power armor. X-02 is the standard enclave power armor from Fallout 3.
---
Backpack, a level 50 adds 60 carry weight.
---
Oh oof I guess I'm an idiot lol
---
That's hellfire.  xo-2 isn't in the game yet.
---
There‚Äôs always a time machine somewhere in time...
---
I almost never die anymore, with the exception of Imposter sheepsquatch. That fight is a death trap. Worst part is I always have to be the conduit even though i can usually deal more damage than anyone else near me. Rockin full heavy gunner with a tse minigun and troubleshooter 50 cal mg.
---
You don't need to be a game developer or critic\* to know what makes a good game. That's absurd. Don't gatekeep people's opinions based on their profession.
---
Fallout 76 had a massive amount of issues on launch and still suffers greatly from many issues. Other games have had similar issues and have received similar amounts of backlash. Some haven't. Some have received more.
---
People weren't exaggerating the amount of bugs and lack of endgame content on release. Those things are factual. If you want to like the game regardless - okay, you're absolutely allowed to. That doesn't mean it's a polished, well thought-out game deserving of a $60 price tag on release. I've seen Early Access releases with less issues.
---
If you want to gatekeep people for "not playing the game" or not being "a professional game developer," you should at least know your own limitations. If you didn't play the game on release, you can't claim that all the bad press was for no reason or that people didn't know what they were talking about. Take your own advice and don't talk about topics which you haven't experienced first-hand, apparently.
---
Ok at least I have a chance ü§ò
---
Were you able to get X01 shocks, my trade mule has 1 of the mods. I'm returning after not playing since around January. On PC. You can have it for free for helping out new beans.
---
Yea, I didn‚Äôt miss anything. It‚Äôs the rules of the mode man. You created a character for survival...you have to deal with the rules of survival. I‚Äôm not a griefer myself, but if someone wants to do that it‚Äôs their choice in that mode. Either figure out how to escape them or go to a diff server. Asking to be safe in a mode that isn‚Äôt supposed to be safe is like asking for chocolate milk to be white...it‚Äôs chocolate my dude.
---
derp my bad lol
---
"Its my birthday soon" literally nobody cares, you aren't entitled to anything.
---
You can buy plans from Watoga vendor (I think) or if you‚Äôre very lucky, get a legendary drop. I just got a 3* mutant‚Äôs handmade rifle and I think I‚Äôm in love. 
---
Since I have the plans, when I have the mats I craft and scrap low level versions to learn all the mods. Too bad I run out of steel constantly or I‚Äôd have them all üòÇ
---
I played for a couple hundred hours starting at launch before the crashes and bugs broke me and I uninstalled. You may enjoy it now. But don't judge the people who said it was bad at launch. They saved you alot of pain back then because the state of this game was about 100√ó worse than sea of thieves at launch.
---
I don‚Äôt know why I want this since I‚Äôm awful in NW but I do want it.  My KDR is gonna be so bad üòÖ
---
This is my thought as well.
---
Haha. That's cool. ‚ò∫Ô∏è
---
When you think about it most quest are this way the dmv name what makes it seem worse the the other quest.
---
You‚Äôre giving me hope!
---
I played it at the start but I got sick of the bugs so I ditched it for 2 months now i play it every day though I gotta admit the game can‚Äôt be doing to good if they were desperate enough to put battle royale into the game
---
Ya. I've done it 3 or 4 times but the payoff ain't worth it.  I can solo a sheepsquatch in under a minute for the same reward so why even bother.
---
How do i start it?
---
Been since first day of B.E T.A and been streaming it pretty regularly.  I withered the storm of criticism within my Discord community during launch, and kept my head held high and my weapons hot. 
---
Bethesda's commitment to this game never ceased during the "tumultuous era."
---
724 gameplay hours later, I'm still nukin' (seemingly) random areas on the map and dunkin' on my enemies in Nuclear Winter / Survivor mode. 
---
I bought one game, but got three kind of:
---
1. PvE with some PvP.
---
2. PvP with some PvE.
---
3. PvP battle royale. 
---
Im here for a good time, and a long time.
---
Its all good man
---
Walk inside. There is a vendor in there.
---
Yes, I initially build my character to by a sniper in combat armor, hen changed it to primarily Power Armor, then I went for full auto rifles, then I switched back to normal armor and now I‚Äôm big gun player. Takes a bit of time, I‚Äôm well over 200 and I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll switch again when a gun gets nerfed or something is more effective at what I like to do.
---
Fine. Those don't fit in with the narrative but what's fallout without skeletons in intriguing or humorous positions?
---
Power armor
---
If players are afk whole matches not doing anything, they don't hurt anyone else in the match, so it doesn't even matter.  If thats how those players want to use their time, than let them.  It is a legit strategy in a timed battle royal match anyway.  It doesn't even make much sense to begin with, the "afk player".  Its battle royal.  
---
Lots of players will hang around the outskirts, and a lot of players will check the outskirts of the ring.  You will have lots of players doing all sorts of things.  In the end it won't change anything about the matches conclusion or how long it lasts.  NW is pretty close to perfect from my perspective, I'm level 38 atm.  When I say perfect, I mean in a general sense of the game and how it plays out.  Sure some things have to be tweaked and added, like fixing rendering issues and adding more guns and stuff like that, but that all comes with updates and time.
---
However.  I wouldn't be against rewarding the players who do deal a lot of damage to players.  On the contrary,  I would be all for it.
---
Abbies bunker within The Mire. Look up a walkthrough if you need one.
---
Just put a track for each instrument that actually goes with the other instruments...
---
I did not know this! I‚Äôm in uk so not sure if it makes a difference but thank you!
---
They said they will be changing up how the leader board is ranked as we go along. First was time alive, the we had most kills, now it's survival score. Ittll change again.
---
Sent a request but was never accepted
---
"Revive an Ally"
---
I don't have friends Bethesda why did you do this to me
---
You need so e help to transfer to a mule but it can be done. They were either lying to you or they are idiots
---
I've managed to avoid those so far.  I have one point of Concentrated Fire to target head shots when overwhelmed.  Otherwise I try to stay out of vats.  I know my choice limits the damage I can inflict, but it makes the game tense for me.  Its exciting to be a bit scared or just nervous as to how this will turn out!
---
Strangely enough, there didn't seem to be as many ghouls as what I would normally see. Everyone else on the server was low level so they probably couldn't even get to WS much less survive a nuke zone. It was good for gathering materials to stabilize flux.
---
Not to be a Debbie downer. But one of the games biggest issues was the endgame. So for players who just started playing everything is new and fresh with a world of things to do it's exciting. That's how I was at launch. Not saying you can't find your own fun. But you will hit a rough patch eventually when you've done everything and the game just gets grindy
---
The psycho and mentats ones not so much. I'll always buy grape and Berry mentats if reasonably priced ( day tripper too for ersatz grape mentats when necessary). I sell fury pretty fast when ever I put it in my vendor but I'm really cheaply priced because I play ALOT.
---
üßü‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I'll raise both hands. Been playing since beta, ran into a couple of glitches but nothing gamebreaking. Now I got another friend hooked on it. However I do sympathize with those who had real issues. I used to play Bethesda games on the ps3 so I know how unplayable they can get and I'm glad players won't take it laying down anymore.
---
Hellfire is X-03
---
We need a camp budget upgrade or else one elevator would take up 50% of the budget lol.
---
Deep pocketed mod for armour gives you +10
---
Standard pocketed mod gives you +5
---
I can confirm with players that have the Tricentienal Vault Boy Head with the tall hat that the hit box doesn‚Äôt change as I was trying to snipe the hat that was sticking over a wall in NW
---
The pitt from fallout3
---
Excavator power armor with calibrated shocks for each leg.
---
That sounds like the aura in looking for.  I have a couple questions though if you don't mind giving your feedback. Thanks.
---
- When you say that survival mode is unbalanced, what do you mean?
---
- Is your CAMP protected from PvP damage at all?  I built my CAMP in Adventure, and its is pretty visible in the forest.  Is it going to be destroyed if I move to survival?
---
Sounds like you want Survival Mode. For me, Adventure finally is what I wanted it to be from the start in order to promote community and cooperation. We're all from the same vault with the same goals in mind to reclaim and rebuild.
---
Every week. Not sure when it rolls over
---
I did buy it the first day, and it really was the buggiest game I had ever played. Once I hit the 400 stash space limit I just decided I'd come back to it later. I picked it back up when they increased stash space to 600 and it's been pretty good since, only getting better.
---
Besides the xp increase its pointless to do survival aside from getting the weapon only difference in survival is your gonna get killed by some much higher and better equipped
---
Why does everyone act now like this game hasn't improved massively and wasn't horribly unstable at launch?
---
Been here since the beta,just hit level 76.. and finally decided to check out the other side of the map
---
Dude your missin out
---
All of the scout badge's are a pain in the ass...I think I prefer Preston Garvey.
---
Jesus H. Christ this subreddit has turned into a circle jerk. I'm not saying that you your opinion doesn't matter but this has got to be the 100th post like this in just the past 48 hours that has made it to the hot section and is really starting to tick me off.
---
I use an explosive lever action and this happens frequently to me.   Just started in the last month or so I think.  It usually fixes if I exit vats and retarget the enemy.
---
Finally someone understands that battle royal is timed and it makes no difference how players play.  The game mode would be a lot duller if you take the sneaking aspect of it away.  I would say theres a perfect mix of being stealth, gorilla warfare, and engagements.
---
My team did that twice. But I don‚Äôt remember how many were killed. I wasn‚Äôt the one who launched it. When I launched we got like 6-7 ppl
---
At least do this with legendary enemies.
---
I've been getting punched in the overseer's office since the first day I got in. Like to stand in the big circular window and wave down at the unwashed masses, uselessly struggling with each other.
---
On another note I didn't start playing in the band until after I had taken all 75 of my in-vault 51 photo mode pictures for my three separate perk packs.
---
This would fit perfectly in choosing beggars
---
God damn these post are getting annoying
---
Yah I have many disconnects and instability since NW was added. I thought maybe it was overloaded servers and services from NW mode.
---
I got my 5 possum badges as soon a s I got the 3 tadpole badges so I could unlock the armor plating mod
---
Not working for me either.
---
Did one solo recently, healing factor is really nice to have for these.
---
That‚Äôs my point
---
Thank you!!!!
---
Took me 3 hours of stalking to finish that üòÇ
---
Unyielding armor with low health is the key. I have to get out of excavator power armor to carry more weight.
---
&gt;* Good way to gain caps for fast travel
---
Minimize fast travel at the beginning.  Travel once to a general area, camp somewhere centralized, and don't be afraid to make multiple jumps through your camp or 76.  Fast travel to teammates and team camps is also free.  
---
Also, set up a vendor at your camp and sell excess junk and ammo CHEAP.  Keep it "priced to move" . Higher levels will buy it sometimes cause it's quicker than fast traveling to get it themselves. 
---
&gt;* What weapons/armor should I be on the look out for while I'm leveling
---
Grab legendaries and scrap them, but hold onto the scrip till level 50.  Until you start getting legendaries, it's often cheaper to craft new weapons and armor instead of repairing them.  The choice is up to you, but Chameleon is often useful when you need to hide from something like a scorchbeast. 
---
&gt;* What materials should I tag for searching
---
Plastic, screws, springs.  So many things require those resources.  
---
&gt;* Is there any must have crafting recipes I should get and where can I find them
---
Nothing I can think of, just keep your eye out in the world for every plan.  
---
&gt;* Is there a good base spec build to follow while leveling
---
That really depends on you.  Green thumb and butchers bounty are great when you need flora or meat, respectively.  I recommend planning a build, getting at least 3 points in each special, and don't race to max out any particular Stat, because it will take you longer to get some perks if you've already maxed out a Stat below level 30 and now have to pick a perk outside of the Stat you leveled.
---
I'm with you. I find most in-game music pretty immersion-breaking. I don't walk around IRL with background music playing 24/7, why would I do so in a game situation (with, you know, all the constant peril and whatnot)?  
---
(Also, I just flat out *hate* the atom shop elevator muzak. Whoever decided to include that in the game deserves a solid kick in the sensitive bits.)
---
Excavator armor would be my suggestion, 100 extra carryweight. Throw on calibrated shocks for an additional 100. Then add the 'glitch' bonus and there's your 3rd additional 100.
---
There seems to be a glitch that when you start a session already in your excavator armor you gain an additional 100 carryweight. This only stays active while you stay in your armor, so no cooking, crafting, or repairing is available while in your armor.
---
I never tried survival so i need some help here please. 
---
In the past few days i have seen many pvp fans sentence the wish for NW gameplay in survival but as i understand it a big part of what makes NW pvp the better experience is the absence of legendary weapons. 
---
Now my question, isn't looting and optimizing gear and build not the endgame motivation in survival like it is in adventure?
---
Couldn‚Äôt you create a new character and get the easy atoms then rinse and repeat? Or are the challenges tied to your account not character?
---
Of the decade*
---
What is "placement"?
---
Really cool idea!
---
I was just at this location and didnt see it. Is it a quest spawn?
---
I really wish legendary weapons come with a users manual. I still don‚Äôt know some of that stuff work, such as a stalkers‚Äô something. It says more damage ‚Äòwhen you‚Äôre not in combat‚Äô, so how can I hit the enemy if I‚Äôm not in combat? Just be there and stalk them motionlessly and they die from my stalking? ü§Æ
---
Yes, and if your first signing in it may take a minute for that robot to load.
---
You can do them all on a new character yup
---
I believe you can buy them from a responder vendor.
---
I find it to be pretty exciting through out the whole game, I guess we agree to disagree.  Theres a well balanced mix of sneaking and fighting in NW.  I wouldn't change a thing to the general aspects of the game mode, unless there are extreme tests that give real positive results, than of course I would be willing to try it and embrace it.
---
I'm lvl 130 now, Between dailys and weeklys I can usually get one every other month. I love my nukashine armor though so I'm in no hurry to get new ones. Patience is key. Im at 1300 a.p. now though so I've got a new one coming soon!

I'm more curious about the ultracite. You can't craft ultracite fusion cores like you can plasma cores. So to me that would seem that an Ultracite GL is already prime.
---
Somewhat related, but was the first round with the Resolute Veteran glitched? Because I was able to get it in Adventure Mode, but I tried to do this week's challenges and couldn't get credit for them.
---
XO-2 Is is in the game your referring to XO-3 it's not in the game yet.
---
UGH. I had to do the first part of the quest (before DMV) twice despite checkpointing. It was really buggy for me.
---
I thought AA was fixed a few patches ago for energy weapons?
---
Ill also be purchasing fo76 after the trial, this game is so pretty. I love that you have cook, and boil water to survive
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 also trying to get this to happen.  Even with a mic and explaining it to people I can‚Äôt get anyone to do it.
---
I might be wrong then.
---
It‚Äôs a trap!
---
If you still need someone I‚Äôm in.
---
Please add platform, better odds of finding what you need. I'm on ps4 and can help if on ps4.
---
Relocate to the relative center of the map because players will have a greater chance of noticing your camp.
---
You should have competitive prices. 
---
I noticed when I moved my camp from The Mire to north-east of Whitespring and I lowered my prices below that of neighboring camps, people were more likely to visit then revisit my site.
---
Additionally, have an interesting/desired inventory. Very few but bulk cloths at 10 caps &lt; x because it is not as desirable as lead, aluminum, screws and ballistic fibers to list a few. Bethesda released the top 10 sold items on FO76 not long ago. Review it and compile data on what players are charging at other camps and sell accordingly. 
---
Think, what am I looking for when I go to other camps? Reflect on what you would pay to find what you are looking for and loosely base it on that; adjust, then adapt.
---
Thanks bro been trying all morning..
---
Only if you'd be able to help me back? üòâ i really need the revive a friend misson done also unfortunately especially when i have no friends
---
Ya, its almost like reviews are supposed to be un-biased and we used to actually pay people to be reviewers. now people want user reviews and listen to opinions from randoms online when everyone has their own tastes and preferences. So many game never get a chance because a vocal minority screams about how bad things are online.
---
I‚Äôm sorry you are right, I am on PC and I would be glad to help anyone back :)
---
make sure its within the geographic parameters the quest dictates
---
That's what being a heavy metal fan is like. Fuck the experts
---
If you sell special alcohol like lead champagne. Then yes because when we get the weekly challenge to drink alcohol 15 types I always come up sort for at least 4. So get your bar open!
---
I think they broke it last patch.  Mine doesn't work either.  Just wait until it's fixed I guess
---
Yeah this is good
---
At this point I think we have to see certain parts of 76 as non canon purely because in online games people want cool shit.
---
I seriously think for the first online fallout they shouldn‚Äôt have made any of it canon so we could have had everything. NCR vs Institute, a new Necropolis, Western BOS vs Lyons eastern BOS, Marcus‚Äô free intelligent Mutants vs Capital Wasteland Mutants, etc.

This has been driving me bananas !!  I‚Äôve been fiddling with my FOV slider hoping that would help but I can‚Äôt tell if it did.  I have bad eyesight irl though so there may not be hope for me lol.
---
They are tied to account.
---
I allow my plasma cores to run out completely before I load a new one in and all that low power stuff doesn't occur.
---
Yeah my one downer of this game is that I haven‚Äôt really made any in game friends, thought I made a few at launch but it never really panned out and we never really were on at the same time. I would like to make some in game friends that are around regularly, it would be more fun :)
---
If you can afford a computer/console that can handle playing the game, then you should be able to afford $15 for a cheap headset with a working mic.
---
Item degradation rates now compared to december definitely feel faster.
---
It was for the Nukashine quest
---
Last time I played I tried to enter Site Alpha alone at level 68. I drained over 70 stimpacks, broke 4 weapons and used all of my ammo. I was right by the end when there were like 2 assaultrons and i had a machete left. That's why I don't play this fucking game anymore.
---
Yeah, this one should also be added.
---
Pretty sure it doesn't *have* a head.
---
I'll pray for you...honk.
---
1. No it doesn't
---
2. Your personal choices aren't a factor in software design
---
I haven't even seen it pop up once this week
---
Go for it man it's easy, just take your time and make your shots count, sometimes I don't take any stims
---
Where‚Äôs xo-2?
---
It would be awesome if there was an in game host to call out events that are happening around the map.
---
The TARDIS from Doctor Who made an appearance in the original Fallout.
---
You should glance at what you have the most of and get strength cards that reduce things such as armor weights , ammo weight, med weight etc
---
Isn't time travel fallout Canon?
---
Damn that sucks, either way I don‚Äôt really need atoms because I rarely like anything in the store anyways.
---
Some people say ultracite gatling laser is a different weapon than normal GL, it‚Äôs not the primed version of GL. I‚Äôm quite confused tbh. 
---
For plasma cores it‚Äôs quite easy, you use regular cores plus flux (yellowcake?) to make ultracite core. Makes perfect sense. I hope they allow us to do this with all ultracite ammos. Thus regular ammo can be put to good use when you prime the weapons.
---
Endgame content is improving though.  We now have free range,  SBQ, imposter sheepsquatch, and arktos pharma. Wastelanders looks like it will add a bunch too, plus faction warfare so the future is bright.
---
waste of ammo defending and building it up...your just going to have to camp on resourse then move to another until your got what you need
---
Ugh, the anxiety and cold sweats your post gave me showed me that I'm totally hooked on my perks and mutations.  
---
Actually, I thought of that and I  may try it a some point.   But maybe it would be best to just start a new character.  I've always been a non-PA bloodied rifleman.  Next time I want PA and a machine gun, or maybe melee.
---
I was on a fight. Sorry... I accepted now
---
I was actually kinda surprised with it.  I like the short duration of the matches (20 mins tops) but it never feels rushed.  I also like that imo, most of the guns in fallout are all good in their own ways, so no matter what I pick up I feel like I've got a shot at doing well.    
---
Compare that to like PUBG and there's a huge variance in guns that will determine your success in the game, and the early version (I think they sped it up) had like 45 minute matches where you'd see nobody.
---
I didn't know x01 jetpack plans where available as a drop? I paid 5600 caps for my plans from the enclave vendor, and about the same for the calibrated shocks and reactive plates plans. 
---
I figured that some guys, especially newer players might not want to spend  that amount of caps on plans and then get the flux to craft when they could get all they want for 6000 caps. 
---
However if they are found in the game world via drops then maybe my power armor vendor shop plans are maybe not the best lol
---
Still need help. I‚Äôm online right now
---
Don't choke on Bethesda's dick too much
---
They say cars on fire they just explode a bit afterwards.
---
Oh it can be, I crouched outside a cabin in the bushes yesterday while everyone killed each other inside. It was hilarious even before I threw a plasma mine in the window while they were tussling by the door.
---
There's actually a perk card that let's you jump 300% higher its called frog legs and I guess its the same as marsupial.
---
I'm on PC and can do those shocks for you if you need them.  IGN is same as here.
---
Hey I‚Äôm on now if there‚Äôs a chance you are

I was mostly talking about early game enemies. I also think the late game AI's are pretty dangerous, especially with their ranged attacks, but the ghouls and hounds are pretty much just moving containers and can be easily dispatched with melee. Though some more variety would also be really cool, like Honey beasts or Yao guai.
---
It shouldn't be way more.  There should be exp for player damage though.  It would take some thought to balance it correctly, but I'm sure it could be done.  I still believe you should gain most of the exp from surviving and winning.
---
So than you would get some player dmg exp on top of your kills and downs.  Tbh I'm fine with how it is atm, but I wouldn't be against it to reward the players who done a shit ton of player dmg with a little extra icing.
---
I purchased it once so i demand 1/3 atoms of whatever this guy gets
---
Easily FFR, the other 2 don't compete
---
I never start the event anymore, since nobody is notified. Other players probably feel the same way.

No I'm on pc.

I rarely get diconnected these days and its usually if a ton of corpses appear. Wastelanders will add fun stuff but its a good few months away. For now we will.make it through nuclear winter.

I like to strip my clothes off and punch people in the crotch.  Is this better or worse than playing in the band?

People who let other people decide if a game is right for them is in my honest opinion fucking stupid, but the game if you don‚Äôt like it return it fucking simple

Do you use adrenaline in your build?
---
Got mine last night and it worked just fine, getting a computer generated code that doesn't work has always be a possibility with games, all I can vouch for is my code worked.
---
If that did happen I'm sure one call to customer service would have it fixed asap
---
Just all of them...
---
Apparently people here would rather make up criticisms than actually play and decide for themselves. I've said it before, fuck this sub.
---
Dude, I couldn't agree more. I'm much more interested in getting games everyone is actively shitting on now. They said Assassin's Creed Unity with its buggy launch was horrible, but it turned out to be my favorite. While Fallout 76 isn't my favorite, it's much more fun than I thought it would be.
---
It would not be the first time in this game something was retconned
---
better just sell them to the bots, but i keep disease cures in mine for 9c just in the case someone needs some sometimes i sell 3 or 4. I have had antibiotics in there for as low as 20c and never sold any, they are very expense to make so I gave up. I did see a vender set up as a drug store it was very cool so I purchased some stuff from her just to do help out.

Marsupial doesn‚Äôt exist in NW.

I don‚Äôt understand your comment on trusting the public with the quality of games. The public was incredibly correct with the game being a pile of trash. You can‚Äôt say they were wrong after the game received a thousand upgrades, it was shit, now it‚Äôs better. That initial comment just annoyed me. I agree that it‚Äôs doing better now, although I still run in to issues that make me want to not play but it‚Äôs getting there. NPCs will bring me back for a while.
---
Fuck no
---
You can get them all over, save them caps. :)
---
my suggestion would be to ry a roleplay
---
after all its an rpg
---
i know its quite a step to take but if you make a character that cares mor for looks and not just stats you can feel another playstyle really improving your experience
---
for example 
---
put together a set of armor that looks like its from a faction or whatever and go with that also use a fun weapon that just isnt the best choice usually like a submachine gun or something
---
once you have a full set of equipment you can make it your mission to slowly get a legendary version of that armor
---
As someone who actively avoided this game due to all the bad press, I ended up only trying it out because of a post like this and am very glad I did.
---
Why the fuck did I read all this garbage üòÇ
---
Message other people, also try and sell stuff away from vault 76. As a higher level player nothing grinds my gears more than traveling to someone's base because they are selling 15 weapons only for them to all be level 1 items
---
Really? Dupers really suck.
---
True. But I‚Äôm pretty sure they aren‚Äôt visible to anyone except your team. I‚Äôve never seen any other signals, and I give signals all the time if I‚Äôm paired with randoms (and no sign that anyone else saw it/rushed my spot)

In Fallout 4 i roleplayed a Institute agent who infiltrated and took control over the Nuka World Raiders to use them as a cheap army to control and destabilize the surface and do surface missions without leaving a trace to the institute.

I think of doing the same here with MODUS and the Enclave.
---
Well I don‚Äôt have the $60 to just have a trial. I can spend $30 on a game that I know I‚Äôll like. I buy my games digitally, you cant return a digital game more than once. So I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs that simple.

They wouldn‚Äôt dare take my 54 levels from me! I like my Gladiator Helmet

It needs some serious tuning as well.

Heavy RPG with choice and consequences, in depth quests, companions, factions, deciding the fate of regions, building up settlements, exploring and learning lore of pre-war, supernatural/extraterrestrial/sci-fi touches along the way, dealing in background themes about excessive inequality and late capitalism and jingoism that lead to the downfall of the old world. 
---
That's pretty much Fallout to me.  It isn't BR, PvP, shooter looters, imho. I am hoping Wastelanders provides a lot of balm to the RPG side of things.
---
So, uh, Pharma. 
---
I got my girlfriend to get the game, we started playing together. Both level 5-ish. We found a terminal near the Overseer‚Äôs camp that directed us toward the Arktos basement.
---
HOLY SHIT. We got fucking massacred. We were hiding on top of crates, screaming over voice chat as we fired our pipe guns at fucking level 50 ghouls. That all fell apart when freaking assaultrons started firing Gatling lasers and shit at us.
---
My girlfriend hid in the elevator, I was separated on the far side of the basement. Had to run through the hellscape, get her to reopen the elevator, and shut it through the gunfire and swarms of ghouls.

11/10, incredible quest, will definitely return in 50 levels

I love how it gives my adventure character caps and experience. It's a slow process to get 100 caps in adventure for me, but I earned 300 caps in NW.

try going there in survival mode, much lower chance that someone was there to clear it before you, there are about 16-ish straight jackets, most in the right hand wing and 3-4 in the brotherhood wing
---
Thank you as well, I will be in game later tonight
---
Actually in the process of grabbing them all so I can have a loadout slot devoted to them.
---
You do need the recipe. I think the vendor in whitesprings might have it. It's definitely worth the extra trouble if you have the recipe. Also, if you need gourds to plant they're in Raleigh Clay's bunker in the free states.
---
I see your point, trust me I really do but at some point there needs to be some moderation on the quantity on this sub
---
Pc here not working just keeps talking.
---
Yes, I'd be in favour of an emote wheel specifically for Nuclear Winter with 'emotes' like you suggested. They also need little to no animation so that they trigger very quickly.
---
Well I didn‚Äôt mean public just at release, even months after that and recently. I was hearing that the game was abandoned and what not. That‚Äôs why I won‚Äôt be trusting the public as much, but rather pay more attention to the players here now. Obviously it‚Äôs not abandoned.
---
Same here! I had a similar experience with pubg and Fo4
---
Work on your camp. I love building mine. There's some suns just devoted to that.
---
Maybe it's something about my smell or just the crew that I hang out with (almost no one) but I run into legendary sheepsquatchs daily. My hvy Gunner or my melee just have to be in PA and have 3 or 4 stims. My pistol packing mamma has to crit constantly for like 7min to finish one.
---
I just bought the game too because of the free trial. It‚Äôs 14 bucks on Walmart rn.
---
Don't you need pharmacist or something in your perk card load out?
---
If you‚Äôre heavy gunner with a good weapon you can solo it. No you don‚Äôt need all three pets to stay alive to get three star loot from the boss.
---
Did my first at level 50, wasn‚Äôt too easy.
---
Bethesda retcons the Fallout lore so many damn times, who honestly even knows.
---
I haven‚Äôt found a sweet spot.  Junkie builds aren‚Äôt common, so it‚Äôs very hit and miss.  
---
Red Ant Lager does sell, though.
---
At this point they probably just don‚Äôt care but still I really would like my account for a game that I bought a cheap nylon trash bag for
---
people jumped on the hate bandwagon on day 1 and never let up, the game is great and has been since the beta.
---
Best...post...ever.
---
Yeap. Something like that.
---
I contacted support over 2 weeks ago,nothing yet.
---
Don't be sorry, I might have been a bit to assertive but this was just sort of the boiling point for me
---
I have trouble finding scorched in grass so I welcome a perk card that highlights dead bodies.
---
I dream my demise will be like that in real life!
---
Must have mistaken you for a radroach.
---
nvm yeah I'm wrong I thought they had added it with the last update.
---
I aldo experienced this with the lock pick challenge. Pick 3 locks in NW. Picked them and it never registered
---
I think all they did was add in a skin
---
Sounds like a good time! Im level 130 and still haven't beaten that one, mainly cause my main weapon is a tse minigun so I tend to blow up the things im supposed to protect. Good luck!
---
Depends on your desired customers and stock i personally park near vault 101 to ease the burden of traveling costs for noob to avg player lvls selling ammo cheap junk meds plans etc no weapons or armor though. Somewhere near like the legendary vendor would imo get the most high lvl peeps maybe even looking for some cheap legendaries for the last push for scrip
---
It was definitely rough at launch. There were many times the game was completely unplayable. I still get CTDs quite often, which is ridiculous. But it's gotten so much better
---
Same way you did in PC one would presume.
---
pretty reflective of reality...
---
Lol bro they are just hyped. Guess what? I bought this game after playing 5 days of the trail.
---
Hay if that's what Fallout is to you then more power to you. I to hope Wastelanders deliver some needed RPG elements to 76.
---
Yep I've had the same issue of the camera just not working, sometimes took up to 10 minutes for it to start working again
---
It‚Äôs extremely unbalanced with how overpowered many players are, players either one shot each other or you can‚Äôt do any damage to them, I run a melee build, doing about maximum 2000 damage but average 1400 a hit, when fighting players some I will kill instantly but other I can hit over and over again and it‚Äôs like the slap damage that used to be in adventure, this is a result of poor balancing of legendary weapons and armour, mutations, and perk cards.
---
Your camp can be freely destroyed in survival, but can be instantly repaired with the click of a button, if you have a vendor in your camp you will want to disable it before going into survival so people can‚Äôt see it on the map
---
i disconnect about one or two times a day normally just after i get into the game for the 1st time after that it seems fine. PC
---
So... you want to play adventure, but want the higher XP given in survival.
---
Yeah, they're pretty useless, sadly.
---
Not sure exactly where on the map, but there's an overturned orange lorry trailer up against some rocks in a slight cravass. If you walk from above (easily done), you slide down the side between the rocks and are stuck floating between the rocks and the trailer. I saw a teammate do this earlier, and in attempting to get him out managed to do the same. 
---
In short, area of the map where you can accidentally get stuck, easily replicated.
---
Releasing a very broken game after the false pretenses of a ‚Äúbeta‚Äù isn‚Äôt unlucky.
---
Blatant false advertising of the collectors edition isn‚Äôt unlucky.
---
Giving canvas bags to influencers but not to please who paid a premium isn‚Äôt unlucky.
---
I‚Äôm very much enjoying 76, I dig NW and look forward to where it‚Äôs going. But to call all the fuck ups around this game unlucky is just plain wrong, they got arrogant like all companies do when they get to a certain size and thought they could get away with it.
---
Yep. It's cool to hate Bethesda now. Apparently their conference was the worst even though they unveiled 3+ sick games.
---
Who are you and why are you so angry? The level of entitlement you have is mind bending. For anyone reading my comment; please continue to express your thoughts and feelings toward the game and ignore this sanctimonious drivel
---
I need that Shi Missile Launcher Skin so freaking bad, I have been spastically waiting for a Chinese themed skin to go with my main character. Just 39 more levels to go lol, now I'll just need Chinese Scout Armor, Power Armor and Handmade Rifle skins.
---
No it can't, it's part of the weekly weapon challenge for the shotgun Salt of the Earth, that specific challenge has to be done in survival
---
Every time I see this sort of thing I'm reminded how this game is playing out exactly like an accelerated version of how ESO went.
---
thanks!
---
I used to run a carry weight build, with all weight saving perks you don‚Äôt need extra carry weight. The only items that don‚Äôt have a weight reduction perk are rifles. If you still need more, run an excavator with two shocks and assist-servo. Or if you don‚Äôt like PA, mod all your armors with deep pockets.
---
I saw on a separate article the other day that it's broken but is supposed to be fixed during the next patch.
---
I always feel bad for developers who put a lot of heart and work into the games they make, then day one the only feed back you hear is how horrible it is.
---
I just stated playing. I'm on pc and playing solo so far just hit level 11 I believe.
---
I was wanted when I first played for picking up wood at an owned camp.. It looked like any other random resource to me.
---
thats all you need to do,  generally pc players sell all ballistic ammo types for 1c.
---
Spices in quotes haha.
---
Like a premium channel?  That's actually not a bad idea, it's a cosmetic only change and would help keep the servers running.
---
Huh, guess I got bad luck then.
---
bulk and sell,  maintaining ones stash is the most challenging thing in the game and that is no joke
---
Thanks for the Help!
---
Hey the three second rule can apply for quite a while if you use division
---
You can get legendary items without using that much ammo anywhere else though. The whole point of doing the event is to get the rewards specific to it.
---
The Mire is like right fucking next to the Capital Wasteland and I am really hoping for a DLC that shows us a 2102 Capital Wasteland.
---
I don‚Äôt think people realise how big of a fuckup No Mans Sky was.
---
They literally lied about 90% of the features and release day was the first anyone found out about it.
---
76 had a shitty launch, combined with all the canvas bag, data breach and rum top memes it‚Äôs up there for #2, but I don‚Äôt think NMS can ever be dethroned!
---
I‚Äôm still waiting to hear uranium fever....
---
Bullshit. üòä
---
just look in all the nuka machines. you'll find plenty of them for free.
---
Great Idea! Could build my Camp to be a Bar that sells Chems as well!
---
I had a problem with my first Xbox One and ended up deleting my game because I thought it was corrupted. Instead it turned out to be my Xbox lol. I've been around since beta my first go-round I was level 101 and this go round I'm level 31. Every time I play I wish I hadn't jumped the gun can you erase my imaginarily corrupted game
---
B L U E G R A S S
---
Bathroom stalls with "put a mark here if Turtle is the coolest technician 3rd class in the vault" aren't official votes
---
me too
---
Buddy, you bought the game. So did the rest of us.
---
Does that mean we should all grt free atoms?
---
What about all of the people who bought the 100 different versions of Skyrim? Where is their reward?
---
We already get free DLC. How much more greedy can you be?
---
That's interesting. I seem to run into quite a few people on PS4 who overcharge for shotgun ammo, and I'm left frustrated after traveling around the whole map to get no shotgun ammo.
---
Nvm didn't fixed
---
Bethesda is the new Ubisoft. Ubisoft got a TON of hate around the time Assassin's Creed Unity came out, which was well deserved. But it continued for quite a bit, even when they were putting out decent games again. Thankfully it has calmed down a bit since Origins and Odyssey came out.  
---
Every company goes through rough patches. It will happen to CD Projekt Red one day, too.
---
Yes the event rewards is the only thing specific to it, otherwise you can farm WS, no ammo needed. Ghouls just die to my axe‚Äôs awesomeness
---
Well not x01 thats still vendor only but all the others drop from the queen and are going fairly cheap. 
---
If your dealing in specifically x01 parts then it might be possible but only drawback there is also catering to a lower base of players since most ive met ask me why i waste my time in x01 since xxxx what have you is better for xxxx reason.. 
---
Personally i just think the x01 looks cool and never wear it unless going into a nuke zone so stats dont bother me.
---
I'm getting the sense that most of the people that play NW don't have experience with other BR games. I understand wanting XP, but hiding the entire game is bogus as hell. I know the game is about survival, but trust me the real exhilaration is getting kills and being a part of fast paced action. You will not have fun hiding for an entire game.
---
You have to physically leave the game screen to do this, no different to alt-tabbing out of a game screen to use discord or similar.
---
He's voiced by someone named Brett Elliott. No other credits on imdb, aside from Roger Maxson.
---
That's odd, I'm on ps4 and had a few thousand shells at 1 cap for like a month and never sold üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Not sure if i have any still, I'll have to check and get back to you if i do.
---
I have 1800 for 1 cap each on ps4
---
Not almost like, it is.
---
Just spend some time off Reddit bro
---
I just waited for a very long time
---
No you cannot. The only challenges not tied to your account are ones that don‚Äôt reward atoms- the pioneer scout ones, the level up ones, the nuclear winter ones.
---
I think you also need to have wasteland whisper equipped, and it‚Äôs not guaranteed to give you the option to do so.
---
Winter. Winter never changes. 
---
Wait....
---
It‚Äôs staying.
---
Did they add ring of Fire? If not they should
---
Course i dont know with x01 parts id think youd have to price it same or cheaper than what you could buy the mods for and its been forever since i looked for shocks or jetpack so i dont know if your 6k price is fair..
---
That's weird, pretty sure our explosive weapons don't hurt the animals we protect
---
The only one i have noticed is the beam splitter for laser rifles. It hits 4x so things break super fast. But its broke cause it shows only one laser worth of damage.
---
I have over 2500 rounds in my stash. And I constantly toss extra out
---
It‚Äôs the most common Ammo I run across at top of the world
---
GoTo mole men spawns they almost always have shotgun ammo
---
Just make sure you use VATS and headshots on them
---
Actually he wasnt, it was the zax computer pretending to be stanlius brown
---
High health. Those bloody builds give me anxiety lol
---
Also the full build out 100+ levels with IE, BE or AAE weapons hunting low levels at starting zone. What would be amazing is no VATS(at least for PvP) and disabled legendary effects in Survival.
---
Thanks for reminding me to play through Unity again when they were giving it out for free. I forgot I had it installed.  
---
Ubisoft is the perfect analogy to what Bethesda is going through right now. Ubisoft messed up the launch of Unity BIG TIME. But they fixed the game over time and treated later releases better. After Syndicate, they took a year off for Origins and have done so again after Odyssey. No AC in 2019, but we'll probably get one next year. Ubisoft thankfully learned a valuable lesson with Unity, and it made them better as a company, I think.
---
Bethesda is going through the same right now, and I'd be willing to bet they're taking their sweet time with Starfield and TES 6. They'll bounce back.
---
Once you start the quests you'll probably learn why people told you to stay away; the quest structures in this game are horrible and incredibly boring. So long as you don't care about questlines, choices, interactions with NPCs, or the general MMO-ness of the game you'll probably be fine with the current state of FO76. If you care about questlines, NPCs, etc, then maybe the Wastelanders update will fix those problems for you.
---
Cool thanks for sharing, is it a lot of fetch type quests?
---
I‚Äôd rather these than 10 million NW posts burying everything else.
---
I think it's cheaper to buy the game while the trial's still ongoing. Something to keep in mind.
---
What are ammo places? I‚Äôm level 70 and can‚Äôt afford to keep hunting lead for 45s.
---
Every new person I met in survival tried to kill me. One of them succeeded, so I went back and mutilated him. (I was on a terminal and he promised he wouldnt kill me)
---
Oh wait is it? Does the 50% sale end on Monday?
---
I have it maxed out and equipped but it doesnt give me the option to pacify on randomly spawned deathclaws.
---
i am asking for xp yes. so i can get this over with and go back to what i like to do.
---
If your build is good enough, you can put out super good dps at level 25 with a stealth commando build, I was melting Mutants and players at 25. I started my character In survival and got all of his perks this way. Then I grinded West Tek for about 110 levels...
---
So like a lot of the time I talk in game I get called the N-word, when my friend whose a woman talks she gets creeped on, I have a deaf friend as well. Maybe add these options for a accessibility options and maybe just not be an contrarion asshole for no reason?
---
That analogy does not bode well considering many people are angry with Ubisoft's new direction with Assassin's creed..
---
While I'm in the same boat as you, I have to temper the optimism with the frustration that comes from the "patch/update redemption arc" becoming a progressively more common strategy- Sea of Thieves, 76, No Man's Sky, etc.
---
There's no good reasoning as to why these see the market missing polish, features, and functionality beyond the company's ability to capitalize on the most profitable potential release window. Then, should the profitability allow, they invest in finalizing the game, or as they- and many dedicated fans- would prefer to put it, "upgrading" it.
---
While I'd rather they go this route than abandon it, and I have been having a pretty damn fun time, I still, in ways, feel like I'm playing a broken game. To what measure this is owed to the game experience versus its reputation is hard to quantify as of now, though.
---
Hello, and welcome
---
Pretty much this, you need both perks rank 3 equipped to tame Deathclaws from now on.
---
Any sort of wave defense for high level characters would be fun. Like serious waves with tons of high level enemies that make it challenging even for the best equipped players.
---
And... how do you mark the location of their camp? Are you telling me griefers are dumb enough to leave their vendors active?
---
You said you have 4 base charisma you would need 6,..3 for wasteland whisper and 3 for animal tamer.
---
That's fabulous. I'm always in need of the stuff. Let me know if you ever plan to just... Toss some out üòõ I'd happily reimburse you.
---
lies and slander!! you will be hearing from my lawyers "handy bot , handy bot and nanny bot !"
---
have stayed with old 76 
---
but the dammed server disconnects 
---
make me want to quit
---
This. Some are account based, some are character based.
---
What is TSE? I keep hearing that. Sorry noob here
---
all I know is I'm not giving you mouth to mouth if you keep eating things off the floor !!
---
Could you be getting shot with a radium rifle?
---
‚úãÔ∏è
---
PC player. LordVulpius is my name.
---
Text chat in eso very good
---
Maybe I don't want to wake my boyfriend up at 2 am by talking? Or maybe I don't like talking in general.
---
remember 200lbs stash? those were the days.
---
Doesn't work for me either.
---
True.  And it still hasn't been fixed.
---
Nothing wrong with putting the FULL list out there, again (at the TOP of the conversation pile), so that it is clear that the players of the game still notice and still want it fixed (and so it doesn't yet again get shuffled under the rug as though it wasn't there at all).
---
Considering it IS the players that saved the game with their loyalty and desire to create a community, it might be nice if Bethesda gave that community the fixes they deserve.  
---
The FREE week was NOT a reward for the players that have been playing.  That was for players that stayed away due to the game's well known and acknowledged failures out of the chute.
---
Just so you know, if you actually like the game, you might enjoy r/fo76filthycasuals better than this sub, as that sub is mostly positive, and this one is often negative
---
Yes on pc
---
Pretty sure that your AAE mini gun is actually slightly more effective in terms of damage dealing. In essence the extra armor it penetrates makes up for the seeming lack of damage it does. All that being said , it is only like a 3% difference.
---
they changed the way taming works a couple patches back
---
you need to be right next to the deathclaw and press E, aiming your weapon no longer gives the prompt
---
pacify is given from aiming, tame from proximity like a locked door or safe
---
My dream would be to have npc‚Äôs come into the game, fix up the railroads then have it link DC, PA, Boston over the course of a couple full scale expansions and we get to see the world building before Fo 3/4 era‚Äôs. Since those places existed before we see them in 3 and 4.
---
Time travel is a no for me though.
---
Great response so it's staying live. Keep in mind it is still a pre-beta test.
---
Well thats not how battle royals work man they actually only give you xp for kills so I suggest you group up or find a method that'll work for you
---
Fallout isn't just a battle Royal lol
---
I sell all my ammo for 1 cap and I'm on xbox
---
Lol! Ya sounds like the radium rifle bud.
---
I‚Äôd like to see something like the opposite of berry(or is it grape?) mentats that highlights living
---
Might I suggest dropping by r/fo76filthycasuals as well. Great group over there too.
---
I thought you're supposed to get killed in 2 shots minimum tho how can it kill you in one hit? Is it because the electricity causes multiple hits at once? I'm not complaining about getting one shot, it's that my black powder rifle can't even tho it's capable with the damage, it's just one hit tho so it can't one shot people. That has nothing to do with defense that's just a game mechanic that doesn't work right
---
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand your comment‚Äù
---
‚ÄúYou can‚Äôt say they were wrong‚Äù
---
‚ÄúIt was shit‚Äù
---
‚ÄúThat initial comment just annoyed me.‚Äù
---
These do not make the basis of a good dialogue, and are really a personal issue.
---
Plus they give you do for surviving jist hide somewhere lol
---
Yes ofc that makes sense to do firstly!
---
For sure... just spent 20 mins talking to a new player.  Answering his questions.    =)
---
Nothing wrong with putting it back on the TOP of the conversation pile so it doesn't get shuffled under the rug like it doesn't exist.
---
Or are you saying you are completely happy that it hasn't been fixed yet?
---
It's kind of good for both, at least right now. It's definitely an easy cash cow for devs, but as long as gamers want the product we'll be receiving BR modes faster than most other game types. I'm guessing in a few years the fad will pass and devs will still be trying to jump on the bandwagon, but for now it's nice to have something that's quick and easy to produce.
---
Uh. 
---
About that.
---
It‚Äôs been a month since you‚Äôve seen a player with a bounty because it‚Äôs been about a month since they patched it so literally the only way to GET a bounty is by lockpicking an owned lock.
---
We didn‚Äôt do this. The Devs did. I‚Äôm not offering judgement on either side of this discussion, just clarifying facts.
---
Nearly every single quest is "Listen to this dead person's holotape and then go do some trivial task that they liked", or "Read this dead person's terminal and then go do some trivial task that they liked". There are nearly no quests where doing the quest would feasibly *matter* to the game world.
---
You're doing things that in the game world's fiction someone else already did rather than doing anything new, and since literally everyone is dead nothing matters.
---
This is the truth. Luckily I‚Äôm one of those players that likes to just wander around and make my own fun.
---
I just wasn‚Äôt sure how the percentages stacked. I‚Äôve been away from this game a while üòÇ
---
Welcome home my child
---
I wish bugs were a higher priority..
---
I hope you two found each other, but if not I'll be one for another couple hours. :p
---
Welcome! The game is 50% off at the moment, so be sure to grab the deal.
---
You're correct. Lone Wanderer adds to ActionPointsRateMult, at least in the current version. I probably missed it because it uses the same spell as Action Boy.
---
Radium Rifle
---
Also I can't really one shot things that easily I'm not Bloodied or anything just a basic crit build. My crits can one shot but otherwise I'm kinda squishy, still other weapons can only two shot me whereas Tesla rifle and explosive shotguns can one shot me
---
If they existed in Fo4 it shouldn‚Äôt be to hard for them to add them in 76
---
Add me if you like, I'm quite low level but always looking for new friends! My username is microwavedregret :)
---
Being bothered by people sharing that they are enjoying something is really a personal problem that you should consider working on.
---
It is an essential if you are going for a full heavy weapons build, especially if you are using a laser Gatling. Stabilized/power user makes such a difference.
---
Also, PA (especially T60) is incredibly easy to maintain and keep running.
---
It‚Äôs the radium rifle for sure, it does radiation damage and ballistic damage and is a fantastic PvP weapon because the enemy can spam stimpacks all they want but if they are out of RadAway they‚Äôre going down. I always pick one up if I see it.
---
It will stay as long as you own the game!
---
I basically ended up becoming a sniper build. I'm kind of thinking of starting over to get a better start, but I don't want to lose out on all of the plans I found. I like being a sniper, but I feel it's going to take some time to get my character how I want him to be built. I'll try West-Tek then since I've seen that a lot.
---
I would use my mic if the battery hadn‚Äôt broke &gt;:(
---
I got a 30% schorched damage explosive vats fills quicker 15% 10 mm sub machine been trying to get all commandos and explosive perks I was also melee it‚Äôs pretty fun
---
Server wide voice chat is not good
---
It's just  been the past few days with the free trial. Ya'd think people would be happy than more people are playing. Ignore that dink.
---
Power armor? Sure, if you want to lose every player vs player encounter.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right. And that would be a priority before expanding to other areas ofc. 
---
That‚Äôs what I meant with time-travel of some sort or maybe an ‚Äòsimulation‚Äô that could make us see and play in the future
---
I'm not arguing hypothetical situations. I know damn well the people wanting text chat overwhelmingly consists of people that just don't want to be bothered to use there voice to communicate. And I know fully well there are people who are deaf or can't speak or whatever other issue that prevents speaking.
---
Watch all the wonderful posts about a fun interaction with others turn into people complaining because someone is spamming the chat, someone is being racist, someone swearing excessively and acting like a complete jackass to everyone. Because that's the behavior text chat is going to make very easy to do like it is in other online games.
---
And despite what some might think, this DOES impact how the game will play and I don't give a shit if I sit in the negatives for saying that. As much as it sucks we can't fucking accommodate everybody's problems.
---
These are the people who likely won‚Äôt buy the game after this week thinking the free trial will continue so I think most of em will be gone ;)
---
Its just above the lumber yard, has like a little wooden plank bridge with a small rowboat nearby?
---
 Straight down from moonshiners shack and above the lumberyard theres 2 ponds like it
---
Pc pro knows everything over us console peasants. Just say pc gets hacked more and go. Consoles have stricter policies now, I haven‚Äôt played a hacker in ages
---
send a copy. $30 is too much for south america. I wish they would sell for that price here
---
Thanks! When does that sale end, does it end with the trial?
---
Some of us have to do it manually....7 cards Everytime I get to camp just for crafting...only noobs use weight reduction perks ( I keep 4 active lol.  I apparently hoard food, drugs and grenades and bandolier is too valuable)
---
Yeah, the Tweaked Automatic Receiver is missing WeaponTypeAutomatic, which is what switches between Rifleman/Commando and Gunslinger/Guerrilla. The other automatic receivers for the pipe gun are all correct.
---
Funny, our team ran into a guy with a Tesla, we ended him and left it on his corpse. And we were a pug team, thrown together in the vault. 
---
The guy I didn‚Äôt understand had an assault rifle and just murdered all of us while it felt like we could barely touch him. Seriously I tagged him with 3-4 shots in a row and didn‚Äôt do much; he ended me and a teammate like 5 times total in a second long burst each (we were right next to cover with another teammate at another angle, so one of us would get downed on the edge of cover, the other would revive while the third kept him from getting too greedy, but he still kept charging up the hill until he broke our cover). I didn‚Äôt understand that at all. It was like facing off against Rambo or some shit.

Agreed. I don't even play with PA but have accumulated all the BOS paints thru technical data grinding and would love to make a big display in my camp.
---
That‚Äôs not a bad thought!
---
I like it. 
---
Well with time-travel it could also be some sort of simulation you know. I was told there‚Äôs already an time machine in the game that‚Äôs not functioning actually
---
I know, and I have no issue with requesting a wanted feature because you want it,  but I just thought I'd try to frame it properly in that not all BR have text chat :)
---
Might be this one if I remember it right. It was fairly big though.
---
Just getting back into this thread...has it gotten better?
---
Please add Bethesda!!!!!!!!!!
---
Sometimes I use it, sometimes I don't.
---
Events. Workshops. Workshop defense. Main quest. Wash rinse repeat.
---
Drugs and bullets for me, I just can't not have a ton lol
---
I wasn't aware that Stabilized was a possible card in NW. I guess that's a silver lining (though unstoppable is certainly an overstatement)
---
Its like we never joined each other‚Äôs team in the first place. Every once in a while it will go through, but when I press accept invite, nothing will happen and it shows on his screen that I declined his invite.
---
Thanks for the response! But dang, looks like I need to grind myself a piece of ap refresh now haha
---
Or new character in survival only
---
I'm excited to see newbies excited about the game. We need fresh blood.
---
I actually loved that quest
---
I‚Äôd go with Fandom. It seems like an actual wiki. The others I looked at looked mostly like data-scrapes from the .esm files, and were sparse.
---
I think that'd be sweet.
---
Like how there's different versions of guns and armor, there could be t45 with [mod], t51 with [different mod] and t60 with [third mod].
---
Two Shot Exploading. Gun fires two bullets per bullet and they expload on impact. 
---
They among many different legendary weapon traits.
---
The youtubers selfishly denied you this game for their own profit.
---
Seriously dude, chill the fuck out. 
---
You would rather see a dozen posts about server crashes, glitched SBQ fights and dupers? GTFO and go have a snickers or something.
---
Ayy those noobs are my valued customers so adorable stumbling in . i just felt bad this one lvl 2 guy came in to buy like 10 rounds of ammo and 1 stimpack i imagine it was all the caps he had
---
I just did the exact same switch I‚Äôm down to play as well I‚Äôm only Lvl 18 at the moment
---
The combat update/nuclear Winter update stabilized the game drastically. I‚Äôm very impressed and glad that the development team has improved this game from a very rocky and at times broken game at launch to a solid entry in the Fallout franchise.
---
Tse pipe revolvers are worth a fortune. You got yourself a gem bro
---
Two-Shot Explosive legendary gun. It's any 2-star or 3-star legendary gun that spawns with those 2 attributes. Widely considered some of the best guns in the game, along with Bloodied weapons, and Instigating weapons.
---
That's crazy, I assume that's the most powerful trait then?
---
I got one from the purveyor, changed it into a TSE pipe revolver rifle and with both rifleman an gunslinger perks the damage goes up to over 600
---
The most broken, unfair and almost always duped weapon.
---
Tse stands for "two shot explosive" which are legendary effects that cause each shot to fire an extra projectile AND deal aoe explosive damage.
---
It pretty much ruins the end game meta on the basis of lack of variety. It also ensures that whoever has one will get all the kill exp before anyone else has a chance to shoot.
---
At one time, people were literally paying $$$ on eBay for them from other players who duped their original one numerous times.
---
Bethesda has since at least dealt with the duping issues, but the op nature of the Tse weapons still wrecks any other gun in terms of damage potential.
---
I'm level 153 and I've never seen a legit one. I've gotten explosive weapons and I've got two shot weapons but never both at once. So they are incredibly rare in the wild.
---
I was thinking about her getting it soon, the only thing that is stopping me from getting it is that it's multiplayer, do you get many toxic players while playing or is everyone nice enough?
---
Could be epic indeed
---
I think what you need is a break from reading posts. Everyone has a right to their opinion. If you're having a bad day please try not to express it here.
---
My forest camo tuxedo finally comes in handy
---
That‚Äôs what I mean. Great idea as well
---
It just (doesn't) work.
---
BETA user has spoken, everyone better never say they like the game ever again.
---
probably the player icon with the medium crate drawing
---
No, there's a separate prime receiver (capacitor?) for the ultracite gatling laser. You can craft ultracite fusion cores as long as you've learnt the prime receiver for one of the two gatling lasers, but they're only used in primed weapons.
---
As far as I can tell, Ultracite gatling lasers also deal no additional damage to scorched. They're just a slightly different weapon to the normal gatling laser.
---
Yeah...but the game wouldn‚Äôt really progress at a required pace by shrinking the game map and forcing players to move and fight
---
Some kind of merchant event would be awesome with that as reward for highest ranked daily or something
---
When you fast travel, pretend you are in Vertibot, during the loading screen. Pretend everyone is saying "look at that cool guy in the veribot".
---
Bethesda, can you replace the fast travel loading screen with a veribot animation, with the sounds of people yelling "look at that cool guy in the vertibot"?
---
I think I deserve a handjob from 1980-era Christie Brinkley.
---
I believe so. It just says ‚Äúlimited time.‚Äù If you‚Äôre planning on buying it, I wouldn‚Äôt delay since there‚Äôs no benefit to waiting at this point.
---
No problem fellow merchant!
---
There are two different laser vats...regular and ultracite...you can prime either of them
---
Last one on team completely surrounded all sides ,  pulls out 50 cal shoots all of them.... of course I didn't dropped  a nuke on myself and kills everything
---
Once I pick up a turret kit I'll select it and go like I'm going to put it down but will instead run around till i spot someone or I get attacked then immediately place the turret down and run to cover while they get hammered a stream of surprise bullets
---
&gt; Ok. Is EVERY player in that game going to be able to get a crossbow or a good melee weapon before they get picked off?
---
Probably they will, yeah. Whether they're smart enough to do it is another story. A lot of players just drop into common spots and try to fist fight. I've spawned inside a group of 8 people. It gives you enough invincibility time to get out of dodge. Melee weapons are literally everywhere. You don't need a good one to start since bigger mobs don't spawn early.
---
It does sound a bit much. What kind of advice would you give a level 15 in terms of best things to do, such as getting specific plans or loot? There seems to be a lot to this game and I would like to be efficient.
---
To be fair though, NMS did eventually fix all the bugs and added all the Promised content. It just took them 3 years.
---
I am super hyped about the vr mode update though.
---
I have a bunch of sounds and  I load them in sResourceArchive2List just fine.
---
However if the ones you refer to need to override the startup preload the only way to do it is... well... repacking the vanilla ba2 containers with them.
---
That's how we are loading the custom fonts required for the icon sorting tags to work.
---
Hopefully - as long as we keep it 'vanilla' for BR - they won't consider this as 'hostile' and they won't swing around the banhammer.
---
We'll see...
---
I'm on.
---
Upvote for this. I‚Äôd like to clarify that the extremely high resistances is more than the listed numbers. There‚Äôs hidden % reductions for damage and rads, per piece, totaling up to like 45% damage reduction and... 90%? Rad reduction with a full set. 
---
Also I believe it only boosts you to 10 str in FO76. 
---
He also didn‚Äôt mention the helmet mods- recon HUD and targeting HUD are both amazing (the former is like a recon scope built into the helmet, but only available on the X-01; the latter is on most(all?) and highlights all living enemies (and sometimes neutrals) with a red glow. Very very very useful.
---
How?
---
Go with the burrows then, mix it up üòâ
---
BOW BEFORE YOU'RE KING
---
Go with the burrows then! Mix it up üòâ
---
Loved the game since lauch, bugs and all!
---
Two Shot Explosive. They are legendary effects you can get on weapons. Two shot cause two ammo to fire per round instead of one, effectively doubling the damage. Explosive causes area of effect damage per projectile. So when combined in one weapon it does tremendous damage to groups of mobs. They are extremely rare to find them both on one weapon. With use of proper perk card and weapons you can still do an incredible amount of damage with a TSE combat shotgun. Some of the effects have been decreased in recent releases of the game so people are looking for and using ‚Äúbloodied‚Äù legendary effect weapons more.
---
Reassemble!
---
I purchased FO76 after playing the trial for3 days.  Amazon has the based game for $17. I was able to price match at Best Buy.
---
I'm really enjoying the game at level 9 currently.
---
It's pretty easy to like a game when it's free. 
---
 Just wish the Moderators here combined the limitless spawning threads (like the WS robots back in November, remember that?) saying exactly the same thing.
---
An easy mode for the bunker part is to have the robot hacking skill. That makes the never ending robot waves much easier to deal with.
---
Nope, followed every step described still no constant connection issues, I have issued a ticket
---
Interesting, do they look the same?
---
No problem! I just got me one yesterday and it was practically new, the only thing wrong was the box was a bit beat up. Totally worth the 50$.
---
Check out video miz Tracey put on YouTube very helpful
---
A dumb little fun game I'll play sometimes is unequip all my weapons, armor, and perk cards and then drink a Vintage Nukashine and see if I can make it back to my camp using only items I find along the way. I still have a little advantage since I can't unequip my mutations or the inherent advantages of having a strength of 15, etc., but it's still a fun way to spend an hour in the game. Plus it's great to see the looks I get from other players when a level 202 comes running by stark naked except for a leather right arm and baseball bat.
---
What place your team finishes in.
---
Knowing is half the battle.
---
ok...to clear some things up since the previous comments are slightly incorrect.    
---
The current instance of NW is just a sneak peak.  and its going away to be worked on internally, and with player feedback,  and will return at an unknown later date.
---
"Nuclear Winter Pre-Beta Sneak Peek will be available for play until June 17. We hope you enjoy jumping into our most competitive and dangerous Fallout 76 experience yet. Please also share your Nuclear Winter feedback with us in the Fallout 76 forums on Bethesda.net."
---

---
Two shot explosive. Basically his gun shoots another shot for free per shot he fires, and bullets explode on impact for area damage
---
Definitely build one, but Id say dont spend too much time on it. Just a simple shack with some workbenches and a stash box is fine, as you will constantly have to move it every few levels.
---
just do it in the mire and drop the fire effect for a Fog effect. The \*real\* problem is that the PS4 might be able to handle that fog rendering. (recall that far harbor had to be patched to tone the fog down because it was soooo laggy on ps4. Its been better, but even with 76, there are some foggy patches that can be kind of laggy)
---
even if i think its a good idea
---
I just wish it was more stable. I have about 10 hours in the trial and have had maybe 6 or 8 disconnects (with sign out) and 1 CTD. I had numerous other Instances: inconsistent team status, quests inactive, missing clothing (as seen by team members), unable to join friends (option not displayed) or follow.
---
That said, I still did enjoy the atmosphere and the exploring.
---
I wish they would‚Äôve added different music rather than just the same music from 3 and 4, and made it feel more unique like new Vegas did
---
I got a duplicate refractor about an hour ago and got XP for it.
---
I have over 1000 hours now and own several TSE lasers. I also have an actual town with multiple stores/vendors. I'm level 235. I have over 100 confirmed NW kills. I *do* want to hear about these new and returning players, my guy
---
Go to folder `\User\Documents\My Games\Fallout 76` and delete this files  
---
\- Fallout76Prefs.ini  
---
\- Fallout76.ini  
---
\- Fallout76Custom.ini  
---
Then launch the game. All settings will be restored to defaults.
---
I had a mobile camp up until player vending came out. Really helped as a low level because I could whip what I needed out, store it all, and pull what I needed out when I needed it again.
---
I've never seen so many people on the maps
---
Ever since the patch before Nuclear Winter, I have generally only been seeing positive posts. Not sure who is still bashing it besides my friend who's just a turd
---
\*farts\*
---
I thought this would be cool too, because i definatly would love to have a small strip of shops, each player focusing on one group of items, but
---
do you want to build a camp?
---
I only built what the tutorial mission required.. then I stored it..
---
I only put down my C.A.M.P. as a free fast travel point whenever im working in difficult areas.. since I dont have anything build there is never a problem placing it...
---
I couldn't love this game at launch. It wasn't finished. I can't love a $60 beta, not one that was advertised as a finished product. Not a chance. I like it more now, but there's still a lot of work ahead of Bethesda to finish this game.
---
There's no two ways about it, the state the game released in was unacceptable. Are people actually happy to get a "game in progress" for full price? Is that what the gaming community has become?
---
I've been here since November 14 I'm old
---
**J-47! Calling, J-47! C3, calling C3!**
---
I actually thought that was one of the better quest lines in the game so far!
---
Build small little fobs for the time being.  Take note of areas that look cool though or that have little advantages (resources,  Defenesibility,  etc).
---
Well damn.  I'm still working on the "revive a player" part.
---
You can build a basic camp just about any time.  It's takes a bit of wood and steel.  Keep it small (2x2) at first, and just rebuild it when you want.  A bed and a storage box, and maybe one crafting station is about all you need, though you can put down crops and water if needed.
---
Once you get crafting stations, learn how to blue print the camp, or tear down the old one before you move, to save a little material.
---
not for nothing, but thats what brings me back. Looking for materials. Grinding events for plans, rare outfits, and the rare vendor bot is what brings me back.
---
Bloody is stronger since they nerfed tse weapons (and for good reason). Bloody is my personal favorite. You deal more and more damage the less health you have. If you get to say 25% health, you could be dealing an insane amount of damage. Way above the base amount. Stack with the adrenal reaction and yeah you can one hit punch a warlord with a deathclaw gauntlet ... Just deadly. Has a balanced drawback though since you are low health so you are basically trading hp for raw power. It's amazing though......
---
I saw that Graham had them
---
I do, I check reddit maybe 3 times a week at my current job
---
PS4 here.  I'm not sure how many rounds I have at the moment, I will check later and let you know if your also on PS4.  I always give my unused ammo away for free in the vender machine, but I can save you my shot gun rounds if your interested.
---
The wife &amp; I play pretty much daily. Both of us are over 1100 hrs ea since beta. We work together on various tasks &amp; goof off while helping other players whenever we can.
---
Level 202 here. Yep, just build something simple and move it as you change the basic area the main questline takes you. Good rule of thumb is start your camp near Flatwoods, then Morgantown, then Charleston, then Top of the World, then the Mire, and then wherever you want.
---
No I don't think I will
---
I almost artillery striked someone‚Äôs camp because I repeatedly told them to leave and they kept blocking my doors
---
So then your post about ‚Äúevery 5 minutes‚Äù is a huge exaggeration.
---
Go away
---
That's what I've been doing once I figured out how to be on my own (turn auto fill off). Then I run and hide somewhere that's inside the safe zone and normally is hard to see me (like on a rocky out cropping) with one or two ways to be attacked. One match I hid in the  Pulowski Preservation shelter at the train station as long as I could.   As I run, I tend to keep looking for better weapons and armor along with nuclear codes/briefcase.
---
I suppose so
---
How have they given up on Project Paradise? That wasn't clear from your post
---
I just got a tse 10mm smg last night from the purveyor.  First tse as well. 400 hrs in
---
get good scrub
---
Two-shot Explosive
---
Plus building basic camp items gives you experience, which is great at lower levels.
---
The trick is to cut off a limb (or use bloody mess). You'll then be able to loot whatever part you cut off their body.
---
I didn't say what I would rather see, only that I was tired of seeing the annoying appreciation posts
---
Join without squad fill and invite your son
---
Welcome to the new players from a lvl 275 with 11 mules that are all loaded with nothing but legendary gear. Yes be, ie, you name it. I'm happy to see you all here. More players means more fun. Ignore attention seeking op
---
I'm on PC.
---
I get to my phone only a handful of times a week and check reddit even less, it is quite annoying to me, personally, that these posts always get 1k+ upvotes
---
Your
---
Just don't share your excitement with our friends on r/fallout, they don't like hearing someone might actually enjoy this game.
---
Clavicus-vile313
---
TSE is great. AAE (anti armor) is up there with it, slightly better I suppose. Theres Bloodied is very popular which increases damage as your health goes down. Junkies damage increases the more chems your feeling withdrawal from. You can adjust your build to suite certain legendary traits
---
Yes. Combine it with the Good Doggy perk and be a meat god.
---
No, its not the one near the vault/lumber yard. It does have a little dock but the one im looking for is completely surrounded by granite looking rock and no boats. Im still looking, thanks for the help so far. Ive found a couple I didnt know about at least.
---
Cleveland wouldnt look much different in fallout than it does in real life ü§£
---
Exactly what I wanted to know. Thanks a lot!!
---
No. Not sure why but I have herbivore on one character and carnivore on another and it didn't change the stats on either.
---
Apologies
---
do you get points in Fallout 76 Battle Royale if you die and your team wins
---
I can't say if I was the guy, but since I did the exact same thing, in case I am him, no need to thank me, I was just doing my job.
---
I got my pack without camera, but it was limiting, especially as a solo player.
---
That would be super helpful. I am also on PS4. Thank you!
---
Tesla double dips into Heavy Weapons, so it gets some of their perks as well, which makes it an absolute monster if you're running a HW perkloadout, or you get lucky and pop a few tesla science mags or science/heavy guns bobbleheads in your run!
---
Not seeking attention, I have 1 character that is level 200. That is it
---
Has to be your aim lmao, I can kill someone with a laser within a few rounds, with the exception of scout and marine armor where it might be a little more
---
Nevermind, you are on PC, I'm Xbox
---
When you have to chose the gamemode (adventure survival or nuclear winter) selecr nuclear winter without clicking on it, you'll see on the bottom of the screen a "fill team option" just put it on off and you are good to go solo with your kid
---
I got frog legs, Master heavy weapons and bullet shield. I have over 30 wins lol, winning isn't the issue. Since eventually we will all be the required level if we put the time in, then essentially it's a timelocked gate to the lore anyway so it doesn't really matter. There's been time locked lore in games before so I'm not too miffed after thinking about it
---
Except during that time, if everyone plays aggressively the game mode is more fun and rewarding to make it to the end. Like you really earned it. Not to mention that if everyone hides then at the end of the match it's a shitshow where skill is mostly irrelevant because there's 15-20 people in a circle meant for 6-8. You're getting shot from every angle and whether you survive or not is more luck than skill. I want the action to be evenly spaced and consistent rather than hide for 15-20 minutes then as soon as you shoot at someone you get shot in the head by some other team, since there's 4 teams around in a 30 foot wide circle.
---
Having a camp is handy, but it's really the stash that helps.  From there the size and what you with it is up to you.  You can base near a place that already has the benches you need, or build your own. When do you need one? It's up to you.
---
My first camp was in the cliffs between the lighthouse and the junkyard workshop.  Great place for a small camp with a good Cu deposit there.  Only did 4 workbenches, bed, fire, stash and hand pump.  
---
I've kept it that basic size for ease of moving and setting up where I want. Im also not one for making houses. At lvl 53 I've moved only 3 times, and those were to areas where I did most of the exploring.
---
Is squad fill an option? By I time we join a match our tram is made in the vault. What am I missing?
---
Same, same and same buddy! I'll be buying it too. Just played 5+ hours with one if my oldest friends , tooling around exploring, looting, building. It's been a blast
---
I did the same but didn't wait for the trial to end!
---
Follower dlc confirmed
---
I still havent got one and ive been playing since beta.
---
You know, spend more money on atoms, because i know i would
---
yeah and the low tier weapons would be stuff like 10 mm pistol or god forbid someone use a melee weapon.
---
Do you play on pc? I‚Äôd love to help if you are!
---
Pre beta will stay online for people who own the game after June 17 it clearly says it on the main menu
---
I agree. If anything weapons do more damage in NW.
---
Goes on until nuclear spring.
---
I ran into a 499 today, there is always a bigger fish!
---
Yeah I have it it takes 9 perception and it shows it on the map
---
Same here never been one for building lavish things. As everyone has been suggesting I'll just keep it simple.
---
Start the scouts quest early and keep your eyes open for a tourist to start the camera quest.
---
I am a PC player.
---
I charge 1c for each shell. Most of my ammos are free to take, only the higher endgame bullets are charges, for 1c (fusion cores are 1c/1% and plasma cores are 20, or 30c if its full).
---
Welcome young wastelander
---
spend some time working on your perk layout and blueprinting some defensive structures for quick camp drops. 
---
It WILL win you a fight, and for me, its been the difference between victory and 2nd place so many times i've lost count.
---
Always come prepared!
---
Alright I will
---
For the most part but I think the ultracite has green lasers..but I also could be making that up...sorry I can't recall as the only heavy I used alot was a plasma gat.
---
Nope. No prewar food is effected by mutations. They are their own unique food types.
---
you can hide for a little over 200 xp almost 300 at that rate people will be doing this for months if not years.
---
Wait where can I get the nukashine armour
---
https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1139554707763093506
---
Disagree with everything except scoped rifles getting a buff
---
On weekends
---
i have grouped and every time i either die trying to help my team survive or i am a lone at the very end.
---
Just go on YouTube if you care that much
---
Are you team inviting from the map/social menu or when your characters are face to face?
---
He doesn‚Äôt like when people get the game on a free trial when he paid for it and lived on the game.  I seen similar posts when conan exiles when free on ps plus
---
Sometimes in life we just make a **choice.** Sometimes in life its just a stupid one lol.
---
Either that or get better
---
except for the fact that nobody yet realizes that building in this game is a "thing"
---
my group already has gone into adventure mode and built a nice 3 story base that has some "traps" inside of it.
---
the game lets you build and move camp instantly. with no delay so we've been putting this tower of death up and we won the game using it.
---
there is no amount of sneaking that really is going to help you win against a tower!
---
Thanks for this. I had stopped playing a while back and just restarted and had no idea this was a thing.
---
everyone has their opinion i have mine you have yours.
---
Good for you, maybe I have just had a bad experience with overly friendly subreddits
---
Yup noticed that a while ago. Would hide in there occasionally and over a month ago I went in there and for whatever reason walked right through it
---
And there is a beer, that gives temporaly 50lbs. Red Ant Ale, or something like that.
---
Like you said, I've gotten probably a dozen explosive guns and a dozen or more 2 shots. First tse. 
---
I use semi auto rifles, too bad it a fully auto pistol. Lol
---
Not to mention those of us who played through since the start went through all the bugs, server issues, patches, and nerfs while trying to play through the main story. 
---
Getting it now from the free weekend is actually a good deal compared to what people who paid full price had to play through. A good amount of complaints did hold merit with how the game came out and was for the first few months.
---
Also keep in mind that in AM there's no PvP now unless you take a workshop. At the start, pvp was a little odd and fairly broken which is why they got Survival mode out.
---
Special skins will only be on the store for a limited time so if you miss it then it‚Äôs gone until they decide they want to bring it back
---
All 'packaged' food is mutation agnostic.
---
I usually tell people to forget workshops or claim them to get plans and rewards then hop servers. You can get more farming easy areas any day of the week multiple times and get more than having a few workshops anyways.
---
Dude what is with you and telling people they have a personal problem and not opinions. Quit trying to play gatekeeper.
---
Big downside is now theres no camps to buy shit from and it's only little low levels everywhere. Now I have no .308 ammo and I cant find a single camp selling it lmao
---
My king would never use the wrong "your".
---
Do you have high luck? I think luck has a lot to do with what you run into and what they are.
---
I am at level 125 &amp; not sure there will ever be an "endgame", if you have run out of quests, start working thru the challenges.. Some of them are down right challenging :)
---
Ive been enjoying medic weapons. Especially since the nooblets have joined the world. I usually team up with low levels to help them figure things out.
---
It‚Äôs a container, so it‚Äôs instanced per player. 20 players could show up and all 20 can loot the body.
---
I need to see this clip. Lmao
---
lol
---
you can quit and re-up right away. theres hardly any wait time between games compared to other similiar games that make you stay.
---
What I did was go to the encrpitid event and just revived someone when they inevitably went down.
---
Listen to Sertith - just keep checking every nuka machine around and save your caps. :)
---
Anytime you want. There's no reason not to build a base. Just make it easy to place anywhere, until you find a spot you want to be for a while. A single foundation with stairs up, build from there.
---
Haha. Sounds cool.  Would be fun to set up a few players to do this together.  Everyone drinks Nukashine completely stripped doen and races back.  I guess you would have to add task like find and bring back a randomly spawned semi-rare item to accomodate player's travel distances not being the same from the Nuhashine trip..
---
True huh lol I kill with a 10 mil pistol
---
Lol yeah eso text chat is pretty nice; I find myself needing a mod to make sure I don‚Äôt miss any messages though!
---
Dunno how that could happen, but also don't wanna think about it too hard. maybe you should start a survival/nuclear Winter subreddit. I'm sure there would be a lot of bitter posters and wouldn't be friendly at all lol
---
if you want, i can paint your power armor palladin+
---
Good for you glad your having fun. Its due to the bitching and complaining that the game has become something out of the untested glitch buggy mess it released as.
---
At the time it was fun and popular to beat on this game but still justified. After wastlanders assuming its good then I feel like this game will become what it promised, and I will recommend it to my friends.
---
Oh okay. Thanks a lot!
---
I see. Thank you!
---
That‚Äôs settled then. Thanks!
---
God I hope we are talking about the same king
---
I use ionized meat. Never goes bad and i don't have to use a perk point for good doggy.
---
Ah ok so it's a cosmetic thing gottcha
---
Go to the encrpitid/scorthed earth event whenever it fires and just wait for someone to need reviving.
---
48 I think?
---
You can hack terminals and get guns Chen's and even nuke keykards
---
Absolutely true.
---
I've long said that to win a game of battle royale you only have to kill one person.
---
The best thing about power armor is it can be camouflaged if you have the skin for it.  Otherwise I bypass it myself.
---
Hey man I played this game for three weeks before I figured out you actually had to read a plan to learn it.  And I only figured it out after making a post and having someone tell me how to do it.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll matter long since based on the story of Odyssey and Origins I doubt there‚Äôll be more than two games released after Odyssey.
---
Your reddit ID the same as your PS4 character's?  mine is.
---
You can get the tesla rifle, minigun and missile launcher from terminals. Wht are you talking about.
---
Power armor is disappointing regardless of what you slap on it but I guess that‚Äôs fair considering that anything and everything is readily available aside from ultracite mods.
---
What‚Äôs shocking is how many people don‚Äôt use the stealthboy mod but are ranged. I was a melee build back when I used power armor, so I used reactive plates or optimized servos. But if I were ranged, I would have had a lot more fun with the stealthboy mod. Especially with pvp. It just amazes me how many people actually find the jet pack mod valuable. Perhaps if it didn‚Äôt drain ap so fast, I could see the point but since marsupial works with power armor. You‚Äôd figure that would be enough. I guess people really want that slight height boost.  There‚Äôs just so many other mod mixtures that could be used instead. But that‚Äôs power armor users for you. The only plus to having it is jumping from high areas and heavy weapons. Aside from that, regular armor trumps it all. That‚Äôs why you see so many people bitching.
---
Inalsonstarted when griefing, pvp, slap damage etc. Were still an issue.  So I kept it small to stay out of sight.
---
Down since beta.  Its the only game I've played since its release.  I just today discovered radiated flora and am becoming a member of the enclave. Having a blast at my own leisurely pace.
---
Smart. Thanks for sharing!
---
To the unsinkable titanic
---
I'm going to apply this tactic because I often end up in trigger happy teams that lose to better equipped enemies. It better to suprise attack others after they won a fight.
---
Hell I saw a YouTuber say how crappy Fallout 76 was and how big the world was and how empty it was and then compared it to how amazing Witcher 3 is and my first though was ‚ÄúWitcher 3 was broken as fuck when it launched‚Äù
---
Prewar Dogs were made of candy pulp.
---
Sorry but the hate was well deserved. This game launched completely broken on a 20 year old engine and STAYED completely broken for a very long time. The dev team didn‚Äôt even update their files for different patches which as proven with the great Bobby pin debacle. Legendary enemies could be impossible to kill, scorchbeasts queens were dropping zero loot, legendary enemies never dropped gear of their level or star ranking. The stash size was impossible to work with (and still is) and let‚Äôs not forget the blatant lies about the canvas bags. 
---
You can defend them all you want, but don‚Äôt ever forget how badly they fucked their supporters, and don‚Äôt ever think the outcry wasn‚Äôt deserved or was done simply ‚Äúbecause it was cool‚Äù because the outcry is the ONLY reason any of if it got fixed. 
---
Sorry rant over: on a side note can the walking armory card be in the actual game please?
---
Well, if you're on Xbox, I'm always up for a naked Nukashine race. GT GBV0
---
Posts like yours really tick me off too!
---
sec.  leme edit my post
---
I just traded for a quad/ffr/vats lever. Nothing super great but I really like it's power and ability to hold 20 rounds. Tse is overrated now.
---
Ah so you haven't heard of the sub war of r/gameofthrones and r/freefolk
---
Nice!
---
i haven't launched the game yet today.  lol
---
What level are you?  Btw all solos are the same layout.
---
The truth hurts. Right, Bethesdadrone?
---
Appreciate the offer, but I'm actually more interested in getting it myself. I'm  a bit of a completionist i guess. Want to collect all them plans out there at some point. I know i can probably buy plans, but rather find myself.
---
He shits on pretty much every game he plays
---
level 44
---
It's weird that it's just that one
---
Post these clips man a lot of us would love to see that kind of thing, probably be popular posts!
---
No worries mate :)
---
I usually use a melee weapon to sever the limb.
---
Now that people can‚Äôt just destroy everyone‚Äôs camp in adventure mode I don‚Äôt get why people lock their camps up. Also where do you get the code door plans?
---
thats how i have played it since like 2 weeks after release.  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
On Xbox?
---
This is great, I'm going to have to draw something about this
---
But..... but that sweet, sweet internet hate train...... /s
---
What of the actual witches?
---
Shall we still hunt them?
---
Lmfao people over reacted a bit? That's an understatement
---
It was a massive circle jerk full of sheep who thought they were blasting battlefront 2 micro transactions or something
---
The game was never THAT bad. It was as buggy as any other Bethesda game at launch and only got better like every other game. 
---
People are stupid especially once the group think takes over
---
i thought you couldn't tell the difference past 60?
---
Sorry, PS4.
---
welcome to the wasteland fellow vault dweller!

Ok but seriously there might be one if you follow the road south from the skull cave in the north of the savage divide

&gt; It will happen to CD Projekt Red one day, too.
---
Going by first impressions of 77, and how the definite tone of mediocrity was in the air, it could be sooner than anyone thinks.
---
They also nerfed the effects heavily, as both used to give a +100% damage boost.  TS now is only 25%, and explosive 20%.  Course they are still OPAF even after
---
Welcome to the community, we‚Äôre glad to have you! 
---
There is a running joke about our Vault Dwellers being late all the time, so that feeling you missed living people by a couple hours is pretty accurate. If you recall at the beginning of Adventure Mode, your character woke up late and everyone had left you in the vault. 
---
I‚Äôm not sure if you caught it or not, but they‚Äôre adding NPCs back into the game. It should feel more fleshed out at that point. 
---
Again, welcome to the 76 community!
---
I sold one got 5k, it was a joke but someone bought it. Got 500 for from eyes lol
---
I once had a post removed for naming a YouTuber who openly admitted to cheating. "Witch hunting" rules only work if you're not protecting real witches who are casting spells and screaming "I'm a witch!"
---
sounds like a bald fatty that rhymes with spazz, he's got quite the hard-on for W3 (as most mainstream low-hangers do.)
---
Note one badge requires reviving someone in water I think
---
In the game I look like the kid in school that was always wearing last seasons trends, I won't buy anything until it goes on sale. Then at that point i have a few thousand free atoms banked from playing.
---
Haven't seen any terminals tbh, been playing for a couple of days.
---
Amazon has it in sale for seventeen dollars. Welcome to the waste
---
There's like 5 of em at camp McClintock :-)
---
Been telling people all along not to trust the public. This game is so incredibly fun. I've seen nothing but negative things towards this game on every platform of social media. Now that it's been free its changed completely. Glad to see it, and welcome home!!
---
Kill robots before they kill you lol
---
Be sure you have a way to deal with the radiation. First time I did a silo run I want prepared for the rads like a dummy and got killed. When you nuke, meme sure you leave a spot on the edge you can fast travel to
---
My husband and I both decided to buy it after our free trial experience. We did notice some bugs (server drops, etc.) but felt that it wasn‚Äôt terrible enough to warrant all the criticism. We‚Äôre excited for what 76 has to offer and happy we decided to check it out for ourselves.
---
Yeah, im selling mine for 3.5k. I said id adjust the price to 5k. I dont think he was very happy
---
I just love this image of two people screaming over voice chat while white deer run around and ghouls fly out of nowhere. üòÇ
---
No it doesn't. You can quit and retain the awards given to you by the game.
---
**NO SHIT**
---
it should've been obvious to anyone with any remote objectivity that it was a massive circle jerk
---
It was self masturbatory Glee at shitting on the game. Obviously a bandwagon.
---
Nope just quite after you die
---
Got a 40 lvl TSE combat shotgun exactly at 45 level while routinely roaming Vendors (back when they did not share caps).  No way it is close to being OP now, so left it at the stash as a memory.
---
As someone who bought the pre-order Tricentennial edition/ played the beta... it is a fun game. There are headaches but majority have been somewhat fixed. I'm still waiting the energy weapons damange to increase but I still use my beautiful gauss and Tesla like no tomorrow...maybe I'm not using the right cards, idk.
---
 I left in Jan due to no end game/#pvp on camps...came bk late may. That's now fixed to the point I can enjoy the game and love farming. Still trying to get my bk pk and helping the vault babies üòä I got water, weapons and food for $free.99 just trying to help a where I can.
---
That's why I always encourage people to form their own opinions. Critics don't always look at things the way a consumer does, and the public can (and does) create a sort of hive-mind around either loving or hating something, sometimes unfairly so. 
---
I just started playing again this week after having been turned off by the B.E.T.A. (the game in that state was pretty rough IMO) and I've been enjoying it. I'm glad things have turned around.
---
See you in the Wasteland!
---
Got to be more specific
---
ok thanks sounds good
---
Nvm. I got a lever and I really like it
---
I bought it on black friday on sale for 40 bucks. I was playing the solo campaign on RDR2 at the time so I didn't even install it until Christmas day.  I took a 3 week break and played Anthem (üò°) for a bit. Then Wild Appalachia started and I've been playing steady since. I have about 400 hours into so I probably got my moneys worth.
---
There have been tons of great updates with player and legendary vending at the top of my list. It really changed the game imo. Super pumped for the vault raids promised soon and the npc's returning this fall!! 
---
See ya in the wasteland!! üëçüëç
---
Hmm "ruins the end game meta on the basis of lack of variety" so like bloodied build are killing variety right now?
---
The first 49 rewards are pretty meh imo
---
That's why it's best with friends. One of my biggest enjoyments is trying different builds. I really enjoy sharing info with friends and us trying new builds and such.
---
The best time to plant a tree is twenty years ago. The second best time is right now.
---
Just had a game me and 2 team mates and one enemy who was jumping 20 feet in the air. I peeled way back since I was using a sniper. After killing both my team mates while doing this jumping thing he then threw a gernade while behind a tree 300m to where I was (while moving) and 1-shot me. I guess my quesion is...is there an item that allows you to jump 20 feet in the air and is there a gernade that travels 300m has no timer and is a one shot?
---
My max was 76. Thought it was symbolic so I stopped there.
---
Lmao, people still complain about that bag.  Their wife could be cheating on them, and destroy their entire home in a pyrotechnic psychic explosive manifestation of her illgotten orgams that trigger her latent superpower in the wrong way and at the weong moment, and their last word would be "The bag...  was... nyyyyyullloonnnnn...."
---
Thank god for this, I absolutely hate the atrocity that comes from that room.
---
Yup I saw that announcement. It looks like there are a lot of new features that they're adding as well.
---
Crafting Stimpaks requires the Stimpaks recipe. Stimpaks require blood packs and blood packs require 2 tick bloods.
---
Pro tip Watoga and sun top rail station bathrooms always have bloodpacks in their sinks. Like so many I have 280 Stimpaks. I give them out like candy.
---
The Sri pack recipe is for sale in the medical wing of the enclave and maybe elsewhere.
---
I just started over on xbox as well. I'm at work til late but feel free to add me. My gt: Spartan00222
---
I found a 3 star Sheepsquatch in the wild the other night.
---
That awkward moment when the Battle Royale ended up saving the playerbase
---
Same issue.  The notification alerts improperly.
---
Then put a math problem there and make the answer not the code.
---
Never really stumble on any yet. I mostly drop lumbermill/wixon.
---
Unless you wanna watch. I mean, I'm not very good. But I'm improving and a big part of that has been watching other people's strategies
---
Sure PM me your PSN info
---
I've been here sense the beta test, I even skipped days of school ( my parents let me because all my grades were good) just to play the game, I loved or even tho the games was buggy at the time it was awesome in my heart and always has been
---
Ah okay that's prob why I thought you could. I've gotten the level up ones on an alt. I'll edit my post thanks for correcting me.
---
Yeah I mostly spawn at lumber mill, and wixon.
---
I hate to be the bummer here but: 
---
Appalachia is fundamentally doomed, from a lore perspective. If we actually rebuilt it, why was it never mentioned in other games? It‚Äôs likely we simply prevented the Scorched Plague from spreading, but that‚Äôs about it unfortunately.
---
Seen them at Charleston Station mostly. Picked them up for both my characters. Really helps to save your planted crops!
---
I dislike PvP too, but I am having so much fun in Nuclear Winter. It‚Äôs so much fun to play with my friends AND solo, with this great mix of tension and excitement when you get closer and closer to facing the final combatants. I love it.
---
0
---
Just watch out because you will still be facing full team of 4 players
---
I saw one for 15k
---
Will you stop playing the god damn twangy thingy!?
---
Me: no I dont think I will
---
I had to double check what subreddit I was on! Let me guess, Xbox?
---
I actually do special deals on my ammo I sell. The first 50 rounds are free for ballistics excluding the 5mm which I make 300 rounds free. Then it‚Äôs 1c for anything 100 and above. 
---
The odds of someone ‚Äúbuying‚Äù my free ammo and THEN my priced ammo at 1c goes up by 80%. I‚Äôve done some experimenting and with 5 hours of playtime, I average about 3-5 players who visit my camp based on my location (savage divide - Seneca rocks). Out of the 5 players, 3 out of 5 buy my free ammo and then my priced ones.
---
Welp didnt know I needed both. welp rip me
---
There are some of those.  And some "kill that guy."  Which will shock you if you ever played a fallout game.
---
Sadly... no settlements need your help, although Wastelands may have Preston's long lost grandmother.
---
Glad you are having fun though.
---
Meanwhile what I learned is I don‚Äôt need the disc to start fallout 76. Accidentally clicked it on xbone and it played without the disc inside then it hit me it was the free week
---
This**
---
More than once I've spent all my plastic to make bulk items to sell, then habitually scrapped all and lost everything
---
https://ibb.co/jR5XPw
---
Exactly but it makes dropping a nuke which can get you tons of kills and wins I don‚Äôt get how some people don‚Äôt underbalance like all
---
Yep
---
Come join the fallout 76 family üòÅ
---
YouTube people still declare this game is dead and Bethesda is the worst company in existence. No one says anything about how the game has improved so much since then, and instead jumps on the stupidest ‚Äúcontroversies.‚Äù (10% tax on vending machine sales; repair kit gate, etc.)
---
Get yourself a backpack and you won‚Äôt need that anymore.
---
South East of point pleasant someone already mentioned it. It definitely fits your description i was built there for quite some time. It has a giant Billboard and a cabin just up the hill, a staircase that leads to a dock on a crater like pond, Granite cliff shelfs take up half the shoreline of the pond.
---
I feel like that‚Äôd be way too much work.
---
I know how it *should* work. But me and many others milked the brahmin on Adventure and it worked. Not so long ago, one of the challenges for a weapon could be done entirely on Adventure too.
---
That‚Äôs true the challenges are stupid. I haven‚Äôt even got a camera
---
Been to Watoga, still haven't considered whether to launch a nuke.  Level 99.  :-D
---
So you point out one game that has hackers and is dying. Pc has them on every game. You‚Äôre not proving much
---
You don‚Äôt need the nuke codes that you find in Appalachia.  
---
I use this https://nukacrypt.com/. It helps :)
---
Barely meet players routinely at all.
---
And when I do, it's friendly.
---
Game in adventure almost feels like single player unless you engage in trading.
---
*They do exist.*
---
I have never seen a three star outside Arktos, so it is cool to think that I may run into one one day.
---
And then promptly run away if I‚Äôm not on a team lol.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt that be sensible? üôÑ
---
I experienced the exact same feelings you did, I didn‚Äôt even look or think about this game for months until I saw a video on it by one of my favorite youtubers (Kevduit) and was immediately surprised by how fun and open it looked. I bought it and I‚Äôve never regretted it since tbh, It can definitely be rough and a little punishing at times but its supposed to be a survival/adventure fallout game that you can play with friends and it feels like they‚Äôve done a pretty good job so far.
---
Speed Demon does work in PA, yes.
---
Thirst and Hunger are not affected by Class Freak at all, no.
---
Radius rifles are great and awful. Great when you have em, awful when someone else does! ;)
---
Cool, I'll probably buy it
---
I‚Äôm doing that quest right now
---
No I mean they usually release the month of weapons online beforehand. So we know the effects. They haven't yet.
---
Pretty much this. You can quit when you‚Äôre dead and get your rewards, but learning strategies will help you improve your game.
---
I'm pointing out how easy it is to hack on consoles. If you didn't notice those links are all for CONSOLE hacks. Of course I'm not going to link to hacks for this game, that would be against the rules here and get me banned.
---
I have the stimpack recipe. Just needed bloodpack recipe but its seems my character is bugged or something so I'll have to farm the bloods
---
Suns = subs.  Especially fithy casuals, those guys are epic.
---
fortnite charges 20 for 1 skin and nobody bats an eye. fallout charges 15 for 4 similar skins people get mad
---
Ya, i honestly think they would sell more if they dropped the prices. The power armor skins cost more than the game does right now. Someone said it's 17 bucks on Amazon.  With all that being said I usually buy 10 bucks worth of atoms each month on payday just to support the game and reduce my time spent grinding for atoms.
---
I seen literally not one person that enjoys its current scoring mechanics and they seem to just not care at all
---
Alright well hackers are dealt with much more swiftly. I could do the same thing and point out hacks for pc.
---
You could just not buy games on release...
---
They used to be easy or at least manageable in a few hours. My conspiracy theory/ belief is that Bethesda has ramped up the "limited daily deals" and made the challenges impossible to make us buy atoms or risk losing out. Which isnt working as far as I know.
---
Thank you üñ§
---
The US and Russia were sorta nice to each other in the fallout universe
---
if you have less than 5 there‚Äôs a challenge that you could use for now until they add it in
---
Which is the unintuitive and annoying problem he‚Äôs suggesting a fix for man.
---
It‚Äôs going to be more crazy since school is out. The game is rated M. A game is not a babysitter.
---
Glad to hear you are ejoying it! See you in Appalachia, vault dweller.
---
If you don't want to google them and find them the legit way, the enclave have a way of finding them. It's like a quest. There is a terminal in the military wing in the whitespring bunker, everything is explaind there. Hope this helps you.
---
Swear to god I‚Äôve read this exact post before. Hold on...
---
It's just a sewer full of ghouls, basically.  It used to be a small settlement and there's a bit of lore you can find down there.
---
Any recommendations for good videos about sea of thieves?  Now I'm curious.
---
Thanks, im so happy running around in my Uncle Sam costume
---
I dont think so. Everywhere I read says it's a default recipe that you get when you leave the vault. I just never did.
---
No one is denying there are hacks on pc you claimed there were no jacks on consoles. I know people who fun hacks on consoles and have been for years. They've never been banned, it is how I knew about hacks on consoles to begin with.
---
I'm starting to get really irritated, I have 1 or 2 good cards I've gotten (I'm lvl. 23 now) but the last 5 packs I have received are all doubles. 2 of those were told doubles...so woohoo I got an extra 100 exp out of those.
---
I just want commando or a heavygun perk
---
Lvl 229 myself, just never got around to doing it. Something always came up, or I forgot my plans.
---
One of us one of us
---
Console?
---
I've got to get in on this nuke action. I've just been grinding levels and not really tried but man it looks like fun. In adventure there is enough warning that you don't really get kills but in NM it's a whole new world. I think nuke yourself should be an achievement personally
---
Can vouch for this, everyone is awesome!
---
Im on PC
---
Yay! I hope you have a good time!
---
How do I submit one? Tried to submit a ticket on bethesdas website but there wasn't anything for bugs, just for other stuff.
---
What a design failure. The scout camp around the northern section of the map positioned around a lake.
---
I‚Äôve had the same thing, it‚Äôs like that with perk packs to
---
Who downed this post? How dare they
---
Have enough stimpaks and if you have the robot expert perk is a plus.
---
They got a whole bunch of money with that E3 bundle
---
Troubleshooting armor is nifty af in there. I just sneak around and use lock picks and hacking perks. Speeds it up considerably.
---
I scavenged a full set of troubleshooter armor and use it for silo runs and the imposter event. You can usually find 1 star pieces super cheap. I threw my mixed set together for about 1000 caps.
---
Well the one I ordered was brand new other than some minor damage to the box.
---
Honestly look at it like this:  you can go solo,  SPECIAL makes a big difference, you get adventure XP, and it costs you nothing.
---
Just another wonderful bug ü§ó
---
Too bad... I had some goodies for you if you were on PS4. Either way happy to hear you liked it! Cheers
---
what platform are uou on? a quick fix is to mute  the ingame music in settings, and then run something in the background like a cool spotify list
---
That sucks
---
I never heard of the trial. Is that why there have been so many low level players?
---
You got me there. Unlucky wasn‚Äôt the term I was looking for.
---
Matchmaking usually takes less than a minute.  You might be stuck in a loading screen.  Just restart and it should work fine.
---
How though? Unless I‚Äôm not right they‚Äôd just have to put the map files and then make the arena like any other NW map they‚Äôre going to make
---
Well thanks for the kind offer friend, im sure there is someone on Ps4 who would like a great.
---
It was for the first months, but has since been nerfed: Two Shot is only doing 1.25x damage instead of 2x now, Explosive effect is weaker, too. What's more, Two Shot has really bad accuracy, so don't fall for overpriced TSE weapons on offer.
---
Explosive is still one of the best traits overall, but the best combination nowadays is BE for guns (Bloodied Explosive), and Bloodied with Faster Swing Speed for melee weapons, respectively. 
---
Some players prefer AAE, though: Anti-Armor Explosive, and there are other viable combinations, but Bloodied weapons tend to have the highest damage output currently possible.
---
Ps4
---
üëé
---
I was a bit higher level the first time I took down the G monster, such a feeling of accomplishment.  Now I one shot them with a BP rifle.
---
You‚Äôre absolutely right but it‚Äôs far worse when you consider it seems they broke it a few months ago trying to rush out a patch and have yet to correct it ü§ó
---
Welcome ü§ó
---
Every 20 hours from when you first picked it up I think.
---
what kind of degenerate dog are you? 
---
only true wastelanders drink nukaquantam
---
That and the one after yes but it‚Äôs since been corrected.
---
It is incredibly rare but understandably so. You can still have incredibly powerful weapons that will easily do the job and are not explosive such as two shot bloodied faster fire rate or instigating with increased damage while aiming, furious and explosive automatic weapons are really nice too. Point is you don‚Äôt need a TSE despite what everyone says, they are definitely the strongest in game imo but you can definitely have fun and not feel underpowered without one. :)
---
To clarify they are intended to only be collectible from playing in survival mode
---
It has its flaws but as someone who has enjoyed the series evolving for better or worse, me and my friends find it a great way to connect, explore and have fun together. Welcome aboard!
---
Ya, you sold them for pennies on the dollar to the robo vendors or just dropped them if they were crappy.
---
Player vending opened up the map in big ways. You never were able to see anyone's camp before. Not to mention the buying and selling of everything. It was the biggest change in my opinion. 
---
The legendary vendor is a way to reduce rng on the legendary items. It's been a welcome addition. I just got a powerful two shot explosive gun last night from her in fact.
---
I never listen to what people say because you always have ones that hate something and ones that love it. There was a lot of hate about Conan Exiles and I love that game, the same with FO76. Welcome to the Wastelands!!
---
Thank you both so much xD just saved me from pulling out my hair üòÇ
---
The Tesla bounces but I think it only hits once, the thing that makes energy weapons pretty powerful is most armor and perks everyone uses are against ballistic and not energy. Against the explosive guns do you have fireproof or a dense modded chest? Those reduce the blast damage a huge amount and will help you stay alive a bit longer. What kind of armor are you using in general?
---
My only problem is that a lot of new people came at the same time. For me personally the servers are full with them, and there are only 3-5 players "good" enough for scorchbeast queen, that's why i think almost noone goes to the silos. I'm sure this will change tho. I was also a noob at the start, and so was everyone who plays.
---
I think between two characters (lvl 100 and ~50 I think) I‚Äôve seen one weapon total with either two-shot or explosive, maybe I have shitty luck
---
No, this was clearly bait.
---
Mercedes started exports to the US in 1952 only a few years after making Tanks and armor for Nazi Germany. Japan, the very same if not more with Nissan, Kawasaki and more that were initially large military builders.
---
Hope they can fix you up so you can play! Good luck man
---
Or sitting perfectly still a bush. Skillful right? Maybe now you see the problem.
---
I have been playing since December and loved it the whole way, welcome newbies. Hope you enjoy it as much as I do üëç
---
Oh but there will be end game, once you hit my level and higher (( lvl 182 )) there are pretty much a very set few events and quests we do...so now we have NW and just wait til y'all get into the buying and selling aspect of the game. BTW, Heavy Guns is the way to go in big boss fights. I run explosive on all of my guns and it is mad crazy how fast bosses die with them. I would always recommend to peeps starting fresh to get those weight reduction perks and focus on about two different types of weapons and there is always a melee weapon. Have fun out there wastelanders...enjoi...
---
I'm loving it so far. Feels like a normal Fallout game. Don't get the hate.
---
I wasn't on PC, i was on PS4-- so this guy and I aren't on the same system, but it was funny how close the stories are. I might still upload it later, but its not a big priority as I'm moving right now :c
---
this makes me feel good about playing it now. i suck at pvp shooters, but I sure know how to hide
---
Yeah no it‚Äôs pathetic nobody thought that was a dumb idea lol
---
I don't trust people who are paid to have opinions Skill up, Yongyea, Jim Stirling, and many more that I'm forgetting are just propagating hate for the sake of clicks and views quite frankly I'm done with YouTube game reviews if I want a game I'll buy it and if not then I won't buy it, easy.
---
Its because the game is f2p so they can download it without the parents even knowing.
---
I accidentally duplicated my power armor, so I ain‚Äôt complaining
---
how was the exp?
---
Something to bear in mind though you can use multiple of the same card. Not great if all you have is junk but useful if you have a few decent duplicates
---
Somebody has to much time on their hands
---
All beit riddled with holes
---
&gt;I know the game probably had a rocky start
---
You have no idea. It wasn't a rocky start, it was literally completely broken and should not have gone on sale until it had reached an actual state of functionality.
---
There were questlines, early questlines, that were impossible to complete because you couldn't interact with quest items.
---
 Servers would crash every 5 minutes. Item weights issues and carry limit breaking bugs were common, and bugs all over the place would have a cumulative effect on your inventory by adding invisible items you couldn't get rid of, meaning you would be overencumbered whilst literally naked with no items.
---
Your camp would dismantle itself for no reason, not storing any of the items, nor refunding the building cost. It would just be gone. The items that disappeared from your camp would still be counted in your camp budget (which was a lot smaller too) meaning you couldn't build a camp any more.
---
The game would not count any of the bonus carry weight on your armour, unless you logged out naked, logged back in, then re-equipped your armour. It would then log you back in a *different* server.... which wouldn't be a problem with the join friend button... *except the friends list never worked either, and you couldn't join your friends if you'd already been in a group with them recently, if you could even see them online at all, which was unlikely to begin with*.
---
The perks didn't actually work, the event quests deleted unrelated items from your inventory, regular quests would reset progress to the beginning every time you logged out (or the server crashed), even if it was a huge multi chain quest, you'd get 1 hit killed by people even in pacifist mode, you'd have to server hop for hours on end to kill 1 mob for a quest as the one mob was shared for everyone on the server and didn't respawn, and your character's movement speed was tied to your refresh rate.
---
These are just the bugs I can remember off the top of my head, there were dozens and dozens, and that's before we get into the rife cheating all over the place, because when the game went live it was barely altered from fallout 4 and so all the hacks and tricks still worked ***in an online multiplayer***.
---
All of these issues took an absolute *age* for bethesda to address, we're talking many months, so if you had *any* of the bugs (*and you did*) your only recourse was... **to stop playing until it wad fixed.** Which again, took months.
---
So yeah, that was a bit long-winded, and I'll happily admit the game's good now it works. But when it was released it did not work, and deserved every bit of vitriol it had thrown at it. You made the right call by listening to the masses.
---
Well, you can see the real Greenbrier shuttle buses here:

---
Glad to hear it. Im in the same boat. Just dove in today.
---
He can‚Äôt see people camping in bushes so is he supposed to launch a grenade at literally every bush he comes across?... currently you literally need to look at all of them or hope you can react well to be shot in the back
---
Haha, that's hilarious.
---
Thank you!  Been trying to figure out how to fix this for a week, even tried reinstalling the game!  Couldn't find info on it anywhere.
---
Wondrous
---
Yes. Final circle I just Frog legs and spam bushes. I mean, I got to level 53 this way...
---
How many months now? Wonderful priorities lmao
---
You da real MvP
---
Fandom always has bugs listed, so I‚Äôve stuck with it
---
That just seem.... nightmare fuel
---
No you wont have to delete and redownload, just pop it in and play.
---
I wouldn't worry, there are so many legendaries int the game, you will have them coming out your ears.
---
Yes, this oh it was deserved and it's way different now shit people keep parroting is nonsense. Yes there was stability issues and the duplication problem but other then that it's the same game and all the hate was overblown and dramatic.
---
Sold mine for 6k so dont be obliged to hold onto it if you ever need caps
---
#fortnite76
---
I was looking at these in my deck last night.   Nine points in str all for weight reduction 100% of the time.   I know it‚Äôs wasteful but I can‚Äôt help but be a packrat.
---
Finally someone has the balls to say it thamk you
---
Bethesda bans for griefing so if you admit killing level 1s fresh out the vault is griefing then you agree it is against the rules.
---
This is how I play because I solo queue. You just can‚Äôt fight whole teams. If I spawn near a team maybe I can pick one off before fleeing, but I tend to find a team and follow them, waiting for them to get into a fight so I can get a few freebies during the chaos. I‚Äôm only overseer 4, but I rarely kill anyone, enjoy the tension of hiding and tracking players, and typically last to the final circle, earning about 400xp per game while still having fun.
---
I went out and bought it last night because I enjoyed the trial..
---
I found my first explosive weapon at level 40 and then nothing for a long time. I find them occasionally now. It seems like if you have them stashed or are carrying them you find more of them.  Not just explosive stuff either. I find 1 instigating weapon then find 2 or 3 more in short order.  
---
Seems the same with armor. I looked forever for sentinel and finally found a piece. Now I have a full set and find it regularly. Maybe it's just recency bias, idk.
---
You are strong and wise u/ScarySkeleton24 and I am very proud of you.
---
The event can still be done, but there's no way to get people to come to it.
---
Ive found the stealth boys don't work everyday 20 hours slight longer they take to Respawn I don't know why.
---
TL;DR: Doesn't matter. Don't read if you're just going to paint me as a butthurt critic. If you feel that my arguments are invalid, then dispute them in writing.
---
&gt;I‚Äôm done trusting the public with the quality of games. 
---
You are a fool. The current state of the game does not change what the game was. If you had bought the game at launch after all the bad reviews and then made this comment, then it would be fine, but you're having a different experience than many of us OG's, and as such, you can't say that the reviews at launch weren't trustworthy.
---
&gt; I have had a blast exploring and building houses, and I have played for hours and haven‚Äôt even started a quest 
---
That's what I did too. My most fun of the game came from about lvl 1 to 30, because the world was dangerous and exciting. I went around as a tourist taking pictures of neat places I came across. But once you explore everything, you realize that there aren't that many quests. In FO4, there was over 140 quests. In FO76, there's 40 (or at least were). Many of these quests are small, and I got through many of them in 10 minutes. The game has dailys and events, but those are just activities for you to have something to do. And now I'm (only) lvl 126, and I have nothing to do in the game (I have played fo4 for over 600 hours, and I would bet that there's still stuff and quests that I haven't found. As a matter of fact, I just realized that I have never finished the main story in fo4. I got sidetracked). 
---
I have done all the quests ages ago. I have done all the activities. I have explored a large majority of the map (all the major locaitons. No point in exploring all the dead space). I basically go around building, scrapping, building, scrapping. 90% of the enemies I meet are pointless. They sometimes ambush me when I'm on my pip-boy screen, and I don't even stop what I'm doing, because they can't hurt me. 
---
The change in experience is vary apparent in the change in my character. I started off as a touristy well dressed guy, excited to explore all the world had to offer. Now I'm a grouchy guy in combat armour angry at all the stuff I have to deal with in the post-apocalyptic world.
---
&gt; The building in fo4 was my favorite part, and I love how much they added to it. 
---
80% of my time in FO4 was spent in building settlements, so what on earth are you talking about? Like really. The only new thing is basically build (almost) anywhere in a small area. 
---
The game uses many assets from fo4, yet it does not have half of the building assets from it. For example stairs. By the end of fo4 DLC releases, fo4 had a wide variety of possible stairs available. Even the OG stairs from fo4 could be much better placed than in fo76. I actually wouldn't be at all mad about the lack of variety in stairs, if we could place them on the side of floors like in fo4. They ported dragons from skyrim, why not stairs from fo4?
---
The game has some misguided goal of making buildings more realistic (my best guess why they did this) by having many placement limitations for various things, yet completely fail at whatever they were trying to achieve and only making it impossible to make things that any rational being would believe to be possible. You'll find this out when you're trying to build something and can't understand why one object doesn't attach to an another object. Like floors to foundations. And then you'll have to try to figure out how to work around these limitations, and it isn't always impossible.
---
Just yesterday I was building a nice place on top of Seneca rock which would have required attaching floors to foundation or floors to stone stairs. Neither of those things are possible. I tried to figure out a workaround for a couple of hours. I even restarted the build a couple of times to try and change the design in any way to make it work. I failed in the end, and decided to build something somewhere else.
---
Yeah, that's my major complaint for NW, you get more XP the for the less you do.
---
What system are you on? Cause I have some for sale,
---
But youtubers said it's bad, who are you to disagree?!
---
Do you know if its duped? I came across a level 40 TSE LMG Randomly at some camp and always wondered if it might be duped. Its lvl 40 tho if that makes a difference. I dont fully understand it.
---
Basically. At least there aren‚Äôt dances.
---
Yeah thats what i noticed.
---
Is that somebody you?
---
Glad to see another person accepting the newbies
---
So this may be spam (technically?) because I linked it in another thread, I'm sorry if it is, but I keep seeing the question coming up, and I made something to address it.
---
I run a fan-made radio station, and it can loop and shuffle so it performs just like a real radio in the game. Pull it up in your browser while you're playing and voila.
---
For other options, as suggested below, CONELRAD streamed from  youtube or searching for "fo4 diamond city radio" or "fnv mr new vegas" will give you streams of that game's music as well.
---
But this sentiment is why I made the station : the radios feel so empty. There's no deejay, there's nothing to..stick. We don't have Three-Dog howling about the good fight. We don't have Travis tripping over equipment screaming we're all gonna die. Mr. New Vegas isn't coming on too strong. It's just music loops.
---
I really miss the human element of radio. Radio is meant to entertain, to inform, to draw together...to blast 60 minute man while slaughtering Preston, to hear Johnny guitar for the 34780390th time..not to just be silent. 
---
Turning off the radio and just listening to the birds and ambience, (and ambient tracks) is nice. But every once in awhile. Just to relax. I want to sit down in my camp, flip on the radio, and hear a human voice, have something to laugh at, hear about a current game event, and get some more music,  you know? Hence making the station. Dorky little ads for Nuka Cola and Fancy Lads, a little more music to add to rotation, some honest West Virginia lore on ghosts and cryptids (I'm local to the area) and with podcasts? Story time.   
---
If you'd like to hear what it's all about, here's the trailer.  There's also a link to the radio station there. [https://youtu.be/Txm955QbPhA](https://youtu.be/Txm955QbPhA)
---
Or,  you can just jump straight there if you're so inclined :  [www.rbtsradio.org](https://www.rbtsradio.org)
---
Please Note : I'll be migrating servers soon. So, if you see the station go off air for a few days? It's not dead, I just had to migrate. It will still live at its current address.
---
You should be able to hard check the numbers by just turning on the floating damage numbers right? Just swap perks/weapons and look for a difference.
---
Welcome to the family. Enjoy the punch bowl(still trying to figure out how to fill it)
---
Pre ordered the game, it arrived a few days before Thanksgiving (Pretty sure...i was away when it came ) and have played pretty much every day for 2-4 hours. Love it and play filthy casual
---
Like some of the awesome songs that'd fit like: Bad Company, Gone Away, House of the Rising Sun?
---
Yeah it's Modern Rock music but we gotta remember that Tool, Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana existed in the Fallout timeline too so who's to say our Modern Rock music didn't exist too?
---
I'm on PC
---
Must be a bug
---
Yes! THIS, I love fallout 4, 3 and New Vegas and was so sad to see the bad publicity 76 has gotten, been playing it the last two weeks and couldn‚Äôt be happier! So happy to be in the fallout universe again!
---
It wouldn't be the same game.  Your pretty much describing a deathmatch type of game mode.  Don't get me wrong, deathmatch is a fun type of gamemode, but a key point in a good battle royal game is about gorilla warfare and using communication with your team to execute smart engagements.  Almost all of our friends loooove this type of play style.  We get some type of satisfaction when we notice our communication is getting better and better.  Than you have guns blazing type of style, which is fun in its own aspect, and some players still go guns blazing in battle royal and can pull it off with raw aiming talent. 
---
Sooner or later you will get to a point with your team where you start engaging more often because you get more confident, which leads to more deaths on your team, but it can be more enjoyable to switch it up.  Some teams will play more towards one way than the other, or a little bit of both.
---
So yeah its just a difference of opinion really, some might believe battle royal should lean more towards guns blazing, and others more towards Gorilla warfare.  I'm heavily on the latter, and I can get my deathmatch fix from counter strike or something.
---
Melee it can be really OP with the right build
---
I just peeked in there today for the first time. Discovered the train station and killed super mutants at the train yard for my Possum challenge, and that was enough. I'll come back later once I've explored that far. =P
---
I felt the same when I picked it up a few weeks back. My whole thing is that if something looks worthwhile, I generally try it despite what other say about it. I've found that some of my favorite games and music albums are the ones people circlejerk about and call the worst in the series or discography. I'm glad you have similar feelings on that front.
---
Kicking a rock in the street is fun with friends.
---
When the punching stops and the band cant play, you will rebuild.
---
My best NW moment was last night: I've gotten into the habit of using CAMPs to give myself shelter and fire cover, and one of my teammates (who was rather stoned) came barging in and distracted me to the point that I accidentally put a wall instead of a doorway, trapping us both in a room together. He immediately started complaining and calling me names and I just sat there hooting with laughter.
---
I have played almost every day since a week after relese when i bought it. I fully admit that the game is better now that it was but i have always loved it!
---
This is a mindless shameless comercial, most likely a paid opinion (how about you reply with 'no it's not', shill) 
---
No one, and i mean no one who loves this game doesn't have serious issues and constant misgivings, never ending loading screens, disconnects, bad servers, poorly coded quests, events, challenges, etc ... , and zenimax/bathesda like a scumball used car salesman in a cartoon start's telling us that that missing headlight is a feature or crying that the media has been mean to them (no, the bad press has been honest. Way more honesty than this advertisement post). Not even a slightly convincing one, though it seems a lot of the people reddit must have leming level iq. Maybe they're just working for the same company bathesda has hired to fix it's public relations nightmare? Zenimax/Bathesda could take responsibility and change their corporate culture, create and maintain some sort or work ethic that actually focuses on quality and substance but when you can just pay someone to lie about you and make you look good with profits, which Is doubly upsetting when you know that zenimax is a privately owned company and not beholden to it's stock holders)
---
In my opinion zenimax/bathesda owes every single beta player, every single pre-order player, every player who played fallout 76 in the first year (yeah, that's right. There are still bugs and glitches from day one in the game and unaddressed, and i don't see bathesda fixing them by November. Not without player feedback aka. Play testing). and anyone else who play tested their software for them compensation for their time. As they provided an incomplete product with claims of a finished one. They charged us for a finished product. They then used our complaints as product testing. If they're allowed to do this without consequence this will become the industry standard.
---
The game is beautiful, it's fun, there's a nice community, and it's getting better (i personally have broken quests challenges and events, constant disconnects, perks that don't work which make me wonder what else is just broken in the calculations for my particular character, visual glitches which are new with recent patches, slow loading times followed by slow rendering, occasional audio glitches, enemies that don't take damage, unresponsive trading screens, several social menue issues, and more) but zenimax/bathesda is going to have to actually do the work to finish and keep this game polished for as long as it's been broken pe longer before i start with the sort of mindless and obviously sponsored accolaids being reported to here. 
---
Zenimax/bathesda earned the bad press and they're not done fixing the problems that earned them that bad press. We shouldn't feed they're attempts to create acceptance of their faults when their faults lead to our expense.
---
Fuck yeah brother. Also be wary of the church at the western side of the map. Just, steer clear of it
---
How do so many for to nukes? See the alert, check map, run. I suppose if you're in the middle of a gun battle you could be distracted, but if not you have no excuse lol
---
You can't go wrong with either, really. I've even seen some good pistol vats builds.
---
Auto seems to be the way to go
---
Stop by EVERY camp and see whats for sale, always look for a bargain.  Try to befriend someone and go around destroying white spring with them.  Many higher level players are awesome with helping out.  And will often drop serums for lower players. 
---
Good luck!
---
Or add the arcade machines for our camps.
---
Did you mean "piece "?
---
&gt; 20 year old engine
---
[Ship of Theseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_theseus)
---
Unreal is a 20 year old engine as well. Engines are modular and can be upgraded. The age of the engine itself is mostly irrelevant. It's the modules that matter. Bethesda upgrades their modules every game.
---
This is the only online game that I play, so I can't compare to other games. But I thought the idea behind micro transactions is that they're small. You sucker people into paying cause it's only a buck or two or maybe 5. 
---
I only spend free atom points and still think the stuff is way over priced.
---
Don't give them any ideas!
---
I'd say that's a bit stretching it. The Red Scare related notes etc texts can be found in the world of Fallout which doesn't exactly tell about good relations. Also, at least in the lore the relationship seems to be a bit more wary with espionage and general distrust between the nations and the USSR never considered the US (or China) its ally.
---
And just because it‚Äôs called Deathclaw Island doesn‚Äôt mean there is actually a Deathclaw on it. That‚Äôs just silly.
---
I learned this lesson long ago but in recent years the public has gotten really bad. Both Battleborn and FO76 were torn apart for bullshit reasons at launch and both are excellent games. Let‚Äôs hope Fallout 76 lasts longer than Battleborn!
---
I was done trusting others opinions abou5 gam3s YEARS ago. Always try something for yourself, were all different.
---
If Sea if Thieves can do it, so can Bethesda.
---
I‚Äôm behind on the camera quest to be honest.... I have yet to find one!
---
Come on Todd, you're better than this.
---
Actually it‚Äôs super intuitive to have half-empty cores if you reload before they‚Äôre empty. The way reloading works in nearly every game (and reloading regular ammo in 76) is unintuitive. So you swap magazines before they‚Äôre empty yet magically recover whatever ammo was inside them. Sure- that makes perfect sense to me ;)
---
Let me know when it's my turn to post
---
I'll admit. I will be playing a lot more once the wastlanders call me about. But I kind of stopped playing after the sheepsquatch update. I haven't really tried Arktos yet, I did it once at the tail end of the event but didn't get to explore.
---
Its cute to see brand new players who waited
---
This long to play, come out and proclaim they love it after 5 hours played.
---
You also have Survival and NW to get into once you finish the main quest line.
---
Still has an amazing story and main character.  They patched it out like 76 though. The witcher 3 is better of you have read the books and played the games though.
---
Ready, set, GO!
---
I agree, the prices are stupid. Need to be tweaked.
---
Best and only good thing ive gotten from
---
Purveyor is a bloodied explosive Submachine gun "tommy gun"
---
Fortunately with Excavator armor and calibrated shocks I can take off most of the strength weight reduction perks and use the heavy gunner perks to fight.
---
Pc.
---
I can't find it in the atom store, they removed it?
---
That‚Äôs amazing.
---
Why would you say that? The game looks great.
---
It all depends on how you set up your build. There is no ‚Äúbetter‚Äù way to play. Buuut I would choose one or the other. Don‚Äôt be a jack of all trades and a master of none.
---
It's nice that you two work together, or is it just one sad fuck on two reddit accounts?
---
I'm really enjoying it. Played the free trial for 1 day on Wednesday and bought a steel book edition of the game form eBay for ¬£20 which I've switched over to now. I've played Fallout 3, New Vegas, 1 &amp; 2 (and Skyrim &amp; Oblivion)  and I'm liking the differences here.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to say it‚Äôs a bad game whatsoever. It‚Äôs fantastic. But they compared the state 76 launched in to Witcher 3 as it stands now which was completely unfair.
---
I‚Äôd have to know more to say agree on that. Is that a dumb pass time for that guy and he simply uses his freedom to kill whoever he likes, or does he target one specific player and gives him a bad time?
---
I take it you‚Äôre not a fan?
---
"Yah best start believin' in paid beta tests disguised as a released game, yeh're in one!"
---
In fallout 1 one of the playable characters ancestors was a soviet ambassador
---
During the beta I was way too excited. I called out of work one day and skipped school another day just so I could play the beta on all of the beta days.
---
Same with cap stashes
---
Do you have stuff like:
---
Missiles or mini nukes they weigh a lot.
---
Ore, it can weigh you down. And gunpowder.
---
Sure man Ill add you on discord , Ill be working for next few weeks soo I will wait patiently.
---
You can't always trust the court of public opinion. I never expect a launch to go easy. I can count on one hand each time a game launch has gone smoothly for me, but I'll need some help counting the times I nearly threw my computer monitor out the window from frustration because the loader was pissing me off.
---
I told a coworker that I was excited about Fallout 76 before it came out. He told me he wasn't going to buy it because he heard it sucked and he had already decided he didn't like it. He kept putting the game down and it wasn't even BETA time yet. I told him "I won't know if I like it until I play it. Maybe it'll be awesome and I'll enjoy every minute of it. Maybe it'll suck and I'll never touch it again. We'll just have to see." He asked "But aren't you afraid of wasting all that money?" I said, "Yes, I am. But I've wasted more than 60 bucks on stupider shit. You're always going in blind with a game. Just because some jackass on Youtube liked it doesn't mean you will. Same with if he didn't like it. Again, we'll just have to wait and see."
---
I've had my ups and downs with Fallout 76, but I guess I do enjoy it. I wish they'd make it easier for people with no mikes to chat with other players, but at the moment, it is what it is.
---
That was one ot the first things I've noticed as a new player. I keep thinking "Man, I wish I could send a global message to get a group to raid this place." Such a disapointment.
---
I know what you mean. You're right. The witcher 3 is on a different level though. Looking forward to playing 76 tomorrow though.
---
Mostly yes. Few Griefers but thats any game. I liked always being out of supplies early game. Gives a nice challenge
---
Waaaaaat? I thought we were done with the faulty merchandise issues
---
Damn, someone went through the exact same images I was browsing after I saw the vehicle XD.
---
The firetruck is definitely another weird choice. However, the firetruck I saw in the game looked much more in-line with the art asset quality compared to the other vehicles present in the game. This bus, on the other hand, sticks out like a... Like a bus that doesn't belong there. Artwise or other.
---
Also, I got 5 3 star weapons today in 2 hour game play. Than gambled for 2, 3 star armor and a 3 star ranged weapon. Haven't even been serious today. This guy is full of shit.
---
There are many, many very friendly and nice people in this game :)
---
I'm not a shill
---
I was really surprised how much adventure mode do I was getting from dieing pointlessly in NW (I really suck at deathmatches in general, and shooting players bothers me - ultimate carebear, and happy with it). I levelled from 37 to 39 just losing matches - generally pretty fast.
---
So I started a game solo, aiming towards the middle. Hid in a bush. Read my Kindle, occasionally reaching out to the mouse. I made the final 5, and died. login to adventure - sure enough, I dinged 40 for my bush experience.
---
Not sure it should work like that.
---
This sounds fucking awesome, I gotta get in on this. Lately I‚Äôve been sleeping on NW, I got the update last night.
---
same happening to me. the Kill Creatures isn't registering.
---
Did I say it was unrealistic? Honestly what a disturbing response I hope to god you‚Äôre not serious.
---
It would be irrelevant if the games they released didn‚Äôt all have a pattern of game breaking bugs, physics errors, unrendered textures, and crashes.  But they do, so not exactly a compelling argument. There is a reason Bethesda is a meme for bugs.
---
Well money is not really that good atm but I got like 20$ saved up , and on a plus side I dont have to wait for the copy to get to me I can just buy it in the store. Soo Ill pick it up today.
---
Goddamn squeakers. I have one bugging me in Adventure Mode who has a really bad echoey mic and also keeps asking dumb questions about the franchise despite claiming to have played every single Fallout game.
---
Pretty much ye once you get to the higher levels you end up with so much stuff that you're basically forced to give it away for inventory space and stash space lol
---
Awesome to hear , thank you for a reply.
---
You need to go to the atom shop and click the button to favor for ne and most stuff will show up there . Just remember bright colors show up and emotes are not only seen by your team. Welcome to the wasteland my friend.
---
?? It's the people who got hands-on during E3 that said that, obviously NDA for now but as always things slip.
---
Well done.
---
Got my first today with 2 kills and a well placed camp. Got an xp of 922.
---
Thank you Todd very cool
---
Not a fan of deceit. When scab advertisers hire people to hype up some sale like they're part of the community. 
---
The community already knows me and weather or not I'm a 'fan'.
---
On the cover of a tesla science magazines
---
Dude or dudet, NW is so much fun. Come join the party lol. Bes ready did hit a home run here imo
---
Well I can only get one shotted by certain weapons, others only drop me to nearly dead and I usually get killed on the 2nd shot anyway but getting killed in one shot is another story. Explosive rifles also can't one shot me even tho the damage should be able to. I think the game has a max amount of your health that can be taken out in one shot, some weapons like the Tesla in my experience can bypass that rule. I once let a guy kill me over and over and over to try and see if it was one or two shots and he literally just let me stand there and take him to almost dead then he would one shot me with the Tesla and emote like he knew exactly what I was thinking. I wasn't mad at him I just wondered if the game was supposed to be like that or not
---
Yup.  I love seeing all the new players in Adventure Mode, but I'm looking forward to playing NW without all the toxic free trial people.
---
If it weren‚Äôt for the server going down every 10 minutes I‚Äôd like it more. It‚Äôs a great game but I can‚Äôt stand how often the servers go down.
---
Damn I'm on ps4
---
Can i have more should I posts?
---
Wrong account man, go back to the one you used to post.
---
Het man you playing?
---
No idea üòÇ but it definitely got a few people. This was at the end so the circle was small.
---
Hot damn! Do you know how much the succulents are on sale?

One of the best experiences I've had with this game is the random group of guys I found and tagged along with. I didn't have a mic at the time so they were talking and I could only emote and jump. But man was that fun. Later my social anxiety kicked in and I actually blocked them so they wouldn't see I was on and try to join me. I try playing with my wife, but try as I might I can't teach a non gamer to play a multiplayer online shooter without them getting frustrated and quitting.

Cool. You can take off your tinfoil hat. I‚Äôm a legitimate fan who read the news splash and conveyed the information in hopes of growing our community.
---
I always say make your own opinion about games.

Welcome to West Virginia vault dweller
---
How about magazine locations??? That would be a good one... fossil locations.. various other things for the scouts
---
Did I say unrealistic?
---
I like to hang on a bit and watch. You learn things. Unless they're hackers/exploiters, then you don't learn a thing.
---
I can‚Äôt seem to find the article I remembered but swear down it was almost word for word on that title, lol.
---
SPF 1000 Man works good. I had sunroof for a month or so when one day I tried again and then Suddenly they went to together with ease.  Since then I've relocate my camp and I'm glad I kept the bottle because the fallout roof Gods clearly think it's funny because I have another sunroof.
---
Compared to other competitive multiplayers, is it easy to get into? I haven‚Äôt played competitive shooters in awhile.
---
Ah yeah that's unfortunate, would have been cool for it to be the same match, but yeah man still would like to see stuff like that since nothing that cool ever happens when I'm playing.
---
Good luck with the move, always a bit hectic/stressful.
---
Very nice summary.  Just adding:  fashion.  Lots of outfits to find, buy, or trade.  The real endgame.  üòâ
---
Wow, I expected backlash from this comment. Seems other people feel the same way.
---
Sorry for asking, but what is a "Lore friendly" camp?
---
*nervous laughter*
---
Ive gone from 8 to 1 and back- god do i want to be closer to 15 than 1 endurance for sure.
---
If they do it at all it will only be with Fallout 4 map
---
Lmao, not a good analogy at all. Bethesda ass kisser.
---
No- it‚Äôs just atom shop purchases. Also, the atom shop stuff is mostly top layers, so once you equip armor you default back to your jumpsuit or go naked. Kinda weird- must be related to visually displaying the armor of people in-game (since in adventure mode all over layers hide armor pieces)
---
This is what I've been telling people and no one believes me :c
---
Well I'm part of a clan and we have a lot of regulars who play. It an over 18 clan so no bs. Hit me up if you ever want to tag along.
---
The ultracite version does as much damage as a primed regular gatling laser. An extra 30%, I think. 
---
Still, I'd go with the furious one. And prime it.
---
Using old looking wood and such and doesn't look new... it has been twenty odd years since the great war. So I want to see camps using tents and old wood and looking like s\*it. Nothing too brand new.
---
I have the same problem from yesterday but it changed from stuck at about 57/57 GB to 7.95/7.94 GB for some reason. Yesterday while downloading the download speed was pretty slow so I don't wanna try to cancel and reinstall.
---
the gat and the .50 are both major league beasts.  the gatling plasma is a serious mower as well.
---
My mistake, it was a 1 star: https://i.imgur.com/LBD81hV.png
---
Heh, gorilla warfare.
---
it does not?
---
I picked the game up during the first few days of the sale on xbone and ran into some genuinely nice people in adventure mode.
---
Yes. There were some amount of citizens visiting each country but it was still more or less the Cold War.
---
I kind of disagree. I have completed every mission besides pharma and play daily. I am currently working my way through all the challenges. Every day is a new adventure, someone‚Äôs new camp to visit and now with the NC it just adds to the fun. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
I‚Äôm online, but I‚Äôm installing. I added you the other day. My tag is Stiicky xD
---
We can play the technicality and talk about how you said it‚Äôs intuitive to have a billion left over nearly useless cores cluttering your inventory. I gave you the benefit of the doubt assuming you wanted to discuss how in reality bullets don‚Äôt warp from a swapped mag back into backpack but I guess that was a silly thing to do
---
Yeah. I pre-ordered the game, and haven't spent a dime on atoms because they're so expensive. If they want me to buy atoms, then they're going to need to give me more for my money.
---
Just dont go energy weapons if most of the stuff I've seen is any indication of late game energy weapons
---
you will get some perks @ later levels which will help you make more ammo easier, as well as knowledge from experience on how to manage your ammo supply better.  hang in there.
---
I‚Äôd say most people are like this ingame. Especially once they tweaked pvp rules- it cut down on griefing 98% and now most ppl are helpful
---
The ammo for the 50 cal is pretty inexpensive to make, it's accurate, and it's also one of the better guns in NW to be experienced with. Good choice overall. 
---
The LMG is very accurate when aiming in 1st person, and while the ammo isn't plentiful when you craft it at home there are many enemies who use it. It seems more aesthetically reasonable to carry an LMG than a 50 cal, as well
---
The cryolater is a good support gun as it can slow and freeze larger or tougher enemies. If you add the crystalizing barrel it also shoots snowballs
---
Flamethrowers are all style and ammo consumption. They're good for surpressing or for large groups of small things
---
The best heavy gun in the game for ammunition, damage, and usability is probably a gatling plasma. Hard to find but very very useable, even by people with no perks in heavy weapons
---
Let's not forget how Sim City was unplayable for a month or it took 8 months for Mass Effect Andromeda or how poorly optimized Ubisoft and Square Enix games are. Oh wait Bethesda must be the worst by default. Let's be honest people only bought the collectors edition for the helmet. It just sounds like more nitpicking for reasons to hate Bethesda for the sake of hating.
---
Let's not forget all the good Bethesda does for their fans. They forever immortalized fans who had a terminal illness in Skyrim and Fallout 4. They sent a guy a free copy of Fallout 4 to a guy who sent in boxes of caps. They were one of the first big game companies to develop major games for VR. They helped bring smaller studios like Arkane, Tango, and I'd Software to the forefront. If they never picked up development for Elder Scrolls and Fallout the broader audience wouldn't know they existed. But let's forget those things ever happened and pretend Bethesda are ran by demons raising pitchforks who don't care about their fans.
---
You change your perks just to fact travel? I hate not being able to sprint, so I keep my weight reduction perks active 100% of the time. Same for lockpick, I don‚Äôt want to pause the game and change perk cards around just to pick a lock.
---
Don‚Äôt ignore melee even if you go ranged- is helpful when a cloud of ghouls surrounds you.
---
Hmm, I'm like lvl 115 or something and I'm pretty sure I don't have that recipe either. I know I can make glowing blood packs, but I've never seen normal ones be an option... Damnit!
---
The vendor spawns near Lady Janet's Soft Server, and honestly I've gotten it more often there than Charleston. I used to get upset about camps there, too, until I realized about LJSS.
---
I've never bought atoms because I can't justify spending 7 real human dollars on a single in-game skin. Of everything was $1 or $2 I would have spent probably $40 so far. There's alot of cool stuff in the shop, but not for the prices they have.
---
There is guaranteed grafton monster on grafton day event. In grafton
---
Ultracite gatling lasers use regular cores. They are just an upgraded version of the base weapon. 
---
Ultracite cores are for primed gatling lasers.
---
You can prime an ultracite gatling laser, there is a plan for it.
---
I used to have the same trouble early on, I think most all of us did with enough junk to keep up and aid to stay alive. But yeah after a certain point you acquire most weapons and armor you want (Legendaries) so you have loads of junk that adds up because you‚Äôre almost never crafting gear only repairs. As far as aid items doing 1-2 events a day makes you almost have to much of it and/or crafting them once you have the recipes. I like doing the same for people... helps them survive and helps me keep my stash weight at a reasonable level (I‚Äôm level 235) glad you‚Äôre having good experiences:)
---
I‚Äôve enjoyed the game so far off free trial. My friend told me of a deal you can get the Tricentennial Edition at walmart for $19.99 right now... my walmarts shelf price said $49.99 they were completely shocked when they scanned it when it said $19.99 lol
---
Haha. I just tried to sound clever with the title and also cram everything relevant in it.
---
Strictly speaking about BR games, this was the easiest for me, but that's because I didnt have to learn new controls or gameplay gimmicks.   It's not as clean a shooter as Destiny, Battlefield or Cod though.
---
Nice, it may need an update but other than that it's all good to go. If you want to explore the wasteland with someone send me your GT on xbox.
---
&gt;Bethesda bans for griefing so if you admit killing level 1s fresh out the vault is griefing then you agree it is against the rules.
---
You're so full of shit your eyes are turning brown. The only people BGS have banned were people using CheatEngine and similar cheat programs.
---
Stop spreading bullshit.
---
I don‚Äôt know what the prices are on the PC but the Xbox/PS4 prices are justified as PS4/Xbox do take a cut.
---
Did you hit level 50 while in the beta?
---
Not at all? Did you read it?
---
Ahh dangit, I'm playing on xbox.
---
Exactly. I once saw multiple comments on a jateful Fallout 76 youtube video that did this exact thing. Their "rebuttal" to people in the comments saying it wasn't actually that bad was that the reviews were awful, and that's why they shouldn't like the game. I just despise how much the media and "critic" reviews affect everyone's "opinion" of the game being reviewed.
---
I tried finding that one but have been unable as of yet
---
Also: I forgot about the missile launcher despite how cool I think it is. That should tell you everything about my experiences with it ("So cool!" *never uses it*)
---
Probably going be missed but yeah here is my take a a beta player and launch player since day one.
---
The public was not wrong, the game was a buggy mess, servers crashed constantly and there were many exploits and I even did some (not duping but level farming ones)
---
There was no end game content and there still is a weak one but with the legendary vendor bot it has gotten a lot better.
---
Pvp was a mess and still is and people abused workshop pacifist glitch back then.
---
That being said there was a gem of a game under all that rubbish us vets had to endure and we are oh so close to reaching the game on what it should have been.
---
But I will say I‚Äôm glad for the influx of new players and I‚Äôm glad Bethesda‚Äôs is doing good unlike the other company that starts with a B 
---
They been working hard to improve the game for the new people and I can‚Äôt wait to see what‚Äôs in store for the future.
---
Exactly.
---
Stuff like this shouldn't be in the atom shop if the intent is its free. Should be included in the base game portion, especially considering its function.
---
I was joking ;D Check my history, it's beyond me how people are happily defending this shit show
---
Wanna pm me yours? I'm not really sure what mine is, just bought the xbox couple days ago
---
No idea. I have played almost daily since beta, I'm on my 6th and probably permanent toon. For a while the game was straight up garbage, and I still played daily even when I was getting dropped every 15 mins. This is a good solid game, but it's not a life changing experience. It's just a very fun and challenging game with some very rough parts, surrounded by amazing wonderful parts. I voice my opinion and people accuse me of not playing or hating the game, even now.
---
www.eurogamer.net/amp/2018-11-30-bethesda-bans-fallout-76-player-for-life-following-shocking-homophobic-attack
---
Try to ignore it.   It‚Äôs the opposite side of the spectrum from the irrational fo76 haters that tried to destroy it at launch.   
---
Enjoy the game!  (I do, warts and all)
---
TLDR; f em.  
---
Peace
---
This is true, but I‚Äôve found the real fun when the fire starts getting on the 3+ circle and you catch people moving in from cover.  Have had lots of fun fights with the fire chasing me or others.
---
That first one is so close, except the one im looking for actually had a small dock at the bottom of the stairs. The pond was a bit larger as well. Ive tried googling ponds in game and there seems to be nothing out there.
---
Not sure but I'd jump on it, sale might be over.  I think it was less than 200.
---
They tend to be a frequent sale item though.
---
Today I got to 3rd place after an hour just by minding my own business. Looting and killing monsters. Wtf :/
---
Add me. My GT is the same as my Reddit. I picked it up during the sale and I'm loving it. I've pretty much played solo the entire time so itd be cool to team up and tackle some of the more interesting things. I made the mistake of building my house next to a Deathclaw Matriarch spawn but you're welcome to visit lol
---
Ahahaha also subbed to r/childfree and assumed this post was from there at first
---
Could be like Mr New Vegas where it's an automated AI, although much less capable.
---
I like critikal but even I, someone who absolutely despises BRs, had fun in NW for a few matches
---
lol, I make use of a lot of the ammo you're calling "useless". Very useable useless ammo, apparently
---
stop watching..
---
vote with your feet...
---
The game was pretty bad at the start. Crashing all the time and server issues. I think some people have grown so fed up with any hate that they just don‚Äôt want it even if the hate is sometimes deserved. Without the hate Bethesda would not have fixed half the issues with the game
---
Just sent it. I will be on in a couple hours.
---
I just completed this quest today. It was brutal. Luckily I ran into another wastelander who worked with me to find the various forms and stuff.
---
Nice. The purveyor never gives me any love.
---
Yeah i found this one, but its not the one I lost. I do like the area though.
---
Of course you know people that have hacks
---
Idk why everyone loves nuclear winter to be fair. Compared to other battle royale games I‚Äôve played, it‚Äôs terrible. Mainly the movement system isn‚Äôt the best, the game is slow and glitchy still, and mainly it‚Äôs sooo slow paced. It has a good concept but the fallout movement system and bugs ruin it for me.
---
The only way to fix this is to start a new character this happened when I hit level 25
---
That's so silly though how do people even know whether you have or have not played the game in the first place? And why does it affect them whether you like, dislike, love or hate it? It's just so weird and it seems damaging to care so deeply that random people on the internet love what you do. 
---
Good for you though for playing it for so long yet still being able to be objective about it and see both sides. I'll happily admit the game for sure has some good elements to it from what I've experienced so far üëçüèª
---
Added you
---
I mean you could go to r/Fallout and say 76 is a good game or that you don't like New Vegas and you'd probably get similar threats. Some people are trash, I don't think that has anything to do with the game. Play it if you like, or don't if you didn't like it. At the end of the day, I don't think anyone really cares. Pretty sure 99% of people would tell you that their experiences with the game's community has been amiable, so it's your choice if that's your metric. We appreciate that you informed us about some toxic members of the sub, I'm sure the mods will keep an eye out for them. But announcing your departure is something no one cares about and it comes about as melodramatic on your part, whether that was your intention or not.
---
I'm guessing they've bought it down for maintenance since it was usually saying that 2/5 of the sludge was collected at the beginning
---
My current camp is just the "wood" walls and floors, it's on stilts over the mire. I have some crops and a single turret, since I'm somewhat on an island and enemies have to come from one direction. Everything is ramshackle and it's just one room with a flat roof and an outside fireplace. The only " new" thing I have is that fish lamp from the atomic shop because it's awesome.
---
Fossils were added after my data were exported but magazines are on a map along with bobbleheads and caps stashes
---
I actually agree with you, I rarely watch YouTube gamers nowadays, for some reason with was in my recommend
---
Wow with that i can farm a grafton of grafton monsters
---
Him: "If I'm going down, I'm taking you all with me"
---
Cause there‚Äôs equal levels of crazy on the other side. They must balance each other out.
---
It's kind of weird of you to focus on the quality of the OP's testicles
---
If you have any pics, I would like to see it if possible,
---
Thanks I will try, just was a bit off-putting to be met with so much instant hostility just for voicing my opinion, never encountered that level of vitriol even in other controversial places like the Anthem or No Man's Sky subs. 
---
I am curious though, what do you mean people tried to destroy the game at launch? Why and how??
---
Put ammo in vending machine. Sell for caps. Use caps to  purchase other ammo. 
---
Converted.
---
Hehe, just read your comment again. Looks like it happened
---
Then again, Mercedes Benz plants were located in Stuttgart, I believe, which was located in West Germany in the area occupied by the American Forces. Same with Japan.
---
I do, but every MP game has text chat. It's useful even if you have voice chat.
---
Welcome to the wastelands!
---
Then why are you watching him - or any YouTuber you disagree with for that matter? He just sounds like the stereotypical whiny, clickbaity twenty-something YouTuber who thinks they're a genius because they got 200K subs from a bunch of 12-year-olds who think their crass humour is edgey.
---
Seeing as I am a modder having friends with consoles that can run custom code is very important for testing, yes.
---
Because map files take up space.
---
Balance in the Force.
---
I can throw some up tommorow, I'm away on business for the day
---
True, all things must be perfectly balanced lol. Although in this case I think it would be better if just both sides didn't exist.
---
Buying multiple copies of the game just to store shit. WTF?
---
People are crazy.
---
Never seen one in the wild or managed to get one from the purveyor so bit the bullet and shelled out on a TSE shotty today. 
---
It's really fun but there's definitely better weapons out there.
---
No problem...
---
Agreed, 100%. I downloaded it last night and I‚Äôm *fucking loving it*. Definitely gonna buy.
---
I believe many like it because it is slower. Most Fallout players are not used to fast paced shooting. The fact that NW can be played strategically and not just with precise sniping skills has been a selling point to a lot of players.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Who the fuck is upvoting this bullshit. BGS hasn't released any sales figures, so VG has no way of knowing the actual numbers. 
---
If you believe this shit I've got a bridge over the new river gorge to sell you.
---
Gotcha that makes sense to me
---
you an sell ammo in vending machines at train stations?
---
if so, does this include syringer and cannon balls?
---
personally i'd just rather convert if possible.
---
Aww, man :/
---
You're in the Fallout 76 subreddit to be fair, so naturally you're going to see lots of fans here, and many of those fans have invested hundreds of hours into this game. That can make them feel quite defensive when people call the game shit and indirectly question why they'd 'waste' all those hours on it. But it's the same with all subreddits; head over to /r/Fallout, tell them you think New Vegas was shit, and Fallout 76 is the best Fallout ever made. You'll soon be downvoted into oblivion.
---
I like him but for someone who uses cuss words like a kindergartner it's hard for me to watch him at all, just a tad immature for me dawg
---
I think it was a joke like he was making an example of everyone who hates the game
---
Boo hoo. Let the man play the mode how he wants.
---
Wanted to see how much bullshit he was gonna say
---
Waaaaat? A game that offers players a chance to RP as a raider and where everyone in West Virginia was either tortured, eaten, starved, violently injured, suicidal, or murdered isn't for all ages??  :-p
---
I‚Äôve made mine look into a somewhat condo with the brick building set and put it close to a city so it kind of looks like it belongs there. It‚Äôs a 2 story first is the garage for the workshop and there‚Äôs stairs on both sides leading up to two room one for a personal room/trophy room and the second is my store.
---
Good to know
---
And get reward from grafton mayor
---
Ya it took me a little while to learn this also lol
---
In your vending machine. Or collect a bunch and post it here. Someone will buy in bulk because mining lead and acid is a chore.
---
Iv never maxed out my stash ever. Even before they increased it. Am i the only one?
---
Nah.  Game launched November 14th.  OP is 5 months early.  lol
---
In case you didn't know, TSE'S are no longer the meta as it has been nerfed to bits. I only keep my legacy TSE's for nostalgia, TS buff is now at 25% instead of the then 100% and explosive buff is now 20% from the 100% it used to be. 
---
Now there are quite a few meta builds in which in your case you might end up considering game breaking and overly OP if you still consider a TSE weapon OP. And a lot of it doesn't involve explosive on the weapons legendary rolls either.
---
Same! I did a double take, haha
---
But in the lobby you see all the emotes though ;) same in game currently. I'm sure it will change in the future.
---
Glancing at your other post, the way you worded it was a lot more aggressive than you're making it out here.  You weren't offering constructive criticism, you were just bashing on the game.  It's probably not what you said, but how you said it.
---
Actually r/Fallout seems pretty okay, seen a few both positive and negative posts about 76 over there lately and I haven't seen any really nasty comments, even once when I posted years ago that I thought New Vegas's map was a bit empty and some other kind of trivial criticisms. Maybe I was just lucky though. 
---
However I'm not sure what you mean by I was announcing my departure? I'm not sure how I can depart from the game when I don't even properly own it yet? Maybe the end line was a bit confusing so I deleted that just in case. However the post isn't about me whatsoever it's just a discussion piece on why some people get so illogically defensive and aggressive about something as simple as a video game. 
---
Sorry if it read as something else due to my own experiences included in it, I'll look at rewriting it maybe.
---
yeah it‚Äôs fairly weird to me and i‚Äôve never played BR until this game.... and... isn‚Äôt BR supposed
---
to be every-man-for-himself kind of thing? wish there was a mode with no teams
---
When I was your level, months ago, I got helped the same way, and now I try to return the favour for low levels I see. I think the initial community was so helpful that it has stayed that way since then. Also, later on you'll find too many items to use yourself, so helping low levels also helps one lessen their own load.
---
One of the complaints I saw the most about FO76 was inconsistent lore within its own universe
---
Didn't preorder but have played since launch. I remember the 200 stash limit! Lol. It had its ups and downs but I enjoyed the game even when people were talking sh*t about it. I think it has come a loooong way. And is headed for something even more revolutionary in the fallout universe. Some of the greatest inventions in history were scorned and mocked because of failures and hiccups.
---
Not once did I feel I was ripped off or that the game was a cash grab. Bethesda was testing the water and I knew the game would grow into what it is today and continue to get better. Its the perfect game. It has no END. And unlimited directions it can go. I paid 60 bucks for an endless game. How many developers offer you that? Make Appalachia Great Again!üòâ
---
i don't want to set up a  store just to sell ammo for caps.
---
&gt; Mainly the movement system isn‚Äôt the best
---
I'm a big fan of Respawn Entertainment; Titanfall and Apex Legends are two of my favourite shooters this generation. I'd like to think I know a thing or two about good movement systems from playing their games. But I still enjoy Fallout 76 precisely because it has a simplistic movement system and gunplay. I like how the gameplay focuses on RPG elements, is slower-paced, and how your FPS skills don't let you dominate so much. It's a refreshing change from other battle royale games. 
---
&gt; the game is slow and glitchy still
---
The glitches definitely need to be fixed though.
---
Ok, i'll keep an eye open for this. But are you sure it was in Vault 76 area ? There are forest outside of the forest region, like south of the savage divide. Lot of ponds there.
---
Agree. These things take years of work, frequently 80+ hour weeks at the end, and to have people react like that must be the worst. 
---
I felt this especially hard for the No Man's Sky dev team. This was a tiny dev team that worked round the clock to deliver one of the most ambitious games ever. The media (and their director) had hyped the game up beyond anything they could have possibly created. Then it comes out and... for an indie game it was actually pretty good. I had a solid 30+ hours of entertainment out of it before it got a bit repetitive. But it wasn't this enormous, life-changing, spend-years-of-your-life-playing game that people had decided it would be, and it became The Worst Game Ever, Sean Murray became The Greatest Archvillain In All of Video Games, and anybody who liked it was accused of being a "paid shill" by people who hadn't even played the game (sound familiar?). Thankfully they dedicated themselves to delivering on the game that was originally promised and now it's an incredible game for those that stuck around.
---
It's also important not to over saturated the landscape like fo4 and Skyrim both suffered from to a degree.
---
ok ill double check all that
---
Oceania is usually an awful place for matchmaking in video games. I see this exact same complaint - of matchmaking taking forever, that is to say - in the Battlefield V subreddit.
---
I‚Äôve seen people with skins and stuff in nw how‚Äôd they do that?
---
Glad you like it :) bethesda knew it was gonna be a rough start but they have awesome plans for the game and it's only gonna keep getting better with time
---
This guy never left either. Woot for the faithful! Lol.
---
Just my assessment.  Honestly, it‚Äôs not worth our time to rehash.  Happens to every games launch nowadays.   
---
Suffice it to say that manufactured controversy, sensationalism, and hyperbole drives clicks, ads, etc.  not just gaming sites, media in general too.
---
But you do realise your views push his stuff higher up in the YouTube algorithim, right? It's why clickbait titles, in the past things like the 'reply girl' scandal, and so on all exist on YouTube.
---
Fortunately, I'm on PC and can use Perk Loadout Manager. I have sets for fast-travel, melee fighting, heavy weapons fighting, and vendoring/crafting. I even have a 5th set for when I need to pick locks or search ammo containers.
---
like a vechs map with nuclear bombs ?
---
yeah I have been looking for that event for the last week now....
---
I'd consult an eye physician. If you think its a problem with the game, id create a new character or go in and out of nuclear winter. Could work.
---
I‚Äôm with you there, so many people talking about how much they love the game.  At first I enjoyed it, but now I largely don‚Äôt see the point everything endgame is so lack luster I just can‚Äôt enjoy it.  I want to be able to but I just can‚Äôt find a good enough game to keep me around for longer than a day or so
---
There was a time when this sub was flooded with "I'm quitting" posts, and people got really tired. The rest of your post is pretty valid though. Like I said, scum exist everywhere. I love the game too and I coukd perhaps persuade someone to try it out, but if they don't like it, fine. There are plenty of popular games I don't like too. No big deal. Games are meant to be for fun. No point getting nasty about how my way of having fun is superior to yours, or vice versa.
---
I tried it today and it didnt work.
---
Listen.  with enough practice I WILL master the tuba.  Thank you for your patience.
---
For PvE either way is perfectly viable. For PvP ranged is the way to go, hands down. AI enemies are dumb, so they‚Äôll let you get close enough to hit with a melee weapon. Humans...not so much.  I‚Äôd suggest making the decision based on necessary materials and side benefits. 
---
Melee means you won‚Äôt need to grind for lots of ammo, but you‚Äôll be taking a lot more hits‚Äîso you‚Äôll need materials to repair your armor far more often. The side benefit there is that you‚Äôll have lots of ammo to sell in your vending machines or to supply your friends with. Armor repairs can be irritating. Power armor requires some harder to find materials and regular armor needs ballistic fiber, which is particularly rare. 
---
Ranged means you‚Äôll need to grind materials to make ammo regularly, or caps to buy it from player vendors, but you‚Äôll also be able to do damage from relative safety and your armor will hold up much longer. Ammo requires lots of materials, but they‚Äôre common. 
---
Either way, you‚Äôll want a backup of each. Sometimes you just don‚Äôt want to bring a knife to a gunfight.
---
Is the USSR even still a thing in the Fallout universe? I think relations between Russia and America are cold, but I think China is always the main threat in the Fallout universe.
---
I'm on PC and can craft you some weapons and armor and whatnot if you like.
---
Right but both made the war machines for the said countries and retooled.

While I think the S.B's are mammals and thus don't lay eggs,i think the eggs could be juvenile S.Bs  cocooned in ultracite/fungus mesh to accelerate their growth via radiation and fungus providing nutrients.

You cant sink a boat thats destined to float.

I've seen it a couple times, but a game restart usually fixes it.
---
most of us want to have a good time. don‚Äôt ever let dildos discourage u
---
I haven't seen any that are character only.  Which ones are only characters that can be repeated if I make a new character?
---
Yeah. I think I spotted few mistakes during the week as we played it.
---
Iv never really trusted here say. I followed sea of theives for probly a year before it came out, got to participate in the technical alpha, the beta and the scale tests. I knew exactly what i was getting into when i started. I love that game and it gets better all the time. The same thing with 76. I love fallout and 76 is more, fun, fallout and i like it
---
Shhhh we are trying to appear altruistic üòâ
---
Literally my only issue is it being online. I wish I could just play with noone else, even though noone messes with me generally. And pause. The game is solid. Could do with NPCs, but it's literally the always online thing that bugs me.
---
Idk. I've had a decent time, but I feel constantly on edge anytime a PC is around, and sometimes I want to just pause and go make food or something.
---
Idk. Its better than the reviews, but I'm not sure it's for me as it is now. Glad I tried it though. I generally hate any form of pvp in games, and like doing things at my pace. Lack of pausing and the multiplayer just doesn't hit for me personally. Shame, because I'd love to keep exploring the world. Not sure if I'll end up buying.
---
I got that too. Relogging fixed it for me.
---
I'm a huge fan of fallout, and was excited for this game. But it was just, boring. The quests weren't fun. Just felt stale
---
Yep, the joys of a smaller population I guess. Would be helpful to be able to pick the region you want to play in, ping be damned.
---
1 problem with that idea

When i was your level, i was ballin in the garrahan estate with robobrain chicks at my side, gazing upon the wasteland in a velvet robe with my hands on the balcony saying "Wow, I'm the best at this game".

Jk i was getting slaughtered in wendigo cave. RIP me
---
It's Atomic Shop Outfits only, not underarmor.
---
Same issue here on console (xbox).... sitting in "finding a match" 
---
Yesterday had the same issue... promoted a US friend to team leader and we instantly got matched into a game
---
The USSR seemed to be in a bit of a Cold War-ish situation with the US, mostly due to capitalism and communism clashing. The relationship was not as strained as in our world and the main focus was on China. But the Red Scare is definitely part of the world, as a concept and not just from China but also the USSR.
---
As someone who has put many hundreds of hours into the game, rocky is an understatement for how this game started.  Launch night was abysmal and the first couple weeks were borderline unplayable for most people.  That said, the developers who have stuck around for the sustaining work have done a great job.  I believe these guys would have preferred the game didn‚Äôt ship in the forced state that the corporate suits required.  I appreciate where the game is now and the direction it‚Äôs going.  Glad you‚Äôre on board.
---
Neither. I recommend a naked throwing knife build.
---
I beat up Mole Miners for their clothes and weapons just to make 50 Caliber I'm far from altruistic at this point
---
No one ever said any of those things not did I ever claim Bethesda is the worst offender (it most certainly is not). But doing a good job does not make up for the bad nor does erase it. Mass effect andromeda will be forever remembered for the unplayable piece of garbage that it was. Really all you have done is support my argument that the only way to fix these issues is to start a shitstorm about them. It is abusing consumer confidence plain and simple and it is a behavior that deserves to be shut down as soon as possible but the worst offense the consumer shouldn‚Äôt NEED to start a shitstorm in order for a triple A company to produce a working product on full release or at the very least not outright lie to their customers.
---
And yes they did a great job with the release of NW, I am pretty happy with it. But that by no means makes any of the hate they got up until this point undeserved.
---
It doesn't matter to much if it's duped. If uts affordable and you like it then buy it :) theres no real way of being able to tell unless you see multiples of the same weapon and most the time you won't unless you're in sale groups. There is no real downside to using a duped weapon as long as you're not the one duping.
---
The Scorchbeast Queen is an actual enemy you fight already dude... they're bats but their sociatal structure and access to the Scorch is similar to those ants who weaponize Cordyceps.
---
Sigh. These threads always make me cringe. I've never seen a more contrarian fanbase.
---
There's currently a bug in the servers where you get stuck in the Finding a World or Joining Nuclear Winter screen. They posted it on their forum that they are working on a fix. Meanwhile, cancel the search. You will probably get an error message about Platform login failed or something. You'll need to log in and it shoukd work. Otherwise just restart the game. Frustrating bug, hope it gets fixed soon.
---
Sorry about that,
---
opinion "I actually like the game" was not publicly accepted and most people did not want to get stoned (or at least downvoted) so we, that actually like the game from the beginning, kept our opinion mostly for ourselves.
---
The game is in a way better place now and I'm is only getting better from here. I can only say that I'm glad more people are recognizing this fact and coming back to the game. Glad you approve and welcome to the wasteland. Hope to see you out there. :)
---
It's cool and fun to hate popular things. Everyone loves being a contrarian because they think it makes them unique
---
I liked both of those because there was so much to explore. It's why I played them for hundreds and in skyrims case thousands of hours.
---
glad things turned out this way for you!
---
You are doing them a favor by releasing them from their miserable existence.  Atom‚Äôs work. üòâ
---
And both countries were occupied by the US. The USSR wasn't, in either worlds, ours and Fallout's. If your theory would apply to the USSR it would mean something like the US occupying the USSR and then the Lada factories starting to export their cars to the US.
---
Platypusses (Platypi?) lay eggs and they're not an enclave experiment gone wrong so it wouldn't be too much of a stretch to have an explanation of cocoon eggs like you said.
---
Yes it does certain melee weapons like the meat hook can use both gladiator and unarmed also pipe bolt action pistol you can add a rifle stock and double dip on Riflemen perks and gun slinger
---
I took a photo if you want to check it out. I have gone in and out of different modes. I'll try a new character.

I run 3/9/2/4/8/15/15, Bloodied VATS Explosive Stealth. Don't have a BE Lever yet, and even then, single stealth shot damage with a Bloodied Lever is 1200ish torso, 1500ish head. Crits are 2500ish. Hard to complain about, kills almost everything in one shot.
---
I still haven't gotten to Diamond City
---
I believe the "this isn't fallout" line came around as a response to the idea of 76's new wasteland experience. In the other fallout titles you leave a vault and enter a wasteland full of wonder, terror, mystery, and most importantly, society. The social aspect. I appreciate what 76 is. It's unique. As a vault dweller in this title you conquer the wasteland. You create the society. It is just as Fallouty as any other title. More so, I'd dare to say. We get to experience the world after the great war for the first time. Not hundreds of years in, but 25. Society crumbled, the scorched emerged, those who were left fell prey to the elements and the scorched. Bethesda did a spectacular job with the environmental story telling. It's a new focal point in story telling for RPGs of that caliber. I love that the bots are still kicking, stuck in their programming, repeating tasks over and over. It's too real.
---
You can place a camp??!
---
South of marigold pavilion
---
Grafton monster can also appear instead.
---
Apart from Fallout 4, none of the maps from other games are up to the graphical fidelity of Fallout 76 and remastering them would probably take almost as much time as making new ones.
---
They turned off the working of the punch bowl because of some "issues". They'll turn it back on again later. Currently it doesn't work.
---
It‚Äôs vault raids, you and 7 others raid a vault
---
Christ on a 3 foot bicycle, thats one hell of a problem. Not sure if a new character would help. Did you experience these colours in the vault? If not, go into a building somewhere. Or reinstall.
---
Absolutely hate NW. not because it‚Äôs badly made I just don‚Äôt like no story and also I‚Äôm terrible at it but yeah. Wish I could filter them out
---
fun fact, cheaters who got into the dev room found a jet recipe in there. Jet wasn't in the chem containers though, so it might not be functional
---
W H A T, since when, were the Red Hot Chili Peppers and Nirvana included in Fallout lore? I'm genuinely curious.
---
Yup. Seems that way.
---
It was very rough at first but always had such promise that I stuck thru it and honestly, over time the value gained from the up front cost just goes up since you don't have to pay a monthly fee and don't have to buy micros. 
---
I think bsw deserves all of the criticism they received but they deserve some praise too for trying what they have with this game and making much of it work in the end.
---
It wasn't only about being paid for the opinion. It was the hate bandwagon, **just to get views!!!!!** Hell even channels that have nothing to do with games smashed the game with a fucking "worst game ever" score, only to get a chance with the youtube mechanism and win some free views.
---
Hey if the crew is responsible enough to patch it. Godspeed.

Power armour is definitely underpowered in NW.

Sigh. Comments like these from people like you always make me cringe. Free speech certainly has it's downfalls and you have made a shining example of that with your comment. Have a great weekend!

Doing the challenges. Or buying them.

Go auto.

You had me at crotchfruit

Yes I know, I was making a suggestion for another raid type.

I've been working on these challenges since they came out, and I just got enough possum badges for a high capacity backpack this week. Still got three more tadpole ones to go, too

Wait? You can move your characters from PS4 to PC?

---
The 50 cal is one of my favorite weapons in Nuclear Winter the Handmade is a close second congrats on the win.
---
Glad you are enjoying the game.
---
I have yet to play it. I have played every other game in the franchise since Fallout started. I have a hard stance against multiplayer games especially with microtranactions  and will be skipping this one. But it is nice to see that people are making up their own mind about it instead of following the herd. 
---
Keep enjoying the things you enjoy.
---
Then sell other stuff
---
Just because a different company does it worse, doesn‚Äôt mean this company is doing it right. I don‚Äôt play fortnite, I play fallout, hence I am here. If you think people should be mad about paying ¬£15 for a skin then that‚Äôs up to you
---
Thank you now I can stop smashing my action button.
---
You cannot compare sea of thieves to the launch of fo76 not even in the same ballpark. Has fo76 gotten better? Of course but it took over a year to get to where it should've been at launch
---
I imagine it does that because all armor drops as a full set
---
You've seen this specifically? https://imgur.com/2ZCNd94
---
I watched that video too, and I noticed he had to make a new character. this is what cemented the idea for me that he was jumping on board the hate train, since that was likely the first time he's played it. still though, just because you happen to disagree with his opinion (whether it's forced or not) doesn't mean you have to stop watching or try and boycott him. watch who you want, but a few disagreements shouldn't warp your entire view on somebody you like as a creator
---
I just went to the lighthouse and server skipped until I got the lady. Surprisingly didn‚Äôt take that long
---
Nuclear Winter
---
Thats the one, its no where near where I thought it was. Thank you!!
---
I added a vault photo, makes the character's model completely black. I could try to enter a building but it's near impossible to actually see what I'm doing.
---
I know the Gating is great that‚Äôs my main with my power armor.
---
How did r/Fallout take it? lol
---
Yeah I agree if stuff was cheaper I would definitely buy points more often and I think other people would too. I don‚Äôt mind supporting the game, they just need to make it a bit fairer for what you actually get
---
Yeah thats it, i literally just found found it.

---
I never left, I loved the game but I balanced it with COD BO4 until about a month ago when I joined the discord community for FO76
---
Yup that was the story of my 3 Charisma build when I went out and wasted 2 hours to find a Deathclaw only to learn they reformatted their taming.
---
Thanks for the help everyone. i finally found the right one.
---
That‚Äôs a lot lmao! I probably could have gotten more, but I was definitely more interested in score. If a player didn‚Äôt have score, I generally wouldn‚Äôt engage unless they were coming for me. 
---
So I wasn‚Äôt doing a lot of repetitive kills on respawning enemies.
---
In that case, you may want to take a look at the nexus. There's a couple of mods that'll really improve the game further, from a perk loadout mod, to text chat. The text chat really made the game feel alive for me, seeing people talk about what legendaries they got, or getting groups together for events.
---
lol.
---
I‚Äôve seen this before there, across the map in different locations there are many different writings like that on walls and boards with different drawing and things :) not sure anyone has figured out what they mean exactly though
---
Was it? I did say right at the very start that I thought the core game was fun and had some good ideas just that it was being held back by the old engine. And all the post was about was just why the old engine is being used, how it brings the game down and my worries for future Bethesda games because of their attitude towards it? If it came off aggressive for you then I'm sorry. I wasn't bashing on the game at all though merely the game engine which isn't unique to just 76.
---
Your case is really interesting. I would definitely consider reinstalling.
---
It's in adventure mode too, not a new thing :)
---
I too would love more music. Love wouldn‚Äôt it be nice. Blast it all the time. But music is expensive to use in games. Still never hurts to ask :)
---
Try to wait til level 50, to get at least 3-4 level 50 troubleshooter pieces of armor.  Use weaponsmith perk to repair 3-4 weapons to 200%.  Bring at least 12-15 stimpaks and 6-7 radaway.  The two assaultrons are best handled with the robot hacking perk.
---
It‚Äôs on the front not up like the BoS one.
---
Shall try this now, cheers!
---
I get where your coming from and I agreed with you :)
---
52 vs 52 baby!!!!
---
Didn‚Äôt mean to crush your hopes and dreams, it‚Äôs just the way the game is set up. It‚Äôs frustrating because there‚Äôs so much potential for different builds but none of them are viable because you can‚Äôt kill end game content. 
---
I‚Äôm over level 100 and it takes me forever to kill a level 50 scorch beast as a stealth sniper, whereas dudes half my level with a two shot explosive .50cal MG can down them in seconds. Currently the game is far too gear dependent.
---
U  rainium!!!  
---
U  rainium!!!!
---
I‚Äôve definitely run into them occasionally at vendors but it‚Äôs never the meta weapons like the handmade. I picked up a TSE LMG a while back and it‚Äôs a fun use of your .308 but it‚Äôs definitely not the meta without tank killer or armor piercing mods. I have a medics explosive 10mm for example that I find is much better because the fire rate keeps up with the LMG but the armour piercing edges it out. 
---
I doubt you‚Äôll ever see a legit TSE handmade though, it‚Äôs far too valuable of a weapon for someone to sell.
---
Okay yeah that I can agree with, unfortunately bad news seems to be far more interesting in our society than good news after all. However I do think it's a slim line between what's really just click bait and whats actual legitimate criticism of things and it's too easy for some people to lump both of those things together if it goes against their opinion. It's like an easy way to discredit that other persons view. 
---
In general though negativity sells far too well on the internet.
---
Dang, alright. For whatever reason the Bethesda launcher won't download quicker than 8mb/s even though there isn't a limit and my bandwidth should be much better than that. Not a great first impression for the launcher or Fallout 76.
---
Thanks for taking a look and replying though!

I love the mothman cryptid and was surprised you were giving these away, thanks for the card and I hope more people get these cute cards

Melee in PvP has been nerfed pretty hard from what it once was. Use to be really badass, now hits have a hard time connecting.

If you go to the Tyler county Fairgrounds and travel north east you will find a shack with a safe grave yard. Build a small base here as there is a junk extractor spot for easy early junk. Also inside the safe grave yard you will find a box of Bobby pins as well as 3-5 loose ones.

Yeah seen it, wanna know if its worn on face or top of head. If you look at the bottom of it, the place where someone would put it on is not face forward, but rather worn on the crown of the head. Unless there is some animation like the Assultron helmet and it comes down with weapons drawn, im afraid itll be topside only.

Awesome! Thanks for the input!

Thank you, Teeg!

You could barely even call ESO a "game" when it launched, it was more like a vacant, boring, hollow shell - the basest of foundations upon which a \*glorious\* online world would eventually be built.  Today, ESO is a \*nearly\* fantastic game with an amazing game world. 
---
Sadly, I find $15 a month "inventory tax" needed to make the game not be too tedious to play, to be a little too high of a price.  And, there are some glaring deficiencies in the mechanics of game play such as not being able to grab ledges, climb, wall jump, or anything really interesting besides not very exciting "running" and pitiful jumping ability.  So, the world is beautiful to \*look at\* but not thrilling to move around in.  Particularly disappointing if you want to be a stealthy ninja-like character such as a thief, who would scale walls, hid in the rafters, and tip toe across rooftops in the night.

Lol go away

I always need a few seconds to bang my head on the desk when the usual suspects start up with "BETHESDA SUCKS NEW VEGAS RULES!"

New Vegas was buggier at launch than 76.

You see the absurd irony in this? You haven't learned your lesson not to trust public opinion.
---
What is the difference between survival and adventure?

Thanks, so am i
---
Thanks for the flashback, gonna go play some adventure maps now.
---
I actually think its a great comparison. These are pretty much the only 2 games I play. 
---
SoT launch was buggy as hell (dont know how many times I have almodbearded, too many to count) was lacking in any substantial content and took about 5-6 months before any substantial content was added (forsaken shores)... Sound familiar? 
---
SoT is the main reason I was patient with 76
---
The easiest and quickest are the camera ones and you get quite a few I think. 20 of the same pic on all regions.
---
I have it yes.
---
I‚Äôve been screwed pretty hard by this. 
---
I saw someone make the suggestion of a compounding xp reward for scraping the extra (50 for the first card, 100 after the 2nd, 150 for the 3r... etc) I thought this was a good idea! Actually look forward to getting duplicates after awhile
---
That would be lovely, if its not a bother.
---
Yeah I get that, but they were both every condensed. I think having open spaces is important for a believable sense of scale. I'm probably in the minority but I think this is a  better map for that reason.
---
Awesome, thanks for letting me know!
---
Yeah I agree it‚Äôs weird it gets rid of the clothing you equip, I don‚Äôt mind it so much though only for 1 reason. I don‚Äôt use a mic when I go in unless it‚Äôs a preset team I go with, being able to see what armor my teammates have when I‚Äôm soloing helps me know to drop or be on the lookout for something better if they are running around with a wood set or a scout needing to changing to a marine set

My house is made from brick, but its covered in little bits and pieces that make it feel like home. It's got a personal feel to it where it actually seems like someone has been living in this little brick building on a foundation for the last few months.

He can have negative opinions on things? Like yeah I got a little annoyed listening to it but he's allowed to have an opinion about a game he's playing.
---
And he's done *one* video on it. It's not like he's pumping out video after video shitting on 76, someone convinced him to try the game during the free trial. I've been watching his videos for a long time, he *hated* Fallout 4, I'm honestly suprised he was willing to give 76 a shot at all.
---
But anyway yeah dude can dislike the game and talk about his dislike of the game on his channel if he wants to, it's not like he's trying to smear the good name of Bethesda and their wonderful products, he just didn't like 76.
---
Np glad I could clear it up for you :)

I thought it was probably a unibomber Easter egg since he was a mathematician and he lived in an isolated cabin when I first seen it but probably not

Sea of thieves was nowhere near as buggy as fallout 76. the only problem with sea of thieves at launch was that it was mostly barren, fallout 76 was not only super buggy but was also barren. pretty much once you beat the scorchbeast queen all you did was farm at White springs.  I closely followed both games when they launched and I would easily say sea of thieves came out ahead despite the empty content in the beginning.
---
ok then
---
Every game is fun with friends ???
---
You can see the challenges. Open the map and open the menu, go click challenges. From there just look for things you think you could do.
---
Well the current deal is really good. $10 for 1500 atoms 6 repair kit and Bosch jacket
---
Work with your team. It's more effective.
---
For lockpicking and hacking, i have the cards but dont have them selected unless i find a safe or terminal that needs them. If you do this you can run rifle perks until you need the other cards and just swap them out. 
---
Its a bit tedious if you need to do it a lot but it saves special points
---
people complain enough about wanting more points and cards.. and loadouts as it is.. sheesh...
---
No problem bud, glad I was able to help. That's an awesome location enjoy!!
---
Don't know, better blow it up just to be safe. Better dead than red, or in this case better to have a flaming wreckage than to be red
---
Heck yeah, +100% damage to monsters is a must.
---
Just because you don‚Äôt use a certain ammo doesn‚Äôt make it useless.
---
Place your camp where ever youre going to be farming.. keep it small so its easy to place. You can fast travel to your camp and to vault 76 for free.. 
---
so if you know you will be in say grafton for awhile place it somewhere in walking distance of grafton. Try to stay away from random spawn points and marked map locations (lessens chance of getting camp attacked and having to repair it). Be sure to scout area out good. Look for fissures to stay away from and so on. 
---
Inspirational in a party gives 5/10/15% xp bonus you could rank charisma up to 9 to share it then once you break 50 move a few points out of it to another stat. Im 280 and i still share a lvl 2 inspirational to help teammates out..

Find cranberry reslish recipe.. 10% xp bonus.. with rank 3 inspirational and cranberry relish thats 25% add in keeping well rested going you are getting 30% xp bonus.

You see someone fighting something shoot it.. it doesnt take anything from them but will get you xp when they kill it. You see players fighting a scorchbeast or deathclaw.. shoot it.. robots at whitesprings shooting something shoot it too but be ready to run incase they get killed lol
---
Plant crops.. atleast 10 of each, adhesive, food, corn and gourd soup easy to make and gets you through dry patches of not finding food.
---
Do events get plenty of rewards and rare plans and such from them.. jump to all you see any at.. make sure ya put junk in your stash and dont pick up anything until events over.. expect to die, just respawn dont wait for someone to stimpak ya.. shoot everything ya can atleast once.. like  for example the imposter sheepsquatch event just run in shoot at everything try not to get hit, if ya die respawn run and gun again.. events over win or lose pick up junk from the bodies then. Good way to get junk and a ton of xp.
---
I am of the camp that i believe you should avoid the main quest, mayor for a day, and miss nanny at wavy willards, and rose at top of the world until you are lvl 50. There are weapon quest rewards that better saved for when you are max level (50).
---
Id say anything except for like screws, adhesive, acid, lead, steel, springs, possibly gears (springs and gears maybe 150) be kept at 100 in your stash. Helps manage your stash weight.. screws are used in both weapon and armor repair so always look for fans and typewriters. Adhesive, acid, lead, steel, screws, gunpowder, ballistic fiber keep all of it.
---
Under level 40 i wouldnt worry about armor.  Dont repair it.. make new.. its cheaper resource wise. Unless you find a really nice piece close to your level.. its not worth repairing it.

Above 40/45/50 armor you want is gonna depend on build and playstyle autostim and lifesaving help alot and always good to have one of each unless you do a bloodied (low health) build then you wont want autostim. If you dont move much in a fight look for something with senitnel ( less dmg taken while not moving) if ya run and gun cavaliers? (Less damage taken while sprinting) then look for other perks on it action point refresh to refill your ap bar, or vanguards/bolstering and such to increase your defense, unyeilding if you wanna go bloodied (lower health for more damage) then +stat to your main stats.. like rifle build you would want perception.. shotgun/heavy gun/melee youd want + strength. Pistols +agility and so on.
---
Dont bother with mutations until you can get starched genes. Youd more than likely lose them.
---
About all i can think of at the moment.
---
You got upvoted mostly for the Cask of Amontillado reference, lol
---
Only buy stuff on steep sale, consider the use of earned atoms as a further discount, and buy large numbers of atoms to get the max bonus atoms . Then it's not so bad. It's really only if you're impatient that you feel the cost most.
---
Similar experience with a Scorch Beast a couple days ago.  I was engaged in fighting it when it disappeared.  But, in a certain area, I would get pummeled with rapid attacks that would break my PA and drain my health from full within seconds.  I tried to pick up my loot and it would just happen over and over.  Finally just gave up and quit.
---
Well atleast they did THAT justice haha.. they may have missed alot of other things but hey.. nice they gave respect
---
It really sucks because I don't even like be modes but I really want the rewards
---
$11?  how?
---
Love it!!
---
you wanna shoot bb's and .22 cal at death claws and and muties all day, that's on you.
---
i wasn't asking for anyone's approval or debate.
---
i love his work.
---
How much do you need? What price do you want to pay?
---
Trend setter!
---
üòÇclassic!!
---
What OP is talking about is the state of the game for AU and NZ. I suspect it's bug rather than a lack of people.
---
Oh
---
On PC yes I'm usually selling all the ammo types for 1-2 caps each
---
If you crouch you can not be targeted in vats. Keeps ppl honest about thier first shot at you!
---
If your gun is out and your standing your going to have a bad time from a vats sniperüò©
---
Try consuming one
---
Just saying that just because you say something doesn‚Äôt make it so each ammo has its place.
---
Have tried rebooting the game, Bethesda launcher, and my whole PC. If it's a bug then meh, hopefully patched soon but it was working fine yesterday. I think it will be a lack of people playing in my region.
---
TYFYS
---
I couldn‚Äôt find it think you can send a link?
---
And they can probably kill you ez
---
I know it sucks man
---
Early on, I would invest in these perks as soon as you can:
---
Super Duper (luck, potentially doubles any crafted item) 
---
Chemist (int, doubles crafted chems and medicines) 
---
Ammosmith (agi, increases amount of crafted ammo)
---
Bandolier (str, reduces ammo weight up to 90%)
---
Traveling Pharmacy (str, reduces Chem and med weight up to 90%)
---
Travel Agent (chr, reduces fast travel cap cost) 
---
Thru Hiker (agi, reduces food weight up to 90%, also applies to water) 
---
*if you plan to play a power armor build... 
---
Batteries Included (int, reduces weight of energy ammo by up to 90%, includes FUSION CORES) 
---
For things to do, I would head to the golf pro shop near Grafton. South of there is a crashed vertibird and close to that is a truck with a decent chance to spawn a 50 cal at level 25 (20 maybe?). 
---
Be on the lookout for spots on the map with resource deposits. You can build a camp on them and get free resources with an extractor. 
---
Plans are everywhere for cheap at player camps, but initially all you need are the basic crafting stations. 
---
Be weary of taking workshops. People can and will pvp you just for caps. Most of the time they aren't interested in the resources. Just your caps. If someone does this, just let them take the workshop. Nice players don't steal workshops.
---
That's what I did. I'm a huge Fallout and Bethesda fan, love all the previous games. But I wanted over 6 months to get Fallout 76, to let all the launch issues get addressed. So far the game has been very fun, and I missed most of the launch issues. Worked out pretty well.
---
Welcome to Appaliachia! Don't be a stranger, and watch out for deer.
---
All the YouTubers are still crapping on this game.  Angry Joe reveiw of BSG's E3 pretty much shows the bias.  Dell or whatever his reviewer's name kept throwing negative blurbsof FO76 without even trying the current version of the game.  AJ finally has to say they would re-review the game for NW while Dell kept on slandering the game.
---
Yeah that's something I thought about too. X-01 could be the rarest and have the stealth mod, T-60 with jetpack, T-51 with medic pump, Excavator with carry weigh and T-45 the most common PA without any mod.
---
i don‚Äôt usually enable them either, but i know in a silo i will need level 3 of both, and while i pause to swap them on i‚Äôd probably be destroyed by an assaultron :)
---
It‚Äôs not a ‚Äúhate bandwagon‚Äù when you get your trusting and loving fans to quite literally ‚Äúbuy‚Äù into your unfinished and untested product.  I played the game at launch and beta for 2-3 months straight and I felt betrayed.  I also had friends that bought the PA edition and got swindled out of their canvas bags and broken helmets sent their way.  Had one friend who preordered the Rum and got duped there too.  The game had and still has numerous bugs and exploits that prevent it from being balanced.  I really want to give it a shot come this summer, since some work has gone into it since October.  BUT don‚Äôt for a SECOND forget E3 2018.  They lied.  There‚Äôs no bandwagon most of the criticism is completely valid.
---
I've got thisnproblem in Australia after midnight.
---
It was someone else's drop ordered by a  **US Government Supply Requisition** slip, you stole it...
---
Thief thief thief :D
---
It's part of a quest. I did it several months ago but cannot remember which one it was. You could probably google the info and get some info on it. Usually works for me. So I googled it for you.  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Isolated\_cabin](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Isolated_cabin)
---
It certainly makes way more sense for the countryside of WV then the cities of Massachusetts
---
Not sure about the microphone bit, that would provide teams with mics an inherent advantage. I like the other two suggestions though.
---
I get your drift, but your post comes across as when someone says, "no disrespect, but I hate everything about you," or something to that effect.  I also see you've edited the post since my first comment, since your remarks about it looking like Skyrim in 2011 and New Vegas running better are gone.
---
ok, I thought that was something to do with where you deployed, thanks
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. Somebody requested an airdrop, and by unlocking it you stole from that player. Just like a raider would.
---
thanks i‚Äôve got an explosive lever that is my go-to rifle i‚Äôll make sure i have plenty of ammo for that :)
---
Not working on Xbox. Even when activated from the computer in my camp. Was part of my daily routine. Gonna increase the price of that jerky!
---
I have a legendary 3* gatling plasma I‚Äôm currently using: furious, fires 25% faster, 90% weight reduction. I love it. Shreds regular scorchbeasts like paper and only weighs like 10 lbs fully modded.
---
I've been here since the beginning. I can't seem to put it away. A lot of my friends have moved on...but here I am still. It keeps getting better.
---
Theres one of them
---
Science! 
---
I have noticed more and diffrent scrap with higher intelligence too. Everything was just giving steel at the beginning but now i get other bits also.
---
Then I must of had a glitch last night.
---
My very first game I only picked up chest pieces.
---
Brand new chests, I got to first.
---
Yes a lot of good/decent games are getting skipped or over looked. Simply based off of what they see and hear on youtube. Most of the hate and bashing videos are by people with little to no knowledge of the game its self and in my opinion don't know anything about the gaming community ,the type of game there talking about , the company there talking about or the evolution of sertain game mechanics .
---
I think this happens when you loot supply drops that somebody else had dropped. Like if somebody loaded a US supply req Holo tape and ordered the drop themselves then you get wanted for taking that loot.
---
You can't kill anyone new until they reach level 5. And I'll let you know I just chased them with my Fashnacht mask and chainsaw. Shit's priceless because their enduro is so garbage fresh out of vault
---
Nope. Just buy new version and start from scratch I believe.
---
You also forgot the minigun. Although it is worth forgetting in adventure. Different story in NW it's an absolute beast.
---
Actually had this happen to me a few hours ago. Went to craft some ammo at the purveyor but every time I walked in my health would start draining rapidly and I would fall over dead with my armor breaking in the process. No enemies around or anything. Died 3 times within a minute trying to figure out what was doing it
---
I've only entered Survival once and have never even tried NW, I'm too busy collecting all the sweet legendaries while Whitespring is deserted :))
---
The biggest fix was when the shotgun counted as just one total dmg modifier. It used to count PER PELLET. I'm so glad that was fixed for reals.
---
I‚Äôll think of you as I drink some. Been saving it for a special occasion
---
It depends on builds. People maximize damage with Bloodied builds, and there are legendaries which negate damage from players and add damage resistance as well.
---
He based most of his arguments off of framerate, but it seemed like it was locked at 30fps and someone in his chat as well as himself agreed that it shouldn't be running like that. He also mentioned the load times but from what I've seen of streamers and YouTubers the load times aren't that bad. Juicehead was the first that I watched and his load times weren't long at all. (He was the first one I saw streaming it at all).
---
While framerate is one of the most pressing issues he didn't give anything else much thought. And his buddy didn't want to agree with him about the framerate. 
---
I'm pretty sure his PC has loading problems but I'm basing this off of Fallout 76 and Anthem, but I own neither of which so I can't say much. 
---
Also, his depth of field slider moved really poorly, that should change if it wasn't a bug.
---
Up until level 50 levels definitely matter.
---
Ah okay.... Was wondering why I became wanted ... So why did it tell me in the journal to retrieve the supply drop?
---
Oh for sure and it‚Äôs still super buggy lol. It‚Äôs still my favorite of the trio of 3, NV, and 4. But I replayed it twice on my Xbox One and still would freeze, crash, have frame rate drops (especially in the Sierra Madre gas areas holy shit), and times where I just couldn‚Äôt interact with objects and have to reload.
---
Yeah, Modus sells the plans for it now. I can do it for you free of charge if you're providing the mats and torso to be modded.
---
How much disk space are you now at? The installer may be having trouble with space allocation.
---
Weapon workbenches.
---
Same here. Though my purchase was delayed a few months because of their bs.
---
Sharing is caring
---
I've already ordered a digital code for 17 dollars on Amazon, good game but definitely not paying 60 dollars.
---
Armor workbenches.
---
High five, fellow  **Nickelback** fan!!  XD
---
Haha I felt the same. Took me ages to launch a nuke. And when I finally launched one, we where to few high level players on the server. We would have killed the queen if someone on the server didn't fakin launch another nuke close to where the queen was, which meant that everyone died and therefore failed the quest.
---
Yep. There is no point in being able to craft weapons or armors with God tier end game stuff. Everyone runs the same exact builds it seems.
---
The meta shifts when Bethesda nerfs the current lack of variety build. Then everyone plays a new meta build.
---
Almost brings me to tears how underpowered PA builds are. That used to be the end game meta itself.
---
Sure, my account name is same as here, NTL389. Which timezone are you in?
---
The prestige system is gonna be after wastelanders if I remember correctly.
---
What Todd Howard said in E3 is basically true, more players in adventure mode are more likely to wave and give you stuff than try to kill you. Giving away and helping that much isnt as common but most people you come across are friendly
---
It's literally just called Text Chat. Has a global chat that's across servers, a local for on-server, trade chat, and even clans (though they don't really do anything)
---
You will need to build a camp and make a weapons station , armor station , tinker workshop and chemistry station.
---
I wasted some plastic today too (2x).
---
And perk card build savers please!
---
Watoga is a no man's land. Literally.
---
Can't log in right now?

soon, probably next week we hear about them. Since Nuclear Winter BR was such a hit they probably take some time off the road map to update that
---
Why would you drink a perfectly good grenade ingredient?
---
It's dangerous to go alone. It's dangerous to go in groups. It's just dangerous.
---
If you have the materials for repairs you will not need to use a repair kit.
---
Related workbench.
---
I think it only takes you out of the picture... everyone else can see you just fine
---
there‚Äôs level scaling. a level 7 will do higher dmg against a higher level
---
Nah, just thought of it now I can't play atm.
---
Start again from lvl 1 in survival mode. You level up quicker and it changes the whole game knowing everyone can kill you.
---
I'm not getting increasing numbers from furious either. It's quite frustrating.   
---
Any chance /u/Ladydevann can take a look at why some players are getting increasing numbers from furious, while several other players reporting that the affix isn't working?
---
Colorblind, so take my confirmation with a grain of salt, but yeah, on Xbox.
---
Same for me! Played during the beta, was not having fun and cancelled my pre-order. Came back to give it another shot when I saw it would be free this week and holy hell I'm having a blast. I love the atmosphere and the amount of exploration there is.
---
It's still pretty damn buggy and laggy, but definitely not as bad as people say it is. It's too bad it has all this negativity now that probably will never go away.
---
This was really the major motivator. After the first day a lot of streamers realized hating on it got them a lot more views.
---
Benches are everywhere.  If you don't have a camp, go to a vending camp and use their benches.  Just need the right mats.
---
Unless you plan to hold a gun to Todd's head then no.
---
Hah. I think I was in that game. PS4?
---
That‚Äôs kinda lame :/ if you‚Äôre level 200 you deserve to absolutely demolish lower levels.
---
Timezone is ADT.
---
I‚Äôm 900 hours in and I haven‚Äôt even touched the main quests lol
---
We may one day... or maybe a legendary set of armor.. then you get a gun in survival and armor in NW
---
[https://adasko.s-ul.eu/rmIWY3NZ](https://adasko.s-ul.eu/rmIWY3NZ)  
---
i think im ok
---
The problem with your explanation is that the majority of the hate had nothing to do with end game. At all. Most of the people critisizing the game never got past the beginning.
---
Sloth
---
Well, that just means there wont be the normal influx of toxic people!
---
Yeah, I think they do better damage. I can 3 shot kill a mirelurk.
---
Msg me for inv
---
Best advice for getting atoms right there
---
Another shill post , acting like a new player. Nothing to see here.
---
200 usually has legendary gear so the scaling thing kinda stops working. it‚Äôs more for low-mid lvls
---
New Vegas was the worst one.
---
Oh I agree. I have a Furious 50 cal that also has a 25% faster fire rate and deals bonus damage to scorched.
---
I don't be winning any pvp with that, but it excels on normal adventure mode for sure. But then again, with enough distance from pvp there is a little more variety than there previously was because murder is less of a thing now. 
---
Instigating looks devastating on rifle builds, but I am only assuming because I pretty much only do heavy weapon PA builds.
---
All good points though my dude. I'm just explaining why they got that reputation (Tse) to answer that guy's question above.
---
That‚Äôs how I felt when I played the B.E.T.A. and then I got to the end game content and realized it‚Äôs trash. This game is great until you get to about level 60 and up and then it gets real fucking boring bc there‚Äôs not shit to do other than build but at that point you probably already have an immaculate C.A.M.P. with no budget left. I redownloaded for the first time in months a 2 weeks ago and even tho some improvements have been made it‚Äôs still the same boring shit. I‚Äôll prolly give it its last shot when they add NPC‚Äôs but so far this game has been a huge disappointment. It‚Äôs even worse than Red Dead Online
---
Ah, I guess they were probably crouched. That also explains why I only seem to get killed when running away, I play stealth so I'm crouched like 80% of the time.
---
Think of me too but when you piss it out 
---
üôÉ
---
Excuse me for wanting valid discussions on the game and not brown-nosing passive aggressive threads that downvote anyone critical of this very flawed game. I understand not wanting every thread to be negative, but this whole "haters gonna hate" thing is just fake and cringe-worthy.
---
And no, responding to me by copying the tone of my comment is not clever, it reeks of projection.
---
Go to market76 subreddit, where people sell stuff

I enjoyed FOshelter until an update bricked it on my switch...

My only king, god, lord and saviour is Godd Howard.

We both know what that means.

You use benches
---
Neither are yours, toots.
---
I have gotten 1 new card (that was garbage) since level 15 and im 34 now. Rest was duplicates. The way it is now is just not worth the grind and makes me want to quit it tbh. Like 4 in 5 cards is a duplicate.
---
GMT+2
---
I'm available today at around 16:00, if not earlier.
---
It's not for no reason. Text chat in RPGs is cancer and it would be terrible in Fallout 76
---
Overseer's camp is a good place to repair etc. It has benches, good location.  If you can't build them in your own camp, you can also just go to Flatwoods. There are benches around there.
---
Skin and outfit prices are terrible, camp items are not too bad though, a lot of the good ones are less than 500 each which is mostly fair imo when you can earn that without too much difficulty. Could use a slight lowering for a lot to the 200-400 range
---
I hate BRs, so that wont be a problem. Thank you so much, gonna download that tomorrow
---
What I don't get is that people generally accept that No Man's Sky is a now a good game so why not 76? There are weekly blogs and the updates keep coming faster and faster, yet for some reason, people are clinging to this idea that 76 is still a day old.
---
I'm available today at 16:00, if not earlier.
---
There's been more lag today than the past few days for me.
---
6.5k!? That‚Äôs worth at least 20k caps! I‚Äôll take it!
---
You can. There's NW challenges that award atoms.
---
I wouldn't bother with pvp in adventure mode id stay in passive mode and watch out for people trying to trick you by inviting you to their team. Pvp is broken in his because players have 50 cards towards pvp and use duplicated weapons and armor and doubles team and higher towards you. My build is for PVE so i can carry alot and build stuff to strength 200%.
---
Which makes it fun!
---
It‚Äôs probably the servers playing up because of the free play days on Xbox and every other platform it doesn‚Äôt experience lag like this often
---
Go look at the challenge list at the map menu... there is alot for 'spending x amount of caps in x region', 'collecting x amount of caps in x region', 'take x amount of pics in x region'... ya get the jist
---
Nah this was PC.

Throw me a PM when you're ready.

Oceania always sucks for matchmaking. It doesn't excuse it, but I'm just saying it literally always happens. Guys over on the Battlefield V subreddit were complaining about the same thing.
---
I actually wanted to buy the rum too. Did you watch the video? Internet Historian is always a good watch.
---
Hello Bethesda! It's me again, the guy from Beta. I like what you've done with the place, I knew you could do it! Good work!
---
As others have said, you need workbenches. You can either build them in CAMP, or find them in the world. Weapon and Armor are at Overseer's Camp.
---
Yeah, and your username?
---
Internet....
---
Yeah pvp in adventure/survival is a whole different story sadly..it‚Äôs pretty much just all bloodied explosive builds with dodgy and serendipity until one person runs out of AP or just gets lucky. It‚Äôs dumb, that‚Äôs why I only play nuclear winter now for pvp and it‚Äôs so much more fun and balanced.
---
And here I keep getting reported from people in Fallout 76 specifically for my Gamertag Hugh Jeffankawk. Had to spell the name different 4 times last month and all I've been playing is adventure mode solo. No appreciation for a dick joke these days.
---
It's not worth much I thought since you can just pick up snallygasters spit to get it
---
It's 2019. Text chat in video games is obsolete.
---
I watch it because i find him funny, dont agree with every single opinion but do you agree with absolutely EVERY single thing someone you like says?
---
Exactly it's fucking pathetic how people act, an old "friend" I know at school, he runs his life off of what YouTubers say. He sold his PS4 because a the YouTuber called "rags" said " PS4 is a true console peasent choice of gaming" (this is grade 12 by the way, not sure if he has downs or what) but I convinced him to get fallout 76, which he finally did... He encountered a small glitch where when you exit a work bench, it'll put you back into it (nothing major, just press exit again and your all good) and he then sold it, saying this game is a discrase to gaming. Didn't give it a chance and now won't shut up about how this game is bad
---
Thanks for the silver!
---
Yes. This is good advice. I was explaining the existing context when duping was destroying the game.
---
A lot of duped stuff still exists, but if you are the buyer, there is no way to tell it was duped so you won't have any penalties for having one.
---
It does kinda suck helping a duper get caps, but since you don't really know it doesn't really matter.
---
The bit that shit me the most about the nylon bag fiasco was that people were behaving like it had any bearing at all on the game. 
---
‚ÄúErmagherd Bethesda shipped the PA edition with a nylon bag instead of a canvas bag hurrrrrr Fallout 76 is a shit game amirite‚Äù
---
99% of the whining was from idiots who had never even played the game, just jumped on the hate train because everyone else was.
---
What is it used for?
---
Hmmm is that tree glitching or is that a player ü§î
---
People buy those? Son of a....I had one but got rid of it because I just thought it was a common glitch
---
Excuse me for not caring about one single thing you have to say. That's the beauty of free speech as well. I can decide if I think what someone says is garbage,  i.e. everything you have said on the thread so far. I'll assume you wont be commenting any further as I can tell you're an intelligent individual and quite frankly I'm taken aback that you wasted your intellectual on a internet posting.
---
I mean it‚Äôs not a traditional fallout, anything goes!
---
MOLE MAN!!! *grumbles*
---
No it‚Äôs not.
---
Thank you for that - I actually wanted to do the campfire one, but never saw it come up. That was frustrating, but I didn't realize that you had to travel to the area to start the event. Thanks!
---
Its a left over from back when everyone would get loot outta one and it would notify everyone near it was there..
---
Then they changed it trying to encourage more pvp since everyone was being too nice to each other..
---
Or.
---
If ya want a different way to look at it..
---
Todd did it cause he knew youd steal it and get wanted and someone would come kill you, and hes sitting in his office now laughing at you slapping the desk goin "it worked, i cant believe it worked and he fell for it"
---
I‚Äôd hardly consider prop hunt PvP but that‚Äôs just me
---
A man was like 20 ft away and in a instant was directly in my face and one tapped me. I‚Äôll definitely take your advice cause Jesus
---
Yeah, you need a mod because the text chat is a cancer filled with spammers.
---
Yeah, in my opinion they should've brought their entire team to your house and let them create that bag right there. On top of that, they should've made it out of diamonds!
---
On a serious note, jesus, it's just a fucking bag. Yes, it was shitty of them to use other material than advertised, but they actually sent people a replacement bag and you still complain about it.
---
I feel like we will never see the punch bowl come back. Hope i'm wrong.
---
True. If bought that edition and got the plastic bag I wouldn't have cared you didn't buy that edition for the bag you bought it for the cool ass helmet
---
you don't need both, I tamed a deathclaw with 4 cha just a couple weeks ago
---
I too have one on Ps4,  taking bids
---
Lucky Hole Mine is the best for lead and I find robots to be the best for steel. For straight ammo though, the converted munitions factory is probably your best bet.
---
Kinda what I thought when I saw the first pics showing up, but not my fight so I didn't want to say anything.
---
Yes there is perk card packs you can unlock for if you wait till the end and your team wins... once your team is 100% taken out then no I dont believe there is a reason to watch
---
congrats?
---
True.. forgot about the experience  exploits early on...
---
Yes those happen but not as much as they used to if you think it is to much than that‚Äôs fine don‚Äôt play it after the free trail.
---
That's why I don't listen to other people's opinions on video games, especially if they haven't even played them. My husband and I play have been playing this game since it launched and most of our friends refused to even try it because of some random YouTuber saying it's shit. I'm glad you gave it a try!
---
&gt;The prestige system is gonna be after wastelanders if I remember correctly.
---
If they've delayed it, that would be awesome to know.  It was on the original road map under the nuclear winter heading.
---
I love this. Humility is a rare thing human.
---
I wonder that too, I've also seen a 'Caps' misc item for sale, with the preview being a bunch of caps flying across.
---
I usually have fun with people in zone chat‚Äîand usually it‚Äôs not that toxic at all, just people trying to do world bosses and things. Cyro chat on the other hand... hahah

I only really need chat mods so that it can log the chats so it doesn‚Äôt all go away when switch toons :P

Sorry that you didn't like it.

I guess you will leave the sub now.

sorry but you are incorrect, I tamed a deathclaw a couple weeks ago with 4 cha

Perhaps you should shut up because no one is paying attention to what you have to say. Again, have a great weekend.

Omg this is the perfect response ok the second half. If i had hold I would give you it lol
---
What did you want to accomplish with this post? I have over 100 hours on console and am approaching 50 on my PC. I‚Äôve played both since release and have a combined 2 crashes/game break bugs. If you don‚Äôt like it don‚Äôt post here, and go play something else. The game is fun for many people

Okay, so why are you here? Go play whatever youtubers you subscribe to tell you to play then.
---
Welcome to Appalachia we're happy you're planning to stay with us!
---
I understand and all but what I what I meant by this post post is that his opinion was 100% bullshit and biased and now put the idea of "this game is terrible and not worth trying" into almost 1 million people's minds

Yeah it a shame.

K then 15k

I‚Äôm new.

Oh oops didn‚Äôt read the rules sorry mods

I got a TSE pipe rifle once from her. Fun to play with and since it uses .38 ammo, a good way to get rid of the ammo.

Gotta clear out space in that overstuffed stash box from time to time, and you just get to a point where you‚Äôd rather that stuff go to somebody who needs it than sell it to the Whitespring vendors. Besides, we want people to stay and enjoy the game, and the only way to build a community is by helping the community. üòä

I'm not to sure on pricing as in the past I've paid 1 cap per round, but now its apparently less than a cap per round.
---
Lemme know how much you have, I could make do with like 5k rounds
---
Why did you spend an additional $199 to get this bag? They where supposed to send it out free to anyone who bought the power armor edition.
---
See ya later buddy
---
honestly was giving my impression, as far i see you only accept positive opinions - the game is such a mediocre shitshow i was wondering why do people praise it so much, there are many better games that make their niche more interesting than what this "game" gives
---
Yeah, because I totally expect someone to arrive to my house and handcraft a cÃ∂aÃ∂nÃ∂vÃ∂aÃ∂sÃ∂ diamond bag just for me for that price. 
---
You've got me.
---
I'm indeed complaining because the bag itself it's still shit. I payed $199 for the full package so fuck me for expecting some sort of quality, right?
---
My thoughts on the matter 100%. 
---
I would know, I bought the PA edition.
---
Let me clarify a bit. Yes it has been nerfed, but it is still capable of one shotting many of the ghouls and other legendary enemies so that no one else gets a shot in.
---
I'd still argue that it remains the end game meta for adventure mode now that the pvp in that mode is pretty much non existent.
---
The other end game meta is one that involved the sentinel/other thing build that makes players invisible and invincible if they aren't moving. But that was somewhat nerfed to the point where I think the Tse build slightly edges it out.
---
I never said it was game breaking (though it used to be) but it is irritating to try to farm nuke zones and not be able to pick up three stars because one dude is one shotting stuff.
---
You learn the upgrades as you progress through the overseer's quest.
---
it's called the nursery :-)
---
Oh ok.
---
Headshots.
---
I'll buy it for $25.00 USD ;)
---
Oh its not getting any better man, I'm 34 and I have gotten 1 new perk card (that was shit) since level 15 and I have completed almost all the challenges for perk cards. Its so irritating god damn. Its like 1 in 5 is a duplicate and they intentionally made it that way for some reason. Bethesda, this doesnt want to make me grind more it makes me want to quit the game.
---
The uncompressed size of my game now installed is 63.8 gb not including saved game photos etc in C:\\Users\\xxxx\\Documents\\My Games\\Fallout76, so you may not have sufficient overhead after the sizable download to install, try deleting any space hogs (large files videos etc) on C: although I see you have a separate data disk.
---
I'm guessing here, good luck as you have waited clearly a long time to download this far.
---
It's 2019. Learning to write is obsolete.
---
Jesus Christ, you are a fucking moron.p
---
Giving my opinion on this shitshow, there is a positive opinion on the first site of the page, you guys dont seem to bother that, so hard to accept honest unbiased critisicm?
---
This was my very first camp location, and I may have to stop by again now lol, looks great! Btw, you can put colored lights in your vending machines to spruce them up a bit!
---
"$199"
---
What's your level? What level are your weapons? What perks are you speccing into?
---
Idk know price of it just heard 6.5 but how about 15k? Also message me for inv
---
Yeah but like I just mean for playing matches and shit like if you win you get X amount and stuff
---
I accepted you, feel free to msg me to play, when you see me online :)
---
Was a 1* (furious) handmade rifle with anti armor
---
And also you can have 5 characters on one account meaning never under estimate those low levels, I've seen more players between level 50 - 75 looking for fights than any level range. I look at their account and they have screenshots and videos of their main account level 200 and something. Theirs no actual reward to pvp in this game. Nuclear winter is üëçüëçüëç excellent balance for pvp
---
Ok. It looks like you ran into the old repair kit double button mash. It gets most of us once. 
---
When you go it repair/inspect in the work bench, on the bottom you'll have multiple options. Pick the work bench option, I think it's square on ps4, I don't know what it is on other platforms. 
---
Yeah, they made the repair kit option the same button as the repair/inspect option. Be more weary of that when you actually have kits (you can get improved kits for free off of the queen)
---
The ones that don‚Äôt reward atoms. Ones like the level-up challenges, the pioneer scout challenges, and the new nuclear winter challenges.
---
I love fo4. It's fantastic, and aside from the occasional crash to desktop if I've been playing too long, it's pretty much perfect.
---
I would love a new map and new quests. I just hate playing games online.
---
Not sure what game you were playing, but SoT was indeed buggy as hell at launch. I cant even begin to count how many times my boat started to float into the sky only to be almodbearded (SoT name for a crash). Invisible cannonballs, double firing guns, lost rep, green skeloton skins after returning from the ferry, the door for the ferry not opening and the game still suffers from a lot of those (I almondbearded today turning in loot from a skull fort). 
---
As far as content, there was WAY MORE content at 76's launch. In SoT at launch you could only fight skeletons, find treasure or deliver animals... Thats it!
---
Like I said, my faith that 76 would get better was strictly based on how SoT turned it around
---
This is a subreddit for people that actually play the game and like it. We don't care about your shit opinion. We already know we like the game. We already hear enough about "how shit the game is", so you can leave the sub now.
---
It's a cool spot, wish there were more like it.
---
Calling a game that most people on this sub find fun a shitshow is not going to go over well.
---
Similar situation here.  If you don't plan out your character it can hold you back in the endgame.
---
I think the real issue is why are new players playing Survival?
---
Did you shoot them to legs or why are they crawling?
---
You know if you position your camp carefully you'd get the shop AND the house on the hill above.
---
Do scorched spawn here? I swear they did
---
I'm back since I last played 6 months ago, I'm loving NW but the amount duplicate packs I'm getting makes me want to quit again if they don't do something about it.
---
Tried and not the same results even with the perks
---
Bought it yesterday and am looking forward to playing even more
---
I mean, it's *his opinion*. You don't have to keep a detailed list of every little reason *why* something is bad and you don't like it, you can just be like "this shit sucks" and move on with your life. I really doubt anyone is gonna base their decision to purchase 76 on cr1tikal's video alone. I promise you those million people watching him were already not gonna buy the game. Again, dude *hated* Fallout 4.
