What mods/etc?
---

---
Is it magic?
---
---
---
Exactly! Why dont they just not let you launch it?
---
Don't overthink it. 
---
The code for camp placement is fucked up anyways.
---
I havent found a major issue as yet. Maybe under pricing or delayed results in pricing, like when the dupe or a shift occurs in what is possible. Otherwise I find it useful to start there and see if other deals have occurred recently to give some idea what to sell things for.
---
Yeah, considering my game crashes 1 out of every 3 times I try that Event, and when I do complete it, I don't get back nearly what I spent in resources, I quit doing it. I traded for all the rewards I was missing, and called it a day.
---
I don't have to spend 2,000 2mm rounds with my Gauss Minigun to kill the Scorchbeast Queen, plus I get Repair Kits, twice as much Flux, and no limit on other players joining in. Plus that Event doesn't have a high crash record for me.
---
I have no idea, the best weapon I have for Earle is my flamer doing 20+ damage on him but it breaks constantly.  We're already getting so many people doing nothing down there it's beyond aggravating.  I've taken literally all my 3Star weapons to test what works best and my queen melter does 2-4 points on him, and everything else is around 8.  I haven't seen a single guide for how to destroy him, like best weapons, ect that match up.  Everyone says different things.  I honestly haven't gotten some of the rewards and I'm ready to just buy plans from people because it's not worth the loss of stims and the loss of ammo.
---
Could be 50, then quad would be 200 which would be badass there's just no way to justify going quad over junkie or bloodied except for funsies...
---
Sad that the most effective way to kill him is solo.
---
So much dor a community event ☹
---
Nice vid/kill.
---
&gt;every  
---
  
---
Really?
---
Its a suprise mechanic.
---
Indeed.
---
I have had luck recovering those *sometimes*. If I wait until it becomes a meat pile, it tends to move a little bit, and can reappear above the ground or not clipped into a rock etc. It's not 100% though.
---
Master SG'er
---
Skeet shooter
---
Demo expert
---
One of my my in game friends has a cool base setup there. I tried making my base there but everything I spawned in I would fall all the way down.
---
The GS is exactly like the CS, but with extra explosive dmg.
---
Won't know that till you craft it.
---
I mean there should be some attrition to be able to do it, but I think they could have thought about it a little more.
---
Same.  At this point if he hasn't mutated by the 15 minute mark I leave.  I've noticed so many people go down and do nothing, just chill in the lobby above after landing a few hits.  The SBQ and ACP glitch happened last night so my husband went to ACP and I went to SBQ and he was 1 of the 2 people who even went to ACP, but the entire rest of the server was at the queen, no one wanted to even bother with Earle after the Queen.  It's sad.
---
I've had "ghost" items like that before, usually turrets. Moving my camp made them show up again as stored items.
---
I just like having something to do and a goal to grind for. I also REALLY want the greenhouse building set and brotherhood prefab from the next season.
---
Sorry dude, but if you have the time and the ressources, if you get out of there with a good Unyielding set with over 45 intelligence and are in a Event team, you hit over 60 xp it feels great ! It all depends on the role you play inside. 
---
2 heavy gunners can easily work on Earl while commando builds get the xp from the Wendigos...
---
Heavy gunners can easily resupplies them selves. But the only problem is that it can cost us alot of diluted stimpaks to tank this dude.
---
This is a shit ton of xp down there man, sorry for my language.
---
Repairing it does not stop the glitch, just like the glitching does not fail the event.
---
Psycho or overdrive +  guns &amp; bullets 4 + small guns/explosive bobbleheads.
---
Yeah I was gonna say, with the mods on it, it's not half bad at all.
---
How do you know if it’s a survival tent blocking it?
---
You have to have plans for the weapon to get the drops
---
and I thought I had alot with 1.5k acid.
---
I think I remember seeing that several years ago.
---
You need to store whatever they were resting on and they will re-appear in your storage
---
Lucky strike!
---
You're right, the camp should have priority. I don't think people care that much about their tent location.
---
They should always be a 3star too
---
I think its a modification but I cannot remember
---
Yeah ran it 7 times, even with a Tesla or two with no issues, then ran it with a dude spamming a Tesla and it was unplayable, I couldn’t even help took me all I could to stay alive
---
Radshield helps with t65.
---
Wait, really? I just got the .50 cal plan last night so that means I could get one now? I wonder why I've never got a handmade or any of the assault rifles.
---
Turbo fert and plantable tiles are super nice.  I’ve heard gauss shotgun is a beast but I haven’t built one yet
---
I cant even get the f'n plans
---
You can get a free one on top of West Tech I case you didn’t already know
---
Too much glowing meat sweats will do that to ya friend.
---
And who swipes with a spear?  
---
You're supposed to stab with it.
---
It is true we do.
---
It really is.  Pretty sure vamp gives more dps than bloodied because you can't shoot when you're dead, which is what you will be if you're playing bloodied.
---
Oh i forgot, yes, the magasines, so you can also stack it with the bubblehead ? That's nuts ! I'm certainly one of the most unlucky dude recently lol.
---
Thank you.
---
I didn’t. Someone else posted that on Reddit a while ago.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7tb75/chart_vendor_sell_prices_vs_charisma_and_hard/
---
I just want a Pie emote
---
I spent most of it looking at the ground and stimming people to pick them up because my poor PC couldn't deal with it at all. My mate was having a similar problem and I imagine it wasn't very good for the other 6 either. So I'm guessing it isn't normally as bad as that if it isn't Tesla spam?
---
Oh so Croc hasn't been on yet. Guess it pays to read things. Thanks for the heads up
---
Like in a day? Wow. I guess you're the MVP.

---
Maybe Bethesda added them to the loot pool because noone ever bought the plans, hoping that once people tried them, they would like them and buy the plans.
---
Like a free sample.
---
I still trash them the moment I see them in my inventory.
---
Ive tried that i think someone placed a bugged item while i was in a group with them
---
You on PC?  
---
I have an Executioners FF 25% Vats if you want it.
---
Same
---
Is this the one that’s in the &gt;!TNT Domes!&lt;.
---
On occasion I go in there and clean them out to sell the plans.
---
I don’t know off hand if this is one of the plans.
---
T-65 E - protocol on chest and calibrated shocks.
---
I had a similar experience, I did my first Scorched Earth mission during lockdown and playing with 15+ players, all with a single goal, made the isolation a little less lonely
---
Level 79 here and still trying to figure out how other dude with the same perks make 320 damage to the Wendigo.
---
The insurgent and the bog wanderer "accents" are just too white. The mountain scout is more to my liking.
---
It is
---
It's the flamer mod for the plasma rifles
---
There's a mod you can put in the plasma rifle (and the gatling plasma as well) that turns it into a short range plasma flame thrower. It's actually really good on the plasma rifle, though you take a hit on range. I've ran into cultists using them before, it seems to be rare but it happens.
---
Dome 7. Game crashed before I could open the secret door. Keycard 1 is not there. Picked up 180 world objects and it looks like it'll never respawn ever again. Fuck Bethesda. Garbage.
---
The meat event is coming back pretty soon, anyone aware of that isnt going to spend big on the plans, so it’s a smaller market. I’d hold them till after the next event so everyone who missed out is more likely to purchase
---
I was wondering why that suddenly started happening! Did it eventually stop? Or am I forever listening to this woman warning me about the swarming vermin??
---
I just got a bloodied non-explosive handmade, and I've been looking for one for this character for 125 levels or so. The plain bloodied one cost me 5k.
---
I have three extra chally backpack plans, but I like to sit on the seasonal stuff for a while before I sell it. I did sell one copy already for 250 caps or so, but I like to sell stuff cheaply.
---
For farming at level 40, hit the uranium fever event any time you see it. Waves of mole miners give good xp, and three or four legendaries spawn that drop level 40 stuff.
---
Yes! Craft a couple. Most of the ones ive gotten have been pretty good.
---
I mean, that fits the narrative
---
Will One Wasteland make enemy level scaling similar to Borderlands 3?
---
As a grenade oriented build, they are STILL trash. I don’t think they’re being affected by the perk cards at all. Not double radius, not double damage.
---
No no. Only that they spent more time redoing skyrim than producing new games. They made 1 whole game. I guess you could talk about ESO and Fallout 76 but I believe both of those were produced by separate studios. Also worth remarking on both Fallout 4 and Skyrim had much better game mechanics than their predecessors but despite that the storylines seemed like they barely tried. It was just very offputting for me. So they stopped being my favorite game studio. I still like them as a company but they're no longer my favorite.
---
I run an excavator with a cheater jetpack on it.
---
Miscellaneous. Far right category.
---
What system do you play on? This feels like it could be a thing you could get worked out for you on an exchange subreddit. (I mean, fuck Bethesda always, but I also love them.)
---
It’s always hilarious when someone plays a game for 6 months and acts like it was a failure.
---
Yea this happened to me and it fired my last shots
---
Did you get any plans or outfits? (Like sheepsquatch mascot)?  Sometimes you also get improved repair kits.
---
Lmao I wonder if that was me, I use my two shot Tesla rifle on the wendigos, but my game just freezes for like a solid 10 seconds, it's hell.
---
5 million in 24 hours? Likely already done.
---
It took them a while to realize they are best served melee damage to the face!
---
How much do you want for it?
---
I could understand it having a bit of an effect on performance but it really just tanks it to fuck, it's real bad. Hopefully they fix it in some way because it's literally unplayable at times
---
To me, her voicebox sounds like Marcus from the Borderlands franchise.
---
I thought rads would heal them like it does ghouls. I'm not sure though, it's worth checking out. I think I have a two shot ffr radium rifle stashed, might have to give it a go.
---
I still cannt believe they were so blatant with the concrete.  They didn't even try to hide it
---
I got the mascot mask. No plans, but don’t worry, I probably got purified water lol.
---
How useful would the Anti-Armor Cryo be?
---
No, because if I’m in the middle of combat I want my gun to fire as long as possible before I have to reload.
---
I don't like the way they snap to uper floors, so i try to avoid using them as much as possible. if only...
---
The mr. pebbles and the rabbit look like they are staying out of it and waiting to see who comes out on top - then they will pounce the winner.
---
It would be more realistic if you had a plant there for them to hide behind so that they can be 'bush wooking' it.
---
PS4. Not interested in trading for something that should work anyway. Whatever.
---
I had just started trade school march 2nd. Our program was supposed to run 11 weeks, and not taking a break for march break (which started march 16th here). There was a lot of confusion about if we were going to be in school or not during march break and got an email on the friday before that we WILL be in class. 2 hours later, another email saying that the school is closed until further notice.
---
We lived in trade school limbo for 2 months, not knowing if we would return to school, switch to online classes (which is pretty difficult for a program with hands on electrical labs) or the program be outright cancelled. We ended up starting online classes with live video demonstrations and simulation programs starting June 22nd. 
---
According to steam I've played 944 hours since March 16th so... I'd say I've gotten my moneys worth lol.
---
Even with the constant bugs, I'd still say I've enjoyed it immensely.
---
Yeah, and I have gotten shit loot both times I've completed the event, I might not even go back to the event, I feel like it's not worth it for how much ammo I'm going through, and how unplayable it is.
---
[removed]
---
I'll give it to you
---
And here I am just wanting more hairstyles
---
If you are on PC, at least there is a few mods for changing loot piles.
---
Flamer mod. You can turn your plasma rifle into a green flamer which melts enemies but DRINKS ammo. 
---
Cool, but pricey. A fellow redditor once said: 'you might have to suck dick for copper' as a way of explaining how fast ammo gets used with it.
---
I haven't tried the SBQ event yet, guess thats my next stop!
---
I think I sold my moo moo backpack for 76 caps because I’m just that kind of guy.
---
I think you could do well farming XP during Uranium Fever if you have a good enough weapon. Nearby is Top of the World’s atrium level, and all of those old Raider buildings.
---
Yeah but nobody is nuking that area of the map rn, and I'm too lazy to do it myself.
---
What was with his weird name?
---
I thought that was only for specific items like the ones you get gold bullion for, because if that was the case why am I getting legendary Fat man's, harpoon guns, gatling guns, and pipe wrenches when I don't have the plans to make any of those.
---
Then you could literally get into the same situation where you have 10 cores with 20 shots each. Smh
---
I never have more than like 200 acid at a time, my flamer eats it all.
---
I like a few of the items, but overall meh. I greatly prefer the atom challenges, which let me spend the rewards on things I've actually chosen.
---
I'm hoping they'll go back to the atom challenges for a little while between seasons.
---
You dump the almost empty ones idiot.
---
“Ah screw the blackjack and hookers, I’m going home!”
---
You on Xbox I got I think 3 extra fixer plans
---
Oh, I didn’t mean trading. Surely there are angels on PS4 as they are on XBOX. It’s those PC wing nuts you gotta keep an eye on. 😝
---
Lol okay douche bag. Good talk.
---
I would love to see some more too, including a clean looking Civil War style dress.
---
This. Love the plantable tiles.
---
That’s a solid option for sure and totally works. I have exactly that, the vampires 50 cal, I was mostly using it last night. With the perk build I was getting between 7 - 25 damage per shot and nothing was able to kill me. However, there were only 4 of us at the event. And while I managed to farm a huge amount of screws and acid, the 4 of us, all over level 150 a few 300s, could not even get him down enough to mutate before the mine collapsed. lol. 
---
Heck, my quad prime Plasma caster, which gets about 50 damage per regular shot and 350 per critical shot against the Queen, only gets about 20 per regular shot and 150 per critical shot against Earl. 
---
And while I have plenty of vocal sacks in my stash, lol, I’m still in search of the best non bloodied weapon / build to take him down. lol. As I’m sure many of us are. It’s kind of fun to compare notes here on Reddit.
---
In a world where they want you to burn through ammo in an orgy of sustained fire so that you have to grind for hours to replace it, it’s strange to have them throttle the drum capacity. Illogically broken design mechanics? Not Bethesda.....never
---
Yeah it does. I used to wear that one too. Also the fancy raider hat.
---
I wanted to say something on here but i had to hit post six times...
---
It does a good job of focusing me when I play. Otherwise, I’d accomplish very little.
---
Yeah man, let us know if it does anything! The “Awareness” perk card could have been bugged out last night. But when I saw no radiation resist it got my gears spinning on how to take advantage of that.
---
Yo i can give the armor now
---
In half an hour?  Wow.  Junkies would be my best guess
---
IT JUST WORKS DAMMIT! IT JUST WOOOORRRRKKKKSSSSSSSS!!!!!
---
Much as it is irritating, I find it adds to the game.. you’re in a wasteland, not everyone’s a saint. Some are shysters, hucksters and murderers behind a mask ;)
---
I haven't gotten that far in the game yet...haven't even reached Vault 79, im horrible about doing all the side quests and what not before ever finishing the main quests. I still haven't finished Fallout 4 🤣🤣
---
Haha I was close to posting to see if people had plans but didn't want to be that guy 😂
---
I took 15 stim supers and I came out with 5 lol i feel you
---
Yea I had no ammo by the end of it and we didn't even manage to kill him, was a shambles from start to finish. I currently have 48 bullets in my fixer and the only thing I gained from it was a bunch of screws. On the bright side I did need more screws
---
Yup, that's how it works.
---
Beckett really fills those possum scout shorts out really well.
---
Often same. And then often I get told over and over and over in each FT.
---
May be interested. What kind of group and or activities are a part of it?
---
It's definitely not that rare.
---
I had 100 when I went in and realized at the half way mark that they were gone.  I had a meltdown when my respawn time went over a minute.
---
Yeah, I might monkey with a junkies build at some point. Might be more fun (for me) than a bloodied. Something about actually making an attempt to keep my character alive is part of the fun of the game for me, but he can be a fury addict, that’s totally a viable option. Lol
---
It's not quite that rare.
---
Damn those words are sexier and sexier every single time I hear them......I'll let you guys in on what my kink is......I get off on watching YouTubers videos on how terrible the game was at launch while I enjoy playing the game at the same time.......Really does it for me
---
And kill your favorite NPCs.
---
Do you desperately want the key or do you just want the paint plan?
---
Yes. Please stop using your Tesla on this event.
---
I think it's a .5% chance?  Maybe .25.  I've gotten it a few times.
---
Haha thats pretty dumb dont understand that concept at all. No need to make me wait longer to die again!! I just bought a gatling plasma laser from enclave, im gonna try it out next chance on Earle i get. The event seems to awhile reset
---
They should put the steamer trunk outside, and if you didnt loot Earle, then you can find his loot in that box
---
I'm not a dude.
---
Eventually yes. It always took at least a week for me. But as soon as I did that event again I'd be hearing her bitch again. Makes me want to nuke the church.
---
Yessss! My bf &amp; I said the same thing when we were running it.
---
I've literally only done the wastelanders and enclave quests, idek what the main quest line for 76 *is* lol. But launching a nuke at level 45 solo was an interesting experience lol.
---
Not sure, I've seen quite a few people with random characters for a name recently.  Met them in a public team, and showed them around a few obscure quests.
---
Ah I'm on console, not sure if I can get mods.
---
The Simpsons!
---
First time I finished the event I didn't realize you have like a minute and a half to get out of the mine, I usually go and collect everything after the event has ended. Lost out on a shit ton of stuff.
---
Trading posts, including price checks, are not allowed on /r/fo76. There are other trading/price checking subreddits and websites available - please make use of those.

If your post is not about making a trade, please [message the subreddit moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose/?to=/r/fo76) and they'll take a look at your post for you.
---
Exactly why this change would be a good one! It makes the card useful if it affects rifles.
---
I can’t believe there’s only two maps considering they are just lifted straight from the base game.
---
Wish there was a machine or Tinker's bench function that let you consolidate your partially depleted cores into fewer full ones.
---
I always kinda hoped there would be a creation club aspect to the game. I cant stand it in Skyrim or Fallout 4 but it would go well in 76.
---
Level 83 here and did not know you can craft legendaries.
---
I don't care if people want to exploit pretty much anything that doesn't crash the server.  Glitch away.  No skin off my back.  Does not reduce my enjoyment of the game one bit.  But if you're going to be an exploiter AND a dick, well, that's just uncalled for.
---
Above about 450 or so has massively diminishing returns. Watch angry turtles video
---
Yea that would make everything so much easier and enjoyable
---
We play both fallout 76 and GTA 5, we are mainly a pacifist group. We do not take part in aggressive activities. And we just mainly chill around in the games. And if you need help with something we are generally down to do so. 
---
If you want full info check out: https://youtu.be/v4bp9KiS_Dc
---
I put one on and it don’t do any damage so I don’t even use the gun but I’m a hoarder so I kept it. Is pretty neat tho. I had to scrap so many to get the mod
---
My power armour seems to use them at random and as I mostly pick up highly charged cores I don't have an issue with low power cores filling my inventory 
---
My gatling plasma on the other hand 😅🔫 I have 64 cores and like 15 are at less than 30%
---
I think I stopped being able to see items when people started stealing/taking items from your stash instead of buying from the machines. Then, vending machines were put on standby and when they returned, darkness.
---
oh, crap !  that sounds like a heart-stopper
---
I don't think he means low levels not doing enough damage. I think he hints at that issue where if someone aggroes the boss(usually the PA guy),then the other don't get the full benefit of stealth damage.
---
Like when you shoot a mutant that is already fighting something else.
---
If anything the 'nerf' will further enhance the problem.
---
God that would be too convenient for us players, and Bethesda doesn't want us to have that kind of convenience. Not to mention if it is implemented it would probably break 💥 the game in some way, or reintroduce the rath of  bugs 🐛 that are apparently already fixed, that haven't ever been fixed. Lol. 🤭
---
But an awesome Idea that should have been introduced at launch. 👍
---
I wish you, and everyone all the best!
---
Not if it was a toggle on/off, save objective pictures or if it only asked for objectives.
---
It’s so obvious too why waste resources
---
My Gatling plasma does the second most damage after my flamer (which is crazy) finding the cores is the problem.  💔🤣
---
I think I have a spare you can have.
---
Honestly also allow us to transfer legendary items between our own characters, even if it costs atoms it would be worth it
---
It will eventually respawn. I don't think keys follow the same respawn mechanic as regular loot. It'll probably take a few days but it will spawn again.
---
I really like your dining area! I’ve been thinking of doing something similar at my camp but I’m holding out until they add another wallpaper I like, haha.
---
The entire premise of launching nukes as a goal in this game makes no sense and singlehandedly makes fallout 76 seem noncanon
---
Give the gal her dresses!
---
https://i.imgur.com/5rasx1t.png
---
There you go.
---
Only a select few. Mostly thru plan purchase from billions or completing events. Most are usually coveted when they have the proper legendary effect/s.
---
I need 5 points just for the mutations and mitigation of their penalties. Then, 3 for serendipity and 3 for bloody mess. 
---
I have been using tormentor instead of bloody mess because fuck Earl Williams.
---
Yes.I hope to this gets recognized more and fixed asap.
---
It’s just a waste of time.
---
Wastelanders turned Kanawha into an instanced interior. Key is gone forever on this character.
---
They should add a way to combine basically empty cores even if it had a 10% loss such that 11 cores at 10% gave 1 fully charged core
---
Sorta like fallout 3 weapon repairs
---
Can you post just one of the side view opposite of the fountain with the 6 statues? I can't figure out that side. Also where is the entrance?
---
Here’s another I had someone put a ammo factory in my camp and now i want it gone post. If this many ppl had this happen then none of them have kept up on reddit. Because every day there is a new post of someone saying while they where in a team a person put it in there. I don’t think that many ppl are playing in teams like this. Just seems fishy
---
I doubt they'll bring it back sadly, they didn't bring back the one for Quakecon.
---
i won't be charging into the groove like an idiot any more.  i had no clue about this
---
Lol! I was about to YouTube it 🤣🤣🤣
---
Correct. Legendary SPECIAL buffs your stats beyond 15, but you'll never be able to equip more than 15 points worth of perk cards in an attribute.
---
I love it when a bunch of people get together for this reason. Like shooting fish in a barrel when you have enough people and it gets amusing.
---
Now if only they could fix the meat pile framerates issue, we'd be golden. 
---
Maybe implement some tech from raid dungeons in other games I've played where the loot gets deposited into an instance container which can be accessed at any time.
---
Luck of the draw can be of some use.
---
People used to drop them in Watoga in bags because they weighed so much.  Lmk if you find a good spawn point, my husband loots them a lot so he gives them to me, and I give him the 5.56
---
Try to get the 3 rare baseball bats. That'll keep you busy.
---
thanks, but I've never found one.  the community shouldn't shoulder the burden of working around Bethesda's errors, but thanks all the same
---
Not only is this a great idea, but it's suggested with plenty of time for them to actually implement it!
---
Get guass shotty. First roll I got a 2 star bloodied one and seeing some damage without perks being over 1k is awesome
---
Because it works. When ESO first dropped it was garbage. Fast forward a few years and now its a top tier mmo. Same with the devision 2 (tho I dont think its fan base is as large). If the community that plays the game don't open their mouths, game developers would just chuck out crap after crap.
---
Yes! Bush Wookies Unite!
---
I bail if I see someone with a tesla in the lobby
---
Yea PA doesnt bother me too much since I don't have to reload. But weapons gets frustrating in a big fight. Granted, I should keep an eye on them more. Now that I learned the lesson im hoping it doesn't happen again lol
---
I thought we vote them into office. 😁🤭
---
Im no dick, i just hate the grind
---
I think for me the guaranteed 3 star roll is worth it. Essentially a mystery pick for finishing an event. No other event has that
---
Oh ok. I have some, and was wondering 😆
---
I just realized -- equipping these legendary SPECIAL perk cards can let you equip more regular perk cards, if your SPECIAL is not maxed out at first.
---
I have a fixer that stays at 999/999 and works like the one never ending effect in fallout 4. I love it :)
---
Hold b and it’ll kick you off the terminal
---
Hold B and you'll exit the whole thing. This works for any terminal.
---
Todd bestowed a visit upon you. Thou hast been blessed.
---
I would love to see this on Xbox. Maybe I could actually get some legacies. But most of anything I have at one time was 6k lead and 7k steel. But my fixer usually eats that up quick. Specially with the new event
---
T-51b with calibrated shocks and a jetpack.
---
The level 62 enemy is a issue I think people who are against one wasteland forgot about. It basically locks your new characters out of most of the game randomly
---
Had to be some sort of magic weapon
---
Another thing that is very annoying is that if you use it in PA, you emd up looking below the terminal. I don't see anyone bringing this up.
---
Wait till you see daily ops. Every enemy in those have a chance for these same ammo drops. It’ll help quite a bit.
---
Pro-tip: it’s based on your currently equipped weapon, not what they died to. Melee friend + gun that’s out of ammo in your hands = profit.
---
Go look at the market sub. The vast majority are H: duped high end item W: different duped high end item.
---
Excavator for Life.  Roll with it literally everwhere.  I use Ultracite if I need to jetpack.  
---
There is no difference in practice between the PAs so why not have plus 100 carry weight?
---
Tbh nobody knows what game that are going to copy
---
Elder scrolls online would be an obvious choice to copy though
---
Hold B
---
I am so glad I never bought the plan for these. I end up having over 20 of each in a hour or more of playing. I just drop them. They’re useless
---
More than a joke they made this card literally just for the 10mm pistol, laser, plasma, and pipe pistol  unless I missed  something and three of these convert into rifles so why separate pistols into different cards like this.
---
They could have at least made an auto mod for the guass.
---
Also they have a few images showing dual wielding but we dont have this either such as adrenaline, psychopath, better criticals, and barbarian.
---
Exploit away man.  You're not hurting anyone.  Was not talking about you at all.
---
That’s awesome man! I started like two weeks ago. I’m only lvl 22. I feel like I’m at the bottom of a very tall mountain.
---
Gods, they need to bring back the nightwear as well, those looked amazing in nv...
---
Hell ya it’s something...been playing since this feb(&amp;months) ...I’m level 115 and still have not set foot in a silo
---
The way I see it, the falling debris is a hazard. It's something you accept when uou fight Earle. I actually quite enjoy this aspect as it encourages you to be more careful and keep moving. I personally have never died fightjng Earle, though I am a Junkie's PA build.
---
It was the spirit of Kyle.
---
I like morgantown more because I feel like it has more high level loot spawn from the start.
---
Flatwood feels like everyone is at the same 3 spots ,and I start with crappy gear untill I kill or find dead bodies.
---
It's really fun but yeah it doesnt make sense.
---
I think we should all dress like Ward on all platforms as a joke and post it on Bethesda website. Lol.
---
Excavator calibrated shocks tesla coil torsi
---
Well... Radium rifles are my favourite ones and I have been saving a vampire's Faster fire and a bloodied limb damage.
---
Time to do some testing.
---
Get yourself an auto grenade launcher. Tag em all.
---
I actually prefer to clean adds and then put some shots in the boss. I'm not bloodied so I still do my part and everyone is happy.
---
Yes the launch crew had to have at least 2 keys for the missile to launch. The article didnt state what it was called and just said they voted on it.
---
I've seen a teammate place one of these in a friend's camp. It definitely happens.
---
Honestly there wouldnt be this problem if Bethesda would fix the issue where every gat plasma and laser gat reloads automatically even though theres 54 more "rounds" in the core.
---
Yes, it was data-mined near launch but was unfinished even then, and I suspect it was a relic from before they radically shifted plans into NW and eventually Wastelanders.
---
I wish there more cute lady outfits too! I rock the witch outfit now. I’ve only ever seen one outfit that I loved (flats and ankle pants) but idk what it’s called or where to get it.
---
They really aren't though.
---
This would inevitably result in me having the 50 crafted weapons flash across my screen 30 minutes later. I'm not willing to risk it for the biscuit frankly.
---
Don’t you know those websites use slave labor to get those items.  I wouldn’t buy anything unless you want to promote slavery.
---
4 leaf with better criticals on a less vats cost rifle was a game changer for me. Almost every other shot being a critical substantially increases your damage output, especially solo. B2525 or B5025 is definitely my choice running this load out.
---
I would also like to be a literal tank as shown on the master heavy gunner perk card. Is this cut content? Sarcasm.
---
I think that's the main quest, about Scorched and launching a nuke, I'm level 115 and I just met the enclave and in wastelanders just met Paige and Meg. I'm too slow with quests. XD
---
Im sorry to do this on your post, but does the prime increase damage? I havent seen any resounding source for it and am wondering if i should change out my gatling laser rcvr for it.
---
Even tho they’re just playing a video game?
---
pretty sure it's against the TOS
---
This is not a karma farm, I'm being serious about this, I would love to put something together for him
---
Gonna be honest I had no clue it caused people’s frame rate to drop. It doesn’t benefit me at all as a high level bloodied fixer guy but I just thought it was cool to have it shooting. It’s never caused issues for me so I wasn’t tracking. This changes my whole philosophy on the turret.
---
Way to go man, I bought the game when it first came out and I still haven’t beaten it yet lol.
---
[Their history indicates the answer is probably yes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cuyahoga_River)
---
Strongly agreed , Most interesting is Wastelanders it’s just the basic for ALL FUTURE CONTENT
---
yep. Bethesda really needs to fix this. Teslas are good mobbing weapons, but we can't use them because they are also server killers. They need a fix that isn't a Tesla nerf, but that's probably what we'll get.
---
I wear the ratty skirt and the mothman backpack. But I also want some cute day clothes and night clothes
---
You ate getting a random legendary 1-3 star weapon. And a chance at the other items. There is not a guaranteed drop like meat week.
---
To be fair its easy to oneshot them scorched without sum legacy or magic weapons. I got a Junkies Explosive Mini Gun and they die in like 2-3 bullets.
---
I've watched it happen for two years, I know it's crying in the rain, just putting it out there for anybody who wants to actually know. I don't care for internet points, but it does get a bit saddening to see how many people here still refuse to accept that this isn't intended to be fallout 5
---
Or a quad tesla. I got one sitting in my stash.
---
Sounds about right, they'd rather make the weapon obsolete than fix it. Bc they r plain out lazy
---
How about in events all enemies drop loot weather you hit then or not. This could promote afking but thats always been a thing and noone really seems to care so why not?
---
If they implemented a PvP that worked then it wouldn't be a problem. The broken crap they call a PvP system should just be left to the survival server.
---
I get that there is no perfect solution, but I think that it would at least help with expectation settings when looking at camps in the "high level" areas. Maybe I was just never lucky - so far, I found the best items in camps of level 200+ (and I've been to a lot of camps, no matter the level).
---
Quad would be 110. It quadruples the base effects not total ammo. So instead of being 4×50=200, it would be 4×20+30=110. Its odd and a bit dissapointing how it works.
---
[He's not exactly sane, I suspect.](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/main/unreliablenarrator)
---
wait, you can craft legendary items?????
---
Mine do it all the time. Typically when there is a trader visiting.
---
I wouldn't care if you guys had adventure mode all to yourselves as long as they brought survival mode or something similar back first.  It would be easier to balance things separately.  
---
If I see someone has built up the ws then I still don't know if they are anti pvp or not.  I have taken ws and built them up out of boredom to make them more appealing targets for other pvpers.  Besides, I still don't understand why someone would take the time to do this if they don't want pvp since even someone who doesn't read the forums gets an in game message warning them about it.
---
If there is a daily for building stuff in camp or ws then I will wait a bit if I know someone just took it.  It doesn't take long to build everything you need in a daily/weekly.  After about 5 mins then it is fair game.
---
The thing I do is check the person's level.  If they are under 100 then I switch to my alt who is also under that.  Otherwise I stay on my main who isn't that much higher anyway.  If someone was to get on the mic and  start cussing or being a brat about me being there then I will obviously attack them.  If they shoot at me then ofc I will shoot back.
---
To get some beer and a mounted tick plan
---
Lol - I tiptoe over to him after the fight in 3rd person with eyes everywhere 🤣
---
Word!
---
Ya know, I had tried holding B and it begins to look, like Im going to pull off from the terminal....But it zooms back in and gives me a "Transaction Failed" message.
---
-Guessin' I'll scrap it and build a new on the other side on my porch. Maybe its a bug like the rogue Turrets
---
I once had every turrer firing at Grahm as he leveled wall after wall on my base. He was immortal so I had to leave the server.
---
Wish I could join but I’m on xbox:( My condolences dude
---
Oh weird I just figured it was a 4x effect..only ever had a quad lever action.  Well poo on that
---
Can we also add weapons for arms so I can be Iron Man??
---
I just scrolled through New, and counted 20 posts on the first page that were offering or asking for heavily duped God rolls. The only reason it's not higher is because there's still a ton of people looking for meat week plans and ACP rewards.
---
Yeah, I thought that too when I got my first quad rifle. I was quite dissapointed.
---
No, it really shouldn't. Not in the horrendous state the game's currently in. They unbanned cheaters with nuke miniguns and beam splitter .50 cals. Even for you console folks, they unbanned all the cheaters with mules full of explosive lasers. Maybe in three years when they finally start cleaning the game up this can become a genuine talking point
---
Thank you, I'm just trying to do something good for his much closer friends like my best friend, who is 20, cry like a baby when he got the call that he had died
---
Yeah, I tried to put it next to Earl's big ol' swingin' balls and was sorely disappointing.
---
I just got this game last week to play with a friend. Everything downloaded fine and the update went smooth only to find out we can't play together for some reason. Both on ps4, cant see each other in the social menu, both of us has deleted and reinstalled the game, refriended each other, and power cycled our consoles and still the same thing. The only way to join each other is in hopes a player from a world will accept a friend request to allow 1 of us to join the world. Does anyone know if there is a fix for this that I missed or do the creators of this game just have theirs heads that far up their own asses to fix anything?
---
Sorry I’m on PC, but I’m sending my well wishes- that shit sucks I hope your friend rests easy
---
I do to
---
The single action revolver is the most beautiful, elegant, and completed revolver ever designed. The base damage should be buffed, but ugly modifications, especially reflex sights and recon scopes, are not suitable.
---
https://youtu.be/jksPhQhJRoc
---
I just killed a guy about 100 levels higher than me after attacking his workshop.  He had some extremely strong language for me.  He said "F U", literally the letters.  I told him this was a pvp area and to read the box that pops up when he takes a workshop.  He then instructed me to go to the dork place and to go play fornite.  It was a good night.
---
Also let us spend extra legendary modules to manually role the effects, I've spent over 500 modules and still no bloodied Plasma Caster...
---
Hookers
---
Sell excess stuff off, look for more ammo in vendors, check for possible weapon upgrades on vendors, do any non-tedious quests while vendor hopping, get a piece of perfectly preserved pie.  Lately I've been hanging out at my new house more and tabbing out to surf the web some, when I hear someone buying something off my vendor, I look to see if it's a low level player or not. If so, I gift them a bunch of stuff.
---
This is downtime between legendary run seasons, otherwise it's the same above but doing daily quests between stuff.
---
Before it was doing all daily/weekly quests to get atoms, mixed in with the above mentioned stuff.
---
I'll add you but looks like it will be hard to match out play times with timezones
---
It was a vault ranger. If you listen closely they say you can even hear the call of the vault ranger. It goes a little something like this: 
---
Cause the Eyes of a Ranger are upon you;
---
Any wrong you do, he's gonna see.
---
When you're in Appalachia, look behind you,
---
Cause that's where the Ranger's gonna be.
---
How much you wanna bet they don’t though? We’ve asked for more simple than this but they don’t come into the game :(
---
Carry around your chems instead.  If you get enough Raider faction you can get that Chemist backpack mod.  Also if you can get armour with carry weight reduction on it this will help you.  You will lose junk if you die to anything, not just players.
---
Bro your CAMP is haunted? Mine is infested. Everything is in use no matter what I do. Delete an Ally? Nope. Leaving game and playing it again? Nope.
---
It still would be a problem because, try as I might, I can't shake the reflex to hit the reload button every so often. It's ingrained in me that in a video game, if you get a second to spare, reload your gun even if there are still rounds in the mag/clip/etc. I'm trying!
---
I remember somebody suggested ages ago that the star pins and propaganda posters be used as a new traders currency for cash deals over 30k since they weigh nothing, sell for a cap apiece, and are a little bit harder to freely generate than actual caps are,, so who knows, maybe your collection will make you a fortune some day lol
---
Right? It’s not like I didn’t TRY to not walk into certain death.
---
Lol yeah you got that FPS syndrome. Years of BF hardcore made me not do that
---
Probably someone playing the PC version through Xbox gamepass. When I opened it on my laptop for the first time, my name was a random string of letters and numbers, much like that person's. Had to change it on the Bethesda site if I remember correctly. I think it's because when you sign up for a bgs account on your console, it doesn't actually give you the option to select a username and therefore just assigns you a string of letters and numbers.
---
Heh, maybe
---
We are seeing that, starting with this year's fasnacht. 
---
Then people complain "I did all the work, I should get more" 
---
And now where back where we began, where people want loot off of the legendary's body as well.
---
Its when people buy fo76 on steam and never set a username on bethesda.net. bethesda decided to default to steamID instead of steam username.
---
Ash piles are the main cause of loot pile lag.
---
Goo piles block people from looting other loot piles and show up for people that can't loot the goo piles to add insult to injury
---
Meat piles don't cause lag glass cavern infinite spawning proves this.  The flies can get so thick you can't see through them properly. Then you end up at 2k weight and unable to pick anything else up with a heap of weight reduction cards active when you loot all the piles and you lag like crazy cause of all the individual weapons in your inventory but only once you pick them up
---
I also wish it wouldn't force a reload at random.  Why are you forcing me to reload?  It says I have 247 shots left!
---
The sheepsquatch's ear tag is taken from the photo for the 'ear tag' entry on wikipedia. It's not Big MT. /
---
Any tips on how to farm acid?
---
Sure but what about calibrated receiver? Or different grip types?
---
Yeah, but I still try to remember to manually load my lowest charge core into my power armor before I step inside, so at least I get rid of 1 low charge core.
---
Well, I was told just move my right stick when heading to certain doom and it never seemed to work. I guess the fact i was in PA was why. 
---
We all try avoiding certain death, but that thing....that thing just terrifies me. Lol
---
I’ve been looking for one forever.
---
They don't bother, they only times in the last month i saw bethesda replying was either lonewanderer rping or ladydevann replying to a few bugs, but when it comes to implementing something much needed they ignore it, same deal like in the interview yesterday, everything the players want, is being delayed to whoever knows when and i doubt they will take this into consideration.
---
What level are you?
---
That's one of the fun parts of the game. New stuff that both new and old players alike find every day to share :)
---
Maybe.
---
*cries in heavy weapons*
---
I got 3 Two Shot 10MM's from the Purveyor the other day. In a row.  RNGesus either hates me or isn't quite so random.
---
Right now, I don’t even wear one usually. Full SS with ghillie on limbs and camo on chest and helm. Paratrooper backpack.
---
Limb-specific mods don't work for Solar or Thorn armor. Only the stat mods (reinforced, polymer etc) and the mods that apply to all limbs (ultra-light, deep pocketed, etc) can be attached. 
---
I share your pain.
---
It's just a suggestion lmfao. I'll collect screws and exp.
---
Same. I’m only a low-60s player, but I had a level 200 keep giving me the thumbs down and refuse to save me. 
---
Man, I’m a rifle build because I didn’t know any better. I’m just trying to keep the spawns off you and get some loot. I’m not trolling to ruin your experience.
---
What can you cripple on him that is good to target? I run a sniper and don't usually pack torment, but if it'd be helpful, I's be willing to swap out for them.
---
What i wish is that they didn't randomly reload when I had 250 ammo left. It's so annoying, I died to a bloody cricket because the laser rifle bugged and reloaded at around half core charge. It's infuriating
---
Thank fallout 4 for that, it wasn't a big deal when it paused the game
---
Steam, game pass and bethesda are all under the same servers. So, yes.
---
Ty appreciate the feedback. It’s all about personal records now so for sure that will help. 😃
---
Yes. They are on the same Servers
---
Legs keep him quiet, heads make him attack less often, as far as I could test.
---
Yes. All PC users are on the same servers no matter what launcher they use.
---
Was dead set on building the gatling plasma. Got it, realized this issue and man can I say this is a pain in the ass. Even the ability to recharge used cores would be nice, as long as it isn't at 0 we should be able to use the Tinker Bench to recharge or even make a machine that recharges over time like the resource processors
---
They should make it so you can’t see players name tags or on the map at all unless you are in private teams and they should remove legendary effects from weapons that would make the pvp more challenging and the game feel like way more of a fallout where everyone and everything wants to kill you
---
 I like where it was it was low level friendly, no scorchbeast attack every couple minutes, no nukes and a free travel spot beside it
---
Try the PTS, apparently a whole bunch of netcode issues are reporting as fixed by players.
---
I shot her in the face, after our first encounter, because I thought she deserved it! Arrogant bitch! 
---
She, like the rest of these NPC'S need to no their place. Lol. There needs to be a better AI system with the NPC'S interactions personaly. And different dialog for each encounter in my opinion, it is way too repetitive,  and it makes each encounter,  seem so trying to say the least.
---
Same, and I am using a Gatling Laser but I have earned all the new rewards so I will be giving it a rest for a week. Now I just got to nuke Whitesprings to fill up my fluorescent flux again
---
Sounds about right.
---
OOF
---
I always look at names in the mine and fast travel to them if they are in a group. Has gotten me quite a few extra kills I wouldn’t have gotten
---
Orbital strikes won't hurt a camp unless you're in pvp with someone. But exsplosive bait does
---
Essentially it's best to have your special stat start at 10 for whichever one you wanna max legendary on, unless you wanna jack one up to 20 without uny armors
---
If I understand this system correctly
---
Ya do you have an addictol? I accidentally drank too much
---
Ah okay, so they will only do damage to that player and his camp of if pvp has started. Got it. Thanks for the quick reply.
---
I only got weapons I had plans for so I dont know that is my experience and what I was told by others
---
Try sticking to the back section where you first drop down at. There is a decent section for hiding and going stealth in. Tag those spawns and no one will think less of you for it. 
---
Im almost level 190 and use a vampires gat laser, so i usually have my muzzle firmly against earls head and just hope others are able to keep me from going staggered from the spawns.
---
Use ps messenger app to transfer the Image
---
Batteries included means I'm carrying 18 pounds of power cores so I don't care about 5-10 partial cores as they would only add up to 1.5-3 pounds
---
You on xbox
---
Blue pink and silver and all star?
---
Peter Gabriel LOL I see what you did there
---
What do you get when you complete it? I didn’t want to tell her that her dad was dead and I had his ball sad in my inventory.  Didn’t know about the watch until I found the weight issue
---
Ok I’m not saying it doesn’t actually happen but this many times. Come on. And I never go in a team unless it’s public so that’s what ppl should do
---
Is into the fire part of wastelanders? I can only do those missions. I finished hire for hunt, when will that story resume?
---
If you’re on PS4 I’ll just paint it for you. If you’re a completionist then unfortunately you’ll have to keep trying to get the plan yourself. Or pray that somebody is selling the plan for you.
---
Why yes I am.
---
I have a BE .50... trust me it’s worth the grind lmao
---
No worries. Im over in the dgaf group. We get our own, help when we can, but in the end, its the fun we are after, not the maxing out some think is a necessity.
---
I look forward to your results!
---
Make the next meat week a week instead of 6 days
---
This is where I'm at. I didn't know this.
---
Have been kicked out of the zone both times before being able to loot anything.
---
While fun, is extremely expensive if you only get the quest rewards and nothing else.
---
Even if its a new perk, call it "Battery Recycler"
---
If you are in full unyielding with a fixer you should have no issue staying hidden at SBQ, can’t say the same for ACP since I have only done it a few times on my full build character and always in a group. I personally don’t even run serendipity anymore, to much poison or burning attacks to make it worth IMO.
---
Yes please
---
I remember I had a Qe handmade back in the day, oh my god it was just a minigun but better lol
---
Get blocker to 3 asap. % increases of defense are much(!) better than DR. If you're gonna use dodgy, use rank 3. With rank 1 you get a third of the benefits with all of the costs. Also sentinel armor helps and you might want to think about getting vampires weapons for next patch, bloodied will be muhh less superior in terms of damage.
---
You can also run it twice if there are two instances and one is quick enough... I finished it really fast with one group, saw that someone on my team was getting the terror effect and fast traveled to them and was able to complete it a second time with that team.
---
My terminal only shows info on 3 daily quests: Biv,  Scout Leader Jaggy and Scout Leady Treadly.  Is it supposed to show more than that?  I've gotten to where I don't bother using the terminal anymore because I feel it's worthless.
---
Edit: Reading through the comments, I can see it's the same for everyone else.  If that's the case, I'll just remove it from my camp.
---
If you reload one just switch weapons or such to stop the animation and it won't reload the gun
---
I'm using 2 for my donut bot vending machines, LOL!
---
I might try hard wiring them to the fusion generator on the roof.
---
How about not even logging in and getting loot for everything. Hell, give us loot for shit that no one bothered to earn at all. Give us loot for quests that don't even exist yet.
---
That a glitch and high lvl do not miss land in the sand because it an easy 30-40k exp
---
We should be able to. 
---
If you have a good legendary one, it's still worth using though
---
.
---
I'm on PC, but may he have peace. &lt;3
---
Stalkers outfit + sack hood + missile launcher or fireaxe
---
Thanks, I'll do that.
---
[This video?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hh0YYDb-FYY) I care more about survivability against high damage attacks, like glowing yao guais and scorchbeast queens, than supermutant pipe pistols.
---
What i dislike is how it keeps falling when he dies and you have a minute to loot him,avoid the amber,and then get to the exit
---
I mean explosive lasers aren't some super strong weapon anymore
---
I do it ALLLLLL the time lol
---
Yes, I have 2.
---
You don't actually have to exit. It just auto teleports you out if you stay inside. I just loot everything while keeping my eyes peeled.
---
Its a great perk, but I personally can't slot it due to space. What all do you run under int?
---
A lot of people seem to use that instead of power user, but i like to have a 999 magazine for my 3* furious ultracite LG
---
r/titlegore
---
I don't have a legendary yet, but I built a level 50 one and so far it slaps pretty damn hard, rocking the Blade of Bastet for melee and the Tesla Rifle as a secondary firearm. Idk if that's a good  loadout but it seems to work for me so can't complain lol
---
I can testify this happened to me today. The edge of the radiated zone cut through my CAMP. Everything inside the zone spawned in as if it had been present when the nuke landed. Everything outside was fine.  
---
edit to clarify: My character itself spawned into the world outside the nuke zone, on the northern edge of my CAMP perimeter. I didn't receive any warning/question about loading into a nuked area.
---
While he’s standing at the front of your bed
---
Are you on ps4?
---
Also effects miniguns
---
 yes but there is +1000 'bonus' atoms so it is actually 5000 atoms for 40 bucks
---
Naa, Xbox sorry.
---
Now if only The colossus didn't seem to die in under 2 minutes in each fight :(
---
Oh yeah i forgot about them. At least those dont have "leftover" ammo supply with 34 rounds left after reload.
---
Marksman? Such as marksman sniper rifle?
---
My ores eat it all
---
What? Damn I wish he did! Every fight takes about 20 minutes on PS4.
---
That’s a good one.
---
I can trade you one. I’m on now. Got anything you’re willing to trade for it? If so message me so we don’t get in trouble here
---
Not useful
---
Really nice! But where is the mouthharp? Oh right we can't build one!
---
Good to know
---
Look for snallygasters/yao guai/Grafton monsters/cave crickets near:
---
Sunken Trainyard  
---
Tanagra Town  
---
Dolly Sods Wilderness  
---
Toxic Larry's  
---
Between the Capitol Building and Poseidon  
---
Hemlock Holes
---
They drop flamer ammo.
---
Ok, got rank 3 of Blocker, and rank 2 of Dodgy. Next level up will get rank 3. So ranking up Barbarian isn't worth it?
---
I am sooo delighted!! Which name did you choose?
---
Yeah - I think the longest I've gotten in around ~12-15 events was 5 minutes.
---
(on PC)
---
Congrats, i haven’t got anything remotely useful for weeks
---
Not everyone that plays games is a dude lmao
---
After noticing some of the complaints were similar to those of a friend (also female btw) I knew OP was a girl. Regardless of gender, I agree with the post. There needs to be cuter outfits in the game. And this is coming from a dude, since it apparently matters so much lol
---
how brave of you
---
TBH I’ve only tried twice, but thanks for the advice! I kept getting staggered myself so I tried to be a meat shield made of bologna.
---
"Unnamed Guy" = "Mysterious Stranger"
---
But don't bring it to ACP on console or your a big a hole.
---
When I do this, too often, I quickly change weapons and back to beak the reloading.
---
Agreed lol
---
Lol, well if you want to run heavy and throw on some PA I could help you out there. And on Xbox, should have mentioned that first.
---
Screw the power armor guys haha
---
I’m pretty sure having plans for purveyor items is for dlc stuff only. Like the fixer, bear gauntlet, wastelander gauss weapons, etc.
---
I play PA heavy with a sneak player. He has never complained about getting more than cautioned most of the time and when he is spotted it's not unreasonable that he was. Normal mobs bump him out of the way some times so maybe you should consider looking at your build.
---
*cries in GUASS heavy weapons*
---
Cause im not a baby who gets upset when fictional characters insult my fictional character 😂
---
Nothing makes me quite as happy or quite as sad as when the cashier knows what the hell my Big Damn Heros shirt is from
---
I am around 1000-1200 hours and have seen 2 but both teleported away. So as of right now, I have killed 0 lol.
---
I don't think I agree with this change.
---
Reloading my Gatling Plasma is pretty slow so I'd rather the game tried to leave nearly empty cores for me to deal with after a fight.
---
I've had it glitch out from players use it too!
---
Why? 6 months is more than enough to judge a product, and Fallout 76 wasn't short of a big failure at release, it has improved a lot but there are still a load of problems.
---
Todd said all that matters is how the game ends up, rather than how it starts, but no. The base product has to be complete and properly done before expanding on it.
---
If you were trying to say that the person endured for 6 months and then decided it was  failure, that's fine too.
---
Lots of people do it but I suggest looking up how DR works in this game. It probably isn't worth it to you
---
Used to damage camps back when you could damage camps outside of PVP.
---
Found it... but did you kill it. I have seen it there 6 or 7 times and maybe another 2 or 3 in the wilds. I get one shot off then it's just gone. Maybe he seems back up?
---
We are were we are because of that...
---
The Scorched Beast Queen lvl is scalling over the amount of players on the event. So we had no choice to discourage low lvl players to show up there.
---
But if ppl care cry over the fact they gotta kill all the adds in a event on their own. We have a problem. Personally...i appreciate it...the xp is mine !
---
Do you use the ultracite ammo? I can craft the mod that converts it but I havent even found my first piece of crimson flux
---
Alright, thanks for the help!
---
Clean steel worker outfit with wraparound Google's and a hard hat. The gloves on the steelworker outfit are on point!
---
The quest Campfire Tales is a good place to farm the Stingwings that have proboscis sacks. Cave crickets, bloat flies, blue coolant bottles and batteries contain acid (pick them up.) In the Mire near Tangara there is a big tree full of crickets, kill them all then server hop. 
---
Look up -Acid (Fallout 76) | Fallout Wiki | Fandom
---
Not at all. Trust me, it’s so good you don’t need to bother with ultracite ammo
---
I think it just has a certain stock or scope. Nothing to special about them.
---
Yeah unyielding and Fixer but when you fire you can attract attention. Probably not enough to warrant blocker. That’s my debate.
---
I throw all of them that I get into Ward's little trailer. It makes a satisfying explosion and knocks everything off his shelf and onto the floor.
---
I'm currently using a level 45 with the heavy barrel and it already puts in work. Lol
---
You do realize that Big Mountain is on the other side of the country, right?
---
For me it is the ultracite 556 ...
---
I think the single action revolver is simple but completed, so I don't want any reciever or barrel modifications. I think Beth also defined the gun as simple and completed. But elegant engraves, which grant tactical advantage or not, welcome.
---
Strangler Heart with the raider skin because it looks so cool and I did my time in Vault 94 to get those plans lol. Now if only I could get those stupid calibrated shocks from the queen.
---
Stop dying
---
What you looking for? I’m a collector I can point you where it at. I’m working on a spreadsheet to all rare collection items.
---
What are you talking about and how does that reference what I'm talking about?
---
SBQ and Earle have 32k health. No scaling. SBQ's DR is 300. Earle's is 400. No scaling.
---
There is no scaling. There is no scaling. FFS there is no scaling. Do not perpetrate bullshit.
---
[deleted]
---
Don't die
---
I'm not asking for people who didn't participate to get credit, I'm talking about the problem of one guy coming along and somehow killing the boss in like three seconds and no one getting XP or loot except him.  Which is a problem with the game.
---
For normal fights sure.
---
I guess for me, im not always expecting to fight SBQ or Earl, so sometimes I don't have time to ammo manage and just go, knowing I have 15+ cores but not their charge. But you have a point
---
I found it in my camp once. It turned all my turrets purple. Cool encounter
---
I knew someone would say this lol it’s kinda hard when the only build that lets me put a dent in its heath bar requires me to be at 20% health
---
But it's pretty clear you're trolling based on the ridiculous leap you made there so whatever lol
---
i considered trying, but was intimidated after Earl and his endless hordes of spawns.  it was like watching an underground prizefight, that's for sure.  if i can take down there scorch beasts attacking me at the same time i can probably do it - thanks for the information !
---
I managed to get it with my mutants 50 cal.
---
Yeah. He seems really interesting.
---
Lvls mean nothing, i got it mr.data miner ✌
---
What system?  If you are on ps4 I have an extra bloodied .50cal.  Cant remember the other two stars I think its +10 while aiming and faster reload.
---
I try lol I literally sit in the back and sill get 8 million wendigos dropped on my head
---
This has been happening to more since sometime after the wastelanders update. I am not sure I can pinpoint when, but it was after that for sure.
---
Sometimes I have to respawn at Vault 76 as my ONLY option, then warp back to the event I was in, hoping it isn't over yet. I even have it to where I sometimes respawn as normal, only to have the respawn still stuck there, even though I am standing fully respawned and unable to move. I have to respawn elsewhere and pay caps, or respawn at Vault 76, then back again to the event.
---
No, my issue is that I get locked in a room with levels 17, 21, 36 etc when trying to fight earle and it is a cluster fuck. Bethesda needs to put the room in classes so I dont waste 30 minutes of my time and cores galore just to lose the event because of the range of people in the room. 1 in 5 events do I get fair odds and have some decent players with me and we can take turns with the spawns and Earle to mix it up and get adrenaline pumping.
---
Yeah I'm on PS4, I currently only have about 300-400 caps so that's all I could have to offer, unless you want some random power armor pieces or sub-par weapons lol
---
It’s not your fault but please bring another weapon
---
Intersecting with what? If it’s with another one of your objects you should be able to destroy the interfering object (I use the fire trap) then place the thing that was intersecting while the other, destroyed item is destroyed, then repair it. If you’re intersecting with a world object like a tree or cliff you’re probably SOL.
---
i think i was involved in that.. i was letting an auto-grenade launcher off for most of it.
---
They still drop that ammo too, but Earle does clean me out of it... Its really not as efficient or as deadly as the 45 rounds from a Fixer...
---
No
---
My turrets once aggro'd Grahm and he started tearing my camp apart.  I don't know why, but they never liked the traveling merchants.
---
I just imagined post apocalyptic mail ghouls who worked for the post office before the war, and take their job so seriously that they still run it to this day now that people have come back to Appalachia.
---
Not really, all rewards become available eventually
---
I do:/ who tf mains a tesla
---
Those dailies really kept me playing, now I feel like I have nothing to do as well.
---
I spent a few days building a super detailed new camp, went on a junk raid, and then got my caps back to almost max again... now I'm back to nothing to do until the next season starts.
---
Just keeping up on my selling/bullion/vendor hopping for stuff/etc is about it.
---
50% limb damage is a magic effect.  You need to test it yourself though.  Server latency and FPS play a factor as well.  Whats the fire rate?
---
Fastest I've done it is 6 minutes solo with my fixer, always takes longer if someone else shoots at him though.
---
My camp?!? How could you be so dumb le bait laid le bait taken by you the silly goose
---
There is reward vs risk. It's a standard mechanic. Promoting a zero risk vs guaranteed reward is not the way forward for any game.
---
Staying put is not the way to go.
---
The magazine nerf happened way after the explosive nerf!
---
Nice!
---
I like that event also ive gotten the fixer plan the two outfits and he’s fun to fight
---
Forgot about fire rate. Only 91 so probably not
---
I have 12 intelligence

---
Shit I was thinking about a tree and stuff like that thanks anyways
---
If I run around tho my sneak is gonna and I do 10 damage a bullet and I get a ton of rocks or some shit dropped on my head
---
Title is stupid.
---
Bethesda.net - on PC
---
Steam - on PC
---
Crossplay?
---
I wouldn't even mind if they were player locked if this was an option. I'm not a fan of anything being locked, but I some what understand the reasoning. Which is not to save the in game market, but to prevent RMT IMO. Just make anything crafted with a module player locked. Would be cool if world drops were traceable, just lock the modules so people can't dupe those and make thousands of specific weps to sell.
---
Is there a way to start that event
---
470 hours and I've seen him a handful of times. Got a couple shots on him, but he'd always vanish. 
---
Finally found some purple Super Mutants so I knew he was near. I actually got to kill him this time around! Very uneventful with mediocre loot, but I was finally able to get my picture of him for the challenge.
---
The reality is that all power armors perform essentially the same.  They all have a hidden bonus of around 40% damage negation when wearing full power armor.  With this in mind, excavator gives you bonus carry weight and mining for lucky hole, so I just wear excavator
---
If meat week comes back then you can get a lot of acid from the prime meat events by killing the creatures that drop it. You can also find a lot laying around the event area as well.
---
Thought you needed the perk for that?
---
Don't use BE weapons, close range shots will kill you and or stagger you letting the wendigos win.
---
Keep an eye on the roof. If you see debris falling down, sneak around it.
---
Equip, Blocker and Fireproof any level but higher is better, born survivor rank 1 and have plenty of stims on you.
---
Those are my tips. I only die when Earle comes and stomps on me after I agro him from doing too much damage.
---
Not screwing you out of looting the damn thing when you die at the end would be nice also. This event needs a reward and general balance. Tired of blowing tons of ammo for squat in reward already.
---
I can kill it I'm 6 minutes on my own, in 12 minutes with a group of 4,and almost the whole timer with a full squad of 8!
---
I don't know if you already knew this but for people who don't know, if you use a Gatling laser use the perk card Power User. Not only does it double the duration of fusion cores in your power armor but it doubles the ammo you use in Gatling lasers. With the card fully ranked out a full fusion core goes from 500 shots to 1000 shots.  I use it on my main and I can go for long periods of time without having to reload. Hope this helps someone.
---
Edit:  also yes, it works with ultracite Fusion cores
---
Wait, we can craft legendary items now? 
---
How??
---
Not really, but make sure you play both sides until you get a warning that continuing will cause the other side to fail. There's a very expensive reward that you miss out on if you don't play both sides up to the decision point.
---
Your stealth is breaking anyway since wendigoes are dropping on you.
---
Actually they did but it was free stuff
---
Ooh gotcha. I use rank 5 gunsmith. I feel like its hard not to. HW break so fast
---
I mean. I can understand that. Making it bound would be a reasonable solution IMO. I think crafted weapons are like that anyway. I tried to give my friend a crafted .44 and the game said if I dropped it, it would be destroyed. Same thing with a crafted handmade.
---
There are just so many weapons and armor that legendary drops are all over the place.
---
Hell, I finally beat a colossal problem (with help obviously) and I got a damn combat knife from it. Of all the things to get....a combat knife.
---
I'm a sneak build and this has never been a problem for me.
---
You buy a recall card from a vendor, then use the station at the cabin.
---
Check under mommah murphies, there's a holotape that tells you what silos are usable!
---
The person was probably opening shit loads of holiday gifts to get the caps and then dumping the plans. I doubt they miss them, but good luck vendoring!
---
Two shot so you double the fire rate. Plus explosive.  It very well could trigger magic damage.  You'll have to test it.
---
Im surprised there wasnt something like a flight stuardess outfit near horizon like a pan am dress
---
I tried that but it  gave me no option to
---
Yes it probably would be, if both shots hit. TS should technically double your firerate, just like how explosive weapons do.
---
Because I can spawn in and look at it
---
Try the trading sub. I can't link it, but it starts with Market and ends with 76. You should be able to find one for 10k or less.
---
I did it twice, and that's enough for me.  Completed the event and sentimental mission.  Reward for main event doesn't seem worth it to me.  You also get to kill a bunch of windegos but no time to collect loot.
---
My ID is Eldyrus3
---
Friend request me then join my world.
---
Edit: I'm logged on right now if you want.
---
Same here. I run bloodied commando, and I only die once or twice, usually from the debris when I'm not paying attention. As long as you don't play recklessly its fairly hard to die more than once or twice.
---
Yes you can, but the names of some Steam players will appear as random number and letters if you are a member of Bethesda.net.
---
Oh cool, ty.
---
We can figure something out.  Sub par weapons can be useful especially if they are &lt;level 10.
---
Sent u a PM with my username
---
Did you pick up the Blood Eagle and Junkyard bundles? Lots of great raider-y type things in those. I nabbed them both and the raider vending machine when it was back in the atom shop a couple weeks ago. Got Meat pile from ACP event and the raider tree from the Legendary Run all make up my raider themed camp. I also have Ace the raider collectron, raider punk and built my camp around two static raider NPCs in the toxic valley.
---
I'll agree, I feel like most of the female outfits are utter trash. I understand it's the freaking apocalypse but yea.
---
I modded my Slug Buster to a flamer barrel, melts Earle’s little minions real quick. 🤙
---
Cool, rolled it right before I had to log off for the night so I didn't get a chance to test.
---
Wastelanders was when I started 👍🏻
---
So, you may think that your dealing sneak attack damage, because it shows up in the damage numbers, but it does not actually apply the extra damage.
---
Same for me on ps4. I'm guessing it's broken. I'm planning on holding onto it in case it gets addressed.
---
Indigo, pink, fluorescent yellow.
---
This for me too.
---
Yeah...I didn’t know what I was doing. I couldn’t find a stealth spot so I just ran around the edge shooting spawns and then “hiding” on the platform in middle to (hopefully) stim. Rinse repeat. Die a lot. I wasn’t helping but I felt like I was earning the rewards
---
Things like Secret Service armor or gauss mini-guns are crafted at a workbench using legendary modules from the purveyor. When crafted they gain legendary effects.
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Gauss_minigun_(Wastelanders)#Crafting
---
Well, I was hoping that this would go away when meat week was over but it hasn't.  I still go instantly into danger if a legendary shows up plus I think they have nerfed the Chinese armor.  I used to be able to stand tow to tow with a SB and only take a little damage with their echo attack now I loose more than half health when I get hit.  Kinda suck.  So let me throw this out there.  I love being able to sneak everywhere and pick baddies off and they have no idea where it comes from.  What build can I go after that will get me close to that playstyle?
---
cats are pretty rare to begin with.  your solution is what I've had to do as well, but it would be nice to have it fixed.  hell, i was always hoping for the tougher animals that were more difficult for me many levels ago !
---
ps - *GREAT* username !
---
Blocker is huge. 45% melee mitigation combined with serendipity means I can have tank the queen and take almost no damage. The only time I die at this point is from surprise poison attacks or from a ballistic gutsy catching me off guard.
---
Also, if you have problems getting seen I'm betting you have an explosive Fixer. No amount of stealth can hide you from that noise, so dump it and look for one with ffr instead.
---
Your situation is different from mine. I don’t have this issue.
---
I get it from other peoples 'take out the squatters' quest lol So it's already in this game....
---
I saw how it was shit on so badly (deservedly) for so long, and had no desire to play it. But I recently got Gamepass and it's been really fun. Always loved Fallout games and it's been a blast playing with my buddy.
---
Stealth commandos can clean up the wasteland from on high without even being spotted by the enemy.
---
I killed a couple in toxic valley when I was like lvl 15 and never saw one again
---
Honestly if we get at least 25% gone in the first 5 mins I just leave. Its a waste of ammo at that point
---
There was a free face paint in the atom shop at some point, but even though I claimed it, it got removed.
---
Still working on mine.  Still have to get through neighborly.
---
Yeah that’s why I like blocker too. I use fireproof which I love. Nope no problems getting detected. I always tinker with that 5% of my build.
---
Sorry "Rusty" 🤨
---
and how many people are involved.  the free travel are a bit less painful because I'm only paying one-way, but still ... i think the reasoning i presented should sway anyone in development to argue for a change
---
I've noticed that you do more damage with less players involved, though my fixer is still a lot more efficient than the Gauss Minigun.
---
Currently there on my alt...
---
The character customization in this game is poop, I expected a massive upgrade with it being a new game and all but they literally recycled it from 4
---
Yeah. I almost died trying to get a good picture of him.
---
I'm bloodied and have run out dozens of times and can count one one hand how many times I've gotten to to 24 second respawn.
---
Stop trying to tank... Attack, run, repeat
---
folding caps ... you youngsters any your new-fangled gadgetry.  us oldsters can't keep up !  in my day we had rocks to play with.  literally rocks.
---
edited for senior-moment misspelling
---
You are awesome. Thanks a bunch. Btw your camp is badass
---
What the fuck are you even talking about?  There is zero chance of this leg of the event failing or Bethesda needing to step in and fudge the numbers.  The remaining 5 million is like three percent of the total and the collection period goes on for another 14 hours or so.
---
Why the fuck are you trying to spin this into some sort of drama?
---
I have had issues with stuff disapearing from the store, Bethesda support were no help. Shit sucks man.
---
This is already a feature if you are part of the players team and within close proximity to them when damage is dealt, you get to loot the corpse.
---
There's a reason why you have to inflict a certain amount of damage to the boss. Get your hits in early is my advice.
---
Hunters Long Coat and Cowboy Hat is my standard get up. Was this on xbox? I hit up a few defense events today and played mysterious stranger.
---
If you're wondering why, it's because we get bored, and random defense events give us plans and crap we can put in our machine for cheap. Plus, you know XP and whatnot.
---
I agree. The event rewards beat anything else
---
100%. If I switch to my bloodied one I have no problem with damage....just ammo...
---
Idk who is blowing Bethesda to keep the Fixer from being nerfed, but hopefully they keep polishing that glizzy long enough for me to abuse that weapon too.
---
Yeah, they used to be good in the early days, now they just ignore us or actively lock tickets asking for help...
---
Except I'm not doing that.  That's where your flaw is.
---
I'm saying, spawning a boss is a server wide event.  People quickly make ammo and hop into armor and go to the boss.  They spend five minutes waiting for it to start sometimes.
---
They all fire at the boss the second it spawns, but one guy's damage is somehow like 1000 a hit at least.  Does no one else deserve a reward now because this guy decided he wanted to hog it?  
---
Obviously the answer is that everyone deserves a reward if one guy is trying to ruin everyone else's experience. 
---
In case you didn't read the original post, it said "IF one player deals more than 40-50% of the damage" then this should apply.
---
If it's a normal boss fight and no one deals broken amounts of damage, we can just use the 1% rule as we do now.
---
Codewise, it's one extra looped if statement and a Boolean.
---
Mine makes music sounds which is weird
---
no problem and thanks :)
---
Imagine a fusion core laser rifle or a plasma core rifle
---
I have like over 300 acid and no ore
---
Thanks. Just tried this and got in and i finally got the heads plan i needed.
---
I have made the Gauss pistol, shotty and mini gun. My only word of caution (because I do love the shotgun) is it takes a bit of practice to get used to the charging and at least for me there is a frequent glitch where I'm locked on fire, so can't heal can't reload etc, cant even do quick switch on weapons. I have to actually go into Pipboy and deselect then reselect the Gauss Shotgun to unglitch. Kinda a beast in the middle of a run. If I had been able to identify what causes it I would avoid and/or share but I still have no idea.
---
Somehow I managed to get my gauss minigun to cause earl to mutate in 12 seconds once but ran out of ammo... But haven't since been able to replicate it, must have been a lag glitch.
---
My actual record with the Fixer is 6 minutes for the whole fight.
---
It doesn't matter how many hits I get in if some broken player kills it in seconds.  There's no way to get 1% before it dies.  That's a problem.  Either stop calling them server events in that case, or provide a reasonable reward for the investment.
---
Glow sight does not affect them.
---
I've never seen the timer for the "regular events", and they have ended while i was doing them many times, which just send silly : "don't be involved with anything because Bethesda might throw an event, and if you come late, TFB".  that just sounds crazy to me
---
thanks for the info
---
haha nope was on PC
---
I hate it. It’s so much  harder than Earle or Scorched Earth and the rewards are much worse.
---
wow - first time I've seen him.  my personal RNG sucks !
---
Will do! I play on Xbox add me Solebrother0731 if I find a good spawn point I will send you a message
---
sounds like you are judging someone based on your experiences... you have a choice .. jetpack or movement speed... doesnt seem very useful
---
Google Nukacrypt, the codes reset September 1st.
---
Damn I've never had the game lag and give me damage only lag and take damage away. Got put double the rounds with the shotty cause the game can't handle it. 
---
Curious to see how the fixer will hold up after the damage nerf.
---
Had the same thing happen to me today! :D
---
A creature of that size could cover that much ground in a few years. Issue is they have no reason too, and they aren’t in between
---
This is true. Without giving spoilers, you really want this item. After that, it's just about how much time you want to grind for reputation.
---
I really want a special PA that runs on plasma cores
---
You're right - it's a crazy idea 😂 but it's just crazy enough to work
---
I have 47 holiday gifts on top of these so I’m starting to understand why people drop loot so much lol. My inventory is scared of them so I’ve actually started giving away the holiday gifts when I can.
---
So after that will I have to search it up again when they reset
---
I used it on my phone earlier and had no issues
---
Only the energy heavy weapons break fast my .50cal takes over 5k shots to break and my gatling gun takes so long to break I don't honestly know how many shots it is. My feeling plasma probably around 2k shots to break. The lucky break perk for guns might actually be useful. I haven't tried it yet though
---
Could be a Easter egg, could be a similar area who know
---
That’d remove half the grind of the game. It’ll never happen lol
---
I’m pretty sure I did my first Scorched Earth during lockdown too, and wow it was so awesome! Just felt like a fighting party haha. Now I am stoked about ACP for the same reason :) 
---
My other cheesy quarantine thing: I moved my CAMP to be next to Marigold Pavilion because Settlers (and sometimes raiders) randomly spawn there. It was nice to “check on the neighbors” and get some Settlers rep by shooting things with them. But really I liked the feeling of being neighborly again haha
---
Could be similar institution nearby
---
a drop, in my experience, means i go back to pick up my shyte as an optional component of the event.  i have no idea if i DC'd because i don't know what that is ( LOL)
---
Pleasant valley
---
You will have to search again. But on the plus side once the codes get posted online you can just use those.
---
Instead of hailfire power armor its plasma power armor
---
Make sure you use the 200% repair perk when you repair
---
Redeem pleasant valley tokens at pleasant valley ski resort for a chance at getting one
---
Thanks
---
I wanted to post it there, but figured it'd fit better here
---
That's triple boxing. People do this in mmos a lot so they can solo dungeons alone. Have 2 other characters as a healing class an a buffing class, buff the main and go to town farming dungeons alone in a mini dungeon party.
---
So how long do the codes normally stay the same like a week
---
Well. I can’t say I disagree, General.
---
Bloodied Commando here, B5025 Fixer.  I run blocker along with Better Criticals 2 and 4 Leaf Clover 1.  I've been pleased with the results.  I took out Bloody Mess 3 to make room for the Crits perks.
---
There were a lot of explosions, no lie haha
---
thanks for the link !
---
If you side with Raiders you get a Raider specific cosmetic outfit and head piece (covers the head and face but you can wear eyewear and bandana underneath), if you side with Settlers you get a Settler specific outfit and hat. No matter what ending you choose you get to decide how you distribute the gold bullion rewards and can still farm reputation and unlock all items with both factions. Personally I enjoy the Raider endgame quest line more but they’re both unique experiences up to a point and then end pretty much the same way. The outfits from either side are pretty cool in my opinion though I don’t really like the Settler hat you get.
---
I don't think ALL mobs would be fair, but I do believe the BOSS should drop loot regardless, if you are part of the event.  Sometimes there's just no way to deal enough damage with how quickly the boss dies.
---
I mean obviously the underlying problem here is the bad math being used to determine damage, but good luck getting them to address that. (What I mean is, there shouldn't BE people who can solo a boss in seconds, or it's not a boss).  If these people are reaching this level of damage output, imo something needs fixing.  I'm not just hitting the boss with a sword or something; I'm using a legendary .50 cal with armor pen and increased RoF.  If I can't even deal enough damage with this thing before a player kills it immediately, there's a problem with that logic imo.
---
Or you know, why not fix the game so they don’t just randomly reload lol
---
*quietly raises hand*
---
I see the vertibots flying all over and shoot them down, happens 1-2 times per session. After a while I got a bunch I'll never use. I've only launched one nuke since the game launched LOL.
---
I don't feel like a mooch, I feel like someone helping make the bullet sponge events more efficient so people can get their loot faster then move on to the next one, and I get to profit from it too.
---
Since the legendary run started, I open lunchboxes while everyone's waiting for the nuke to drop as a bonus.
---
*was it you?*
---
Wow I’ve returned more of those than I can remember I’ve had so many western outfits it must be a very low drop rate
---
Everyone does lol.  I can deal thousands of damage to the Queen solo.  hundreds when in a group.  It's the same way for everyone.
---
It's pretty rare, yeah. But think how awesome it will be to finally get one!
---
Well...it would only work for 3 cards.....and I guess depending on what ur character is, would be useful? An interesting one tho is not cards, but the mutation Empath. 3 other characters running that gives u like 70% less damage....that would be awesome...not sure if really worth the 1000$+ for 3 additional consoles and 1000$+ for tvs....not to mention the 100$+ a month for excellent internet. Oh, and the electricity bill or excessive heat coming from the console and tv....not sure if that's worth it
---
Put a better barrel on it and it should be. Mine is a  beast.
---
I found it on accident. Going to the taxidermy shop you do like 4 quests and get the card for free to do it once. Didn’t even realize I was doing it until then so honestly, wasn’t as prepared for it as I should have been
---
Yes it will
---
when the game freezes on me i usually exit and restart, reciting my "prayer"* to Bethesda.  how exactly did you get to go back and get your junk ?  please teach me !
---
*actually an 'extended cut' of the many, many horribly acidic expletives i utter during Fo76 gameplay ... there kind of stuff you learn in the Army, and you would never want your mother to hear you rant like that
---
Okay Mr Moneybags
---
The guys at BigMT wouldn't let something as trivial as physical distance get in their way :)
---
Is it harder then Earle?  Honestly I’ve been holding off because I figured I wouldn’t contribute enough based on what people said. I did a pretty fair amount of damage and cleared at least 20 of the robots but I assumed this event was easier.
---
like many other things bethesda don't want to tell us how it works the comunity test and uncover it as good as possible. shortly after release the first rumors went around which didn't got validated or vitiated from bethesda or anyone else, simply because no one can except from bethesda. i think each server get a set ammount of certain drops. my very first item from the legendary vendor was a ve90 .50 and every other char got a decent first item from her aswell - all claimed on a fresh private world where friends bought some weapons and said that they got 2-4 godrolls out of 5 picks.
---
If you were xbox I would love to do a big nuke run in his honor or something.
---
Other day i accidentally discovered scorched-spawning ultracite veins were a thing when I went to find out what my teammates were doing in tanagra town. 
---
Inside the tree, each time anyone clicked on the ultracite vein about 8 scorched spawned above us in the air, falling down all around us. We were in a nuke zone so it was crafting materials galore. Had no idea about the ultracite veins before this.
---
You need to pick up 180 items from the first ore you picked up to respawn that ore node. It's not time based.
---
You have to fix it at Tinkers workshop I’m pretty sure. After completing the black sheep quest line I got the plan to make the card
---
HA!
---
i love swooping in and murdering everything and then before leaving as swiftly as i arrived i drop some goodies on the floor.
---
Rubber banding health has been a problem for a long time, it's because you are doing too much damage and the game doesn't like that.
---
It was a lot of fun just was not prepared at all for it lol. I had a bunch of stims, but had nothing prepared as far as stat boosts or PA
---
Nice thanks alot
---
I found NPCs to offer next to nothing personally.  They aren't any different than the robots/scorched in anything but appearance, and like all beth NPCs thier wooden and repetitive nature is actually kind of immersion breaking.  
---
Never really got why everyone made such a big deal about it, or the previous lack of them.
---
Good to know. I've been running for it as soon as I loot earle, and always missed the chest too (just learned about that as well). I usually sit on the green port-a-potty by the entrance and snipe wendigo's most of the event to keep them off the tank players. I kill dozens of them each time, and never bothered to loot them due to the hasty exit :(   Guess I'll stick around next time.
---
I wish you could get a dress like Vera's from dead money! Vera's outfit was probably the most beautiful outfit in new vegas in my opinion
---
Thanks. All he dropped was some rare-ish junk like crystal though.
---
Absolutely not as long as you have a few other high levels there. I played with a group that had 6 players well over 100 and we got our asses beat, and another group with such players doing Colossal problem and we did that easily even though the group was half the size
---
Best pictures are when they're on the ground dead.
---
Still works 8/30
---
Should have grabbed them when grahm was at the cookout
---
wait a few weeks for meat week 2: the quickening. You may have to server hop a few times.
---
Gauss weapons are actually classed as being explosive off the bat without the need for the legendary effect. This means that your rate of fire is essential already doubled in the case of magic effects to what it says your rate of fire is, put a tri or penta barrel on it and you should be good to go.
---
This needs to be fixed or something, their appearance is obviously the same as glowing wendigos but yeah as far as I can tell my glow sight perk isn't doing any additional damage to them
---
!!l  do they come in a mounted version as well ?  you know - where there's a seat for the gunner ?
---
Maybe it really is a cryptid.
---
just checked and it's fine for me on pc. 
---
does it not give a price because the item is crap?
---
If a perfect melee build with all the chems can kill a boss in less than 60 seconds it needs buffing, in my opinion.
---
They gave away some free stuff, but they didn’t bring back the bundle that included the Revolutionary General’s uniform.
---
She's easily one of the coolest characters in the game.
---
They didn’t get the plan
---
I'd be happy if they let me combine them
---
I’m level 75 now and have my build in my opinion pretty well optimized. Might have to give it a shot. I haven’t even run a silo ever. I’m mostly a luck vats build for a lot of criticals and use my vats boosted as 10 mm with aa. I do pretty wel against about everything I’ve tried, just haven’t worked up that yet. I do well on scorched earth, but Earle seemed like a different kind of beast
---
tipping the scale at thirty pounds ?  it better sing and dance if it doesn't want to get scrapped !
---
Actually they should just fix the bug. The cartridges shouldn't eject at random low numbers period. I've gotten killed so many times because of this crap. And now with the Colossus Problem the spawning Windingos is murder with each of these things popping out every 10 seconds. It's unacceptable.
---
Edit: word
---
Yup, this right here. Some enemies that I should technically be able to one shot will take me like three or four because somehow or another even though they're not legendary, the health goes all the way down and then pops back up to halfway or something.
---
Your correct, I guess melee builds might get use out of 20 strength maybe as well.
---
It’s a waste of development time
---
He is. If you’re on Xbox you’re more than welcome to join me. Running silos aren’t very hard, they’re just annoying and tedious
---
The event is especially nice if you use a harpoon gun. You finally get ammo back from the enemy's
---
Start with a hunting rifle. Sneak Vats builds work well with them.
---
If you can get a Junkie Sniper or Hunting Rifle, that's your end game weapon.
---
Stack 5 addictions, try to avoid addictions that reduce your perception.  Alcohol, buffout, day tripper... Those kind of drugs are ideal.
---
Did you miss the times they moved the goalposts back for previous goals like concrete?
---
For sure, fully intended in doing it alone since no one I know plays. As long as you don’t mind a micless player lol
---
they have put new anti-griefer measures in place : keep your map out at all times, because the 'wanted' miscreants are clearly labeled !
---
Same.
---
Same. Same. Same.
---
Ty. No bloody mess? Interesting. I swapped four leaf for blocker to see how it goes. It comes down to damage output vs damage resistance.
---
Finally got one today after about 20 tries
---
The boss prime beast still doesn't spawn on at least 1 of the prime cuts and we've had meat week at least 3 times. They won't implement shit.
---
This. People focus so much on the poorly written hate reviews from all the people that don't want to take the time to really get into the game, so they miss out on all it has to offer because the media says it's bad.
---
I've been playing since day 1 and despite all the "issues" most of which I never experienced, or rarely did, I've had a blast playing the past couple years. Totally worth it.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Glad you gave it a try!
---
Funny you mentioned Skyrim, I wanted to like that game so badly, but just couldn't get into it. Even got a lot of hours into ESO, but just don't enjoy it like I enjoy more modern day games, such as Fallout, Farcry, etc.
---
You can do an extra character pretty cheaply if you have the game on steam/Bethesda and also have gamepass for xbox pc. Just don't link the gamepass account to your Bethesda account and you can boot up both version of the game at the same time.
---
What do you think is best to run as like a side arm? And where is the best place to learn new mods for tings like hunting rifle?
---
There is an acid node directly South of Wavy Willard's.  Set up a resource extractor and a missile turret facing north.  The Acid extractor can get you up to 10 acid per harvest, and the missile launcher can get you up to 48 acid from the Yao Guai corpses.
---
I've nabbed him twice and no such luck I'm afraid.
---
I got 3 out of 42 and 2 out of 24. i must be lucky =0
---
and then i sold one for a ludicrous amount of flux
---
Level 34 and started having a shop around level 25.   I don't have much, but it's honest work.     Ammo I don't use, chems and booze (don't touch the stuff myself - I live a healthy life), plans, and power armor.
---
I know it’s not your fault but man you’re connected to a shit heap of a game
---
Interesting thought on saving them.. I'll keep mine around just to see what happens :)
---
This is my experience.    
---
My main who is a Stealth Sniper has 6 STR but 15 PER.    
---
Early on the easiest weapons to get and mod pretty fast are the Pump Action Shotgun and the Hunting Rifle. The latter has a slow rate of fire but hits hard. I'd like to know what your level is so I can say more. The Rifle increases every 10 levels. The Handmade Rifle is pretty good but depending on mods you can eat through a lot of ammo.    
---
Ammo for the Rifle (.308) and Shotgun shells are fairly easy to find. IMO regardless of build and for a good 20 levels one should carry 1 melee weapon to save on ammo and lower tier mobs, a pump action shotgun, and a Hunting/Sniper rifle.    
---
IMO don't wait every 2 levels until 10. New Park cards won't show up until you start spending perk points. Bookmark the Nukes and Dragons site. After you build it, get opinions on it. It is your char so it's up to you how you want to play.    
---
After you make the build at the bottom is an option for level by level perk suggestions. They have done well in helping me choose and not waste perks and points.    
---
I'm also on PC so PM me for more. Maybe I can help somehow.
---
Adding you, Name is WILDLibrarian25 💜 TY.
---
What 20? I’ve literally returned at least 200 I think I’ll never get it
---
Getting 20 cannonballs for 1 ultracite plasma cartrige is a much more genuine experience. Really summs up the game for me.
---
I wish we would see people reclaim the city's and towns
---
I do this with my GF's account when sees not on. I made a mule, set up a shop at the bar and join myself in a building team. The passive experience gain from others finishing quests leveled her up enough for 15 charisma and several good perks.
---
I usually just share inspiration or one of the weight reduction perks. Nothing fancy.
---
Wow you are and mine must be bugged I’ve returned at least 200 and never got one
---
That would be extremely annoying
---
But you can display his pocket
---
How'd he build underground? I'm working on building a vault underground and right now you gotta use a glitch to get into the vault
---
Weasel and Aries would be excellent camp allies.
---
What level are you, what's your build, how much damage are you outputting?
---
I found after 150 levels of blowing through tons of ammo in my lever action in what I thought was a powerful gun ....  I took the time to read up on an actual character build (I never had before this point). After doing so, I went with a bloodied build (or pick anything that does higher damage too). I then found I used WAAAYYYY less ammo since I could 1-2 shot nearly everything except for bosses. 
---
Just saying, sometimes it's because you actually are shooting more than you need to be because you aren't setup right.
---
After finding a bloodied fixer, I retired my couple of awesome lever actions. Now I only go through ammo on ACP or Scorchbeast queen events.
---
I tried it again tonight and you're right, I kept the junk I had on me.
---
Pricing is so messed up on that website anyway. Tells you plenty of weapons should only be scripped that have value and way over prices other things
---
We're everywhere!
---
It donated its body so you'd get a free taxidermy rug
---
Its manually updated, it's prolly been completely beth just hasn't updated the site
---
The only reason to escape is that red box that appears at the entrance. It gives you a few caps, grenades and some ore. Other than that I recommend staying in the main room and loot the dead wendigo spawns until the timer ends and it teleports you outside with no penalty.
---
Or, it could just be a really fucking big goat.
---
They both us bullion
---
after a couple dozen ACP's I realize after reading a few of these ACP posts today that I had been doing it all wrong LOL.
---
Thanks for the tips. I'm definitely sticking around next time.
---
Not to be contradictory, but regular crafted weps and armor are stoppable unless you put a skin on it. And combat knives are the best of the knives. Just sharing info man. Not that I wouldn't want something better than a combat knife from Earle myself....lol
---
Yeah every 7 days they change
---
How do I start the event?
---
yeah that may be too low.  Give it a test anyway.  I have read some  posts about a 96 fire rate gataling plasma that triggers it.
---
Tanagra town
---
I've been advocating for something like this for months.    
---
I played WoW years ago. You have a limited stash but it has an Auction house. In the main city for both groups there is a place you can set up items and set your own price.    
---
There is an in-game mail system where you can send anything to any character even your own as long as you know how to spell that char's name.    
---
It would fit into the lore and game so well. Of course, most of it would be run by the robots and may be 2 NPCs. You could send/receive mail from any trainstation. Depending on what you send and how much there would be a small fee nothing big. The recipient would get an on-screen notification in the left corner as well as a reminder at the CAMP through that terminal.    
---
The auction house would be our in-game market. There would be a "Buy", "Sell", and "Make Offer" option. For new players and alts this would be beneficial as you can pay a bit more to help them out.    
---
There would be categories for "Clothing, Armor, Weapons, Aid, Junk, Ammo, etc." and the level would be in the item bar so you could sort by level or alphabetical. Through the mailboxes at the trainstations you could send a short message to any player as well for 1 cap each. Someone could ask you when you're going to be on or if you have a certain item or for help.
---
Melee'd one to death when I was low level and under 10 hours played.
---
300 hours later I haven't so much as seen another in the distance.
---
It's all RNG, dude.
---
Oh shit. This is a bug?!? I thought it was my fault reloading randomly by accident....that explains a lot.
---
It is an atomic shop item that returns every so often if it’s not their right now. It’s what my character usually has on since it came out.
---
Agreed
---
A good sidearm is combat rifle.  Set it up to use different ammo like 45.  It fired much faster but uses all the same bonuses as the hunting rifle. It's half the damage but much much faster firing rate, works well when you get jumped and need to unload dmg fast.
---
West Tek is the best place to farm combat rifle parts.  Hunting rifle parts are easiest learned by crafting and breaking down lots of hunting rifles.
---
I wish we could display the atlas donor box, it looks like it was a great model but we can’t display it :(
---
I laughed at first with this exploit, but then I got real sad thinking that you do need to go out of your way for this in order to have fun with the score board system. 
---
I am really surprised they did not address this, as it would be an easy fix.
---
The first thing I’m going to do is run in guns blazing on my Bloodied PvP commando. I can do two thirds of the work on Earle (no dying), so why can’t I tank the shit out of the enemies and burn them with my BE handmade/laser?
---
SQUIRREL !
---
Eventually you'd roll what you want
---
Tables in Watoga.
---
Radiation damage is hard to even handle a little until you get a empty power armor frame
---
This!
---
I've had people dump cool stuff for me in the long ago past.
---
I now regularly dump an entire inventory full of stared items and plans on new players whenever I can if I just finished a ton of events.  Right after all the prime meat events last week, I had more stuff than I could scrip in a week and I had to start giving it away, so this was a good use for that.
---
I like the camp building help idea too! I might see if I can try that sometime. Get some more detailed builds in the world than the poor wood stair shacks to the sky. LOL
---
Each faction gives you three quests before you have to decide and the game will let you know. You can cancel out of it if you haven't done the other side all the way. Once you choose, it's done.    
---
Each faction has it's own unique backpack mod I think. I've only completed the Raider one and I'm going to work on Settler next. I'll go Settler next time on an alt to exerience things from that perspective.
---
Don't forget to power up the artillery and have a recon scope
---
I think they mostly only appear in the loot drops for the higher level ones.
---
It'll carry over, your bethesda account is linked to the steam account. At least I would assume so since you got the free copy of it.
---
It's been forever. Also the same on Plasma weapons. That being said you too can often eject your core by accident especially if using a controller. Bur it is quite obvious that in just using your cores they will randomly reload when low on ammo count. I may end up with 15 almost empty cores because of this...that gets me into trouble all the time.
---
Let's fix this Bethesda...Only been a few years now.
---
I swear cores lose their charge over time after not using them. I’ll craft a bunch stash them then when I come to use them half of them lost their charge so I maybe get 5-10 useful ones out of like 50
---
It DOES need to be fixed, i agree.
---
I feel like they have the glow effect because having normal in the dark mine would be annoying af
---
You don't get stealth damage bonuses if the boss has actually be aggroed by someone else and is fighting them even though it says you are.
---
It's been like that since beta. I expect it's a performance optimization. If the target detects anybody, it turns off the stealth bonus.
---
Get the PlayStation Messenger app.
---
Start a chat with a friend and have the friend leave.
---
Send the screenshot to the message thread on your PS4, then view and save on your phone.
---
gonna take more than that =0 Took me about 20 hops to find the radiation emitters. But then found them again like 3 hops later.
---
And if you are camped there, make it a habit of taking the workshop at Hemlock Holes. It has 3 acid nodes.
---
My melee build (pre wipe) wasn’t even halfway to being complete. It could solo the Queen with 2* Unyielding (no strength pieces), a 2* BSS super sledge, and the melee bobble, Nuka Dark, Psychobuff, a shit ton of Nuka Cola Quantums, Scorchbeast Brain, and a little bit of luck (her not staying in the rad zone and landing) in 8 hits. The first three caused it to mutate, and then each hit afterwards took off 20% of her health.
---
This is exactly why I stopped leveling until the next legendary run comes out, so I can get that daily level up bonus on the new run's daily objectives :D I don't want to get too high and it become too tedious.
---
Wait do you learn mods by finding the books things or by breaking down the weapon? Or both?
---
I've kept an extra in case we can one day.
---
I got it from a player vendor maybe 2 weeks ago for 2000 caps. I can make them but no extra plan.
---
You could get half a dozen or so from all the tables and carts in watoga. I've seen a few at a time in flatwoods. Wavy Willard's tends to have a few. The tower south of the bed&amp;breakfast has some, can't remember the name.
---
This game should not be considered canon by anyone sensible. They literally have a fucking outfit labelled as “Piper’s” even though she’s not born for another 150 ish years! So I don’t see why not.
---
Ty!
---
Vendor is a random spawn
---
Just 60 caps and some experience I think, same thing I got for keeping the watch.
---
Awesome. Thank u!
---
Weasel is the best. Change my mind.
---
If your playstyle has you on a server for a couple of hours, for sure!  If I land somewhere where someone had acid extractors built, I'll park there long enough for a couple of scavenging runs.
---
I know the vendor bot is but where is the settler that spawns near the vault 76 sign
---
It's called multi-boxing, running buffbots, etc.
---
It's done in every single MMO.  
---
Here, it's even cheaper as there is no monthly fee.  
---
I'm not sure the value is high enough here - especially post legendary perks.
---
On PC you can mod it so meat piles and bags and other things you're looking for glow (you can pick and choose what you want).
---
It would be cool for something to do this natively in game somehow. Lost so many legendary items due to not finding their corpse after large battles. It gets even worse with the exploding stuff, their parts fly all over, so you have to track down every part until you find one with legendary loot on it LOL
---
I read the article about it on the fallout website and it says enemies will be different levels to the players looking at them. So if you're a level 50 and seeing a level 50 super mutant, the other player who's level 10 will see a level 10 super mutant.
---
Oh maybe that's what happened. I usually put skins on weapons that I can, it's like second nature lol
---
I dont generally use melee weapons. I usually go for a superseldge or the death claw hand thing.
---
YES. PLEASE!
---
I. WOULD. LIKE. THAT!
---
(she is my favorite in-game character)
---
Same but it's still annoying. I switched my Gatling laser to ultracite, it was worse when it was a regular laser and shared cores with my power armor. I could be wrong but I think that if you use different power armors (I keep 3 on me) they will use a new core when you bring a different set out because that's the only way to explain how I constantly have 13 cores varying from 80-99 charge.
---
So, I did a 3rd time.  So many ridiculous things, but the icing on the cake this time was I couldn't loot the beast because of all the wendigos and feame rate in power armor.
---
I have a problem when first playing this game that i rushed quests to level up because its an online game and then i realized i didnt know shit about the story and then i got bored :)... thinking about starting a new playthrough but it was quite a long time for me to get to lv 60 with all the gears and caps i got
---
People who exploit these types of posts for karma have a special place in hell. My condolences btw. Would totally join if I had a PS4
---
Yeah, I really hate it when it's a prefix you don't want (I'm looking at you, Ghoul Slayer) but if OP is correct maybe we can leverage this streakiness in our favor?
---
For getting the screenshot, a few people have said the Messenger App, but you can also just directly upload a screenshot to Twitter and the like via the Share menu and grab it from there.
---
Even if I'm only going to be on for a little while, if I wind up near that way I'll take it over and get them running just so the next person to stumble upon it is ready to go if they get there before I get back, or if I forget about the place.
---
and alcohol. 😆
---
The issue with that is that if it prompted you, I would not have gotten all the crazy shots I did with quick button pressing. A prompt would have messed up the timing and opportunity to do so.
---
At least on PC you can make a shortcut to the photos folder for quick daily access.  My load screens are filled with my fully edited master pieces and those random shots of whatever the quest asked for that day LOL
---
That should be an actual system in the game auctions. You can use caps or scrap. I think that would be awesome
---
Tears in the rain is the only feature that just works in this game
---
I got one for trade.  DM me what you have and we can work something out, I can even toss in the black cowboy hat.  GT LastWeeksFreak
---
Ohhhhh, so I can't make a legendary sledgehammer or fire axe?
---
1.5 I only have 300
---
I sided with the Raiders and got max level a couple of nights ago aiming to get the Ammo maker thing asap. I finally took the push and got the plans for the SS Chest Armor and my first two rolls were really good.    
---
It's your char and your goals are different. I'd look up what each faction offers vs what Regs does and go from there.
---
It's never too late to start. I absolutely love this game and have over 1000 hours in it. I see players of all levels. I've seen level 5's and level 1000 doing the same event. It's about to get a HUGE rebalance and a ton of new content. It's so worth picking up right now. Best advice is to do the story, then start hunting for the best gear. There's so much to do now. Go out and explore and build the best camp you can. Community is super nice too
---
Yikes
---
Both.
---
If you know how to craft it you can break down the crated item for a chance to learn a new mod.
---
Finding plans you already know about.
---
Meanwhile the rate of return for my bloodied .50 cal heavy gun was so low that I went through about 3000 rounds and only got a couple hundred back. Sadness. It wouldn't be so bad if the Atlas event hadn't swindled me out of all my steel. Just like how enemies that drop .50 cal and 5mm ammo drop a ton at once, these wendigo spawn either need to drop more than 26 or have more consistent drops.
---
Yeah I was under the shaft when we killed Earle so I didn't get to loot. Then respawned outside
---
1) Find an acid hole
---
2) Place your C.A.M.P. next to it
---
3) Build an acid harvester
---
4) Harvest any time you return home (up to 10 per harvest)
---
5) Lock your shit up
---
I'll be honest with how this game is it didn't even occur to me that the watch didn't have a world model, rather I just assumed that it probably clipped into the base of the display and that's why I couldn't see it...
---
Try equipping the Can-Do perk card(Max 3) under Luck. Then start dumpster diving...literally. Lol. You have a high chance of finding can goods in trash cans, dumpsters, lunch pails and coolers. Best places: Watoga, Whitespring, Valley Galeria, Tyler County Fair Grounds and Wavy Willards Waterpark. 😊
---
Edit: spelling
---
You do, but maybe someone was roleplaying.
---
I'm assuming he meant underground as in "off the books" or "back alley"
---
ha
---
That helps. Thanks.
---
welcome to bethesda games
---
Thanks for the positive response!
---
If you join a global event (the ones with exclamation points on the markers), and stay in the event, you don't drop your loot when you die. I died many times in both APC and Scorchbeast Queen and my junk is all still on me when I respawn.
---
The only time it does drop my stuff, is when I run into an event to join it, instead of clicking on the icon to join it on the map. This happens once in a while, but it's rare.
---
happened to me 4 times. you can deal with the pain after the third time
---
Blackwater mine, there's roughly one at least per building outside. The larger building can have up to 4 on a good spawn.
---
I wish but no. I just love presents 😝
---
I play on pc, so you could probably make some pretty cheap PC's that can't play the game very well but still load the characters in, and it'd only be $200 for 2 more monitors.  Definitely not worth it, but not too too bad.
---
There is a Fallout 76 market out there. I have no plans to be in-game rich. I sold that plan plus a Chally Moo mask and outfit for under 100 each. I'm not big on cosmetics so if I get them I'll end up selling them for cheap.    
---
You're going to get different answers on what gear is worth. As a slightly disabled gamer I LOATHE gear which you have to be weak or nerfed somehow in order for the effect to work. Therefore Unyielding and Bloody gear is crap to me. If I find/get it I'll sell it b/c I know there's a need for those.
---
To actually do this would kind of be a huge waste of money and effort.
---
Yeah, I spawned at Poseidon Energy Plant. It was another event that I had active at the time. Funny thing is, it left me in the ACP event so I still completed it and got the rewards, when they killed Earle, despite me running around Poseidon the whole time.
---
To me nothing is more fun than defending a low level players workshop from bullies. Then they give me the heart emoji and I contest that workshop and blast them to pieces as well. I’m on no ones team baby
---
Flatwoods doesn't have many places to hide and most loot tends to be inside buildings. Morgantown has a LOT of places to hide and for the game to spawn more 'stuff'.
---
Yah I think it was between 20-30. Those tickets are hard to come by
---
Happened to me. Sadly you’ll need to switch servers and do that entire sequence inside all over again
---
Even things with world models can still show up invisible in the case. It seems like certain items are just coded to not show up, even though they aren't banned from being displayed.
---
You have to find the other ones.  It's a treasure map to some great loot.  They spawn around the map.
---
Yes please. This would be very helpful.
---
Go to the unmarked pawn shop in Grafton.
---
I used to keep bloody mess on because you know that means 15 extra whatever the weapon.
---
It’s just fun lol
---
It’s an unmarked quest...leads you to a particular location...
---
&gt;!Try investigating grafton pawn!&lt;
---
Fun to get the chest?
---
Yes. YES. ALL OF MY YES! I absolutely lost my shit when she said, "Fornicate you, Friend!" and have been in love ever since. There should honestly have been an extra ally from both Crater and Foundation, upon reaching max reputation.
---
I see new players coming out of Vault 79 several times a week. Considering there are only 24 people allowed on each server, there must be a lot of new people still joining the game. 
---
It's definitely worth it to start, you just have to get used all the bugs and glitches.
---
You're not going to be at a disadvantage even if there are higher level players in your server. In fact, from my experience, the higher level players frequently drop you stuff.
---
you had me at the first half, i'm not gonna lie
---
I got mine while fighting the imposter sheepsquach. Most of the area is covered in puddles, plus the small pond too
---
They're classified as Wendigo spawn, so not glowing, or diseased or scorched either.
---
A bug I know about on this quest is you must use the plasma grenade she gives you on the protectrons in order for a door to open.
---
No, it just doesn't work period.  I tried an armor price check, and only get the drop down list of effects for weapons, like anti-armor.  Something is definitely broken, either with their last update or with the xbox browser.  It used to work until recently.
---
I imagined, I already had to redo it when I couldn't speak to Gail though the interphone. Damn, issues like these should've been fixed years ago. It's the fucking main campaign.
---
Awesome thanks. I'll do it just to get the messages to go away LOL!
---
That makes sense.. I just have vaults on my mind lol
---
Today \*two\* of the people I play with found pies within an hour of eachother, making me like "well I guess I'll just eat the one I grabbed off the roof last night"
---
That's what I'm doing currently.
---
This is about the Buried Treasure quest, not Fun and Games.
---
Not really in dupers case. People straight up did this on consoles and self dupe and sell on websites or eBay and rake in thousands of dollars a month. Ran into folks flex about it and saying it paid off their house or car payments or 6 months in rent.
---
Uh, buddy? Hate to tell you, but that isn’t water. That’s blood.
---
Still, good tip!
---
Fun to do the run. Just pretend like it matters and it’s perfection. You just killed somebody’s father, and now need to escape. Your ap is draining fast, and the world around you is exploding and collapsing. Wendigo spawns are attempting to stop you, yet being crushed by your powered boot. You get to the exit, but see a chest. As you open the chest, the mine fully collapses, sealing you in forever
---
Same with the shallow waters in the Heart of the Swamp event!
---
That's not what I meant in this post though.
---
Yess
---
There is no fixed spawn for it. Your best bet of finding a trader in the wild is at Lost Home.  [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here\_is\_why\_lost\_home\_is\_the\_bomb\_yo/](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/i6sj3o/here_is_why_lost_home_is_the_bomb_yo/) 
---
trader spawns there VERY regularly for me. Whether she has the long coat though.. well! 
---
i usually sell them for 5k when i have them.
---
My bad, I didn’t realize rara was in two quests.  I guess I haven’t got that far with the raiders.
---
Prime does increase the base damage on a weapon.  It also adds 30% more damage against Scorched including the Queen but not Earle since he is not Scorched.
---
How did they conceal their name and level though?
---
The difference between Earl and the Imposter Sheepsquatch is in their health and damage. You can actually kill the Imposter Sheepsquatch really fast, but it can also kill you basically instantly. I run a bloodied melee build, and so much as a graze by its beam attack kills me before I can react, which really sucks. Meanwhile Earl is a big ol' bag of hit points, much like the Scorchbeast Queen but easier to hit. Earl will pretty much never one-shot you if you're of a decent level, hell I survive getting kicked all the time and I'm permanently below 20% health. The wendigo spawns make the fight annoying, but it's not that bad. It's really just a DPS check and a really basic situational awareness check, to put it in MMO terms.
---
Yeah we should be able to use legendary modules on existing weapon and armour plans. Total bullshit how we can't do this!
---
I think it's "loot 180 containers" including bodies and such, right?  Not just world items?
---
The issue with concrete was that the number was so ridiculously high int he first place. That is why they changed it. They seemingly chose a general range they wanted for materials and didn't take into account how available those materials were in each specific case.
---
Thank you so much if you have rn I’ll buy it
---
WELCOME! Got a copy and paste reply. 
---
Put a few points into luck as early as possible and use pharma farma. You will have more drugs than you need eventually. (Most builds require at least 5 luck anyways so it'll come in handy after 50)
---
Melee as much as possible to save ammo in the early game.
---
Join a public team. Building gives a boost to INT and higher INT gives more xp. You can then fast travel for free to your teammates and their camps. 
---
Junk is used to make everything. When you build a camp try put it near a junk pile and build an extractor on it. And once you have 500 atoms your first purchase should be a collectron. it collects scrap and junk from around your camp.
---
Capture workshops. They give XP, loot and caps (and usually a free fast travel point but that's buggered). You can then either defend or let it to be captured and then take it back. Taking back is quicker and easier as it's only one wave of enemies. Defending can be up to 4. When you build in a workshop if the junk needed to build something is green then it comes from the workshops own stash so build away. Workshops are pvp zones though. Someone can come and beat you up and steal your lunch money.
---
Everytime you see a workbench get in the habit of scrapping all junk to lighten your load. And then when you see a stashbox (found in camps, train stations, red rockets) stahs your junk. SCRAP THEN STASH!
---
Scrap weapons and armor you're not using as you get components and a chance of a mod. 
---
And this link tells you where to find ALL of the things. It is pre wastelanders so some stuff may be wrong now.

---
Sleep in a bed and play an instrument until you get a bonus. Takes like 30 seconds. 
---
Plant some crops in your camp. Corn or Razorgrain. And then make soup.
---
I have been swearing this whole time!
---
From what I understand, if you complete 8 co-op missions, you get some kind of camp item. But I am not really sure what that item is.
---
Have you played Fallout 3, New Vegas, or 4?    
---
It has improved a lot but knowing Glitchesda there's still a lot than needs to be fixed.    
---
You have the main story of 76: You and a handful of others leaving the Vault and there are no people. You get a few holotapes from the Overseer leading you along the main questline. There is a lot to do in Main and Side quests.    
---
After that we got Wild Appalachia which is still kind of mixed for me.    
---
Nuclear Winter brought a fast-paced PvP separate world to the game.    
---
Wastelanders is the newest DLC with it's own storyline. Here it's roughly a year-ish later and people have started to return to Appalachia but apparently are coming out of bunkers in other areas.  This brings the Raider and Settler factions and at some point you must choose at a certain point. There are new factions beside those as well. IMO, it was fun the first time I completed that storyline.    
---
Legendary Run is just a big challenge thing and I should be over soon. There's supposed to be a Season 2 coming sometime.    
---
The new Brotherhood thing is in prep for the Brotherhood arriving and I'm sure many are excited to see what's going to happen.    
---
76 is still an MMO at its core. It's a slow burn like any MMO. You can play 76 by yourself. Grouping has improved and it has benefits as many enemies and end-game missions can be quite hard solo.
---
To craft it yourself you need acid as well for the gunpowder and possibility for the lead (something I do not thing the others have factored in). The fastest way to farm that is to kill snallygasters and server hop but if you factor that all in it (include the fast travel time/cost) u/Banjo_boyo is correct in the fact that their suggestion is not as efficient as using the ammo machine. Especially since you can build up the defenses of the factory, camp on top of the machine, look at the machine and spam the loot button while you watch something on tv. I use my gamepad for this purpose (I have the gamepad setup so every button is the loot button thanks to xpadder) and I do it on my private server so no one can attack me or steal the factory out from under me (literally in this case). You could also use a wireless keyboard to do this trick or just leave the machine alone to go do events and check back after every one to loot the ammo. If you wanted to make a ton you could do both options at the same time (just leave the machines to make ammo while you hunt for the mats to make it yourself) but you would wanna remember to check the machines before they get full (find the time it would take to make enough to fill the machine and set an alarm for a few min before that so you have time to finish an event could be doing).
---
Hm cool. Maybe it will be something really dope. Guess we'll see
---
There are 4 at Mama Dolce's. Takes 45 seconds to get them all.  
---
Do the "Feed the people" event when it pops up there and you'll get canned meat stew every time as a reward, too.
---
Nah, they don't. No one showed for it when it was around. What makes you think it'll be any different this time around too? It'll be the same shit.
---
A bunch of people will join in early, realise quickly why it wasn't popular and then it'll be back to the way it was before. 
---
Bethesda already did that experiment and it failed. It's better that they move on. Maybe cater to PvP some other way but survival mode ain't it.
---
Can-Do perk x3 and run through white springs resort and wavy willards trash cans.
---
Put the tri barrel on it.  It probably won't matter too much though because I'm pretty sure they're getting fixed in the next update.
---
My ounce of prevention is bugged out. I was hoping for the next patch to drop as its supposed to fix it but I might just get the quest resest. For the wastelander quest what are you supposed to do after you find the "treasure" for Trudy? I know there is a whole 2 different sides and quests for them but do I have to manually find their camps or is ounce of protection supposed to be completed first?
---
Only have one at the moment and that one is mine =0 
---
Usually when i find the scavenger trader i post on here to let people know.
---
Well then if you play this on pc, there's virtual box that you can do so you don't have to buy more pc's but that probably needs a beefy cpu.
---
Nope. Also none of the craftable legendarys are tradeable.
---
I feel sorry for everyone and even thought this post caught a lot of traction and Bethesda responded 4 times, it’s still not fixed. I’ve since uninstalled the game but sadly couldn’t refund it. Best of luck to everyone!
---
So has the ammo dropping been inconsistent for anyone else? I only get fuel maybe 40% the time when I kill the Wendigo spawns.
---
Yeah, you could make VM's.  LTT did a video having 6 people or something play on one computer.  But it wouldn't be the best experience.
---
Nah 60 for containers. 180 in world.
---
I read somewhere that the Imposter Sheepsquatch has a perk that's supposed to reduce your resistances by 30%, but Bethesda used a negative multiplier which results in it ignoring ALL resistances.
---
No worries I’ll grind out lost home thanks for telling me
---
Yeah, level 3 and century link had huge outages today
---
I got the Fixer plan from a player vendor roughly over a week ago for 2000 caps. After that I got a 2 Star Fixer from doing that Weapon Case mission from the Astronaut chick. I was surprised.    
---
I've made 4 SS Chest pieces and 3 out of 4 were 3 star and really good. IDK if I'm lucky or the game tracks or it's just a big di\*\* tease to get me to waste more time and mats or what.    
---
I've had little luck with Mumble Miner lady.
---
Oh, okay.  The rotting carcasses of super mutants count as containers, right?
---
Ahh okay, so it doesn't really seem super worth it then...
---
Was he crouched on top of the pole? If you're crouched down, you don't appear on the map.
---
From the way the lead dev talked about it at Gamescom this weekend, Wastelanders saved FO76. So yeah, they did a great job. My friends are I are new to the game, started a couple months ago, it's great. Sorry it had such a terrible launch, but it's now a great game.
---
First time I found a wendigo, I remember it and a pack of ghouls chasing me for a bit until I found a rock I could climb up on but they couldn’t get me
---
Not entirely sure BUUT black water mine is a good place to hit a ton of containers if you’re looking for a spot
---
Why not leave the core locked in till depleted like power armor is.
---
The problem is that if you buff the boss to make killing it hard with the best possible  build, it'll be completely impossible with casual builds.
---
Water is pretty easy to get. Early on Dirty Water into Boiled is largely the most efficient. You get the plans for the lower level generator and purifier through doing the Overseer's questline. Her chests have plans in them the first time you open them so read them asap.
---
That would work too
---
I guess I'll just test it.
---
This is an issue... Member. But this is Bethesda we’re... Talking.... About here.
---
They changed it the day before it ended.....so either you don't play your game or you don't even understand the amount of resources that you put inn your game....both make them look stupid as hell.  They changed it at the last minute because we were gonna fail the second challenge.
---
I have two bloodied characters and Yao guais aren’t really a threat. That video was about power armour, he has another one about regular armour and how high in terms of resistance you need to go. 400 is all you need.
---
So I can know when I finally get my bloodied/unyielding piece 🧐
---
wasnt crouched and when I saw him on the pole his name and level wasnt listed above his head is what I mean. Looked very much like an NPC but acted pretty human.
---
This may be insane, but what if as you do more and more damage as a percent compared to others, you do less damage.  If you've done half the damage to the boss, your damage drops by 35%, and so on.  It would make it essentially impossible for any one person to kill a boss before others contribute.
---
Use the camera if there's too many meat piles, it'll help you find the legendary pile.
---
I believe you have found what we in the biz call a Roleplayer.
---
This is day 1 please God
---
Entitlement is what is with these kids
---
I like that pa prefers the lowest ones and gatling laser prefers the highest. I personally think that makes more sense as the power armour will just finish off the near empty ones.
---
It’s happened to me twice now, I feel your pain. Taken a break and now I see how awesome No Man’s Sky is now.
---
It used to be a fun event but now it's just kind of old and lame watching this happen.
---
My point still stands, member. Bethesda don’t have... A very good track record.
---
Dear God, yes please!
---
Yup.  And if you want to maximize that, take your example, you have 12 int, move 2 to another special, then apply the card, and you have max int and 2 somewhere else, getting full effect of the card.
---
Destroy the crafting station and then repair it
---
Oh, I know.
---
Iirc there is a setting to suppress name and level.  Yellow triangle still shows though
---
You speak as if theres anything to do outside of this new event.
---

*Country roads starts playing*
---
I have a weird ammo glitch too.  All my guns say 000/000, even if I have ammo and even if the gun is loaded with ammo.  It fires perfectly fine amd then works normally after that.
---
With a melee build capable of doing 35k damage a hit so you can hit him 3 times and be done.
---
In theory, yes, unless you are using ultracite corea and/or plasma cores
---
maybe.  i'm on ps4 and in my just finished session had someone buy both pairs of treasure hats and outfits i had for sale.
---
i go to restock... and they're still there.  got the caps from the sale... so i dunno.
---
Sure, it's part of the fight, but you should still get to loot him.
---
Most of the outfits are either tailored more for men (with a distinctly masculine look and fit), or are ugly-ass long grandma skirts. And it's an absolute disappointment :/
---
there was a new Vegas perk called Vigilant recycler which let you keep some depleted energy cells and craft them into fresh ammo and a work bench
---
I completely forgot about that one
---
The dark side of the lucky hole mine is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be... unnatural.
---
It sucks because sometimes they mod the item and you have no clue which exact item it is.
---
Oh is THAT why that happens? People who never made a bethnet account?
---
Ah, you sweet naive child, thinking that the world would be simple and make sense all the time.
---
Tesla's do this literally everywhere.  Radiation Rumble, Line in the Sand.  Tbh, just stop using it.
---
Emulating mr bandit bot?
---
I don’t get why more people don’t keep it stocked in their vendors, I find so much and sell it for 5 caps a can
---
You do get to, just be wary of the falling ceiling.
---
Not if you die as he dies.  If you die at the same time, you spawn outside the mine and can't reenter.  And it's really not your fault if you die when he can "fear" you and make you run into one and die.
---
Agreed. I’ve been able to find a way around this (it takes extra time, but it is dependable). For weapons I look at what kind of ammo it uses so I can tell which weapon it is. For armor I use this guide to see if it’s heavy, sturdy, or light https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m4sA-lJt2lV5r4NjkGNgyVUGNwjRMLN-ishup58v_Qs/htmlview#
---
THAT just happened to me earlier tonight.   Ended up way outside the event below the ski resort.  Still pissed
---
Yes someone was selling a 100 of them bought them all didn’t care how much I spent because I can make the money back fast and I’ve collected about 100 spent them all never got a shotgun : (
---
I love to do that on xbox
---
along with plasma spaz, it was a critical part of any energy weapon play though, honestly i wish energy weapons would get a buff in 76 i always feel like i am at a disadvantage when i use them
---
Thank God the lockpick/hacking legendary perk is both together at rank 3 and I dont have to worry about if it'd be better to get a stat booster instead, cause damn is 5 extra perk points nice.
---
Yeah count me in,  what's your psn I'll add you
---
I got mine from defends, I think.
---
You can log back in to the same private server if you're a 1st member, but I've never been able to log back in to the same public server.
---
What Norbeard said and consider dropping fireproof 3 for fireproof 1 and instead going with an asbestos chest mod. This way you can add in revenant for more damage or rejuvenated for more max health. Dr/er after 350 (300?) has diminishing returns btw.
---
More development time (money) to spend on polishing legendary crafting ?  How about another session of Meat Week instead?
---
Crazy right? I too have just hit 1000+ hours and there’s some plans I’m coming across in vendors for the first time lol. Idk if anyone could ever get them all without trading... Treat this game like single player and get it all by yourself haha hell no.
---
Maybe read the pts forums.
---
Did he drop the nuke to spawn the event?
---
I am out of words
---
You were never able to automatically log back into the same server. 
---
The only way to do that, is if your game crashed while you were in the same lobby as your friend. That way you can just join them again, so you could join the same server again.
---
Yes, I feel like the developers added the terminal and had plans for it to help gameplay, but just forgot about it.
---
Yes there is I’ll be starting that event a lot now I like events you can start like riding shotgun but encrypted has a very tough boss witch makes it so much fun
---
Did a bunch of server hoping following these results and it worked out ofr me.
---
Yeah then I completely agree with you.
---
Can always send in a support ticket. May or may not be helpful, but with how glitchy the Daguerre quest was they sure were prepared to mess with what flags are set on a character.
---
Yup, that was several months ago.
---
When you get that respawn bug that shows the option to respawn but it doesn’t work. If you leave the screen sitting like that for about 10 minutes, you can then hit the button and it works. Then you chose to respawn at vault 76 And fast travel back to where you died.
---
fornicate.
---
very hot place.
---
Hold up! Craft a legendary? Since when is that a thing?
---
They want you to fill that stash and inventory as much as possible to stop any gameplay enjoyment.
---
The Sheepsquatch brothers are having a civil war
---
The problem worked itself out. I enter, exit &amp; re enter in excavator pa, and regular armor, even server hopped, and now I've done 3 runs thru the mine
---
Le silly goose*
---
A long, long time ago I was at a friend’s camp, and some little kid showed up being annoying on area chat.  He was only level 3 or 4, but my friend locked him in the camp and we told him to drop all his stuff and we’d let him go.   He didn’t, and we got bored in a couple minutes, opened the door and went about our business.    This kid kept following us and trying to attack us, despite the 80 or 90 level difference between us.   Eventually, he turned level 5 during his pursuit of an ass beating, and we jumped on it, taking turns beating him to death with our bare hands.     The last time, he got downed but not killed, we each took a picture of ourselves next to his dying body, kid said “please don’t do this” and my friend finished him off with the cannibal perk.
---
My bloodied rifleman in Adventure is my rifleman in NW. I can't say it's the BEST build, I don't play NW much, but Rifle/Commando seems like the best *overall* build in NW. Rifles and Automatics are everywhere in NW, and are good at pretty much all ranges.
---
I run Lifegiver (45 hp), Frog Legs, Commando, Rifleman (yes, I run both), Tank Killer, and the last two points I usually flex around a lot. Might be Ground Pounder, might be Lockpicker, might be Strong Back, might be Action Boy (usually action boy and strong back; for some reason I like to carry a lot of stuff :P)
---
They need to look at how buffs stack.
---
Yes you have to go through all of that, the id, the reactor, the bot defense, everything each time you want to launch a nuke.
---
The Gauntlet is also really nice to have if you do any melee. There's better melee weapons, but being able to craft legendaries for it is a huge advantage. The Gauntlet is why robots are no longer a massive problem for me.
---
Ok tysm. I’ll wait for my friends to get leveled up then before I even attempt that again..
---
Why on earth would you use that piece of crap site anyways? Those prices have nothing to do with real item values.
---
Yes more dresses and longer hairstyles!
---
Scorchbest heart. It was a bonus item on some Atom Shop bundle, around Valentines (heart-get it?)

His shill script didn't cover that.

It is complete incompetence that this big still exists.

Wish i could give you some in game from here on reddit but... yeah
---
Chaotic neutral
---
Wait what? My ultracite gatling uses normal cores...
---
Wow 5k is a good price I’ve always seen them for 9k so I sold my extras for the same I’ve only gotten 4 of them so far
---
Would you care to link it? I'd like to see the reasoning.
---
Thanks. I put them on the board and apparently had 5 of the 6 fragments.  But I don't know which ones I had so I don't know how to find the 6th without going to check every location lol.
---
I do know that I'm missing the top-middle one.  Any idea whose it is?
---
I crashed while in a team a couple of weeks ago and I got back in same server and team.
---
Not sure when playing solo tho.
---
This on ps4 btw.
---
The only reason Bloodied, Junkies etc are so powerful is because of the way buffs stack. It’s all multiplicative, except from adding to SPECIAL stats. They’re changing it so it’s additive instead, making it even more difficult to play with anything but Bloodied and junkies.
---
What would be great is if he had a chest outside the mine that has his rewards if you didn’t manage to get it in time. Similar to the SB loot protectipn
---
You can get a decent amount through colossal problem with windego teeth
---
I love that he's at the front of the bed. Not the foot of it. All I can imagine is him just standing over somebody's head in a 90 degree angle lean.
---
Grahm sells it. Wait until meat week round 4?
---
I should have added mounts to my post....
---
Or do what the Chinese gold sellers did and make a headless client for the game so you can log in via command line.. I believe its how they managed to run so many gold farming bots
---
Amen

Heres one of my better runs, 1:50 solo with no chems. Apparently his health doesn't scale either with a bigger group.

---
The prime  event in toxic valley gives the most of the lot.
---
this deeply depends on what you are good at and what you like.
---
There's a ton of viable builds.
---
but generally speaking all builds will want frog legs and bloody mess.  almost all builds can benefit from ironclad as well.  From there there's simply too many options to reasonably answer your question.
---
Walking arsenal is hot trash, waste of a slot.  better to get to know where the boxes spawn so you get better at finding loot.
---
As for worrying about your adventure mode character my advise is don't.  make a new character specifically for nw.  give it some lunch boxes from legendary run and power level it to 30 or 40 or so and allocate special specifically for your planned nw build.
---
a couple of fun builds I've used at various points:
---
[https://i.imgur.com/c21KK2M.png](https://i.imgur.com/c21KK2M.png) \- shotgun for up close, sniper for long range.  pair with combat shotgun and scoped lever if possible.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/89asNX9.png](https://i.imgur.com/89asNX9.png) \- commando build, there's a few ways to make this and these perks are not all 100% mandatory, lockpick and longshot are both optional.
---
a lot of ppl run shotgun + demo expert + grenadier for shotty + explosive and it synnergizes with gauss shotgun which is broken op in nw so if you want to be a sheep roll with those :P
---
There's a tutorial on YouTube.
---
I kno it won’t help U right now but sometimes when ur in a public team it will keep u in the team and say “play with team “ when u come back on. That’s the only way I’ve ever gotta back a public server without a friend on it.
---
If anyone else in the 8 person group isn't hidden, then even though the game says you are dealing sneak damage you are not.
---
Takes much longer in a group of randoms than it does solo. He can be taken out in under 2 minutes solo. [1 min 50 seconds (me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xBbbecjh1jA)
---
High charisma and agility really help. Like 10 each.
---
It's been doing that to me all day. At any work bench I try to use at my camp or elsewhere. Servers are struggling
---
It looks like a mysterious item of some sort🤔
---
It turned off by default 🤔
---
You don't get karma for text posts anyways.
---
Or just answer my question?

Switched to 4 leaf. My extra damage on Earl was significantly noticeable. I love the extra protection of blocker but I would rather have that full DMG output. Thank again.
---
YES. Seconded.
---
Private parts because I will forever be a juvenile at heart 😁
---
Yeah, make sure you're on a team if you're doing anything expensive with Workshops. 
---
Any time I Fusion Core farm I make sure I'm always on a public team, even if it doesn't fit what I'm doing.
---
Since they added jetpacks I've been trying to model my character after 'the Rocketeer' and this mask is insanely perfect.
---
I wouldn’t want to reload my plasma to get a core with 30 left
---
Glad I'm not the only one 🤭
---
Probably roleplaying or something. Should've just killed him and took his junk but whatever.
---
You don't need multiple computers; I dual client all the time on the same PC. More than that would be rough without more memory though, but I've only got 16gb; I bet I could run 2 more clients with another 16gb.
---
Ive been playing off and on all day, my vendors are working fine.
---
My Quad Combat Rifle has the same issue, has 80 rounds but reloads automatically when 8, or 27, or 12 or some other random number are still remaining.
---
Could we drop the 'Atom bomb baby' on it instead? A reliable source tells me that she is 'hotter than TNT'
---
When switching from a ballistic weapon I have fight the urge to constantly reload which when using the Gatling plasma saddles you with many partially spent cores.
---
Oh! Hmmm. I missed a couple months thanks to terrible satellite internet making it almost impossible to download the big updates or play. Hate I missed it, but it’ll probably come back next Valentines Day.
---
Wait what quest has weasel?
---
Weird flex but ok
---
No.
---
Are you using the camp module skin?
---
Better be naive than stupid lmao.
---
My condolences- I am on PC but try this: pick a date and time and ask everyone to do something like fire a flare or something simultaneously. I will join on pc
---
I kind of know Jace. Just messaged a mutual friend, your thanks will reach him.
---
not the LOL emote, the Mothman dance would be perfect.
---
I thought that was a real house at first...
---
Secret Service armor is worth it.
---
What's your platform?
---
So sorry for your loss man. Love this game. It has mostly a great community. If I had a PS4 i would totally join. What you're trying to do is awesome. Good luck
---
thank you, I didnt know that
---
I used to dress as Preston Garvey and help people defend their workshops.  Now I hardly see any claimed workshops.
---
it helped yes I wasn't aware of that, thank you
---
Might as well just skip all the baby steps and just have a global auction house.
---
Better yet Bethesda should fix the reload bug so we wouldn't have so many partial cores.
---
If you're using the camp module skin from the season 1 board, you'll have to unequip it, move your camp, requip it and then move your camp again to get it to work properly.
---
You don't even need VMs, this game only uses a single core.
---
It's a rare plan from [phoenix](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Plan:_High-tech_light_set) in watoga. You'll have to server hop and hope to find it. It took me exactly 36 tries to get it the last time I went for it.
---
T 65 with calibrated shocks, medic pump and VATS Assist for Boss fights, one Ultracite arm with jet pack.
---
I was just saying this to my friend today I can’t agree w you more
---
Nope just the standard base skin. It showed the items in the machines and for the caps I was asking but no vendor map icon and the items showing in the vendors are not registering as taking room in said vendors (i.e. 0/30). So after trying numerous things even the age old tech support turn off and back on, I took power from the vendors then turned them back on, I eventually took all items out and tried adding back, it’s no longer even showing the items with cal prices or counting them. It merely acts like I am storing them.
---
You’re asking way too much
---
Innovsurvivalist has a video on YouTube for this “quest”
---
java scripts blocked or something?
---
Sounds like some script is broken and not running properly.
---
As for those who don't like the site, are there any alternatives that you can recommend?
---
This was never a thing. What you read about was for private servers not the main servers.
---
it should be possible with lvl 66. whats your build and which weapons do you use?  
---
im on xbox and also at work so i cant help right now...
---
Nice. It feels good to have that sense of completion! I launched my first yesterday and got the Wendigo Colossus plushie from Colossal problem.
---
Run Line In the Sand or Uranium Fever for the steel.
---
Hopefully all those meat piles will count for looting stuff.
---
do they have power?
---
Last I checked people were still able to build it in your camp, so see if any of your friends have it. It's been a couple of updates so that may have changed, but it may have not. 
---
And that looks like where I have one sitting in my camp, lol.
---
Exactly. Maybe if anything in this game was hard to kill or solo but hardly anything is
---
What causes a dead legendary to look like this?
---
Someone else just made a thread about their vendor seemingly acting odd.
---

---
At least Bethesda didn’t recreate the feeding issues that the drums have when you use crummy darts. Oh no, I might be giving them ideas.
---
I mean, having to choose is sort of the point
---
Quad, ff, or TS. The cryolator does such little damage no modifier will make it a killer. But quad, ff and ts all enhance the way it freezes. I find the TS is the best way to go.
---
Yes. I have a fusion gen with excess power being made for my camp
---
Players don’t need to donate anything for the event to succeed, regardless of how much or how little people donate, Bethesda will mark the goals as a success and give us the rewards. The whole thing is a PR stunt to show how “active” their player base is, do you really think they would take time to design assets that they aren’t going to put in the game because the community “didn’t reach a goal”
---
I do west tec
---
If your steam and bethesda accounts are linked, characters carry over.
---
Atoms do NOT.
---
The Steam copy is likely from the Wastelanders launch, if your Bethesda account was linked to your steam account prior to the wastelanders launch, you got a free steam copy.
---
I got the free steam copy, delinked the accounts and linked the steam to a new bethesda account. Now I have a mule.
---
Hide in the elevator, keep doors closed. May only have to fight a few before time runs out.
---
I normally use a lvl 50 focused Gatling plasma gun for big fights OR my lvl 40 tactical Tesla rifle for bots. I usually just roll in with Chinese stealth armor but I do have full suits available of most power armor. I tried lacing the place with plasma mines to get a head advantage and it didn’t even make a dent.
---
I have been spending 1000 scrip every week to get my secret service armor as you craft the legendary. It is not as fun as you might think, I have not gotten a single piece of Unyielding on anything in 2500 scrip so far.
---
Oh, I didn't realize that.  How do you open multiple windows of it though?
---
I don't do it, just thought it'd be an interesting idea.
---
I saw that and tried it but I couldn’t make it happen. I guess I can go back and try it again. It’s like very few quests are hard...this one was just absolutely insanely impossible to me. 😖
---
Yup!  I was totally surprised when I finally completed that challenge.
---
How do.you open more than one?
---
It’s weird how doing the event is more efficient than actually crafting it
---
This.
---
Like wtf, they want this game to be way too easy.
---
One word: N.U.K.E.
---
Keep grinding for stuff for the next update BoS is coming soon
---
I tend to eat it all.
---
I dont think events would be fun if after 20s half the players at an event went and sat on the sideline while the other half casually took 12 minutes to kill something. That might just be me though.
---
What I have an issue with is it will just stop firing as if there was no ammo left and it reloads. But it just puts that almost spent core back in my inv with like 15 shots left.
---
Sadly not enough ammo to make running my GMG worthwhile, and they don’t drop ultracite cores for my primed UGL ☹️
---
Looks nice, where did you find such flat place?
---
No, not that much.  You'd have to test it, but just towards the end.  And not after each player has done some amount of damage, but as a proportion.  Of one player did 50% of all the damage done, something like that.
---
I open a steam copy and a [bethesda.net](https://bethesda.net) copy.
---
Little laggy, but if I leave my mule in the overseer's house, it's not bad.
---
The game is bugging AF why not let us have something lol
---
Actually I'm not, these features are standard in most online games that involve a trading system.
---
How hard would it be to designate a few servers for survival? Let us hunt and kill. Maybe just say no complaints allowed no matter what happens. Glitches, cheaters, mayhem whatever. I’m game. The railway rifle still drops people like a stone. So fun...
---
I’m being sarcastic lol it’s how I cope with this game lacking of what wouldn’t even be considered a feature on other games
---
I pretty much have. I lost over 400 stimpacks, 30ish dust pails of differing quality, recipes, some legendaries, junk, and I'm sure other stuff I don't remember. 
---
I submitted 3 tickets, got the same reply each time "check your internet, reset your router". They didn't even read the ticket. You, quite literally, have to be a whale and pay for fallout 1st to get real support, otherwise you just get canned responses. 
---
Source: My friend who is / was a whale, got real support replies nearly instantly.
---
Edit: Before anyone says "muh duper", no, I'm not duping. I was transferring stuff with my friend to a mule character after a lot of collecting. 
---
Even my camp gets rolled back. I had my friend build me a camp, *three times*, and it was rolled back each time. Their supplies were gone and I had no camp.
---
He means prime, which uses ultracite cores
---
What kind of stuff? Lol
---
I only have level 1 starched genes and seem to lose it every time. I'm a level 211 and I only have one of those cards
---
I do have perks that get rid of my rads over time so if I can get away before I die I'm good. Sorry filthy casual here.
---
Whats your username. Ill see if i can make it. Ps4- G_leDevious. Sry for your loss
---
Everything
---
The are bugged to all hell, my secondary is a vampires Gatling for the heals, but I always end up dumping a bunch of near empty cores post fight
---
450 levels in and I hadnt tried this, i just always think nahhh that couldnt be right.
---
Or just joint a role playing group or something on discord, make friends and save yourself a butt ton of money 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️
---
I'd prefer they just nerf the OP builds. No one should be downing bosses so fast and it kinda ruins the fun for other players.
---
That way it actually solves the underlying issue rather than putting a band-aid on it.
---
User flair checks out. 😒
---
Gutsys are tough at any level let alone a barrage of them. Hiding was only way i could ever do this one. Scorchbeasts used to buzz watoga alot as well which could distract them idk if one is meant to show up or not. Dont see them in town anymore.
---
Does this Also apply to plasma cores?
---
Best times I've had in this game I had to make myself.
---
I'd recommend always keeping a drill on you.  Then scream through the mic that the repair engineer is here to help and drill your friends power armor while they are fight other things.
---
I know I'm a simple person sometimes, but this puts me in tears every time.
---
I also have a hard fast rule I self enforce.  If booze or drugs are "usable" instead of just being able to pick it up, then I must.  Walk into a bar and I run to the booze before I fight anything.  Junkie for life!
---
Edit typo
---
I'm not saying it's smart, I'm saying it's min maxing
---
I do my trades or item swapping with my mule in the overseer's house because it's a small instanced location.
---
Less to render and no chance of random people running by and picking up what I drop to/from my mule..
---
I have an old quad core intel from like 2005 and a 1080 non-ti.
---
It's the green right next to the Mirelurk pond on the whitespring grounds, nice area and out of the way enough to not be in the blastzone should someone wish to nuke the whitespring for old times sake.
---
Yeah all of my usual spawn points were empty so I never completed those.
---
I've been running into this glitch where when firing my Glat plasma it will get down to 10-18 shots left will go to reload but as it's reloading it shots back up to 245 shots, and I have to cancel the reload or my game just stops like it will just die. I don't know when it happens again I'll try to get video prove.
---
No unfortunately not. The perk card itself specifically states that only double Fusion core duration
---
Ok then I guess that’s where I’ll start. Thanks
---
I'm gonna say early this year was the last time I could actually see an item 🤔 👎
---
Yeah I never realized it either. I had it because I used power armor a lot and when I decided to go for my rifle build to a heavy weapons build I wanted to use the Gatling laser and saw that and I'm full clip it has 999 shots. I was like that's awesome
---
I've asked a few times for the Wrapped Cap to be fixed as well as sent in a bug report to Bethesda directly, but so far no dice. The problem is that it's tagged for the Eyes, Beard and Mouth biped slots in the .esm, unlike Fallout 4 where those slots were not tagged. The Insurgent and Treasure Hunter hats had the exact same issue prior to update 20, so I'm hoping whoever fixed them might one day notice the Wrapped Cap and give it the same treatment. I'd ping the community managers again in this thread, but I don't want to bother them more than I already have.
---
I need a pet liberator his name will be bob after my favourite isopod
---
I'm not trying to tell you how to spend your money man, but I can think of a lot better ways to spend your money lol
---
Encryptid to me is just... okay.  It's usually over pretty fast and, at least for me, the event has been ruined by bugs more than any other event in the game. For example, quite a few times I watched he impostor fall dead to the ground but it would vanish from the spot where I saw it fall. Sometimes I would find the body in a different location, sometimes I wouldn't find it at all which meant that I couldn't loot it.  Other times I have died and was not able to respawn- at all. This meant losing out on all of the event rewards.
---
Scavenger and green hood for a year, winter jacket and jeans + gray knit cap for 6 months and green shirt and combat boots + cowboy hat since then. 
---
I have almost all of them, but keep going back to these three. 
---
I might start wearing the reclaimed helmet + Marine armor, because they belong together.
---
if you schedule it for another time i will totally join
---
If you craft your Cores with high intelligence, say unyielding with low health, you can make cores with 120% charges.  This makes 1400 shots per core, but the weapon only holds 999, leaving you with a partial to annoy you later. Still better a partial with 401 shots than a partial with 1.
---
I'm not going to do this, just that you could do it, and itd be interesting.
---
Amazing!! I broke out my alien blaster just to have a suitable weapon for my captain cosmos suit.
---
Also spent the entire afternoon building a new spooky pumpkin house, to finish and realize the place I chose is very brightly lit.... Guess it's suitable for kids lol
---
I hid and let the robots and scorchbeast fight each other.
---
If you sent the screenshot as a ps message, you can then take a screenshot on your phone using the ps messages app.
---
It is incredibly satisfying if you do get it, though. I'll never forget completing Idle Explosives and seeing "Tattered Field Jacket" pop up in the list of rewards.
---
Oh, interesting.
---
I had no idea it hurt frame rates, I've never experienced that on PC.
---
Is anyone having a issue making them drop 5mm? I get loads of Shotgun Shells but I feel lucky when I see the 5mm drop. Feels like 1/10 for 5mm and every other for shotgun.
---
Bugged at the blood test?
---
Robot/AI
---
Level 1 reduces the chances of it. But it doesn’t protect you 100%. So yea you’re going to need a level 2 version of starched genes if you want to keep all your mutations and be able to take radaway or use the decontamination shower.
---
Oh my fucking god, someone else who knows about the wi flag! If you had it, sucks to be you. Did you happen to play on Darktide? Just curious.
---
I'm pretty sure it still holds the 1400 shots. You just don't usually get to see that because the counter only goes up to 999. I craft the ultracite fusion cores for my scorchbeast queen fights though I don't usually look at it while firing to see if it actually holds that much
---
ngl I did think about "how fun it would be to nuke meat week"
---
sounds not bad. keep in mind to equip the right damage perks (rifleman if the tesla is non automatic, commando if its automatic), think about adding bloody mess from luck or tenderizer from charisma to add damage. also, use the sneak advantage the CSA gives you to get the sneak attack damage bonus. take your time, look around and try to take the robots out one for one. its really not easy but you will feel great when you did it :)
---
I'm pretty sure most of the people know that. Been common knowledge since launch of the game. No offence.
---
I don't know. Everybody I've told to said they've never realize that. But if it is common knowledge then that's my bad
---
I would say don't feel bad, some people don't know, and others do.
---
[https://xkcd.com/1053/](https://xkcd.com/1053/)

What do you mean, no legendary effects? All weapon and armor you make, with plans you buy with gold are legendary. You have to make it with legendary modules.
---
If you want to switch for the max exp gains you can start the team yourself instead of expecting others to play the way you want. 
---
Play the game how you want people and think for yourselves, don't be sheep.
---
Their vertibots, ai ran by the pre war government.
---
It's literally a flag that says PTS and you can hang it on your wall.
---
Oh? I didn't know that, can I choose the effect or do they come at random too?
---
How exactly does this work?  I’ve tried to do it but the artillery never fires.
---
1. No
---
2. Yes
---
3. Demolition Expert yes, grenadier don't know. Never bothered to test it myself and seen posts saying it does, and seen posts saying it doesn't. Either way waste of perks points.
---
Only chest, due to jetpack. Bos combat for limbs is fine, since there is diminishing return for Dr and Er when they are too high.
---
Atleast you don't spawn in the blast zone unprotected 🤠
---
I agree.
---
Yes I understand that.
---
Daily ops are awesome for fuel farming. Mobs get killed in 1-2 shots with my BE flamer and give back 30-40 fuel, almost the same insane return as OP has with their shotgun.
---
I do start the team...... it's a suggestion not a demand. Just trying to get help someone with some exp. Damn.
---
He's talking about the SS, Thorn, and Solar armors and maybe some end-game weapons. Not a lot to choose from.
---
Xbox one!
---
You get 100 fuel everytime u craft a new flamer, maybe it will be cheaper for you
---
From what I understand you have to target the enemy with a recon scope supposedly
---
2% chance on the tickets for a shotgun
---
I wish they let companions accompany you around the wasteland, at least outside of main quests &amp; public events.
---
It's something you accomplished, and therefore you should feel proud of it. Congratulations.
---
Did you craft it through the workshop or workbench?
---
Cost too much to make. But I'm bringing in a lot of acid from the wendigo teeth. And I've been buying a lot of fuel from people as well, I should be stocked up for a while.
---
While I don't have an answer to this, I'll just say this: Wait for the daily ops release, you'll be swimming in fuel in no time.
---
Because this also forces you to move your camp to find the resource that you need. I moved my camp to sit on a junk deposit, I enjoyed playing and building my new camp.
---
It'd save me the trouble of getting my 1000th mutant pipe pistol. I like this idea. Itd flood the market with weapons people actually want and stick it to those "I want your first born child and the spear of destiny" headass traders. Take my upvote.
---
Do you have any damage avoidance or reduction perks? Those ballistic gutsies do me in every time. I just finished at level 30 though, just avoiding the bots.
---
Definitely window shutters like another poster said, but it does kind of look like a McDonald's M.
---
Atleaat id be getting ultracite gatling lasers or whatever else im looking for instead of a pipe revolver pistol
---
Same, and same with vendors recently even if I'm alone.
---
Well, almost every named NPC in Wastelanders is a God and bullets phase right through them, so she probably just kept screaming at you.
---
Yeah, the repetitive delivery is terrible. Wastelands is amazing by the very poor bar that 76 set when it launched. But by FO4 standards, Wastelanders sucks as far as story content goes. The only characters I liked are Weasel, who I still can't find in Crater, and Beckett, because the actor had a lot to work with and had believably dialogue and emotion.
---
For real though, dumbbells are next to impossible to find for a reasonable price right now. It's like they're made of pure gold.
---
Reddit could charge me $5 to upvote this play twice and I’d do it if it was an option. Please for the love of god please
---
It's bid btw
---
Perforating mag ftw
---
I didn’t know so thx
---
ah, that would explain it, thank you
---
Random sadly
---
If not a server at least allow us to toggle a survival mode
---
Seriously? Are we not going to account for all the toxic scum bags that have infected the trading community just because Bethesda’s ability to make a good trading system doesn’t exceed that of a 5-year-old’s?
---
Consolidate the ammo machine with a better UI that becomes a generalized ammo/flamer/energy recycler that can be upgraded with more functionality (kinda like the mysteries consoles)
---
Lol. Here we are, 8-9mo later. I wonder why it affects some players and not others.
---
run the .exe, not from a launcher. It means you have to log in each time, but in this case you want to, since you have to log in to different accounts on each client.
---
Are u on ps4?
---
Everybody you've told are probably new to the franchise.
---
Been a thing since Fallout 4.
---
Yeah, that makes sense.
---
Same here. News to my ears. Thanks
---
I found that chameleon armour was a godsend. I just hid and run about. Hit computer. Hide. Rinse and repeat. I now have evasive perk which is brilliant for enemies just going 'where did they go' when You are right next to them.
---
VertiBOTS
---
Vertibirds and virtibots are two seperate things
---
Completely agree, and a thought occurs to me that didn't when I posted - maybe this next big patch will solve it with this scaling stuff.
---
I said in my experience.
---
It's not too difficult to do solo, what level are you? I did it solo my first time, at level 45, and the only thing I struggled with at the time were the assaultrons.
---
Phoenix has them in Watoga. It may take a few hops to get it to spawn. Pain in the butt to get. Looks really good in camp and keeps light placement costs down as it gives adequate light
---
Workshops capture / defend also drop those
---
warning I came back after a few days break from the game to see on the gameboard for both my accounts that outfit bundle had to be reclaimed a second time !!!!   What's up with that ???!!!
---
 I mean I don't know about anyone else but I hardly 
---
ever got to use a Gatling laser in Fallout 4. Usually by the time I get access to it I'm done with the main story and move on to something else
---
Platform?
---
This questline wasn't released years ago but I know what you mean, it's definitely a pain in the ass when NPCs won't do what their scripted to do 😵
---
Do people really buy it? I usually only eat stuff I cook, and sell all my pre war food at whatever vendor I'm closest to.
---
You can only be logged in to the same account once, naturally, so no
---
You had to link your Steam and Bethesda account by a specific date long past. Once you did, Fallout 76 was auto added to your Steam Library on release.
---
Thats why I suddenly have so much more acid than normal! My cursed flechette harpoon gun is a 1 hit ko on wendigos, so I've been breezing through them.
---
Now I'm curious, how did the campaign end before the Wastelanders update?
---
This. Meat Week is meant to be a friendly, easy-going event for all levels. Throwing it into the Bog/Mire area with max lvl mutants and their neighboring scorchbeasts, scorched, floaters, deathclaws and mirelurk queens doesn’t make for a good time for our lower level friends. Heck, I as a lvl 410 wouldn’t want to be picking up Critter Chunks while having to deal with all that mess lol.
---
Sounds like this would make for a better daily event, where stumbling upon Grahm would trigger a daily quest to go clear out the Steakhouse. Maybe during the rest of the year he’s looking for hunting grounds for the Primal Cuts events and asks you to scout ahead, so the daily would send you to a diff location (out of a set few) to clear out.
---
But realistically, I’m sure Meat Week will stay right where it is. I don’t see them moving it when it works great where it is. :)
---
Here me out.....SPIRAL STAIRCASES

---
Do you have two copies of the game?
---
Meaninglessness teams in line with the Apocalypse IMHO 🤷🏻‍♂️. There were a couple times I read people's letters or discovered dead bodies when I literally had to sit there for a minute and recover from a momentary despair. Those are the kind of steaks I want every time I play this game, not oh well I find that former Raider Hunter and blow his brains out before a rando creature kills the Runaway Raider for the 3000 time how exciting!
---
I'm sorry, but I still do not think it would be a good change. If somebody specs into being able to deal massive amounts of damage in a short while, I dont think they should get a debuff for doing so. Magic weapons are an exception. Ideally they would just be fixed, but certain legacies have reigned for almost two years now. One Wasteland and the changes to the damage formula might make this issue less apparent for you. I would much rather they go in the direction of making enemies lootable for just showing up though. That way you dont punish and particular player base.
---
If I may ask, what actually is you issue? Magic weapons melting the queen? Bloodied melee killing the queen in seconds? Someone melting the ISS before it hits invulnerability? The fastest I've seen Earle die was around a minute and a half but I know there are groups who do I faster.
---
T65 with one legacy jet pack ultrasight arm piece, And a excavator set for back up.
---
To grind, or not to grind? That is the question... for you to decide. There are also a lot of other cool games out there.
---
👌
---
Holy shit that's awesome!
---
What I do to transfer screenshots is send the picture to a friend (or one of those spam bot conversations, because why not bother them with random screenshots) then I go to the PlayStation Messages App on my phone and save the picture to my gallery. Then from there send it wherever you’d like
---
I should have worded it better. Why in god's name do we even have the drum mags at this point when they're outclassed by literally anything else that isn't the bog standard one.
---
Ideally a drum magazine is something you should take if you want big sustained DPS at the cost of one hell of a reload time, but here you're sacrificing reload time for... 6 or so more bullets? To add insult to injury the Swift and Stinging mags also give you a few more bullets on top of their effects. Effectively invalidating Drum entirely.
---
It's quite bad game design to completely invalidate drum mags in their current state with the existence of Swift and Stinging. The combat shotgun one is in a decently better state (12 shots compared to swift and stinging 4) but then you have guns like the handmade that fall right back into that trap.
---
Don't want to spoil too much if you haven't done it yet, but pretty much the scorched earth event and killing the queen. Never really finished it up very well imo but they had to keep it open for replayability I guess
---
I think that's on their side. I have mine at 1080p on high, even though it's capable of doing 1440p. The event itself is full of bugs, graphic and otherwise.
---
Strangler heart, shocks, emergency protocols, targeting hud, and a legacy jet pack arm. Rocking the hellfire paint.
---
It was a bitch to get all those mod plans but worth it
---
Pc
---
Ya'll be downvoting me, but it doesn't change the fact that I'm right. Enjoy your shooter with worse gun play than Skyrim gun mods. 💁‍♂️
---
I have wanted the merc cruiser outfit since launch
---
Good to know it can handle even a flamer.
---
But here’s a somewhat easier tip - the boss of sacrament always drops 100 fuel. Server hop for about thirty minutes, and you’ll have plenty.
---
I think I have about 8 people on there though
---
Maybe I’ll try that with extra sneak perks equipped like you mentioned. I think I was in power armor before bc of the energy resistance.
---
I'm not op if you didn't realize.  I agree auto loot would be better.  I'm pretty sure magic guns are fixed in pts, so hopefully they'll roll that out soon.
---
I'd help you.
---
Yeah I noticed that, I always just take off my power armor when I'm at my camp now, it's impossible to do anything with power armor on.
---
It wouldn't be a lore breaking addition. Fallout 3 takes place is the East Coast, and the Merc cruiser outfit is not tied to any faction.
---
I’m down. Lmk when you are available since I’m kind of indebted to you now. I’ll be home in a bit and am flexible this week.
---
Did you miss that there's only three percent left and as of when I'm writing this another eleven hours to go?  Bethesda moved the goalposts when due to resource scarcity there was no chance in hell of the goal being met otherwise, meanwhile in this case there's a decent enough chance that the goal has already been met and we're just waiting for someone to update it in the morning.
---
I actually think if this happened I'd stop crafting legendary stuff if I'm honest. It would literally mean when I craft 1000 secret service left legs so I can get a 1star unyielding left leg, it will take even more longer or when I nest get a mission or pick up something that causes that screen to come up, I'll get eat raped.
---
My mule account started 2 weeks after start and lvl 97.5 score atm, not doing NW daily 99% of the time
---
Don't get me wrong I love this game if they can let banned duppers back in the game then at lease let us have something of our choice
---
Yeah, usually happens after I mod it or when I first load in. Also happens a lot at ACP.
---
I'll be on for another hour and a half.  If you get home soon, tell me and we can do it tonight.
---
Not my camp.  But I did have a turret that just insisted on killing my junk protectron.
---
Hey! You found the 'Scorched Orgy ball'!
---
It's great fun isn't it. Just jump in and enjoy the ride!
---
I've never ran blocker. Dodgy and serendipity all the way. My thought process being if you are seen, you've already messed up. And if you can't kill what found you before it runs up and smacks you, you might want to reconsider your play style. While there are times you will be detected for no apparent reason, I found three points to be rather steep for something that will only trigger on the rare chance I've been hit, it then has to make it through serendipity, dodgy and sentinel before it even matters.
---
Are you mentally deficient?  These tasks aren't set to just automatically complete and fill up the bar as time goes on, that's why Bethesda had to actually step in on phases like concrete and lower the goal to levels that were actually achievable to match its scarcity.  There's only three fucking percent left and almost twelve hours to go.  Bethesda doesn't need to do shit at this point because as the event page doesn't update manually this task is likely well over by now and just waiting for someone to update it in the morning.
---
Scientist perks are for nodding weapons only. You only need the Heavy Gunner Perks.
---
I never knew Veronica from F:NV played this game hahah
---
I giggle snorted. 
---
Well played.
---
Don't know why. I don't understand their fascination with having realism when it comes to workbenches, I honestly wouldn't care if there was no animation for PA using a workbench, just bring up a menu like how you can bring up the pipboy without really bringing it up.
---
Raider quest to get Lucky Lou from the mine.
---
First time I encountered a wendigo I didn't touch the game for another year lmao.
---
👌🏻
---
I just completer it.
---
Great loot? I gained access to the "Mysterious Cave" but didn't find any loot in there.
---
Oh well, at least the message won't pop-up anymore.
---
Of I remember right, it used to hold like 50/80 but with the TSE nerf, it's got nerfed along with everything related to the TSE days.
---
Not every vault got them.  Vault 94 was given a GECK, but not 101.  The locals tried to destroy it, caused it to explode, and the chaos resulted in The Mire.
---
Animations piss me off cause of how unnecessary they are.
---
Even if most people know, PSAs like this are helpful and comments like that are not. No offense.
---
Vault 79, the vault of gold.  The loot was the fun time you had doing it.  :)  I'm pretty sure it was going to originally be how you accessed vault 79.
---
Between colossal problem and radiation rumble I'm never low on rounds lol.
---
I would agree with with you if half of the best attachments can be made with no perks.
---
I remember a time when they said it wasn't possible to give us more then FO1ST came out with a scrap box.
---
Would love to have a shared bank between characters or more stash space myself.
---
Im aware that not every fault got one, but it seems like a huge oversight on Vault-Tecs part to not give us at least one.
---
Oof
---
There’s some face paints Raiders at Crater have, think they look cool honestly. 
---
The good news is that when mod support comes out, there will be plenty of customization mods there, if Beth doesn’t do it themselves. Of course, if it’s Creation Club only, that’ll be... Problematic.
---
Oh gotcha lol.  I finished vault 79 a while ago so thought that there would be something else in the room.  It seems odd that there's nothing relevant in the room, so your theory about its original use seems accurate.
---
Follow these *exact* instructions:
---
1. Leave the server you're on.
---
2. Join another server.
---
3. Go install the fuse. Do NOT touch the terminal.
---
4. Fast travel away somewhere.
---
5. Close the entire game.
---
6. Go back and install the fuse first, then use the terminal.
---
This exact order of events fixed the quest for me.
---
It needs to drop repair kids. I use like 2-3 improved ones per fight.
---
Thanks for your reply. I do recognise the issue you describe though.
---
If only there was some kind of easy-to-use machine that we could you to scrap or merge cores in....
---
Oh boy, i pick up every dog food and dont use it somehow. Have like 300+ on my main and 150+ on every alt. There is to much other food around, pepperoni rolls and deathclaw steak are my gourmet shit
---
Yeah I remember when it was a super rare drop and people payed a fortune for it. Now it's like 100cta Grafton haha. I for one am glad they made the change
---
I think it says so on the wiki, but idk.  Wouldn't that have been a cooler way to find the vault though?
---
How did you even learn this
---
Yeah just wondering if it's smoke or lighting  related,  maybe there are some ini values i can tweak
---
Yeah, my handmade has this problem as well. Like almost any gun Ive used has had this problem.
---
It does the same with .50 cal etc automatic weapons, but with non energy weapons it is not the same problem than fusion/ultracite/plasma gatlings. 
---
My personal best was to go to SBQ fight with 12 ultracite cores and found out that they got about max 10% on them.
---
I use ultracite core weapons because you can craft full ultracite core with fusioncores that has only 1% load on them and because I hate when my powerarmor is out of juice because this. Also 2 Fusion cores are 3 ultracite and Super Duper perk will sometimes give me douple :D
---
Also with Power user perk douple the charge so one full has 800 "rounds" on it. With 40 cores you can fight quite long and I think that resource gathering is easier / takes little time compared to make 32.000 .45 / .308 / .5.56 or even 50 cal and 5 mm rounds ?
---
There’s one on PC too 😂
---
Imagine putting my 300 dog food to vendor 😁 my stash is always full
---
They have always been there. Its just not known that there is a second vendor. When I tell people they go to the train station and they come back telling me i lied.
---
I take no credit for this.. [I read it on the Fallout wiki.](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/An_Ounce_of_Prevention#Bugs)
---
What you mean Armor Ace? Hell no Im actually excited for this one. Last legendary run was space themed which was lame, but this next one is G.I. Joe VS Commies themed, kind of a military feel to it. That cool face mask, badass dark red skin for the scout armor and marine armor, Handmade and pump shotgun skins, the steel floor and wallpaper, the bunker? All of this looks badass.
---
I’m so excited I hope they start it immediately after the current run finishes instead of giving us a couple week break in between.
---
I don't think they meant that so literally hahah. Though I've used 16000 5.56 ammo in with me only doing the event about 9 times. Earle truly is a bullet sponge without God tier weapons hahah.
---
its good times lol pretty easy to die or forget to put your power armor on if your not wearing it already.
---
They have not always been there. The change was made like a year ago
---
Haha, funny guy
---
Probably not my worst orgy, lets do this thing!
---
Tesla are broken right now and kill frame rate to a crawl for everyone except the user. Please store your Teslas until they fix it.
---
The only Raider NPC I actually liked a lot. 😏
---
They could even merge the 2 maps, make it so you can move between states and eventually have it so you can roam the entirety of the USA. Each state having a different storyline. I know it’s unrealistic but it seems cool!
---
Lots of bushes and water to hide in on that map. That’s why I always vote for it.
---
Part of the goal for 76 was to control the silos, but also examine what would happen to the occupants when they were let loose in the wild.  Not much to go on but makes me think they wanted them to scatter.  Could just as well be that famous vault-tec incompetence.
---
Really? Im sure i had most of them around December of its launch because they had a chance to spawn in there.
---
Ain't that a kick in the head
---
Yeah I agree. It really puts me off starting a new character
---
They have said they are interested in expanding the map
---
Blackwater Mine is also haunted, phantom molerats and moleminers attack you sometimes untill you exit.
---
I don’t disagree, but I doubt it’ll happen. Especially with the massive dupes that make PvP all about “skill” (having certain items and fuck tons of Nuka Quantum), it wouldn’t exactly be a balanced fight, and the number of people who are interested in PvP are rather low. 
---
I enjoy it from time to time, but I’m afraid it just won’t happen.
---
Yea I have a bloodied fixer as well
---
What would you do if you didn’t have that? Just run around killing things?
---
Spoopy.
---
They're adding more areas in 22, not mOs mind you, but still, more content.
---
Yes,  I finally got one of these drops after 3500 hours about 2 months ago.
---
Was he wearing a plague doctor mask?
---
It isn’t just the reload reflex that causes this problem. Some vendors don’t accept X (Xbox reload and interact for sales) even though the interact cue is on screen, and now you’ve cycled to a higher charge. While this doesn’t happen all the time, it adds up if you carry a bunch of cores.
---
They had a rare chance of spawning at Grafton steel. Then they changed it to have them sold in Grafton. Trying to find the itv that mentioned it but it'd hard while entertaining a 6 month old haha
---
But I remember all the folk trying to scam people on the market sub right when the change was made
---
Lvl 270 here. Never new that - Thanks!
---
It’s perk related which is why I sell it, I generally list it whenever I get to 20 and it goes in 2-3 hours of gameplay
---
Wtf 🤣🤣
---
There is a pretty big pvp playerbase. Reddit just hates the feature, so if you come here talking about pvp it will always get a negative response. Alot of fallout derived PTSD around here concerning the topic. And im aware this will get downvoted, but its the truth.
---
Play most nights about the time you posted. What level you at?
---
At first I read it as "Unarmed guy" and was wondering how be was punching things while on a pole. I need sleep.
---
Right?!!
---
6\) Get a "Your camp could not be placed" message every time you log on (because all the acid deposits around the map are really popular camp locations).
---
Yes! And make it the enclave power armor from fo3.
---
I thought they made it so all the plans showed up instead of just a chance.
---
Its not that way for a 50 or mini, but gatling? Hell yeah, I've been running the daily ops with my furious gat and my 5mm ammo count has just gone up and up and up.
---
Hmmm
---
Alternatively why don't you just change teams to an events towards the end. You can stop, hope you don't die or maybe purposefully die so you can then peruse teams at your leisure for an events team with an open slot. If that is taking too long you can always start one yourself. 
---
Cumbersome isn't? Takes you out of the moment and away from the action doesn't it?
---
Its the same thing you're asking of others. If it's effort that if you are not willing to do, you shouldn't be so demanding of others. 
---
You should be understanding when one doesn't and be extremely appreciative when someone does. 
---
I expect you'll be deleting this post and putting up another one "to those who stop towards the end of the event and change team goals ftom building to events, I salute you"
---
I won't be holding my breath though.
---
Wow. No wonder I am being downvoted hard just for wanting a game mode. To me it makes complete sense to have the two modes for the two types of players, but everyone seems to want no part of PVP and also doesnt want others to have a pvp mode either
---
Yep, they don't display.
---
I'll join
---
Well on the bright side 4 had the best customization in the series.
---
There's a bug we can take advantage of for now. 
---
Find a node which usually gives ore, and you'll notice it's an ultracite one instead of whatever it's supposed to be. Collect the ore and then keep trying to collect it after receiving the ore. If you look around scorched will have spawned nearby. Kill them and repeat this as many times as you want.
---
We could have uses those detonators....
---
Melee or..?
---
They could have still scattered with G.E.C.K.'s....
---
Vendor caps
---
Something must have changed, im still having the error
---
Then just give him the caps
---
Come to think of it, when I was using a Drum Magazine before the nerf I had the same issue on my Furious Handmade.
---
Funny you say that, because last weekend bethesda linked my beth account to my steam account without notifying me and I also didn't pay for it on steam.
---
I have a feeling reviving someone in the rain counts too. When I got it it was for reviving a friend and it was on the side of the road. Im pretty sure no puddles were around. It wasnt till later that it clicked it was possibly raining
---
that's 90% of the game with or without the inane busywork.
---
I prefer without.
---
That's weird, because I did it just last night. I was stuck on that mission for a month..
---
I’m really glad my first character was heavy and shotgun. Second character was commando pistol - doing the second one around just entailed the gauss pistol and grind.
---
The best part about a shared bank is alts to create great camp designs. I love my camp, and don’t want to scrap it to make more, but I don’t want to grind a character either
---
I could swear I had the same issue with an assault rifle. Saw the message pop up and got caps but it's still there.
---
Well that's terrifying, have they said nothing about fixing it?
---
It also freezes up the most. Win some, lose some.
---
It's supposedly going to be fixed in the next update, which should be in a couple of weeks I think.
---
Oh boy...
---
First it was the “Lone Wanderer”, Hunter’s Longcoat, Black Eyepatch, Black Cowboy Hat, and a Black Shovel Backpack.
---
Then it was the that outfit except with a Treasure Hunter Outfit instead during the Treasure Hunter Event.
---
Then it was a courier 6 like outfit by swapping the treasure hunter outfit with elite ranger armor.
---
Then I got the idea for a really cool outfit using the Silver Shroud outfit, black Cowboy Hat, Black Eyepatch, and Raider Pathfinder mask. (This one looked really good with a matte black handmade. Could also use the Stalkers glasses.)
---
Came up with a neat looking outfit with the Mountain Scout/Insurgent Outfit, Medical Goggles, and the Raider Pathfinder Mask.
---
Then I tried something with the Bog Wanderer outfit, Black Eyepatch, and insurgent hat. That outfit lasted about as long as the community challenges did because I came up with my all time favorite outfit...
---
The Wasteland Plague Doctor. The Quack Doctor Outfit, Plague Doctor Mask, and Revolutionary Generals Hat. Looks like something out of Bloodborne. I love it.
---
(Then after ACP dropped and I got the helmet I came up with another outfit. Reclaimed Deep Mining Helmet, Insurgent Outfit, SS Backpack, and a matte black handmade. Feels very tactical... I still really like the Plague Doctor outfit though.)
---
Nuke Monogah Mine
---
Do you use vats a lot? Vats interrupts the pop up and causes it to show next time you go through a loading screen.
---
Ran out of caps myself and I had 3000+ pure water from my 12 industrial water purifier🤣
---
Yeah he did that.
---
Theres already a lot of grind I got the legendary run, trying to get the 100% perfect effects. The rep and gold grind is amazingly slow and ive done it twice. I don't use it on anything else so why cant I use it on a new character I can bank items in eso and use them on a new character why not here?
---
He’s now on level 12 but still no thru hiker... thanks for the info!
---
Yes !!!!!
---
I really don’t get players like this. The way you play doesn’t seem fun. You always seems dressed out, upset and sone times angry.
---
You never seem like your having fun. 
---
Too each their own though.
---
I’m hoping they add a shiny black skin (Like the enclave robots.) to the scout armor someday... I’m excited for the red scout skin coming up in armor ace, but I’d never unequip it if they came out with a black and chrome skin.)
---
Very true.
---
I've tried changing teams to an event one but usually can't bond x4 before ACP is over because people are getting really good at taking down earl. 
---
As a Building team leader, as soon as the action of the event ends I loot and somewhere around the last 30 seconds of the given 1.5 minutes before the mine collapses, switch team objectives. By then my character is forced outside and receives the exp boost. Then switch back to a building objective. Easy peasy lemon squeezy. All in about a minutes work. 
---
People are really just overthinking this like it's expected of them. It's just a suggestion for leaders not a demand.
---
Note, will be editing for each question since I find it hard to remember things haha
---
I ended up next to the wayward after I started leveling up, cause I realized the farther away I got the less people came to the vendors. I get all the low levels buying up my plans that I'm selling for dirt cheap.
---
Why do they even have the golf skirt in the Gabe...it’s awful. 
---
The ratty skirt is fun though, not terrible.
---
Totally agree with your main point.
---
Where is it in grafton
---
Yeah, it's baffling why it doesn't prioritize the lower cores already since it does exactly that for Power Armors. They already know how to do it.
---
Alternatively it should let you choose the core you're using, like other equipped items.
---
Happy cake day 👍
---
Amen! Kinda frustrating that I have to go into my ammo menu and check the charge level of random cores. I typically ditch them if I find any at 25% or less.
---
Well depending on the level of the player...one of the first perks I picked was Good Doggy as it helps to get 75hp when you are level 10 and can find the cans everywhere
---
Don't know how "wrong" I play, but its still ammo negative for me as junkie commando.
---
I didn’t even know the next event challenge was up... They need to have this on the front page instead of the stupid ass atomic shop villains picture.
---
subjectivity truly is magic.
---
personally I'm not having fun *because* I need to grind about 10k gold for a T65 set. that's 840 treasury notes over a month and a half, plus smiley's tip.
---
Yeah, as a fellow “dude” i guess, who feels free to dress however I please in a game,  I love to sometimes rock the ratty skirt. But I also wish for some variety, it’s the wasteland, let us live it up a little lmao
---
&gt; I can bring it up next time the circle spins and someone has a new "system". 
---
Whether the actual random number generator works is meaningless though (unless its wrong). 
---
It wasn't even a suspect, since most people (including OP) experiences that the loot varies per server.
---
That’s why I buy the 4th of July dress cause it’s one of the few cute dresses in the game.
---
I usually have issues with frames and lag outdoors in areas with big cliffs and lots of stuff to render but surprisingly in the event, even with 8 people, it runs totally fine.
---
Is this your first time doing the event? Could’ve been a bad server.
---
IT WORKED
---
It's not worth starting another character for this reason. It's not worth the time spent.
---
I was gonna say it was from last year and didn’t come back this year.... but I’d be wrong. It was from this year. February 2020 only *feels* like last year.
---
He was just a Ranger with a big iron on his hip
---
I'm going to do- this delink now that I know
---
I genuinely blew 6k ammo on the SBQ one time with my .50cal it would have been more but my gun broke idiots standing on fences prevented her from landing for almost the entire event timer, she landed with 5 seconds or so to go and we almost killed her.
---
Only stealth builds are allowed to hide on tents, buildings, fences as they won't get targeted by the queen 
---
as she tries to land at the same height as players being on the tent means that height is in the air so she won't land but as they are hidden she won't try to land on them and will land on someone else
---
Doesn’t say that anywhere in your post
---
“Nw is garbage because the requirement for winning is to know other level 200+ people and form a team with them. Everyone using mics. Every one working together. Everyone knows what they are doing.
---
I’d love to see how these people do in solo or duos mode. Or even just random queue. They won’t even play the game without their friends”
---
You don’t say anything about not wanting to play a team game. If you want w battle royale mode you can solo. Go play pubg or fortnite. Stop putting yourself at a disadvantage and feel the only thing to do is complain.
---
Cannibal perk is life. 😈
---
He's the only mob I've used my magic shotty on and STILL barely tickles him.
---
It one-two hits mirelurk queens/legendary hermit crabs but that big bastard just soaks up ammo.
---
I wish they improved survival instead of hopping on the battle royale band wagon but it's too late for that. They're now constantly trying to force us to play the crappy inferior NW mode they replaced it with to unlock Adventure mode rewards. IMO they were better off just deleting pvp entirely till the core game wasn't so volatile, if ever.
---
I didn't mind doin survival challenges for the unique weapons and even made a character dedicated to it but a lot of things in this game just don't make sense in PvP (like the RNG perks and legendary affixes and the way damage is calculated) along side the bugs, dupes, legacys and hacks.
---
But NW instead is a big downgrade in fun to me. It's just a waste of time overall to me (literally, all that waiting) and a PvP mode type I've never cared about (Prefer Deathmatches, Capture the Flag or Seige type modes, personally). I guess it's what kids are obsessed with most nowadays so everyone thinks it should be in every game when it shouldn't. Survival fit this one far better but they never tried to do anything with it.
---
Although if they kept it at cap/junk loss only there may of been more people playing it just to dick around and have fun despite all the flaws. Diablo 2 pvp style.
---
Serenitity- lost count the amount of times that card has saved me!
---
Can you CRAFT legendaries? Or do you mean modify them?
---
Anti armor only works for high fire rate weapons.
---
DPS is definitely the name of the game, his health pool is dumby thicc.
---
They are also sold in the train station in Grafton. The secondary vendor is the only place you have a chance of getting heavy metal armor from a vendor though.
---
That's weird.
---
I was wondering why my UGL suddenly had a 999 clip. Thought it was a bug. 217 levels and just now learning this, take my upvote as thanks!
---
I’ve played it before without issues (other than dying a lot) but last time was crazy. I’d die and it would say respawn in 45 seconds.
---
Two points you should keep in mind
---
1 - MMO features like you want in a non-mmo game is not likely to happen. Though I guess a MMO subscription happend but I still wouldn't hope for a account wide banking or mail system if it wasn't there to behind with.
---
2 - No business is going to listen to you if your subscribe to their services. Reason being is that logically you wouldn't pay extra for something your not 100% happy with. Would be better if you don't mention your a Fallout 1st subscriber when making suggestions, a business is much more likely to take your suggestions if they think you'd become a subscriber.
---
Also I really want a better way to transfer items other than cheesing the group system or privite worlds and would be very happy to buy atoms for it xD
---
Just for 5k caps you buy this happy trails pass and enjoy travelling between our current trade routes and if you are willing to do some guarding we will drop the price of the pass.........   /s
---
Don't get a collectron yet. We should be getting a free BoS one soon in the Atomic Shop. ☺️
---
It's very interesting to me, of not an oversight by Bethesda, that vault 76 didn't get one. Obviously the experiment for 76 was not to hold its brightest, or even to solely hold the nukes if this is so.
---
I know, he's insane. I actually don't know how I've completed the event a few times with people using op legacies. But the upcoming nerf is coming to change that.
---
Well they already have Fallout 4's map made with more or less the same detail as 76, theyd just have to incorporate it. I like this idea even if it is unrealistic but imagine the possibilities 🤤
---
I assume you're in charge of a business as large as Bethesda? Some kind of Fortune 500 finance bigshot? Cuz you sure seem to think you can speak on behalf of an entire company with a board of directors and a reputation to rebuild.
---
does power user also works for plasma cores?
---
Did you go back and talk to Maggie and give her the watch? You also have to talk to her a second time and give her the holotape
---
i need to roll some armour
---
no
---
Am sure it will all be just fine.
---
Yeah the secret service underarmor is probably the best in the game once its shielded and you can make the secret service armor and the other non PA armors legemdary by buying legendary modules at the purveyor and crafting the armor pieces into random legendarys.
---
We could be the founders of the new Vegas strip... help implement  the G.E.C.K and because this early in the timeline nothing is set in stone as well! We could even help establish the trading post at nuka-world
---
I do wish more people would stop going on the fences and Fallout 1st tents, stealth build or not. I have a stealth commando, someones another mod spots me and in turn the queen can agro on me anyway.
---
But I don't feel the queen is as spongy as Earle. Might just be me but I average around 500-600 shots on the SBQ and around 1.5k shots with Earle.
---
It does, but I think it might be part of the reload bug that leaves you with a bunch of low charge cores. I use gat lasers all the time on my team medic character and after a good play session i end up with many partial cores. I end up with fewer when I don't equip it but I have not done any real testing.
---
The only thing great about fallout 4's character customization system was that it could be modded lol
---
Set a time and date and we can all do something regardless of our console.  I’d love to make a little memorial at my CAMP 💙
---
well still the captain cosmos bundle is rank 98
---
Hmm, I've revived a fair amount of people in this event. I need to see if that one got checked off. I still need to do the Swimmer's test at the lake so the badge wouldn't have completed and I don't currently have that challenge "followed"
---
Tip: if you have an explosive gun, put the Grenadier Perk in Perception. You will have a bigger area for the explosive damage of the gun, and you will tag easily  the raining schorched, with only a few shots :)
---
After that,don't forget to put the Scrapper card on :)
---
Also! for the love of Mothman, don't use energy weapons which leave behind goo or ashes, because the whole area fills with pixels and lag and nobody can loot.  thanks!
---
Can also just bash to cancel.

I was wondering if we could guide him into that giant drill for damage...
---
I'm on quite often. PSN: createbeauty
---
Thx!
---
I’m friends with Jace and I sent him this post! He got a kick out of this for sure. He’s good people, if you see him on again, definitely add him!
---
I have the holotape but it won’t let me give it to her.
---
Now that is some next level thinking, that would be pretty cool.
---
1. Yes you complete the challenges for score which has rewards if atoms among other things. You can also get atoms through account milestone challenges.
---
2. I hope you really fucking love grinding and playing every single day. Doing events before you unlock the ability to get gold bullions is practically worthless besides for the exp. The only ways to get gold bullion notes which can be converted into gold bullion is by quests. However you do not get them before you finish the main wastelanders quests. 
---
Also you can only redeem 20 for 200 a day. So if you can't log in daily to collect youre not really gonna be able to buy anything useful. 
---
You can also get some from the legendary run and redeem some for caps per week.
---
3. Oh boy the enclave and BOS don't really exist right now. They exist as quests where you do things for them. Not exactly out and about. The BOS is coming maybe next month and we'll see what they do. 
---
Hey remember that part about loving grinding and logging in every single day? This is part 2.
---
Settlers and raiders give you daily quests. You can finish these for reputation. You can fully complete their reputation to unlock purchasable items (with gold bullions) that are pretty neat and considered end game gear.
---
This however literally takes months of irl time. Not a joke. Literally months of logging in every day to collect reputation. 
---
4. Honestly I think its a side quest that ties into wastelanders. So it's part of the main quest meant to help you by pushing you in the right direction.
---
How many times did you try? After I talked to her it just let give her the watch. The second time it let me give her the holotape
---
Yep dont feel too bad though, bethesda is apparently working on something new pvp wise. And they've been doing a bit of balancing for it already. You just don't here about it because nobody on the sub cares for pvp. I could be wrong but I'm pretty sure it was in a (somewhat) recent interview with Pete Hines where he mentioned a pvp mode in the works.
---
Wow ok then there’s no reason I shouldn’t be able to get it...Thankfully someone has volunteered to help me out but I’ll def make sure to suit up properly. Thanks
---
I’m also very disappointed it doesn’t show up in displays... It’s basically the only reward I got from that quest and I can’t even display it.
---
(I loved collecting unique misc items in New Vegas and setting them up all over my Novac motel room.)
---
Can do...
---
Do you do races or casino jobs or what for gta?
---
also what perks would apply, if any to this weapon im not really sure where it lies
---
I meant no offense so you may as well chill there. Wether you subscribe to 1st or not makes no difference to me. I was just pointing out low level logic regarding that sort of stuff.
---
Anyone who ever studied business would be aware of that. There's simply no business logic nor profit to be made unless your threatening to unsubscribe. You don't need to to be in charge of a large business of a Fortnite 500 finance bigshot to understand basic business. Literally saying you are paying extra for something (be a subscription or otherwise) gives a stronger indication you don't actually care about your suggestion to a business sololy because it's actually extremely rare for people to pay for extras for something for not already 100% happy with.
---
Still broken lol
---
No idea, I saw from 150 till 999. I think 300-500 is a reasonable price
---
Personally I run a Sneaky Automatic Rifle Build with An Anti-Armor Explosive Handmade and I do about 425 to the head per shot. Sometimes more sometimes less depending on the enemy and level.
---
Lever action rifles deal nearly the same damage per shot as hunting rifles, but fire faster. They are a better end game weapon, and an instigating one would be your best bet. I have a two-shot explosive on my sniper, and it works as sort of a shotgun for "uh-oh they're getting too close" moments, but the fact that its damage is spread across multiple projectiles means it's weaker against armor. I picked up an instigating gauss rifle on one of my other characters but haven't had a chance to transfer it over to try it out.
---
The damage per second of lever actions still isn't great, so for prolonged fights like scorchbeasts and stuff, you'll want something with high sustained dps. The best is heavy weapons, which is what my sniper uses, but a junkie's fixer or handmade with hardened receiver would be totally viable (but crazy expensive). Lower damage per second than most heavy weapons but better accuracy. A junkie's combat rifle isn't far behind. I saw a post recently saying that on the PTS, the nerf to the damage equation makes an anti-armor handmade just about as effective as junkies, so long term that's probably going to be the way to go.
---
i had this issue too today: vendors empty, all displays empty 😡
---
It does not work with the plasma gun
---
I’ve thought this too!
---
yeap, it was 80....
---
Shit yeah I love nuka-world, been playing it for the first time, would still be going but I keep blue screening on the PS4 so giving it a break for a bit. I prefer it over Far Harbour x100 but I haven't finished that one yet either, survival mode gets tedious walking back and forth all the time 😑
---
So it is, I've updated the post. I can't update the title though.
---
It's okay if you get in with some try-hard assholes who just decimate the thing in like 5 minutes because of whatever build they're using. Except for I don't care about a cursed pickaxe or 17,000 plans for a fucking stuffed animal. Where the fuck is my meat pile?
---
some legendary effects on fast fire rate weapons are bugged and can kill bosses in a few seconds.
---
angryturtle has a couple videos explaining them, but essentially an instigating, junkie's or stalker's/vats hit chance, limb or bashing damage LMG, minigun, gatling laser are classified as 'magic' by the community.
---
That’s why I play on normal lmao
---
Thanks! I'll look into that :)
---
I’m fairly certain I had three spawn one time... The Brahmin were dead no avoiding that. But I did walk away with three legendaries though.
---
Awesome.. Have fun!
---
Same for me on my first time - I had NO IDEA what I was getting into with that card! The result was brutal but fun.
---
Yeah I'll probably do a run on hard after this just for fast travel and I haven't played with mods yet so want to give that a go.
---
Just an ally or merchant that is going for that station. Click it wait a few secs (or spam keys)
---
It’s a good alternative to Bloodied/Junkies builds like people were talking about. You get pretty decent damage without having as many negative effects (such as having addictions/withdrawal symptoms or only having 20% health)
---
I mean logically the reason Bethesda didn’t write it that way is because the G.E.C.K. Can be OP
---
I mean that's definitely the reason it just makes very little sense without that factor.
---
Those were the good old days.
---
What do you do on FO76 when you get together?
---
It really doesn't matter what you use.
---
They're all very comparable. I'd recommend Ultracite if you can afford to trade for a jetpack arm.
---
Probably an attempt at roleplay? but I dont blame ya for not taking him seriously. I'm in a BOS RP group and one of the people I'm supposed to take orders from sounds 12. Real hard to take him seriously.
---
Just happened to me. Fast travel back to the cave entrance and then running back to AC again fixed it
---
What all items are you using?? I’m getting like 220 damage per bullet out of my B2525 fixer. That’s with All three maxed commando, tank killer, concentrated fire, tenderizer, Adrenal Reaction, covert op, Revenant, Bloodly Mess, Nerd Rage, and Psychotats.
---
True it does take away the lore points what can you do?
---
Found 2 (2 of 3 serverhops) of them at the little military base near west tek a couple of days ago.
---
My Camp Mate (rader punk) sends me regularly to kill a flatwoods monster or a mothman
---
No we don't.
---
Lucky you, I end up dying before the actual visual effect of the embers even render in, with fireproof on
---
If you look up the secret vendor it will explain how to spawn him near Charleston Railway, I believe.  He's had it the last 3 times I've gotten him to spawn.
---
My female alt wears the Misstress of Mysteries set. It's not perfect (wish it was Evening length instead of Tea), but it's feminine...in a 1920's sort of way...
---
Just got back. Idk if you have time at this point. Lmk. We can do it anytime this week too.
---
Thats why I rerolled my main as the shotgunner and rerolled a PA Heavy gunner, which doesnt need the grind
---
A GECK would've been able.to clarify how a group of Raiders can survive in the Toxic Valley.
---
There's a workaround for this that has worked for me 100% of the time.
---
When you're dead and can't respawn, open your team members list, (it's hard to describe it, but it's the tab just to the left of the public teams list), select one of your teammates and choose "Respawn here".  
---
If you're not on a team, just pick any random public team from the list to join, then switch to the tab just to the left of it and pick a teammate to respawn at.
---
I discovered this because when you're hit by this bug, no other controls are responsive, not even the map. It took a bit of button mashing to realize that the teams UI still works and still lets you respawn.
---
Especially doing some of the pre-wastelanders quests.
---
In terms of gameplay, yeah, it's a horrible loss. This game is more or less a time waster though. For somebody who really has a ton of time to waste, this would arguably be a good thing. More things to grind for before running dry, in case doing all of that grind on one character just wasn't enough for you
---
Thank you so much, you sir are a true hero of Appalachia
---
Yeah, I have both, I prefer the wrapped cap cause it hides hair and not making you bald
---
I see I've offended you past a unreasonable point. I'm sorry pointing that you'd have more luck not mentioning your subscribed to 1st when suggesting things for this game upset you so much. You'd be a emotional reck studying business or working any job related to sales.
---
you should be able to transfer it with a usb stick.
---
I’ve heard there’s no way to get a psychotats recipe, But I have heard however you can get a bunch of psychotats by doing treasure maps.
---
I'm going to grab them next time they come out
---
That is a good idea. I’ll check my stash to see if some vampire gun is in there.
---
Do you know where this works? I tried Tanagra and was only able to get two groups of scorched to spawn.
---
I'm actually an army vet, an engineer and own my own business so 🤷‍♂️ but LMAO 🤣🤣🤣 bye.
---
Still dreaming of the moment I can ride a Giddyup Buttercup across the wasteland...
---
speed demon already caps your speed at max. the legendary pool isn't limited to only those effects, it's just that people aren't creative and jump straight to the obvious ones.
---
a mixed set of creature-specific armor is usually better than vanguard's, for example. and bolstering is just bad.
---
You do a lot of assuming for someone who's just talking out of their bum
---
Are you on PC? I got the helmet literally first event I ran and I've been looking to give it away to someone who really wants it.
---
Put it on and look...
---
This has been a problem since fallout 4, they're never going to fix it
---
I know but is there really a blue and yellow one? I got a red from a trade
---
Fixer, legendary if possible. Silenced combat rifle or lever action. I like my Fixer in .38, Lever Action in .45, and Hunting Rifle in .50. Currently running a bloodied build. Consider Commando (automatic rifle) vs Rifleman. Bandolier is useful. Perception/Luck/Strength/Agility are good places for points. Plenty of great melee weapons. I tried Stealth Rifleman/Melee and ended up Stealth Bloodied Commando/Unarmed.
---
The Raven mask and Nuka Girl rocketsuit.
---
Not for long...
---
I would also like to use my cowboy duster and hat with the new white skull raider gas mask, think that would be pretty cool.
---
Don’t think they really care about the lore tbh, they’ll just bend it to suit them.
---
I’m on PS4 so unfortunately this work around doesn’t work for me as all buttons go unresponsive and the only way I’ve found out is to close and reopen the app. But thank you for you help.
---
And the mining suit. Only five existed before the war because it idea failed.
---
did they fix it in the latest PTS update?
---
can't install it.
---
I like how I could just spam it so I can just see what I got
---
As far as I'm aware, yes.
---
That's Distant Thunder. Artillery doesn't fire on scorched on Defiance's doorstep. 
---
Distant thunder is where you "tag" enemies with the recon scope. This is about "Line in the Sand" which is a scorched siege of Fort Defiance.
---
Stock up on ballistic bock, psychotats, &amp; small gun bobbleheads. Learn how to efficiently get lead, steel, &amp; acid. Pop an adrenal reaction &amp; eagle eye serum. Hope this nudges you in the right direction
---
Was anyone using a Tesla?
---
Giddyup Buttercup motor-bike mount. They already have giddyup power armor i think...so why not?
---
They change the colour it’s red now
---
in this game it juat means quit world and join another
---
But it’s still rare right?
---
Yes it's still rare
---
A good tip would be to take extra things like leather and other materials that are weighing your stash down, you have no use for and has no value and bulk them.
---
When you bulk them you gain a lot of value and you sell it at the store even after the caps are all gone by buying bulk of steel and lead you need and trading your other bulk materials you don't need. If you do this you will be rolling in bullets.
---
You're not a army vet, a engineer and expecially not a business owner. Don't lie to me just because you have no idea how subscriptions work on the business end. Don't pretend to be a vet ethier, a lot of good people die fighting for our countries. You shouldn't shit on their graves because you don't understand recurrent business models.
---
Honestly I can't begin to understand how you got so upset over this. Plus I'm not assuming anything. The half have the community lead changes (e.g. reducing the amount of concrete needed for project atlas) happened after a lot of people canceled 1st. Plus I've never seen a internet, phone contact or any type of subscription care what anyone thinks unless they aren't paying or threaten to cancel.
---
For a second I thought I got lowballed
---
I think my group is sitting on about 50k acid by now, we almost never use it
---
Well as far as we know not every vault had a C.A.M.P device either. They might have though America’s best and brightest could manage with the basics and giving them terraforming G.E.C.K wouldn’t be necessary for the experiment put forward for Vault 76 residents.
---
Ah okay, well that's the PC workaround anyway. I didn't realize the bug affected the platforms differently.
---
Thank you very very much!
---
This was likely the issue, even in a PS4 Pro with the game running on an SSD, someone using a Tesla brings the whole game to a crawl, easily single digit frames. Looking straight down at the floor seems to grant a momentary reprieve from the lag.
---
If I'm not mistaken speed demon is a +20 increase wheras a full set of sprinters would result in a 50% increase.
---
I'm also aware that the damage reduction effects are superior to vanguard/bolstering but unyielding is still universally more useful than anything else.
---
It’s cool, you were just trying to help. Unfortunately you can’t really open the team list without the map button on console lol
---
If it was added the frame rate would probably tank to all shit. I sometimes just walk places instead of running just so I can see what I’m doing lol.
---
Id better give a man fishing pole and teach him how to fish
---
Does not matter if you're speed would be put up to +50% you cap out at +20%. You can not move faster than that. For example, using squad maneuvers with speed demon on won't do anything
---
I think someone not in our team was using a Tesla.
---
Yeah it good for that, i usually pick flowers on my low lvl alts around flatwoods and make some healing salve
---
Thanks. I’ll try that if it happens again.
---
They didn't
---
Oddly enough it actually works off of rifleman
---
extra tip: the power user does not stack with the repair bobblehead or the magazines (less fusion core cost magazine and less ammo consumption magazine ). 100% extra is the max (probably since the display for the core charge is 3 digit so max = 999)
---
That is if you give it a stock to make it a rifle
---
This is the best tip ive gotten on this sub thanks totally swapping with my stabilizing perk
---
And tadpole badges...
---
Source?
---
LOL look at a random on the internet trying to accuse me of stolen valor, I was an e-4 94E communications and security systems technician which means that I repaired radios night vision comsec equipment and power supplies. I served at Fort Riley in Kansas  under the first support maintenance company, 541st combat sustainment support battalion, 1st sustainment brigade and I was a part of the big red one. You can suck a fat one, if you still don't believe me I can make your DM's explode with 20,000 pictures of all the shit that I did while I was in. Please go to bed child, I don't argue with children. My DD-214 says it all and you probably don't even know what I'm talking about.
---
there's a cap to speed bonuses and the bonus from speed demon alone is enough to put you at that cap.
---
I also disagree that unyielding is 'universal'. it's a very good effect, yes. but generally speaking it only makes you better at you already excel at. plus it's only useful for bloodied builds.
---
a full chameleon set is sneakier. life saving is great for triggering revenant. and creature-specific pieces for full health builds.
---
I want a core recharge station for low cores at my camp

with a negative multiplier a negative effect would turn in an positive effect... -30% \* 3 = +90%...
---
Very nice, now I wont burn through them all as quick in ACP.
---
It's not a glitched item, its a black helmet/mask that kinda makes you look like an alien/spiderman.Pretty neat though.
---
I’ve only seen one that I can recall in Flatwoods but I’ve seen probably a dozen or more near the mire/west tek area. They seem to like to fight though, never seen one disappear. I see the Mothman disappear a lot though.
---
PTS forums and AngryTurtle who bought up the topic in one of his videos.
---
Also my GI bill just paid for my associate's degree in engineering technology and I'm using my additional 2 years that you get for stem benefits under the GI bill to go to school for 6 years instead of the typical 4 so I can get my bachelor's (because an engineering degree takes longer than a business degree and involves a lot more complicated math) and seeing as though there's a plague right now and I get paid to go to school, I don't even have to work which means I have a lot of time to conduct buy and sell on eBay which is the small business that I own and operate 🙃
---
Thanks for letting me know it's definitely good they have a hard cap on speed buffs
---
They only seem to drop ammo for any gun about that often. Unless you saying it only gives you fuel ammo 30% and random ammo when it does drop.
---
I’ve run in 8 times, 2 times we had a Tesla user no problem, one time we had someone spamming it.
---
Long sorry short it’s well known that Tesla’s have the potential to destroy the event
---
it depends on how many player would anticipate and how many player would play an active part
---
Yes, the boss can melt you in seconds, but since dying in events doesnt cost you your scrap it is just dying and respawn. Holding one or all pylons would be hard if you try to stim yourself but would be easy if you equip your Vampire Weapon
---
Have you actually played the pts?
---
That bundle has a 0.15% drop chance from any event in the Savage Divide (Uranium Fever, Guided Meditation, Messenger, etc.)
---
Yet another “waah, this game would be easier if A,B or C happened”. 
---
Fallout 76 is a GAME, a CHALLENGE. Remembering to check your cores in part of that challenge, and the tension caused by being spanked by a scorchbeast as your character endlessly reloads and you kick yourself for being lazy is essential to the game. Otherwise it’s just a graphics demo.
---
Briefly.
---
You can grind the raiders in at most a few hours still but yeah the settlers take awhile.
---
You do understand that there are actually like intelligent people on Reddit who can make you look like the clown that you are right?
---
Yeah, need more fatman or dragon skins, why improve the game, let the players suffer. I literally logged yesterday on alt, not being able to do a story mission, due to carry weight, overloaded with legendaries. Fucking mobile game daily limits need to go, let me play the freaking game how much i want
---
Lol what system were you on? I did melt a queen with a bugged weapon, then launched a nuke on the monagah mine, and then launched another nuke on the Queen again.
---
You ever see the 80s Transformers movie? If not, there's an exosuit that a human wears and it transforms into a little car.
---
I would mod the shit out of power armour to do that.
---
Have you tested them on a boss?  Because I have and they didn't work.
---
Thanks!
---
&gt;you might have to suck dick for copper
---
made my day, thx
---
No worries at all. Couldn't pass up Encryptid. Felt a bit bad because it popped right as you showed up. Figured you left the server because of a camp or something. I'm sure we'll meet up again sometime for an event or two.
---
My own testing in the pts.
---
If there more then one there its a not to miss event. I think it takes two camps to make the spawning glitch happen. Everyone is trying to tag everything so it becomes overkill of explosives and aoe weapons.
---
People are doing this deliberately now, because if you kill the queen quickly enough you can get into an instance of ACP straight after.
---
Two bosses with one nuke. It's all about nuke efficiency now.
---
bloodied or junkie's. sneak or PA. nerf incoming, meta will stay relatively unchanged.
---
and if you also knew how to even use Reddit you could have checked my profile and looked at my previous posts and seen that this isn't something I just made up 🙃 cuz I jumped into the FAFSA subreddit a few years back when I was having issues getting a Pell Grant because they said I made too much money in the army 🤘please excuse yourself before you act like you know anything about someone you wanna run your mouth about on Reddit, but yeah you're right I have friends who died for your right to be able to talk 💩 to whoever the hell you want.
---
They don't always trigger , something about high latency for it to trigger . I haven't tested personally  in the pts but pretty sure Beth would have mentioned a fix like this 
---

---
This addresses that along with other issues. The fact that it is still being talked about and no one mentioned it didn't work means it is still there. The person is also a player in the pts
---
At this point, I just drop the low charge ones... it's not worth the effort of having to reload constantly during a boss fight.
---
No no no this doesn't make sense!
---
energy gatlings already have an issue with reloading randomly. I regularly carry between 75- 100 fusion cores, if it prioritised nearly empty cores I would only be able to shoot for a few seconds before spending ten seconds reloading and spinning up again.
---
Bloodied builds are still fun, which mostly use mostly bloodied explosive legendarys (which are the most expensive weapons right now). Basically, youre a glass canon. You Do outragous damage but you yourself are at such low health you can get 1 shotted easely. 
---
Also, the new gauss weapons are pretty good, so just use them.
---
They really screwed this game up when they did blanket nerfs to all things that could have TSE.
---
Not to be pedantic, but attributes like barrel length and rifling can make ammunition behave differently.  
---
A good example would be the .50 round between a rifle and a machine gun.
---
Granted it's still a big ol bullet so that difference is really just range/total energy on target.
---
Hmm.  I wonder if turning vsync off caused it to stop working.  More testing is required.
---
raider skinner outfit. it was on sale 2 weeks ago
---
No you can craft Surten legendary weapons and armor with the legendary kits the purveyor sells
---
That's not necessarily a reliable source. Not saying you're wrong, but it's anecdotal at best.
---
I need to hear it from more people first.
---
Thanks for the explanations everyone. They helped me find this video of someone firing an AK without the dust cover.
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=sGeQvKi6SVQ
---
I don’t feel as odd about my handmade anymore :)
---
Junkies Explosive SMG with Scorchkiller's Receiver
---
So i decided to make a gunslinger VATS char. and figured i would give this gauss pistol a go.
---
Does anyone know if there is an update on this? I couldn't believe my luck when i rolled instigating on my first craft, but it's kind of a "meh" feeling when it can't be used in vats.
---
"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe..."
---
This is a lot. Just go on the wiki
---
Since scammers are looked upon by Bethesda as 'people roleplaying as raiders', I don't see this happening any time soon.  
---
The current trade system is BGS all the way. It just works and that is about it. So basically a perfect system in their eyes
---
Lmao more like glass tank
---
I'd rather them finish / flesh out the one we have.
---
I have all 5 slots filled, and each character has specific rare plans learned. I could never delete one to start a new character.
---
only with PA
---
I buckled down and speedran the quests on all my toons. Worth it. I can play whatever I want and not feel like I'm wasting progress
---
Yeah
---
Incidentally why did Bethesda remove the survival mode? I missed that memo.
---
I think that workshops are a missed opportunity overall, PvP aside. It'd be great if they had a co-op function. In the early days I went through a spate of creating what I called "public workshops" whereby players could stop by and take what ever resources they wanted and would advertise to that effect in the hope that it might deter players from contesting it.  But you make a fair point that I hadn't concidered in my assertion that some people might build them up to make them a more attractive target. 
---
From my perspective it is a frustration, I like building and workshops present a great opportunity to experiment and create in a way that's more convenient than uprooting your camp every 5 minutes, though I do accept the terms and conditions and only claim workshops to complete daily/weekly challenges now. If they're taken, they're taken, no big deal. At the end of the day the mechanic is in place whether I like it or not. Bethesda could remove it but they won't and so I don't see the logic in chastising or trash talking players for initiating PvP. Nonetheless it would be nice to utilise workshops for something other than PvP and not have to pay £11 per month for the privilege.
---
Not saying it is fixed, just saying it's my experience.  Although I recently changed something that might cause magic to happen, so I kay have accidentally shut off my magic.
---
It's still pretty easy to die as bloodied against earle or burning/poison.
---
It's amazing, that people STILL don't put what system they're on.
---
But I see your previous posts are for PC so there's no chance I could give you a travelling coat when I am on Xbox.
---
They finally responded saying they will investigate missing ammo types:
---
- 40mm
---
- Missiles
---
- Mini Nukes
---
- Alien Blaster Rounds
---
- Syringes 
---
- Paddle Ball String
---
Also, apparently some receivers aren't set up to give the appropriate ammo type keyword - meaning they won't give the correct contextual ammo.
---
If there is a lack of ammo keywords, ie melee, there will no ammo drop. This is corrected in PTS for Daily Ops (confirm), where it will be random ammo
---
Oh yeah sorry. Am not too used to reddit. on FB the group is entierly PC... so I forgot it here. Will try to learn tho \^\^
---
Vets don't react the way you do ;) 
---
But where to start here,
---
I know what a honourable discarge is
---
Your assuming my age range and time zone, kinda weird considering your past massages. But you got both wrong. I don't even live in the US for start.
---
A e bay business? I honestly could be mean, but I'll fair, I'll give you that considering these times eBay businesses are of what is keeping the world going. Still nothing to do with recurrent business model.
---
People protend to be anything on Reddit, your Reddit history could be one of many who life fake online lives. Honestly everyone knows that.

Nothing I said implies anything but that I have experience dealing with subscription models. But hey look at how you reacted to one simple harmless suggestion online. Literally your whole issue is a suggestion, you've been hostile the whole time sololy because of that. 
---
Now I only said not to get your hopes up for MMO features and there no business logic for any business to take your suggestions if you let them know you already pay more than the base price, something which people who do are very happy with what they got. You can disagree with me, your welcome too. But you have problems, I hope you get help.

I'm going to leave you be because I honestly don't know if you have mental health issues and I don't want to make them worse if you do.

Power armor doesn't help against poison or fire?

No, no defense at all.  Poison/fire absolutely melts you.

Other weapons, like NW Laser rifle, will display 999/0 but can be infinitely higher

Theyve already introduced outfits that are a couple centuries away from being made. Maxons Battlecoat was a custom job in FO4. Theres entries on a terminal about it in that game.
---
Ya hints bloodied will be a tank hopefully they will eventually make it a glass Canon so other builds can shine in the light
---
You want me to bust more photos or you gonna keep accusing me of stolen valor and wondering why I suddenly got irritated with you? I started with sarcasm and dismissal until you wanted to call me a list even though I'm a stranger to you.
---
I’d pay max scrip for choosing legendary effects on guns
---
EXPLOSIVES
---
I love vampire low health.  Essentially just take bloodied but replace the bloodied one for a vampire.  Obviously you do less damage, but it's so hard to die.

I'll kill him for you Nova. You need a promotion

Yep yep I love my Vampires limb reload galling lazer

The game can't load in fast enough at default speed anyways. So no, don't want to fall through the ground mesh.

Probably or partially because it's magic, but yeah, gotta love tanking through the embers in ACP or the ISS face beam.

I mean, I know, but is there any sort of pa skin that at least kinda looks like that?  Gray, green, brown even?

Dude just stop. There is no way I would know if that is you or not. You know that. Also you shouldn't be so eager to show your personal information online because you disagree with someone.

I'm not accepting your chat invite. Seems like you just going to show me loads of info which could be used to steal your identity anyway.

If you are a vet, your the only vet that acts this way. But it's more likely your dad or something is as your acting like a child.

Take care, good luck with your endeavours 🙂

If you're getting one shotted easily as a bloody build you flat out suck at picking perks.

Gotta get my hands on one of these nodding weapons.

Idk, i dont use bloodied, i just see everyone using it and the concept behind it
---
Link to picture or something?   I can't find it.
---
Or even better... Make it so we can’t drop skinned weapons and armor at all. Click the drop button and it says “Can’t drop this weapon, it has an atomic shop skin.”
---
Related question: How do you make such a big home? Do second (or third) stories take up a ton of budget? I tried to make a home with a central garden but could only get a 2x3 space before the budget topped out.
---
My man!
---
Run borderless and launch from .exe, you don't need multiple machines
---
That's what I've heard.
---
Are you sure that's a bug? When you reload, it switches to the fullest available fusion core. So if you keep reloading, you'll be chipping away at all of your fusion cores, instead of one at a time. That's why I don't reload until my clip is completely empty. Am I missing something?
---
I think we shouldn’t be able to drop weapons with atomic shop skins at all. The fact that we even have an option to drop them and make them disappear forever is downright idiotic.
---
The nameplate doesn't mean anything, fyi
---
I think its model was changed in error during one of the previous patches, possibly even Wastelanders itself. Its not supposed to be red.  The object itself is pretty rare but its appearance I think is the same as the standard baseball cap. Put in a ticket to bring it to Beths attention again but whether they will ever do anything about it isnt something you should hold your breath waiting for an answer for
---
How so? Raiders rep taking a few hours I mean?

They can't figure it out lol

They had promised mailbox system and put mailboxes in the files a year ago. They abandoned it and haven't said a word

Those things with a flechette harpoon gun... It's amazing
---
A lot of people are using the 'magic' weapons. I'm not exactly sure what they are, even though I watched an angry turtle video about them, I still don't 100%get it
---
So what?
---
I actually like it that they use "real world" builds to test, IF they test anything, rather than just make up an ideal char.
---
Feel like a Scorchbeast heart should be as big as my torso...
---
Yes 
---
The TS and the imnate explosion both double the hit marker rate.
---
Essentially you have Firerate X2 X2 = hit marker rate
---
If this is over 200, you're in business
---
Exactly it's like you're spawned in, but you can't move or get control over your character as if the camera was not "in" your character.
---
Worst thing is sometimes if I respawn and lose the precious unyielding buff I will simply not be able to respawn at all, being stuck with the overencumbered message, with a character I have no control on.
---
And it seems this bug is player dependant, my girlfriend never had this issue once in the past months, I don't think re installing the game will solve anything, I'm at loss for what to do.
---
Yeah i always get a bit sketchy because i make things in bulk then look through what i made, wouldnt want to get the perfect roll on something then make 20 shit copies after that wasting my modules
---
Congrats!  I'm still chugging along the main quest too. 😂
---
Weapons are dynamically named based on their attached mods
---
I've been doing it the other way, I found higher level chars tend to do acp first with lower levels going for the queen. I usually kill earle and get the reward with a good 15-20mins left usually, plenty of time to melt her. Though recently with how many people are screwing up her flight pattern camping on the roof I've found it quicker dumping that nuke right over it forcing people to fight in the open
---
that give me a lot of fps
---
That's neat

Barbarian is a dogshit perk. Get rid of it. It's a noon honeypot

You're just a clown on the internet who thinks that his word is law when it comes to other people's lives and that you get to insult somebody and not expect them to get irritated in retaliation and prove that you're just a dick head. I'll video chat you right now if you want me to, and I got a lot more pictures that can prove all kinds of stuff and the only thing that diploma shows is my name and what college I went to lol someone's going to need a lot more information than that to steal my identity.

I don't think you understand how personal someone's military service is to their identity, and how insulting it is to have some random cuck behind a keyboard tell you that you didn't serve.
---
Did you drop the nuke?
---
- yes: get a magic gun too to secure your loot
---
- no: you can be quiet

Roxys glitch was never removed. Basically you can continuously turn in the retirement quest half way. Get the bonus for telling roxy what she would like to hear then back out before getting the actual rewards. Kill the raider come back and initiate contact with her. Chose the second option that says Appalachia has a new corpse. Back out when she says her first word nice...... Keep doing it and your bar will slowly go up. I did it last week with an alt. I did have to do it over three days because the server shuttered for a second snd didnt let me back out so had to wait two days for the quest to be available again. You get into a rhythm where you can turn it in every five seconds and then you continuously repeat.
---
Its annoying but you would had to turn it in the same amount except over a few months. It will take a few hours of actually talking to her though but you can split it up over a few play periods just by walking away after exiting out of the conversation early and come back later. If you miss up on the button presses though you cant do it until the quest vomes around again.
---
I did it for my alt last week, and used it a little for my main when it came out.
---
Well, the X01 power armor does have a military camo paint. I know you mentioned excavator, but it might be worth changing power armor if you want to have a set that fits the military theme. You get the plans to make the X01 power armor by continuing the main storyline and completing the enclave quests.
---
Cool, make sure you tell Bethesda to convert them to not being events then.  You're thinking of quests.
---
I had a full sprinter set in f4. Hell of fun. But after the first week's in 76 I noticed the cap is at 20% bonus doesn't matter what you use in combination or not. (skills, speed demon, move speed while aiming). But if they remove the cap and add those armor, I would definitely use it lol
---
Found one for 5caps in a vendor - traded it for stuff worth 50k so atleast it was rare, after the dupe im not so sure
---
There are "woodland camo" ones that pop up sometimes.
---
Interesting 🤔🤔 I never saw that in the data mines

Nope. Go play on your private server if you can't compete

There's a bug where the gatling laser starts to reload as you're firing it before the clip is actually empty (I've seen this happen with up to a few hundred rounds left). The only way to avoid racking up partial cores is to holster your weapon or switch weapons to cancel the reload animation. Really annoying when it happens in the middle of SBQ or Earle fight.
---
I've only personally experienced this with the gatling laser but others have reported the gatling plasma having the same issue as well.
---
Also how are you going to try and flip this on me because you're the one who wouldn't accept that I just said bye and initially sarcastically dismissed you, I literally ignored your comment until you insulted me by accusing me of stolen valor which is the most disrespectful thing you can say to a veteran. You drove the conversation to where this ended up.
---
Most annoying glitch in this game tbh what’s the etiquette anyway cause atm It’s all about starting the ol Gatling plasma just in time to ninja all the  XP xx
---
Does this jeff guy work at bethesda or is he just some youtuber?
---
Omfg I'd actually love that, if we could get all kinds of crazy cool mailboxes for our camp I'd buy buckets of atoms lol

I can sell you military camo paint for X-01 armor for 2776c if your on ps4.
---
That is so cool!
---
Ah, I see. Thanks!
---
He's the Bethesda Game Studios Project Lead for Fallout 76...so like the top dude working on the game
---
It does, yeah.
---
It's 'better' than on release day.
---
But there are some issues still.
---
Fire it up, give yourself until level 30 to see if the things that annoyed you still exist. It might surprise you, or disappoint  you still.
---
They defineitely need to make plans/ reputation and stash account wide.
---
So is the black one just gone now?
---
I also have an Ultracite Gatling, what is the difference between the Ultracite one and regular?
---
Now that I see your pools, I think I have been noticing this too.
---
No, absolutely not. This may seem like a good idea when you've only got a few cores but I have 200 on my paladin guy and 300 on a mule, and would like the fullest each time I reload. That's why I use heavy weapons - so I don't have to reload every 3 seconds and can keep the fire up. Not use 7 shots in some old cores I should've dropped then reload again. Like others have already said, there needs to be a way to recycle or consolidate cores. Or a menu option to choose lowest or highest charge cores to use.
---
Yeah the cards are random so he must be unlucky.
---
If you put a mat on the root of the tree, the tree will disappear.
---
I have loved this game since release, the game is certainly a lot better than it was on release since the wastelanders update, thats for sure. The only thing is that you have to actively want to do things, there aren't a ton of straight forward questlines so if you want side quests, you have to actually go look for them. And there's plenty to do on a daily basis as well, with daily challenges, events and missions.
---
Lol this is uneccesary difficulty literally your mad cause youve had to do it.
---
Magic weapons made shotguns relevant again. Mine is pretty good, but it does nothing compared to magic handmades
---
Bought one for literally 35 caps out of someone's vending machine after seeing this post.  Oo
---
I would rather watch paint dry
---
Yes! Also some 50's style hats for women!
---
It's all rng. There's no way to just get one
---
Your best bet is to buy one from another player either threw vending machines or the market sub
---
Magic? I've never heard of them, what are they?
---
Only on some smaller trees, there are plenty you can't get rid of
---
Wait until you have spent 10000 scrip and still have nothing.😂
---
I started when it hit sub £15 on steam, didn't think the game was worth any more (played a free weekend before).  Got right into it now with 300+ hours in under a few months.
---
I figured lol that was my next stop... I figured I'd ask just in case someone knew something I didn't 🤔
---
yes, as I have 5 playable characters, I started a notebook a few weeks ago and it is very handy.
---
* serum plans per character
---
* smiley visit per character per week
---
* To do's (like 'get a serum plan for each color of flux') per character
---
* To do's per week (like 'character 2 needs to be played with to have 6K caps by next smiley refill').
---
* all the rare plans I still need to get per character
---
* some looting locations for specific stuff (like thistle)
---
I was hoping to avoid that 😆
---
I'm am referring to when you first draw the weapon it some times reloads before firing. It had a core but when deployed it thinks theres nothing in there and pops a new core in.
---
Not even in game, just the middle of the real world living room
---
Also explosive radiums and gauss are legacy so will cost a pretty penny, well will be trade only.
---
Some legendary effects are bugged, and do amazing damage. 33+ vats with shotgun means that all the little shots that usually miss the target hit all in the same spot, doing a lot of damage (oneshotting lvl 60 supermutants up close for example)
---
Instead there are other magic weapons that only work if the rate of fire is more than 200. Those magic weapons are hated by the community because they melt earle and the sbq, giving no rewards to other players
---
Please read our wiki page on this subject

There was a bug a month or two back but that's been fixed. Havnt heard of a new one
---
since you can't even decide to try the game, avoid.
---
You will not be able to manage inventory. Trying go decide what to use, keep, scrip, sell, etc. will give you a nervous breakdown.
---
Pacman is for you
---
Honestly I would be happy with global plan learning. Like I want the gauss minigun on another character but like hell im gonna grind that stupid shit again. Let one character learn it and be a global account thing.

I guess I'll hit up the lfg on xbox and see if anyone is will to part with one.... fingers crossed 🤞
---
If you're on PC you can get a mod that will make any resource you want glow in any colour you want. Any item that gives you that resource when scrapping will glow. It's on nexus mods.

I read that this was an advertised feature for Fallout First that has yet to appear, and had since been removed from their promotional materials.
---
It's a shame, because it could be a major selling point for membership.
---
Shhhhh
---
No! Do not go there. Very much full of scammers. Go to the trading sub. It's much safer over there
---
YES - please !!!
---
Where can I find that ???
---
I pmed you. We are not allowed to link it here. Some conflict between the Devs or something. I've been trading over there for 2+ years and have never ran in to any issue
---
This plan is obtainable only from completing one of the quests. Don't want to spoiler what exactly
---
The enclave vendor does I feel. But you also get one for free from the miner miracles quest line. Where you craft a set of excavator pa
---
Is there a tactic to not die by laser every 2 seconds here? I swear it’s lag 🤷‍♂️
---
Thanks again man.... I play on xbox so if you ever wanna link up and play I'm down
---
GT:: OMUROV:: XBOX ONE
---
Apparently, you do. Did not know that then.
---
&gt; willing to settle for handmade
---
Isn't a handmade the better rifle?
---
Not sure, everyone I've come across had a combat rifle or a radium rife tbh
---
I’m on miner miracles it’s just that I have to level up to level 25 to build the armor
---
\*cue bone,blood,crunching sounds coming from inside of PA\*
---
But if a handmade is better then I'll go for that 🤔
---
Call the High Priest of Mothman cult to cleanse your camp.
---
which is funny because the first star trek movie is fucking terrible
---
Handmades are better. Higher base damage and less recoil. The fixer is slightly better than the handmade for damage but is harder to keep on target
---
Handmade for iron sights 
---
Fixer for vats
---
Combat will be cheapest though
---
I was feeling the same some time ago but then I realized I was sporting the "Grounded" mutation, the one that gives you energy resistance but also lowers damage. After ditching it I don't feel energy weapons are bad at all. Laser gatling with ultracite cores melts enemies in 1 second. And the plasma gatling (two-shot) is awesome for close ranges. It's also quite easy to get ammo for them. It mostly depends on the weapon characteristics, maybe you have a very good conventional weapon and it's just better than your energy ones?
---
Power up mount blair, do breach and clear and lode baring and you'll have tons of ores/scrap
---
I'm always up for new suggestions... It will most likely make me a better player 😆
---
Pretty sure we already got the cap. I feel like we are getting the outfit and collection from phase beta
---
Nope, it was my nuke. Thanks for replying.
---
Sorry for your loss and to the family and friends my deepest condolences, RIP Fallout 76 brother.
---
Wait you can craft legendary?
---
Oh, so this is the norm. I was just curious since it was a lot more often and consistent in the PTS vids I saw.
---
i highly recommend that you watch these:

Cheating you say? In a PvP game? 😯 say it isn't so?!?!? 😀
---
This is 50% of the reason I gave up PvP games years ago. The other 50% being that PvP seems to attract some of the most toxic players.
---
The probably had the Fixxer, which shares the same skin as a combat rifle, but has the added ability of adding speed while you sneak.   But the damage is marginally better with the Handmade.
---
I never use power armour. Drives me nuts. That is my personal play style. I got lucky and got the armour at lvl 20 so I started then. I like to be sneaky.
---
It's at v76 because Grahm wants everyone to be able to join
---
Yup they were sold at grafton station up until patch 5, then they removed them from his inventory pool, at which point the only place to get them was random armor plan spawns within the world. 
---
At one point on the trading sub they were worth a ridiculous amount for a full set as their wasnt legendary scout armor available or secret service armor, so at the time it held the highest resistances of all armor. 
---
Then around patch 13 I think it was they re placed them in the grafton station loot pool literally just as I had finished my months of server hopping at the Top of The World and Grafton Steel to collect the final plan I needed!
---
Fuck
---
Thank you, this helps out a lot
---
I think this a good idea. Hopefully weapons and armor as well to try see how players actually playing.
---
I'd love more stash space.
---
Sadly so many players own Fallout 1st that it won't happen ☹️
---
I only bought the game from a week or two ago, so way past wastelanders.
---
Sounds like its worth getting both??!?
---
Come on, it's a feature, not a bug. Batteries aren't perfect, you don't really know the exact charge remaining, and those chinese plasma cores from alibaba are not as good as the ones made by apple. Always buy originals!
---
I could see an argument about having dedicated servers, as long as those of us with no interest in being cannon fodder for some jerk with a psychopathic need to humiliate others can opt for a "no-PvP" server, ideally without even the limited version in Workshops.
---
That depends mostly on the level your character is, a lvl 50 can build a bigger camp than a lvl 10, but i'm not exactly sure what the cut off point is.  
---
there are some things that take up WAY more budget than others, turrets are a prime example of this, lights as wel, but if you're just using structural pieces then a second floor does not take any more budget, just depends on how many total items build up the structure.  
---
In this case the large open garden is essentially free since i'm not building there, i'm building around it.
---
Yah. I might try one of the supposed workarounds but I don't know if they actually work.
---
Can we have fully functioning companions (Weasel inudrd) in this Fallout game?
---
Aww bby don't delete your posts, it's okay that your a clown.
---
It could have been done a lot better, also it cost them too much and then they decided to try to force everyone into NW for pvp.  What they seem to have ended up doing is pleasing nobody.  I can understand your frustration and I do wish there was somewhere for builders to experiment.  Not sure how they would prevent griefing if ws were made pve only.  Someone would hog all of them.
---
If you played at all while it was active you would still have got it. Check your atom shop under apparel
---
With enough RAM, run 4 low-res windowed instances on one PC. I managed 7 before my PC gave up. Been dual instancing since the start, was essential for inventory management before 1st. With public teams it's not really necessary for me now though except to shift stuff to mules.
---
Moth man base time
---
Whats a magic Handmade ? 🤔
---
Well, they're good for startling Anglers and Floaters out of their comfy little hiding places...
---
A handmade with some legendary effects that does a lot of damage and melts endgame bosses
---
They probably have to go through 5 or 6 mule characters before they get a real one
---
I haven't even been able to bring myself to do it on my second character, level 150 or so.  Not only the tedium of the grind, but also the fact that extra levels on my main (302) mean more perk cards to apply to legendary perks.
---
It will not work with the beta wave lasers either
---
best is wait for legendary perks with +5special. So i take all these perks and can do any build only with changing perks.
---
Bethesda: STOP HAVING FUN. HAVE FUN OUR WAY OR THE HIGHWAY
---
I'm so sorry.
---
Not sure if she's about to sneeze, fall asleep, or sneer at someone...

Pretty sure the "magic" effect does not work on Handmades...

All gold bullion plans should be shared between characters.
---
Rumour is that it was “unfixed” in a recent patch. Haven’t heard anyone lose anything so far though except with extremely over budget camps

---
Gold bullion weapons
---
That’s the quest you get it from upon completion
---
But which fruit should I go for first? I’ll see if they have a subreddit
---
dude , with right build it's easily more than 100k xp . and i'm not even mentioning lunchboxes and double xp weekends
---
A simpler explanation is that Bethesda just makes it up as they go along for the purposes of releasing another franchise entry whilst chuckling at endless community arguments over retcons and lore breaks.
---
Bruh that is nothing I carry over 200 plasma, 150 fusion and 50 ultracite cores at all times I prefer having 500/999 ammo at arms length at all times and it does dmg without stopping I have like 40-50 of each core close to dead or half way and then im stuck sometimes reloading a 300 mag or 149 or 600 or 850 its stupid
---
Indeed. Not only is the terminal huge but it does next to nothing!
---
I’ll be on in an hour I can invite you to my private server if you need help still
---
Yup happened to me yesterday. Didnt know about the player cooldown and even put in the keycard so it was lost
---
Idk why people are downvoting you when you're right...
---
Watch out bro the truth gets you downvoted by Bethesda sycophants! You can only say nice things about God Howard here....
---
Because it’s another live service game Rated ‘M’ for Mature but made for kids, hence events like joining the scouts, trick or treating etc, because pester power = $.
---
I don’t deny it was needed, but surely you cut 50% then tweak from there. Slashing a whopping 80%, then feigning deafness at community uproar, was entirely the wrong way to go about it.
---
Yes, I’m aware.
---
I heard one kid demand that someone give them stuff or they'd nuke the camp.   Beginning to wonder if they've missed important lessons in life....and perhaps they need to be taught them in a game if nowhere else.
---
They should make a partial account wide stash. Don't even need that much, just give us like 200 so we can have a perfect round number, 1000 stash size (800 character + 200 account wide) and I think it would be a perfectly fine sweet spot
---
Psa to all players. Don't trade threw the lfg page, or with randos. Use the market sub or one of the other reputable trade sites
---
Sorry that you got scammed op I really wish they would implement a better trading system
---
I'm sorry, that sucks. As much as I hate to say this unfortunately this post breaks rule number 9 "witch-hunting" and thus will likely be deleted soon.
---
Shame there isn't a way to warn people but I just avoid trading.
---
good idea
---
Sure ! :)

I’m told that this happens when you log off a server whilst somebody is using one of your vendors

LOL!

What he is saying is that he bought a helmet from a player vendor but it does have the text saying it protects. When he crafts the exact same item, the text shows on the crafted item. I also encountered similar when I bought a shielded wetsuit from a player. The text does not show, but the stats are correct. When I craft a wetsuit and make it shielded the protection text shows. So he (and I) are wondering if this is related to buying the marine under armor and head gear from a player vendor
---
There is that. But considering the amount of ammo needed to down Earle, I think I’d rather bounce round the map until I find 100 scrip’s worth of legendaries organically. Or just buy and scrap ones from other players.
---
Happened to me after spending ca. 1k ultrazit 50cal in the event. Alt+F4ed out of the game right after it. Did not barter playing since then
---
Thanks this is what I meant also there was another helmet in the vendor but it did protect so idk what to think
---
I believe the distinction is pre/post Wastelander’s. A marine tactical set that dropped from a mirelurk queen had disease resist, but the one I had crafted prior to Wastelander’s doesn’t.
---
lol, better than my first time... I use the card. A level 14 and a level 24 show up... still have 9 mins and change to wait for others to show up. The level 14 makes a bee line to terminal and starts the event. The two low-levelers then go into a cycle of hide and instakill. A couple of others show up and no one uses the pylons. At one point I'm trying to do multiple pylons, but don't have enough stimpacks to sustain the rate of drain. Wasted my 'free' card, and not gonna spend 2k caps, just to have the same thing happen, again.
---
How about both, they’re a triple A studio I’m sure neither of those things aren’t hard to do
---
Vault 76 was a control vault, apparently, meaning that there was not an experiment going on in the vault. Rather the intent of the vault was for the residents to venture out into Appalachia and start rebuilding America. One of the first things I would give someone going into a post-apocalyptic nuclear hellscape would be a way to terraform things....
---
It doesn't just terraform though the damn thing has a replicator and cold fusion generator for gods sake....Vault-Tec screwed the deathclaw on this one...
---
BE fixer and BE handmade easily command over 50K but you will not find many people that will sell them for caps. Most traders only accept trades for these.
---
That would make sense thanks for clearing it up now the question is it worth anything🤔🤔🤔
---
I thought we could go back in later and still launch from the card?
---
More like "Stop having fun, and buy this $13 costume."
---
Yes I'm trying to do the same one but I play solo as well
---
Been asking for this for ages make getting the modules harder say a 1000 scrip for a guaranteed 3 star weapon of your choice but no control over the rolls 
---
Or they could make it once you got the weapon pay a lot of scrip and reroll the effects one by one still loads of RNG
---
After my second run I decided it wasn't worth using heavies in this fight.  Instead doing no PA sneak with a bloodied handmade or fixer.  Usually leave with more ammo than I came in with and a whole bunch of screws.  With the high agility from unyeilding you can basically walk up and tickle the wendigos without them going agro.
---
The same is true for the queen I suppose, but I still switch to heavies for that because it doesn't waste nearly as much ammo.
---
TSE isn't the "best" any more after it got nerfed a long time ago. I'd probably shoot for EE or IE depending on play style. AAE is good too.
---
I've found all of that at vendors for sale. Once you hit the endgame grind of gold bullion and gauss weapons, you'll just be continuously finding/buying legendary modules so you can roll a new weapon.
---
It's also worth mentioning that you can't roll an explosive gauss weapon, as those rounds have explosive properties by default.
---
True. But When ACP pops up and you don't have time to check, because you want to make sure you get a team of 8, that very thing ends up happening anyway. Unless you carry 100+ I guess
---
And legendary modules, but yes only for certain items that are purchased via gold bullion.
---
the only two non energised weapons i carry are a 10mm and a Western revolver for when i need a emergency gun, my primary guns are a modified laser rife with a automatic fire rate and a side arm of a Enclave plasma gun if i am taking a suit of T51-B or APA MRK-1 i will use a un-modified Winchester P94 plasma caster as is the right of anyone who suffered though the Wastelanders DLC
---
They are? Reddit is weird.
---
Maybe.. but i had to wait 2 hours so i went to another silo 😆. My friend who didnt have a cooldown in alpha went down to launch and had to use another keycard. Im not sure if my keycard would still have worked for me if i d have waited the 2 hours
---
That's not true. Some people choose to avoid those perks in favour of other perks. I don't run dodgy or Serendipity and I don't suck
---
The best update idea I’ve ever heard. Sucks having to carry 35 cores at who knows what charge.
---
At least let us bypass the first part where you have to get an ID. I wouldn't be mad if it reset weekly with the silo codes but it doesn't make any sense having to make an ID card every damn time
---
VE Gatling plasma on a full health junkie heavy PA user makes ACP a walk in the park. Impossible to die
---
First time I saw one, a higher level came to help.  Me?  I ran like hell to get them behind them and then started shooting.   Still grateful to that player.
---
Wait, Morgantown has a set spawn point for the briefcase? Where is it?
---
Silo Alfa bravo Charlie.
---
Yeah lol I carry like 90 I think and I think like 30 would be below 50%
---
Isn't there a cool down
---
On each one. Yes. So 3 seperate cooldowns. 3 nukes
---
Most magic weapon variants don't work in Live ACP either, mostly because of the high client-side lag of the mine.
---
There's a cool down for each individual silo. You can launch all three back to back on one character, swap servers, check the missile silo state holotape, and do it again.
---
Also, itd be great if we could more reliably see if someone is currently running a silo
---
It only shows 999, you can get more with crafted overcharged cores. Better do that with ultracite cores, as they are cheaper to craft in terms of fluxes.
---
Yes, the GB is worth it!   Besides the SS armor, ammo machine, plasma caster and gauss minigun are outstanding and well worth pursuing.
---
I thought it was character cool down
---
I request a point of clarification. 
---
Can I use the bladed commie whacker or do I have to use the factory original?
---
No. That was never addressed. Kind of hard to implement when they likely filled your spot with someone else when you got booted.
---
Looking like a vampire to me.   Any second the fangs are going to come out.
---
Nope. Just a silo cool down. If you've got the nuke cards, you can server hop and launch nukes all day.
---
Each silo has both a server cool down as well as a character cool down
---
Yet another ass hole on reddit who doesn't like someone's QoL suggestion.
---
Cool story. Real original.
---
😀 hmm.. the bladed version is a bit OP, so might not be allowed!
---
Thanks!  Did not know.
---
Sonofa.....
---
Fiiinnnneeee. 
---
Should I assume that I also have to accomplish this solo whilst using my Berserker?
---
I like it!    Hey, I see Mass Effect up there.   Did you see the rumor about September 29?   A shop in the UK.
---
Oh right thanks I wouldn't know because I'm saving to buy t65
---
Lol if I never posted here I’d be on a million karma by now! Stay safe bro!
---
Ahh, that would probably be a ‘weekly’ requirement..
---
Sorry for your loss. I hope you get/got a real good turn out for your friend.
---
This. 3 nukes per 3 hours.
---
Got it. 
---
I might have to sit that one out, coach. 
---
I don't think I can handle watching Wulfgar die that many times in such a short span.
---
Aahhh yes, you're right there, energy weapons for rifleman are very lackluster. I've tried them with my rifleman and they're way worse than auto handmades and fixers. I even had a powerful two shot gauss rifle dealing 400+ per shot and stopped using it because in practice it was never easy to achieve consistent damage. Laser rifles are even worse.
---
And the plasma caster... well it's a nice looking heavy weapon but even a two-shot one can't compare to normal gatlings.
---
Please stop! I can only get so hard!
---
Could you imagine if the 'slots' for prefixes just get dumped? I got insanely lucky once and that's what I use but I think the only thing better would be AA/E/Quad Fixer.
---
Two hours.   Man, that's a long time.   You made the best choice.
---
Thank you so much for this, as a casual player, the idea of having to login daily for months to do the raider rep. quests really put me off.
---
Or even worse you will have to do the DMV quest again! :^(
---
I got one from Murmur.   Out of all the scrip cashed in during 300 levels.
---
 They need to make currencies and reputation account-wide.  A separate account-wide stash for the house would also be useful. In the current state, trying to create a new character is simply pointless. You have to go through the tasks of all the factions, re-farm the reputation and currency for the pioneer camp and ask your friends to transfer things if necessary.  In order to try a new build, it's easier to wait x2 exp and change the build.
---
Fallout 2 has so many retcons that its hard to believe fallout 1 is still canon.
---
You still had to claim it in the Atom shop though
---
They probably play the mule characters because they can't tell the difference.
---
Or 1 spare computer with 3 virtual machines running 76 at minimal specs? Would on parts and electricity, eh?
---
I had a TSE Gauss that was just the bomb at the beginning.   After the nerf, it was pointless.   I sold it for caps relatively cheaply because I thought anything else would be ripping off the buyer.   They *definitely* are not what they were.
---
Upvoted out of pity
---
* way too many non-combat perks. My shotgun character, that wrecks everything, only shares 3 perk cards with this build...
---
* You are focusing on two weapon types. you need to specialize to get better damage. Either focus on the shotgun or the gauntlet
---
I know, right? My alt was almost unplayable (hyperbole - i still played her) until I got it back!
---
So you replaced Serendipity with 4 Leaf and/or Better Criticals?   What are your cards in Luck?
---
Find the regular safe, and scroll to the left or right if you have a safe already, store it, and select it, and scroll on that one to see if you can place the new one.
---
.. I’m debating wether or not to tackle the next season, as free time is tighter than a nuns ... for me.
---
I'm gonna take a whack at it, but I'm not going to worry if I actually complete it or not. Unless the top prize is getting to tell Mama Mole "I want this one" and I actually get to pick a weapon.
---
then search youtube for 'Angry turtle magic shotguns', and make sure you have one. Use all 9 shotgunner perks, skeet shooter and enforcer. Powered armor for the AP (the magic effect only happens in VATS). Then you'll wreck things.  
---
Or get a piece of armor with 15% less damage while blocking, which for some mysterious reason, makes all your shotguns magical.  
---
Get fireproof and/or dense mod for your torso armor if your shotgun is explosive (so you do not blow yourself up).
---
I def agree with tse not being the best.bullets seem to split and fly in separate directions at times and not to mention how often we need to repair tse guns. I'd prefer almost anything but 2shot for explosive but seems ffr seems to be really good to me latley
---
It's in with the default stash box
---
I love helping them when they don't expect/demand it.   Yesterday, I got to give a level 3 upgraded leather armor and a couple upgraded baseball bats; introduced them to the lighthouse event.   It was fun.
---
There's a 45 minute character cool down so if you do all three in that time you have to either switch toons or wait
---
I tried that. Even scrapping my existing safe.
---
I get this but only with my tinkers bench.
---
I was tempted to do this but dont want to risk a ban
---
More evidence for when Bethesda says that they can't restore your character is false.
---
Also by the same token Bethesda knows how broken some builds can be.
---
The skin got bugged a while back. It’s been confirmed that it’s on the eventual fix list.
---
No, this can quickly go out of hand for people who would use stealth commando to kill sbqs and Wendigo colossus very quickly to grief people. Plus, I think it's good for balancing, you dish out the most dps but only on your own.
---
Yeah I’m with you there, and a free choice at the scam artist would be awesome! .. that 3* SS Commie Whacker could finally be mine :)
---
Your edit doesn't make sense XD
---
I did a few just to get standard backpack and bought the chemist mod.
---
That would be tempting. 
---
But I think I'd have to get Wulfgar the shiniest of shinies. 
---
A Berserker 25/25 Handmade.
---
aw SH.... \*sorry\* it hurts always to hear about someone dieing this young :-/
---
Hmmmm. It should be under the "stash"right build section right? I'd check there and scroll left and right on the safes, if that doesn't work, it could be under floor decorations by mistake. Bethesda loves to not place new items where they need to be, they always have a half ass effort with everything in this game.
---
Strange, because over the weekend I launched a nuke from Charlie, went back and there was a cool down, then went to Alpha and there was a cool down at Alpha too, even though I only did Charlie.
---
I also went back to Charlie the next morning and it was still on lockdown until a few hours later, right around the time the vendors and such reset..... So I figured it must have been a 24 hour thing.
---
I'm not disputing the three nukes per 3 hours thing, but in my specific situation, something was up and not sure what.
---
Excavator with Calibrated Shocks (+100 carry, 4 ores mined per node), Medic Torso (auto-stims on low health) and Internal Database (+2 INT). I don't think PA arm mods even work so I don't have those.
---
They should change silos so that you have to collect all 8 pieces of the code yourself and decipher it then just walk in and punch in the code. Only way this would benefit is to have the codes unique to the character. Would be more interesting than the current sprint to launch prep then wait 5 minutes while the bar fills.
---
I won't since this is the truth. I would put (Fish)bones as second.
---
Bloodied, Junkies, Vampiric in that order. Specific builds vary but usually high dps - sneak commando, PA heavy or unarmed. There are others but most are hybrids of these or off-meta picks.
---
The annoying part of reloading in ACP is that my cores aren't fully depleted before I am forced to reload. And the most I had before reloading is 350/500 and couldn't fire anymore. At least the PA is reusing them
---
thanks! :) just in the moment i got an invitation for an interview on next friday, for a job proposal i responded yesterday to! =) a small streak of light...
---
I currently run rank three of better criticals, bloody mess, and 4 leaf. I still have extra points in Int I use to run rank 5 gunsmith, probably going to move those points to either luck for quick hands or charisma for tenderizer.
---
Sums up this game.
---
Can someone explain to me how to craft a legendary weapon pls?
---
There are many ways to get this effect - both legit &amp; exploits.
---
So would anyone else be interested in a PvP mode where commie wacker is the only weapon available?
---
The only thing that comes to my mind when I see this is: Ohh? You're approaching me?
---
Fingers crossed for ya mate- kill it!
---
Just to add to this, get the Excavator Power Armor too, you get more ore per node. It's pretty easy to get.
---
Not include people on bethesda client... doesn’t make it fair... a lot of people couldn’t transfer their data, my partner included, still can’t do it to this day.
---
I saw a player with a boxing ring style camp, they were using whackers, it was a good laugh!
---
I've put more hours into fallout 76 than all the single-player fallouts combined.  
---
Games are more fun with friends and other players in my opinion.
---
If those numbers are true. There’s 1 maybe 2 servers full of people playing 76 on steam.
---
They dont drop ultracite plasma cartridges. So I end up at a big loss.
---
Quite comprehensive good read
---
I started a new character when this battle pass was added, got to level 6 then my buddy reminded me that I'd have to grind my rep and gold again. That character is still level 6 now.
---
I wouldn't mind if the gold vendor cap was increased and we had more ways to earn rep with factions, faction events would be nice, even reworking current events.
---
At least the quad effect boosts the base amount to 80 still, thus you can replace an Anti-armor Handmade with a Quad Handmade and perforating mag (that would be just 10 rounds without the quad effect).
---
You can't find it. Somebody has to craft one and give it to you to scrap. It has a 100% learn chance from scrapping.
---
I'll like to join you
---
&gt;Thanks  Krillgein, i'll go to the hardware option now. Maybe it works. I use my One X in With a External cooler fan: [https://produto.mercadolivre.com.br/MLB-1505137843-base-xbox-one-suporte-vertical-com-ventilador-refrigeraco-\_JM](https://produto.mercadolivre.com.br/MLB-1505137843-base-xbox-one-suporte-vertical-com-ventilador-refrigeraco-_JM) \- But id never clean up inside.
---
Nah that was the savage divide one, never had a fail in the toxic Valley!
---
But those numbers aren’t true. Just checked steam app on my phone. Peak players today was 8k. Currently 4.5k playing atm.
---
Thank
---
Or just download it full resolution from the app!
---
What's your point?
---
Thank you, I guess I have to find someone with the plans then
---
Not anymore, you could only learn it from mole miner pails. I scrapped like 20 to no avail
---
I have several group chats where everyone eventually left, I now have a chat with just myself that I post my screenshots to!
---
Where can i find that holotape? Is it thatone before you enter the elevator?
---
Trappers
---
When did it change?
---
not the treasure pail helmet
---
Why would we like the bad points?
---
I'm not really sure but I assume with the mole miner treasure hunter event because one of the rarest plans was the marine armor helmet
---
What platform are you on? I might have extra
---
Believe it or not, there's actually not 54 more rounds on the core. If you watch the numbers, you'll see it eat all 500 rounds, then as the reload animation starts it'll jump back up to 54.
---
With my Handmade it happens all the time - I see all 25 rounds get shot, reload starts, the number jumps up to 14 for some reason, then the reload ends and everything is back to normal. 
---
You're not losing shots, though it may be leaving cores with tiny numbers in your inventory; I carry so many bullets it would be impossible for me to keep track.
---
I suggest taking it to like a best buy or other computer store that does cleanups. It's pretty cheap and will definitely help.
---
if you're talking about this one [https://i.imgur.com/kZXgRgC.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/kZXgRgC.jpg)
---
If you're on xbone i can give you one
---
Those graphs don’t tell us much at all...
---
Each silo has a global one hour cooldown between uses  after a nuke has been launched. Each silo also has a personal 3 hour cooldown for each player that launches a nuke from that silo. So say you launch a nuke from site alpha, you will have to wait three hours before you can launch from there again but a friend of yours would only need to wait an hour before they can launch.
---
I'm at 79 now i can still finish if i play everyday now and use up all my earned atoms but i mean come on i really played a lot onndifferent season passes you dont have to play this much at all you can just blitz it in a couple of days no lifing it.
---
cos we're perverts and like to be hurt
---
Builds gear/loot and the community
---
Or at the very least, an intelligence check to help with her collar!
---
I know I'm playing it everyday it's still not enough
---
did they ever reply? having the same issue
---
The amount of different builds you can make, not saying they’re all viable but still a thing I enjoy playing around with
---
Bugs are the worst but also can be the funniest things
---
I wonder what the proportion of players are who play on [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net). As far as I know Bethesda does not indulge in giving numbers like Steam does. Whilst the numbers is not included, one can only use what one is given.
---
Ps4
---
Ah, sorry I'm xbox
---
why though?
---
https://youtu.be/Sa1D_YDWQEQ
---
Doesn't work on Gattling Plasma alas.
---
The event is likely fixed anyway, So I wouldn't worry if I were you.
---
Yes, then mumbles could give us a chance to also get weapons we don't have the plans for.
---
My boy dead man is one of the top PVPers on xbox in the game. He's also one of the few people to not hide what he uses and what he does for fights by sneaky edits in video.
---
Damn I'm PS4 but thanks anyway boss
---
Depending on your int it actually does .)
---
What’s your psn I would like to join
---
Also my condolences may he Rest In Peace✊🏽
---
Take a bunch of drugs that boost INT and scrap a bunch at once and join a building team. The higher your INT, the more likely you learn a mod
---
The brotherhood of steel vendor bot inside the whitespring sells the plan
---
Magic weapons are not fixed, I have tested on the PTS also and mine (an LMG and a shotgun) still work fine.
---
Modus sells it in the Enclave bunker. I think you also get it after you launch your first nuke.
---
Ah ok. Have to check that. Thx 👍
---
Use a usb to transfer it
---
I've had this happen to me too! 👻 And my workbenches are all underground!! Totally creeped me out!
---
The random glitches. Best one I've ever had was when I killed a bit in watoga, it got knocked back and landed in a shopping trolley. It started to bounce around like a brick in a clothes dryer ( YouTube that ) and then shot of like it had a rocket attached to it.
---
I was similarly confused seeing that happen, especially since I literally just FT'd in right at the end of the event. Was an awful racket.
---
I don't agree either, this will make people complain about how often reload takes place.
---
I was going to ask if anyone would break it to him that TSE is no longer a thing...
---
Not sure. Haven't used it much myself. You might have to experiment a little.
---
I can make you one. I’m on ps4
---
Making a game easy by removing one of the mechanics is not a QOL improvement.
---
First time I went into the Wendigo cave. Hey I'm doing an early game quest. Sure I'm high enough level to handle whatever is in there......
---
Good to know. I've deconstructed roughly 100 radium rifles, and still haven't gotten the silencer.
---
Going to prime fissure at level 25 and a level 27~ friend with a nocturnal pipe wrench and beating multiple scorchbeasts to death with it
---
Part of the quest to earn rank of general was to help modus events to generate points. I think it would be a better idea to dimply require points to get keycard spawns. Might be a lot harder like that though if modus events dont pop up frequently
---
Yes ! This drives me mad! I went on my travels the other day with a nice tidy stack of fresh shiny new plasma cores.
---
When I get home, I realise I have 15 half empty plasma cores. Its like every time I switch to a different gun and then back to my plasma it chooses a fresh new core????
---
Its pissing me off to the point I'm tempted just to scrip my plasma and get rid of the whole lot.
---
I appreciate the tip. I'm going crazy trying to get a silencer.
---
Oh so it was time limited too collect in the atom shop too??
---
Dude fuck that cave I could handle earle and the SBQ at the same time better than that cave
---
For all we know that IS how it's supposed to work but it's bugged.
---
And let us manually roll effects at a higher module cost! I've spent over 500 of them making Plasma Caster, not a single Bloodied!
---
yes - lucky hole mine &amp; lode baring are the only reasons i have a excavator pa :-)
---
I think today i gonna try the pa glitch to get into the mines without the event has started - need copper too :-D
---
Figured it was the Tesla, what about it causes the tank?
---
and i want her companion quest to help her be able to say her own name again.  no legendaries, no fanfare.  I just want her to be able to say her name again.
---
have the helmet but want 6k caps for smiley
---
They say we cannot have more stash space but I can have say 50 different heavy weapons or I can have over 1000 out fits with different prefix's doesn't make sense they should take the weight out of the stash system and just say you can have so many items and only have carry weight on the character.
---
I don’t use it for the health benefits I only use it to satisfy hunger lol. I’m bad at managing food and I feel like I always let it spoil. Canned dog food I don’t have to worry about :)
---
I'm pretty sure I have it, I'll log on and check in a bit.
---
It happened again to me again today i couldnt loot it still got the reward :-)
---
That the same as I read it to allow lower players to explore more of the map earlier. Also bring higher level players back to low level area. For example if a level 200 does to the forest all the monsters level will be lifted so they get a decent amount of XP and level appropriate drops.
---
So, you're complaining about things five years in advance? Seems reasonable.
---
Pretty sure it wasn’t in the shop for me yesterday but I had already claimed mine so I’m not sure if that changes anything
---
You on now? I’m jgc15903
---
Renegadegamer53
---
Will it even make 5 years?
---
I love F76 but I don't see it outliving WoW or even ESO.
---
Great!
---
I do it, but only whith one hight level mule, it have 15 charisma for share any perk
---
Yeah I cant test it either because i already claimed mine soon after it was available. I HOPE it wasnt time limited to collect because that would be shitty
---
Yeah hang on I'm Luftwaffe112
---
IIRC the Shishkabob is the only “flame” weapon that works properly in all situations.
---
That is what this post is for, to find out when and where and what we can do for him
---
Geez, I never thought of using the spare xbox in the bedroom to pull up my 150 character, park her in her camp after joining my team and sharing a perk.    True, it's just one perk shared, but still.   I think I'll try this at least once.   Thanks.
---
It’s Bethesda so not really surprised
---
&gt;swap servers, check the missile silo state holotape, and do it again
---
What exactly is the holotape supposed to do?
---
I thought it only shows the status of the bunker.
---
The way you describe it, it sounds like it removes personal cooldown
---
I wouldn't mind it in the mire, but ONLY if one wasteland is out as it will lower the monster for lower level so then it shouldn't be an issue.
---
The beautiful environmental art.
---
I've given away good gear, because it's to much of a hassle to transfer between characters.
---
Ah, I never knew it was a bug.
---
Well it definitely does still happen, not all the time, but often enough where it makes the whole experience unenjoyable so I shall do that.
---
Belly of the beast. Game was like a week old. I think i was about level 35 or something. After about 1 minute i realised i was totally out of my depth but I pushed on. Weapons and armour started breaking. Ammo and aid started running out. I died repeatedly but i kept going. Finally i made it to the end. And oh lovely. A Scorchbeast. At this point i was using whatever weapon i had that wasn't broken and had ammo for. When the scorchbeast finally died i felt physically and mentally exhausted. I think it took me about 2 hours.
---
10/10 would absolutely do it again.
---
I like having rare rewards that not everyone has.  I don't think they should re use all the same rewards year to year. It doesn't make events feel very special.
---
lols
---
Only took an hour when doing Roxy glitch.
---
Went to Lewisberg for the first time in the 20s I think, getting caught in a building fighting off an army of around 15 super mutants with a scorchbeast flying overhead blasting its screams through the building.
---
It was absolute pandamonium. Barely made it out alive with 2 weapons breaking &amp; used up most of my stims. The room had a pile of supermutant corpses piled waist high. Had to wait several minutes at the end for the SB to lose interest &amp; made a dash for Lewisberg station to offload my loot so that I could fast travel away.
---
Still one of the most epic fights I've had to date.
---
CAMP building.
---
It's my never ending cycle of destruction and renewal....
---
And smashing events.
---
Fuck I love all of it. Bugs and all there's no place I'd rather be.
---
I can give you one, just add me HoodRichMemphis
---
Thanks.   I plan on getting at least some of the legendary perk cards that effect SPECIAL.   There are alot of regular perk cards I'd love to equip but can't.
---
Yea, the plushie is nice, but the cursed weapons are lame. Especially the Harpoon gun anyway, I have a bloodied Harpoon gun already and it trumps it hands down.
---
The shovel is nice for one reason. It weighs nothing and I can use it for the buried with Honour daily ha.
---
The map is incredible....the map detail and content they added is just massive. It's fun to explore, and really enjoy the background sounds in the Mire and the Bog. Building C.A.M.P.s (although I would like a bit higher budget), gear, weapons, etc.  Community is cool, and i get a laugh at some of the bugs and mechanics of the game...i can kick a garbage can down the hill from Mt Blair and then FT down near the rusty pick and try to catch it.  The guy posting the video a few days ago of blowing up a car and launching a ghoul over the Whitespring....those are the gems of the game.
---
Do they fly around naturally also? I have seen one on occasion just flying around, I assumed someone else called it in, so left it be.
---
I did this over two months ago. Right before the ban wave. Do you think they care your raider reputation went suddenly to the top? lol
---
#DONT TOUCH MY TOON BETHESDA.
---
Only I can touch it.
---
It's under stash boxes
---
Love it.
---
I'm almost at allied anyway now so I may as well just finish normally
---
Good for you. My mental health and free time asked for me to glitch this shite.
---
Going into Grafton from the train station, go left 1 street. Robot vendor on left side, up stairs.
---
Ah I might do that to be honest
---
Haha fair enough. Don't blame you
---
Lol sounds intense..also question am I lagging or is it the game.. I can only really feel it when facing enemies and using vats and such. My other games don't lag.
---
They just need to make a proper way to respec. You shouldn’t have to start over or gain 30+ levels to respec to what you want to do.
---
This please. I hate crafting legendary armours. 
---
Craft, leave bench, scroll down armour to look for the new one because I don't kmow what prefix I'm looking for, get back on bench, go to the same piece again, craft again, repeat.
---
Sometime I make a few at a time but if the next one I craft is what I want then the next 2 or 3 are useless then I wasted a lot of material that I probably need to wait a day to scrip because of the limit
---
yeah, 10+ with all kinds of builds on the wall, aiming inwards to the generator, like a firing squad, obliterating the blob of scorched before it even hits the bottom... average 1500xp per wave, depending on your buffs. tons of loot and ammo. left one of those "meatgrinders" with nearly 1000 40mm nades! great fun. every time.
---
You're assuming, in a game riddled with bugs and mechanics that don't function properly, that its intentional. 
---
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't. I merely suggested my opinion and didn't bother assuming anything with no actual clue.
---
This might seem like something I can get behind...Iol.I kinda like rolling around with my scout mask on it's still in game but not every one has one.asides that they're adding relevant stuff for bulion so its gonna be just fine.
---
Completely forgot about the bash. Thank you!
---
Walked into level 91 Deathclaw at level 15 and it one shotted me so fast my real life self only managed to get "Oh f..." out.
---
Let us know when you’re on the frontline of the next war if you think that remembering to check your ammo is “unnecessary difficulty”
---
Hate that cave. Everything in it is a pushover for me except the Mirelurk Kings which are deadly and take barely any damage.
---
Gating plasma is even more bugged.
---
If you have a partially used core it'll suddenly be at 10% capacity. I've had 30 cores all go 10% at the same time, shelfed it then.
---
Captain cosmos gameboard doesn't display correctly on walls. Mountain scout ski mask not still not craftable - to all the loyal players, here's a reward that doesn't work! Does anybody actually play the game at bethesda? At least they replaced the weapon in the wastelanders photoframe.
---
I am certain that you'll get it in 10 tries if you uny-glitch, join some building team and use int-drugs .)
---
If you want it just to collect I would jump.but mine doesn't break as fast as a tse but it breaks faster than a non explosive. My guess is 25%faster than a non explosive
---
They do exactly that when they set up the PTS, no reason why they wouldn't do that for testing. More than once in replying to help threads Ladydevann or other CMs says that they will pull character copies to test the bugs themselves.
---
Can you display this?if so I would buy one from you ?
---
Patch 22 I believe
---
Is that this one coming or the one after?? I've lost track haha
---
What
---
They have only said sometime september
---
Now you must pass on this kindness.
---
Yikes lol. I under 5 deaths at level 26 so I run if I have to.. Cliffs are your best friend lol. I'm lucky I snuck the power armor in Garrahan mine before the 36 level sentry bot seen me, otherwise I would of died. She hit me with 2 charged laser shots my HP went from 100 to 10 I never stimd and maneuvered away so fast.
---
With a handful of hours in the game I don't know what I have to offer!
---
I'd have it so that each time you deconstruct something with a set mod on there, you learn a little something about that mod. So you might have to deconstruct 100 of a specific gun with a silencer to learn how to make that silencer mod. I'd also add in deconstructing the specific standalone mod to that experience pool, and a tiny amount from deconstructing a different type of weapon that has that same mod.
---
Have the amount you need to deconstruct altered by the sum of INT plus whatever stat the weapon uses for damage (2xINT if it's an intelligence based weapon) so that those who use them more and know their intricacies plus smarter characters are able to learn faster. That way your mods are guaranteed to be learned after a while, but you still get ways to increase that.
---
Lol this aint real life. Sorry elitist
---
Huh, maybe there was a person crouched and invisible. I logged back in this morning and found them capable of working once more
---
Commando
---
That seems pretty boring. Maybe I am in the minority, but I enjoy a dungeon every now and again.
---
my cat should finish the old food before asking for more, too
---
but I agree, that would make a lot of sense
---
Simple. Any plans you have extras of you can drop them off to other new players. And you don't have to do immediately, whenever you can.
---
Wife and I had the rocket chair bug in the original Red Dead Redemption and it's still something we laugh about occasionally.
---
I would be onboard with this change!
---
I will certainly keep that in mind. Still don't understand a lot of the mechanics of this game yet
---
I really appreciate the tanky PA people or lower levels that do crowd control. It makes my job as a low health build possible, and so I always try to revive them when I see them get downed or help out when they get overwhelmed
---
It is the next patch. In September.
---
Hopefully get a new calendar this week!
---
Honestly, the game has a lot of story to it and it's all been pretty well intertwined with a little bit over here adding into this storyline that you discovered over here and this note here clarifying that and... so on. As a single player game released kind of how it is now, it wouldn't have been the best Fallout by far, but it would have been a decent play.
---
Honestly, the worst parts of the game beyond glitches are the concessions made to making it multiplayer.
---
Thank you :)
---
So how to I get around the character cooldown
---
I heard tenderizer is an amazing perk in NW that almost nobody has because it takes like 9 charisma.
---
Right know you cant event progress the wastlander questline ounce of prevention or whetever quest wont work
---
I got a lot of heart emoges after one ACP yesterday when we were down to just two minutes and I had to pull out the Bloodied Gauss Minigun to finish him off.  Unfortunately the wendigos do not drop utltracite ammo.  I like the long fight but why go out empty handed.
---
Being level 20ish and pinned down in the pumpkin patch hiding from a scotch beast. 
---
Also being around level 15 and in wendigo cave.
---
This group is full of supporting vault dwellers. If you have questions, this place has the answers. If you need a teammate or two, this place has PC, Xbox, and PlayStation users. Don't be worried about asking anything, we can't rebuild anything if we don't know how.
---
Xbox, thanks though. I'll end up running it again, I actually like the event. Just might wait until the legendary ammo crafting perk comes out.
---
Whether intentional or not, it works. It creates tension, and challenges the memory. If you want endless ammo and a sure win, play Duke Nukem
---
respect!
---
Get a spawn now and then by my camp at Summerville.
---
5years lol...I'll be surprised if this even get support to 2022.
---
Sneak 3, high agility, sneak legendary armor, fixer
---
Eacapeartist perk and 5x Unyield gear. No sneak perk.   I can be in Earls toes and not be seen.
---
They can't even turn out cosmetics that that look or function right, it'll be a cold day in hell before they could do something like this, even if they wanted to.
---
So kill the spawns with any weapon with plentiful ammo and then pull out an ultracite weapon for the looting?
---
Might just have to start carrying one around then cheers. How many 40mm grenades do you keep on you just in case the event kicks off?
---
Displays for PA are coming "soon".
---
Um, you appear to be rebuilding in Skyrim?
---
Maybe we can all chill tf out and use her to open Monongah Mine for us rather than a NUCLEAR WARHEAD to move a few rocks out of the way.
---
I thought you could but it turns out you can't. That's wack!
---
how does that work? i have x5 unyeilding and escapeartist and sneak 3. but when i shoot he can see me? any ideas
---
It's the Torso for 4x more yield. Game states arms but it's wrong.
---
Was anyone using tesla rifles?  If they were they were the culprit of the lag.
---
I don't believe the issue is with the Tessla rifle itself but rather the ash piles it leaves behind.
---
I noticed it during a Line in the Sand event.  As it went on the lag went up tremendously but if I looked straight up...no lag.
---
I went looking for a mod to retexture the ash piles into duffle bags and haven't had the problem since.
---
This is a thread I want to see “Bethesda Replied”
---
I think I launched about 20-30 grenades before the dang thing broke. It is a Zealots FFR RW. Only reason why it got kept was for this event.
---
Can't wait level 400 now and got 170 odd levels saved to rank legendary perks up. Defo leveling up strength need more carry weight and to stop using weight perks instead of damage perks.
---
For now, you can rename the chassis, so you can tell them apart.
---
It's worth a shot to still try. I did it well after the time frame and it worked.
---
On my mistress of mysteries character i was using the garb of mystery and the phantom device with about 20 agility. Never saw me while i was cutting up those ankles.
---
Thank you!!! I never ever knew about this and I’ve been playing since f76 first came out
---
I run with someone that uses a Tesla frequently with high mob counts and in instances, it's never caused an issue. I have only had that happen once recently and that was at radiation rumble. It's likely a bug, if the Tesla is involved is probably incidental or it would happen every time.
---
It's in with the default stash boxes. You gotta side-scroll.
---
PSA:  you don’t need to perform kill shit to get loot or xp
---
I let low levels shoot first then I finish in 1 shot
---
I tell them to get a good tag gun that uses .38 ammo they loot conserve powerful ammo for solo.  I often build a nice pipe file with silencer can for them to tag with.  Just need to do some dmg to get loot/xp
---
I also share team medic so whenever someone uses a stimpak it heals the people around them too.
---
Are you shooting with suppresed weapons. You can't go stealth with a naval cannon.
---
YES PLEASE
---
I agree with this.  I have tried to start storing the fully charged ones to use up the partials, as they have a good bit in them when combined with Power User.  I just hate seeing a list of 39 cores with varying amounts in them plus they take up way more space in my stash than if I were carrying them.  Kinda wish we could merge them in the clusterfuck that is the ammo converter, but that would be asking *waaaaaay* too much.  More often than not, I just drop anything under 50% and move on.
---
The holotape just tells you the cooldown state of the silos.
---
I'm not sure Bethesda can show the legendary popup while you're in a crafting bench. I remember completing crafting-related challenges during the legendary run, and while I'd see the SCORE popup it seems like I wouldn't see the level up/reward until I left the crafting station. Going entirely by memory so I could be delusional. Grains of salt suggested.
---
I wouldn't play it.  Too many rules.
---
I really hope for the second week of september,but it's most likely the third....or delayed.
---
I wonder how many times they copied a character to find an invisible .50 cal on it
---
Contextual ammo was definitely a great idea :)
---
Are you the one who nuked the mine to go in, or did you go into someone else's mission for the fight through the mine?
---
Yea, you had to claim it from the Atom Shop. I don't think it's still available, though.
---
LOL
---
This is why I just use the 2 that I already had. One Bloodied stealth commando and one heavy weapons/strength/unarmed build, and only my strength build has don't the wastelanders questline through to allies on both sides. My commando only went so far as to get the stealth suit for nuje zones. I can't bear the thought of going thru all that a second time.
---
Sweet ty for the info will give it a shot/bang tonight!
---
You can either finish Miner Miracles and get the plan for free or server hop until you find it on a robo-vendor.
---
The rules are basically just basic game-play changes to base game to make things harder. Most of these wouldn't be fed to you at the start, but rather major things like limb damage and fatigue bar would be explained. Most things would be discovered as you play.
---
YUP!
---
you cant have your cake and eat it
---
...and add some more rewards ;)
---
Her dads a man eating monster that we constantly kill over and over again. She can be a bit upset if she’s wants I guess.
---
It's Wren who gives me the urge to slash.
---
Wow.
---
Howwwww can I teeeech these keeeeeddzzz
---
Yea that’s what I want. When I’m marking 70 or 80 SS right arm’s I want to have to back out of that screen every time.
---
So then Heavy Guns are the only good weapons then in groups.  Because Pistols are not, Shotguns are not, and then without sneak rifles are not.  Wait til you see the damage after wastelanders, everyone will be forced to switch to heavy guns to kill the collosus.
---
Yeah my group has bee doing it that way too. ACP only sticks around for a few minutes whereas Scorched Earth stays up for 30 mins. Much easier to do it in that order.
---
No backpack and no weight reducing armor pieces.
---
No not yet according to AngryTurtle who is pretty thorough and reliable.
---
Build a water purifier or two and don’t lock them.
---
You can also Power Attack to stop the animation, which is much quicker
---
With minimum creation levels, that sounds like a plan.
---
I believe MODUS Production terminal also sells it. Fairly sure that’s where I bought it.
---
Looks like one of them para natural entities from Control
---
I did this exact quest in my alt last night and had no issues whatsoever. 
---
I put in the T fuse, then the blood sample, then analyzed. You might need a new blood sample if you did it backwards. 
---
You could also try abandoning the quest and picking it back up from the terminal but I'm not 100% sure that works so that might be best used as a last resort.
---
Cant blame ya, looks tasty
---
I think I've died more to the "You're not pressing the stimpak button at all, honest" bug than anything else, and definitely more than 5 times.
---
**Lots** of ore in the rocks around Solomon's pond.  Use Excavator Armor.
---
Short answer: no. Long answer: Yes, but you're going to have to grind a ludicrous number of the 10000XP repeatable challenge.
---
Totally agree. I’m so glad they added NPC’s because the world space was so sad with everyone dead or M.I.A.
---
Ah, 2022 then.
---
Anything actually worth it in the later levels?
---
Dammit Beth!!I appreciate that none the less..TY
---
thx
---
are these holotapes intended for single use or for permanent use?
---
You can rename the chassis??? Son of a...
---
I’d like to pay my respects to a fellow gamer. When is this going on?
---
My psn: Phoenixoflucence
---
The secret door is pretty cool imo at level 99
---
I kind of gave up on the game after getting a look at Bethesda's version of "endgame grind". Didn't even bother finishing Wastelanders. I loved F76 for a long time, I really did. Got my money's worth a dozen times over. But there comes a point where I just have to acknowledge that it's not worth my time any more. It's certainly worth a play for anyone coming to the game new, though. I still believe that. There just seems to be so little to do after you reach a certain point.
---
If bolstering, that enables you to have the most defensive capabilities, is just bad, what else is there for vanguard? Bethesda don’t want you to play max health, they made bloodied to good.
---
Bolstering enable the most broken defensive perk to be used, serendipity, while being in low life gives you enough damage to be relevant.
---
For current standards you simply can’t go full life. Even if you disregard damage completely, just the STR bonus alone makes unyielding the best role.
---
Yeah I wish there was more build diversity but if you play anything other than bloodied you are just wasting resources. Let’s wait for the damage revamp to see if Bethesda makes it right
---
I believe its double the speed since the explosion counts as a separate hit so the game treats it like shooting two bullets at once.
---
An ammo converter... I'll see my way out. Thank you.
---
Permanent! I use mine all the time to check which silos are open before I decide where to launch from.
---
I like his hat.
---
Walk down the mountain from sunnytop station towards silo b. There is a nice flat clearing.
---
They are usually limited time atomic shop items. Keep looking. They often come back.
---
It's true, I had a level 13 come in with me a few others, he did what he could and I give him credit for that.  But then there was the level 87 guy who was hiding up on the bulldozer the whole time.  For the most part its a gamble to who you go in with and my experience its been 50/50 when it comes to being lucky enough to be with a good team.
---
Radium rifles are not normal. The mod learn Rate are much, much lower then say a handmade.
---
Run ACP a couple of times but instead of focusing on Earle focus on screw farming. Radium mods are finally attainable.
---
"the heart gangsign" lmfao
---
Yea, that's probably my favorite thing too.
---
I have to wonder if it's all RNG sometimes. I rarely get the legendary effect that I run, junkies. I have rolled 40+ gauss mini guns and not one junkies so far.
---
I am an xbox player so it's definitely possible. Was it in a house made with three glass domes connected by hallways?
---
I bet just for you the devs would add a skill check where you show her your fedora collection &amp; she realizes the importance of worshipping kings like yourself.
---
You'd have to earn approximately [700.000 XP a day](https://akarnokd.github.io/rng-76/score.html?nw&amp;level=50&amp;percent=0&amp;days=8&amp;xpgain=700000&amp;startrank=77&amp;dblxps=16&amp;dblxpe=20&amp;dblscs=23&amp;dblsce=27&amp;weeklyat=1&amp;bonusdaily).
---
Maybe you can get away with 600.000 XP given the bonus challenges in effect today and tomorrow.
---
Wow, that website is super useful. Cheers
---
Community, sometimes I find a very fun or funny camp, like “Epstein didn’t killed himself” in neon lights, or very inspiring designs. I like to leave some workshops filled with everything that is needed just as finding workshops ready to farm. I like the map (crisp, clear, colorful), the weapon mods and cosmetics. Also the new monsters, but that’s about it. I’d like to choose the legendary effects, the quests to be more than a fetch type thing, and remove cap limits. A man can dream...
---
Thumbs up to both of you for hanging in there.  Those moments are the ones you remember.  Way more fun than entering the event only to have some douche one-shot Earle.
---
I will say - I see what a lot of you are saying. Cores drop at all charges so it could get annoying the way I suggested.
---
Maybe if they could tie the system I explained to ultracite cores only.. Its obnoxious crafting 30 full cores, just to find out mid ACP that more than half are 15% or lower.
---
Lmao
---
Wait.. Someone is running ACP with *Syringers, Alien Blasters and Paddle Balls*?
---
Thanks for that. Already 2x as many downvotes as upvotes. All for telling people to vote. It’s like some people don’t want you to vote. Don’t want you to count. Hmmm...
---
Well fuck em. Downvote away. You can’t downvote at the polls. Best of luck down under, mate.
---
hahaha
---
In contrast to that there is the glitch that can give you up to 45 int.
---
Lower rate or not .)
---
We need to keep pounding this into the brains of those at Beth.  I have been playing since the release and have collected so much stuff I have to sacrifice collectable things from events to scrap.  Even with Fo1st its not about hoarding but saving the special weapons, armor and other things.  If anything there should be incremental bumps (10-20lbs) in storage as you hit level 200-400-600.
---
That one already has a home with Jen though! I do visit him sometimes because I like the face she put on him.
---
The thing I dreaded most is the thing I now like most--that there are other players.
---
How are u able to use modules?? Do u have to beat the game
---
Are you using the unyielding properly? You have to get your health to 20% using rads, each piece will then multiply your agility which is what makes you hard to detect, you then can do away with the sneak perk card, I would replace this with 3×ranks of dodgy, this will help you stay alive. Hope this helps.
---
Repair it then use the terminal on the bottom to initiate a combat sequence.
---
Thank you for your advice. Screws (thanks to acp) are the least of my worries. I've completely depleted my adhesive(which I farm at my camp) and springs. It's not a huge deal anymore though. I got a bloodied, vats accuracy, lower vats cost fixer today from the Purveyor. I still want that silencer for my bloodied, ffr, fr radium rifle though.
---

Buy them at The rusty pick. Use to craft weapon armor from vendors. Like ss armor, gauss shotgun etc

That works on Xbox as well. When you get the respawn bug on Xbox just hold down the menu button to open your friends list and Fast Travel to someone.

You're optimistic I see
---
Nice. I think I'll switch my ally to him then.
---
Is it just me or is the CAMP build menu a hot mess?
---
KingVerizon is 100% correct. Marine Helmet/Wetsuit crafted pre-Wastelanders has no disease resist text and post-Wastelanders crafted ones do.
---
I'm pretty sure a beta guy told me it use to be much more of a boon.  He said they nerfed it because you could never find any pieces because people would server hope to scrap it.  Dont knownif its true but thats the story I was told.
---
&gt;others have reported the gatling plasma having the same issue as well
---
Regretfully, it is true.
---
It is likely the stuff you added inside that is buggin it out.  This is only conjecture, but it is speculated that having items "stacked" inside (e.g. placing floor decorations on tables or shelves, having plushies sit on your couch, lamp on an end table, etc) causes the "item needs support" error.  The game thinks the stuff inside needs support, even though it was placed in the original camp without issue.  You can keep trying, but it probably won't work.
---
IIRC Power User also works with plasma cores.
---
Your pretty right, it's to stop people from just grabbing ever power armor they see and scrapping it preventing new players form being able to get any power armor pieces.
---
I’d I could have looted Earl last night and dozens of spawns I put down I’d have all the acids. But I killed earl then died and spawned outside the cave at evacuate warning and lost all the loots. 
---
If anyone knows the auction house guys name or schedule if he’s on reddit I’d love to participate and have some items of my own for trade. Lots of armor.
---
Eat him with the cannibal perk, that's funny.  Maybe he is role playing for his next career with ANTIFA.
---
Yup, that's how I got mine.
---
yes, had my accounts linked when wastelanders launched, so got a free steam copy.
---
I've played since launch, only this weekend did I notice the weights at the gym in the first town. Had to server hop 5 times the next time I went there to get some lead.
---
That is what this post is for, to find out when, where and what we are doing as well as getting as many people as we can, I also have Xbox for those interested
---
I believe it does work with the plasma cores too. I used to live in my PA so I had power user equipped all the time, I may have imagined it but it seemed like it doubled my ultracite plasma cores. I’ll have to test it later today when I’m on.
---
Sounds like magic weapons
---
Count me in. I already sent u a friend request on psn
---
Lmfao, that's gold
---
I ran into an in game memorial on to someone's lost friend Saturday night on PS4. It was nice, touching and a little sad, my condolences sir.
---
You could just do the lazy way of having the screenshot up on your tv and take a pic with your phone.  
---
Also that's pretty neat. I wanna see what the camp looked like.
---
It isn't so easy when you don't have some knob with a hacked weapon melt Earle in seconds.  Happens too often sadly.
---
Yes.
---
I'm a tank/quantum build. I live off of Quantums and Psychobuff. Stealth Boy M3s paired with the magazine + Secret Agent perk card maxed out are nice if you want sneaky sneaky times.
---
It would make it more valuable, and think about how rare it would be IRL. It would essentially make a faction with one set a "super power" if you will.
---
I keep forgetting to bring my PA into Lode Baring! Always regret it! Lucky Hole is the best though. So much lead :)
---
And I was mentioning the PA for OP, in case they didn't know about it.
---
Auto stimpak is a life saver, I rarely die as long as I have stumpaks, which is always.
---
I’d just like to be able to see what I’m looking at in the player venders. I hate looking at weapons and all I can see is a partial name. Bloodied suppressed co....... is it a rifle, is it a shotgun, or maybe it’s Grognak’s ax who knows.
---
i dont even want to play on my potato build, but if the devs want to, they can have at it.
---
I've had good luck with a full set of troubleshooters armor and superstims.  I also switch in the chem fiend, field surgeon, and first aid perk cards when i run it.  Lol the lazer still shreds but at least I have time to restim and jump out of the way.
---
Yes it used to give more material. You also were able to scrap the Power Armor Chassis in the earlier days as well. You would never find Power Armor Chassis sitting around because, for whatever reason, they would scrap for ballistic fiber. 
---
I’ve played since the Alpha Test, so it’s kind of lost to me when they patched this out. I imagine it would be very hard to get a matching set of Power Armor in game today if they hadn’t though.
---
Ya I remember hunting PA for scrap it was good scrapping then they needed it because everyone hunted it.
---
The screaming ore
---
Those are the two I have problems with. Can take down Scorchbeasts up to 90 alone and most Sheepsquatch and Deathclaws too. But those two at level 35 upwards can take me down alone.
---
I'm still fairly low level and keep getting put off by all this high level stuff lol. Seems I need a lot of dedication to the grind.
---
Always. I hear the next patch release will fix everyone's problems.
---
That wouldn’t work. The weapon has to be out at the moment of their death.
---
Sweet, awesome job you did there. It definitely makes it better in a video. As i said in the other post, congrats and great proof of concept. I hope someone at Beth see this and implements it right away.
---
Charging receiver makes it sorta like a rifle or a Gatling gun.
---
Could it be in century links downtime?
---
I've heard it's the chaining effect and that they broke something to do with it when patching the no-damage bug.
---
Yet you can with a flamethrower.
---
Apparently it works for gatling plasma too. I was wandering why I'm losing half an ammo when switching loadouts. Thanks now I'm know why.
---
The new damage model is used to make balance changes which I would like to see which changes occur before the final release on live servers. So what we are seeing in the pts currently isn't the final product. All though this new model is something I don't agree with but I don't know what's going on behind the scences. 
---
I get why you would be annoyed for not getting sneak criticals, I'm a rifleman build and I perform best by myself, yet I can also deal enough damage to kill enemies and do damage (maybe it is because I'm a bloodied gauss rifle build or something) . However, the commando build from what I seen is very powerful and tend to kill things very quickly like the Queen (Captain Noob, fallout 76 youtuber does this a lot) and people can abuse this to kill the queen or Earl to prevent other players from reaping the benefits of the award events.
---
If you are looking for an alternative group weapon to use, you can try the railway rifle, the plasma gun , maybe a legacy laser or something. 
---
I wouldn't say shotgunner builds aren't viable, but I don't experince with shogun builds in groups or pistols but I do with sneak rifleman builds and I know they can work .
---
I truly believe they will eventually allow us to transfer gold items to other characters. 
---
It may be FO1st exclusive but it will come eventually.
---
I did the grind on 2/4 of my guys but thats it. Waiting for transfers for the other two.
---
Please. It would mean that my high INT character could finally feels like the master craftsman he was meant to be.
---
I'm also guessing that the perk changes for One Wasteland were because of the number of literally broken builds they saw that were using perks based on their description, despite it performing poorly (because of incompatible perks, non stacking, unnamed conditonal blocks, etc).
---
Mine does that sometimes also when I first load in. But I can't fire. Switch weapons then switch back it's fine.
---

---
Even with a full health build that beam is basically a death sentence.  It's buggy like all the assaultron beams.  He can spam it if he feels like it, it hits for way too much, and it doesn't usually care if you break line of sight, it still keeps hitting long enough to kill you.
---
That makes gatling lasers a lot more useful for my side PA build. Now to pray for rng that I eventually get a good roll on an ultracite one.
---
Sounds like one hell of an event. Im guessing the minions got oneshot
---
Community had a lot to say about her. I feel she will have some future roll to play at some point. Too good of an idea for a character to pass up. The missions was too short lol
---
not even worth touching it the way it is now, so heavy for 1 or 2 pieces of steel
---
Nah, totally be pedantic. That’s how you get different stats.
---
Semi-auto Rifle may give a slight ‘damage boost’ because its receiver causes less loss of the rounds explosion.
---
Though it’s not on a scale of doubling damage.
---
Oh, I kinda like this one better😂😂
---
At this point, if I am not using PA in combat all the time, I don’t own a suit. Backpack vs PA has become an either or for me.
---
Yea something like this would suffice:
---
Hunting Rifle:
---
Level 1
---
Level 5
---
Level 10
---
Level 20
---
...
---
Level 50
---
Legendary *
---
Legendary 2*
---
Legendary 3*
---
Each level costing more materials than the last. After reaching level 50, materials are the same but each tier of legendary requires an extra legendary module, to respectively give it 1 2 or 3 effects for 1 2 or 3 modules.
---
I guess it was too good
---
Someone had a magic weapon
---
You, good sir, are a true hero
---
Reading this thread shocks me on how valuable acid is. I should get into the acid business I guess. Though mass scrap stuff is hard without 1st.
---
Wait a second...I thought this was only for the Fixer??
---
Adding shadowed effect to each armor piece will help also unless you are using secret service armor which doesn't have the plan yet.
---
i went in the second time wearing my stealth armour and .50 cal and it worked pretty good coupled with Psychobuff, that was until half way through the fight and the armour nearly broke so i was forced to go PA which helped my health a lot.
---

---
Revive a player in a pool of blood and gore!
---
Yep, one shot them even with a regular attack. I cut through the wendigo spawn like a heated chainsaw through butter. My only regret is I don't currently have bloody mess on, as having them explode into chunks from the massively excessive damage would be very satisfying
---
Mmm yes. Join us heavy gunner build, join the unarmed melee players for extreme dps 😈
---
They just need a convert ALL ammo option, the bloody interface is too cumbersome - I'd rather just farm more lead and make rounds instead of having to deal with it.   
---
Cool concept, terrible implementation. It should be like three clicks to convert all unwanted ammo - not going through 3 menus to turn in 20 rounds.
---
I hope not, someone said it’s on the fix list. So maybe it’ll go back. But if it does gets fixed and these red things stay, in the future it’ll be soooo much expensive.
---
Damn you’re insanely lucky then😂😂😂
---
I wish this worked on plasma cores
---
low leveled people i love having around, its like they know its going to be a bumpy ride and have no fear, just wanna help out and get some serious XP and loot in the process
---
It’s frustrating that that they made a new grenade and clearly based it on the utterly useless nuka-quantum grenade.
---
I said screw it and started a second character. I am now trying to complete Burried Treasure but the quest is bugged and impossible to finish.
---
How did they break something that was already working?
---
I wish I could find new players up for this. Get them up on a bush and throwing Molotovs into hordes, then I wipe them out. 
---
If I remember correctly, you just need to do damage, not kill them.
---
Yep. Radium rifle has the same mod learning chance as armor pieces do, which is significantly lower.
---
What I noticed is I spawn in with like 2 level 200+ and the rest are below 50.
---
Generally, (myself included) the 200s won’t shoot if nobody else is shooting. 
---
Everyone wants to wait and make sure the ammo will be worth it before using it. Problem is, someone has to go first for that to work out.
---
I have been dumping thousands of 5mm for my explosive Minigun just to get them to start shooting. It is a very unhealthy way to go about it considering you spend way too much time not doing damage. 
---
Everyone should just go in throwing as much as they can at it and we can get it done.
---
Thank you man i really appreciate the kind words :)
---
Try to get a plasma with a flamer barrel. Might take a while, if you want to stick with an Enclave plasma, since you can't mod them, but they make excellent backup weapons.
---
I always thought that having a Mumbles counterpart that rerolls weapons could be a good idea. So you have the weapon you want but with bad effects. You could take it to her counterpart, give a couple legendary modules plus some caps/gold and they will give you that weapon but with a new roll.
---
This is the better solution. I would rather not fire 13 shots, reload, then 17, reload, etc. I think power armor needs to prioritize low cores because you don't exit to swap them.
---
Used to get nuclear material plastic and steel. Used to get more for scrapping outfits as well. Used to get excited when you found a set. If they brought this back would make pa more useful 😆
---
The thing is PA in the game is overall worse than regular armor except in nuke zones for the radiation resist where it's a least a little useful. The only real use it has is for people who don't have great actual armor yet because it's a good and reliable safety blanket until they can get proper gear, so making it rare would further remove any tiny use it has.
---
You on xbox ? I'll buy a card and set it going be later on a few hours or so
---
They also weigh .5 regardless of any weight reduction perks
---
This! I had a similar experience around the same time. I was maybe 35-40 and ran this Gauntlet in the Mire.  I was doing the earlier quests at Abandoned and Abbies etc and was working my was back down to my base overlooking the Bog. No joke, I got attacked almost every step of the way! All the mirelurks. Death laws, hermit crabs, the whole cast and crew! I four my ways tooth and nail in my Tricentennial t45 breaking every weapon I could find until my PA legs and LA we’re toast and the rest were just about gone. I managed to make it to the BoS base in Fort Defiance in the nick of time. Exhausted, bloodied, but not beaten it was and awesome experience! They are my still my favorite loading screens as reminders of better times!
---
Why? Them being in the loot pool is clearly a bug. They'll be gone soon enough
---
I'm only 144 but play stealth shotgun that one shots almost everything and I've spent countless hours escorting low levels around reviving or helping out when they are overwhelmed in harder areas. That to me feels more fun
---
my camp is right across the street so im all for this.  lol
---
I got a TSE handmade as a Fashnacht reward.
---
Laser weapons in fallout are just proto lasguns
---
I'm on PC, but your offer is much appreciated. Thank you.
---
I love this Fallout community.
---
I just often don't know what to do when I get there. My main is a lvl 80 heavy weapons build with maxed out heavy weapon damage perks but I still feel like my shots are just pinging off Earle. Do enough damage to get the loot but still. Appreciate the people who seem to be able to just start dropping his health like crazy.
---
Okay I wanted to make sure s/he didn’t mean like hunting rifles and miniguns.
---
Also, I didn’t think you could get any of those you listed without crafting them??
---
The game is certainly not alt-friendly. That and the predatory atom shop practices I so easily fall prey to are the reasons I'm not currently playing.
---
I use the Chinese Stealth Suit, combined with the  3\* sneak card
---
All mods from Nexus are safe. Mods are client side only. Basicly UI improvements and stuff like that. Some item skin changes that only you can see.
---
Bethesda does not support mods, but do not restrict the use of them. If they wanted to, they could turn all of them off like in Nuclear Winter. I believe there was an interview early on where they said that they even keep track on what mods are popular for possible development ideas.
---
She does piss me off. So ungrateful and bitchy. 
---
I cant wait to kill her dad and then use his skin to decorate my camp. But I'm going to put it outside, in the rain and getting walked over by my brahmin, just to utterly disrespect his memory.
---
I thought it was common knowledge too (that perk works on fusion cores regardless of what you're using them for) but apparently not due, to the number of people here saying they weren't aware of it. PSAs like this are always welcome, never know what you might not know. And knowing is half the battle, I learned that from GI Joe.
---
Honestly I just ended up staying fairly close to the pylon or cabin. The moment I saw the glowing I went behind one to avoid a decent amount of it. I wasn’t fully prepared for the fight so nothing specialized against it. I just happened to have two trouble shooter pieces on and I run a full health build (need to find unyielding or whichever armor it is). I do have scaly skin mutation which helps a good bit I’m sure though
---
If you have the plans the purveyor has a chance to roll them. Same with events that were recently changed to the purveyor’s loot pool (such as Scorched Earth and ACP)
---
Living critters cause the meter to drop, although depositing their guts will raise the meter. Assuming people get on the spits and drums, it would be easily completed within a few minutes with no critters.
---
I only use it for the the queen fight cause im all ways over weight and you can still move decently with it on. Plus with blocker on you can just tank damage and sit spraying her head lol 😆
---
There's 3 ore nodes just outside of Foundation.
---
Between one of the monorail supports and the stream.
---
Its an easy to access, and next to a place people goto daily to give Ward the stuff he loses daily.
---
So I'm level 800 now, played since beta.  I have played the PTS heavily.  Right now,  DPS is the only thing that matters and the highest DPS weapon is the LMG.  I have a BE15r LMG, and it's great, it really is.  Even on the PTS it destroys everything.  It's a great weapon, but I also like rifles and many other people do.
---
When the new patch goes live, I'll be able to max out all legendary perks and with that I'll be able to max out my STR PER LCK and AGI.  I'll basically have access to any build I want whenever I want.
---
It's not a matter of build or weapons, I have all the best weapons and even the ones you're suggesting are garbage tier weapons.  If you can kill an enemy by yourself faster than a group of 8 people including yourself, there's a problem.  I have killed the queen in 20 seconds by myself, yet it takes several minutes in a team.  I'm not saying the 20 seconds is balanced at all, but how it is right now is counter productive.
---
Main way event finishes quickly is all critters killed and guts turned in when 6 people are on spits/drums
---
I think I got lucky and had good timing. Scorched earth just ended so I bet people saw it almost immediately and just fast travelled to it. I was the lowest level at 75. I didn’t feel bad since it was my card lol. I ended up dying twice and got revived once so I felt for being entirely unprepared went ok.
---
It doesn't seem to drop as much as the cursed shovel or harpoon gun. It's a great melee weapon, I carry it as my backup even when I'm heavy gunning so I'm not surprised people aren't letting go of it easily.
---
Ultracite gatling is green laser, higher heavy gunner dps than regular red gatling laser
---
I would love that. I love exploring and have recently been brave enough to explore the bog more. But now...my character wishes to see the sea.
---
That's exactly why it would benefit from having no critters. Living critters pull the meter down. Having no critters would mean the meter could only go up. 3 people on the spits or drums will give a meter over 50% to start the event. Keep going during the event and you'll finish with plenty of time to spare.
---
That's the plan!
---
You can get them from the Grafton Station vendor as well now. I happened to see them in the pool of plans when I was making my rounds selling.
---
1250 if you use an EW Bobblehead.
---
Its like a side quest of its own. Helping out low level players is fun and must be done. High level players love doing this( myself included). The game is pretty challenging in the beginning so getting help and tips is always very good for the new player.
---
So it’s a random chance to find one on a bot vendor in different lobbies?
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=4d74a7b&amp;d=sf2s00pd2pk2pp2pl2p00e00eu0ej4ce0c62ir2ic3am2an2a30la2l71lt2lu2ii0ik0&amp;m=51c29fba
---
Yep, and if you rename them with a '!' or a 1, 2, '.' or something to that effect at the beginning, they'll be at the top of your sort, so you can find them quick. "!Amazing"
---
This is by design. Allows players to get a new server right away instead of waiting a long time for it to expire first if they want to swap servers. As for the crashing, that sucks dude.
---
Ikr, got a BSS+1STR pickaxe, named it 'Divine Axe Rhitta'
---
I managed to bring Earl down when I ended up in the fight with just two level 20s and myself. I felt bad for not even trying to Stim them, but I needed all 20 I had on me to get through it. It paid off for them though. Cost me about 5k 50 Cal... But it's nice to know I can carry the event if need be.
---
If people are finishing it that easily they clearly had some OP gear
---
All of my PA is configured for Targeting HUD, Calibrated shocks, Motion assist servos (Torso), optimized bracers, and hydraulic bracers.
---
Fro weight consideration, When I need PA, I’m usually in Excavator.
---
You're assuming that the average critter is turned in instead of just killed and that they live for less than 25 seconds. 
---
I'd estimate that maybe 25% of critters get turned in, which means that they'd need to be alive for about 8 seconds or less.
---
Thanks. Yeah, plenty of tips on YouTube. Good luck man look forward to seeing your camps
---
Did not realize this. No wonder my dumb shit gets almost nothing lol
---
I'd just be happy with a way to purchase more character slots.  The rep grind at least gives you something to do, but all Atom shop items are bound to the account (along with dlc stuff), so even if you have a 2nd copy, your locked out of all the skins and CAMP stuff.
---
Your crappy title.
---
I'd like to imagine that they'll address that issue. Didn't they fix the complaints about that greenhouse dome after its initial release?
---
Just inspect the power armor chassis and rename it
---
The events you played went bad than. Any I played finished within 2 minutes of the end of the waiting period
---
I use my limb dmg mini for Earle. I don’t know if this is a thing but it seems like he has so much just dangling there that a lot of hits are going to be limb. Seems to work so far
---
Best, or best for your character and playstyle?  
---
Might be two completely different answers.
---
Inb4betheadapatchesthis
---
Now go make them super close-ups, forget about making them, and let those pop up for loading screens.
---
I honestly feel a lot of that gold stuff is garbage. I keep buying the plans so I don't waste a days gold but stopped learning them so they don't dilute the drop pool. The SS armor is the best but I'm fine with my Scout armor, as that RNG on modules sucks. Here's hoping the Brotherhood brings a commando weapon to use the gold on.
---
Shame man but no worries when I get near max caps I buy 5 cards to keep me losing out when vendor sales happen.
---
Its a great place be 🙂
---
Then again it never specified that it would only work with power armor and it literally says that it’s doubled
---
Yep. The research, testing the perks, see the results, try everything again.
---
Well it doesn’t even have to relate to lore as they already said some of the items aren’t cannon.
---
This. I got five characters at level 120 as a minimum each, and on playing through with my stealth commando gunner I went down the raider path and skipped foundation entirely for wastelanders, locking me out from the Stealth Suit. Want to buy it? Ridiculous bullion grind. Helmet and suit are separate. 
---
It was then that I realized none of my friends played anymore and I had done everything there was to do in the game five times over. I wasn't about to grind the same events over and over and over for an aesthetic.
---
I'm just use like a sneak sniper build
---
I’ve noticed a lot of workshops throw a defend event within a minute or two of capturing them.  
---
Given there are score challenges for completing an event, perhaps said players are waiting to see if a defend event pops up....
---
... make it two weeks and scale the event based on the number of participants or something,  anything to make it so I have time for more than one 20 second event.
---
I thought the cursed pickaxe had locked modifiers? Mine is bloodied +PA damage, weightless.
---
I named it "And My Axe".
---
I requested something like this months ago, but instead locked the legendary version of the plan behind one of the 3 gold vendors.  That way the devs would have 2 different plan ids, 1 regular, and 1 legendary.  
---
My idea was also to put pistols, shotguns and hunting rifles in Foundations.  Assault rifles,  some heavy weapons, and Machine-guns in Crater, and everything else + new weapons from DLCs at the Gold Vault Vendor.
---
Yeah. If I remember correctly, there was backlash over the riot armor given to Fallout 1st players.
---
Thank you for confirming.
---
It does. But it so closesly resembles the NCR Ranger armor that several fans were upset about it.
---
Be careful how much you do this. If you get more than 10K of an item in 24 hours you get flagged. More than 15K and it’s an immediate ban.
---
Simple answer: No
---
Longer answer: Nope
---
Yeah I can see why. I’m pretty sure a PD wouldn’t wear a coat to a riot.
---
76 was not a control vault. In a loose sense in that there were no internal experiments, sure, but the mission was always to secure the missile silos.
---
Thanks that’s good to know. I always wear the full set but I read it here someone said he only has two arms and gets the same benefit.
---
Much less a duster commonly used in hot and arid climates, like California.
---
M'lady doth my katana impress you?
---
You haven’t  bought enough copies of Skyrim. You use them like phone books or matchbooks for support and stability.
---
"White power winter sports"
---
Lol
---
I would not even consider a new character or playing one of the characters I made in the past because of this.  Now that I have a jet pack, I can't play without one, and there's zero change I do that joyless grind again.
---
Got in there again but I was the highest level (82) and I still melted him. I'm a big guns build and I have a pretty nasty 2 shot/+50%limb damage/+DR when aiming Gatling Laser that seems to do the trick
---
I loot a ton of wendigo teeth from Collosal problem and that has built up to a sizable amount of acid
---
How about having cores that guns and pa use. I've got 20 fusion but for some reason my pa is empty. Shows 20 but I'm still doing the baywatch walk and firing the laser gat. I know in the inventory you'll have 1 seperate for pa ect but now I don't know when I'm going to run out of juice
---
Would love to be part of this but I am also on Xbox.  May his spirit fly freely throughout the universe until it find a new home among the stars.
---
Maybe season 2 or 3 there's a core recycler?
---
Rechargeable fusion cores. Make them very expensive to craft, with maybe 50-75% of the capacity of a normal fusion core, but once depleted you can bring them back to a charging stand at your base and plug them in to recharge. I'd use them.
---
Good idea!
---
Does this work for all of the people in the event or just the people in your team?
---
Did it my first time yesterday just two other people and me, it wasn't so bad. I read it was much more difficult that the SBQ and that is not true.   
---
Combined levels was nearly 1000 between the 3 of us though.
---
That and slowing the frame rate right down
---
Yea thats a bugged/magic weapon, hence why it was so easy for you.
---
Ok
---
I also have xbox
---
Yes, I just meant to say I have a God roll axe.
---
I'd join, but I'm on xbox. I'll pour out some nukashine for him though.
---
This is not correct. Intelligence doesn't affect learn chance for scrapping mods
---
I know, the stuff they worry about.  They didn’t want you getting a extra radaway and a pipe pistol.
---
Don't waste drugs or anything to boost INT like people are telling you. Nothing affects scrapping learn chance
---
I have Xbox too
---
Can I have your scrap and fuel?
---
Absolute legend
---
Not many companies will ban a player as soon as they get a report.  It makes more sense to wait and get a bunch in one wave.  This way the hack makers don't knowing exactly what from their program got picked up and banned.  It makes their work harder and companies get more cheaters this way.
---
Say a program gives you a bunch of different cheats to use.  Joe buys the cheat program and only uses one cheat.  Joe gets banned and goes to the forums where he bought the program and tells them he was using the fly cheat.  Now the Cheat developer knows to change how the flying cheat works or to ditch it.  Meanwhile the program is fine and others will have no issue with using it.
---
Now if Bethesda just gets a ton of reports and sits on them awhile (while hopefully investigating them) and ban everyone in one big wave, the cheat developer has no clue what exactly in his program was detected.  He/she now has to start over.
---
Why is it bugged/magic? Actual question
---
Id like to see it go this route as well. Crafting Secret Services gears been pretty nice. The RNG still sucks and the scrip cap makes it annoying but it at least improves the odds slightly in that I'm getting a specific piece.  
---
100% in favor of being able to use modules on craftable weapons. Should change it to 1 module per star too. Not just a random 1 through 3 stars per module.
---
So you received the game for free last weekend?
---
I've heard that it's caused when people do things like stand on the fence at V9 or stand on top of their tents while they have aggro on the Queen.  It's supposedly because the game can't find a path for her to get to her target, so she's just takes off again.  Any time her target was actually on the ground tanking her she doesn't fly off.
---
It's better in raw stats, but the trade-off is stat bonuses from underarmor/backpacks and up to 15 effects from legendary armor. For the end-game, there's hardly even a comparison to make there. As others said, the only benefit that still remains is the innate radiation reduction per piece
---
Peculiarly, some of the human corpses can be looted. But anything other than that? Good luck.
---
At least you can narrow it down to specific limbs though. Imagine just rolling 3 star armor and the Rusty Pick. You'd likely never get a matching unyeilding set.
---
Well, you need meat week to be in a low level, safe, un-nukable area or there will be problems. But your idea definitely has merit. I'd say have Grahm permanently take it over and stay there when its not meat week. Have the sign changed to say "Grahm Meat House".
---
"Grahm find old meat house, kill dumb super mutants who ruined good meat house and shoot human friends. Now live here with Chally and have meat cook all day! Chally love garden!"
---
So a few cheaters made you quit?
---
Also "one of the first players". I hear this so many times
---
It's as common as a fart nowadays.
---
I call bullshit.
---
They should really do some armor-Stat and weapon dmg output fixes as well as damage caps for each weapon type and not just an overall damage cap.
---
Weapons with a fire rate 200 or more with the legendary effects of:   bash damage, limb damage, 33 hit chance, junkies ,and instagating (may be missing a couple effects) have bug that overloads damage calculations and cause the game to wig out and apply a crazy amount of damage if you are continually firing at an enemy. Heavy guns are the best/easiest for this since they have large capacities.
---
Your gun is also two shot so it effectively doubles your fire rate, making it even easier to cause the bug. 
---
Shotguns with same effecrs also become magic weapons when used in vats, does not trigger outside of vats for shotguns though.
---
Equiping a 15% less damage while blocking armor peice also triggers the "magic" effect with shotguns.
---
Edit:  not sure why people are down voting you for asking a question. You obviously didnt know it was a thing.
---
Just like all Beth nerfs, nuke it dead.
---
If your on PS4 and above level 50 I can help with that.
---
When [THIS](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fallout/images/d/d9/Fo4Cage_Amor.png)?
---
And that makes sense. What doesn't make sense is that you can find power armors out in the middle of a field. And you can be level 1 and use the frame without training at all.
---
There should be an epic quest with the brotherhood or the enclave, raiders or whatever where you learn how to use it and they give you one as a reward. Finding power armors in barns is not the right way of getting the most iconic piece of equipment in the series.
---
I've brought this up in the past with fusion cores as well but will raise this again.
---
Gauss shotguns are very worth it.
---
Gauss miniguns are worth it, but wow, do they chow down on ammo.  Still, no problem face-tanking the Imposter Sheepsquatch with a Vampire's Gauss Minigun, while the ammo lasts anyway.
---
There is a default vanilla pool you already know, while some have been added only a few require plans to drop. The fixer being a good example.

This made me giggle a little too much! 🤣
---
My favorite thing to do is drop off “care packages” for new players. A few stims, rad away, a bit of ammo, water, and a plan or 2. When you can spare it!
---
This is one of my money making secrets. So many people don’t know you can buy the chest, arms, and legs for under 100c each from two vendors in grafton. They sell for a ton in player vending because not everyone knows this. I can regularly sell the arms and legs for 450c each, and the chest for 750c. Same with the military and nuka cola quantum x-01 skins and t-51 nuka cola skin. Easy to get for cheap or by server hopping, and they sell for a lot.
---
It's so much easier to make ammo for when it's Ultracite. It pops 180 each time. And it hits harder on everything especially the queen.
---
I understand the frustration this game brings and I feel the same way sometimes. Announcing you’re leaving doesn’t really do anything. Not trying to be rude, even though it may seem I’m coming off this way, but just as you feel about cheaters I feel the same way about people announcing their leaving. Just uninstall and be on your way. I hope you got some enjoyment out of this game at least! Best of luck elsewhere friend!
---
People say you can get all rewards before finishing vault raid, but I am not getting gold or treasury notes. What am I doing wrong?
---
Go figure, that explains a lot haha
---
Well thanks for the info!
---
power armor uses emptier cores first, it's stupid that the gatling laser never did.
---
seriously this is such a great idea!!!!
---
Yes, it does
---
Pls Noooooo. This Change would affect super Dupper, for shure.
---
God, for the first time, just seeing an anime reference is just refreshing. And yes... praise the Sun god himself Escanor
---
Not sure if it was a different spot or not, but last time I saw an AFKer I managed to get some Wendigos to come beat up on me next to him.  This had the convenient side effect of killing him.
---
Because of course they do.
---
I managed to find an explosive bloodied lever action once, anything is possible.
---
I still can't find a full set so this didnt work lol
---
Is it possible to learn this power?
---
Nice, good to know
---
I'm sorry but no. I didn't come here to start an argument. I commented to correct the misinformation that is being spread. My own research says no, dataminers say no and the game files say no. INT does not increase the learn chance for scrap learn mods.
---
Hopefully just role-playing but could also be another one of those kids whose parents use video games to babysit their kids instead of actually parenting them, leaving the adults they run into to be the ones to teach them life's lessons.
---
They should just make the chassis w/ random pieces have a chance to spawn for each player that comes through like bobble heads, and it would be leveled to whoever it spawned in for
---
The one about reviving a player while drowning?  Try that in rainy weather.
---
This is exactly why I switched to the plasma caster except against SBQ. Those cores are efficient as far as ammo goes, but when you get partials, it really slows your DPS down and adds a lot of unnecessary weight
---
so if i just do ever thing i can do you think it can be done? ( boost like rest and joining quest teams) also do you know what date  the run will end on?
---
I agree team effort works best.  I am lvl 300 something and go in with J fixers/handmades and J shotguns.  I get my tags in earl then I do crowd control and revive downed player as much as possible.  When there is no crowd control I run up to earl with a jlimb 25 combat shotgun and tea off on him and the run away.  Rinse repeat!
---
It's the reason I only play through these games with one character and try to do everything possible.  I get the market aspect, and using mules, etc.  Just not for me.  Since launch, I enjoyed the hell out of this title for a solid year and a half (with the wastelanders DLC giving it new life).  It's always a bit sad when there's nothing left to do... but the beautiful thing about gaming is that there is always a new adventure in a new title too.  :)
---
This is the way.
---
If you're on Xbox i can shoot you one. I've gotten one nearly every run.
---
They rotate in to the Atom Shop. Must not be there this week though.
---
Just got the caster myself. Feels a bit weak, but I keep hearing its not. Then again, mine is an executioners. Hoping for better rolls today.
---
That sir is the way to distribute justice!  Hats off to you!
---
?
---
LOL, of course, the one thing I need.
---
I actually solved my stimpak problem. The Chinese Communist collectron had a setting where it will collect broken weapons and blood packs. I take those and make stim paks using the chemist perk and super duper, and end up with a bunch. I had that collection since it came out and didn't figure out the blood pack thing until someone else mentioned it on this board.
---
You have every right not too :)
---
You expected Bethesda to be working on the weekend to answer your question?  You're a bit entitled aren't you?
---
the longer you let it go and the more robots pile up - the more lag. 
---
works best when you have a group who know how to run it - get on the pylons asap and let the heavy hitters go to work.
---
Vanguards.
---
Unyielding is the opposite :)
---
There was a brown one for free in atom shop for each power armor a new one every day a while ago idk if it’s still possible to get
---
Fireproof / Dense doesn't work with Explosive Legacy weapons unfortunately.
---
Was contemplating replacing my bloodied shepherd's crook with one. Gave it a whirl and it certainly does more damage so should be the better choice. However, like producer the Bruce Dickinson, I felt in needs more cowbell.
---
All i want is my imposter sheepsquatch outfit back.   It just doesn't drop anymore. 
---
Once upon a time had like 10...- sold off a bunch, gave away a few for free, and the one I kept got stolen during the stash/punch bowl glitch.
---
I've done the event probably 15 times since, and nada :\
---
Easily. 4 lunchboxes, 30+ int, choose your xp and int food of choice, building team, and well rested can net more if you tag everything (I use TS tesla with no damage)
---
As well as Plasma Cores too.
---
Bit of unsolicited advice, use paragraphs. If you actually make it easy to read, people might actually read it.
---
If you can't be bothered to make it readable, how can you expect anyone to bother reading it?
---
Low lvl and 2 words.
---
Deathclaw island.
---
Time to rebuild stars using the undulating flesh of Scorched!
---
How do you overcharge cores?
---
I'd agree with that. I could see not wanting *all* plans to be account-wide, but allowing it for the gold bullion plans would make the grind hurt less, and, heck, even make it more rewarding.
---
Technically vanguard and bolstering are opposites. Nothing is opposite to unyielding
---
This worked first time on xbox, I'd tried it about 3 or 4 times before discovering this fix, closed all doors, read all documents then analysed before putting the fuse in
---
Yep it does and is infuriating!
---
Just go to events! 
---
Encrypid,,, loads of people go down
---
I’ve not done ACP without 2 or 3 needing reviving 
---
I even got one of mine in the swarm or suitors event.
---
yep.  can't get this out of my head.  it's a good tune, but i have this faint memory of having enjoyed it in a 'previous life', it was so long ago
---
thanks again !
---
Between meat week and this event I have 1k treasury notes. No clue what to do with all these anymore
---
Acid deposit CAMP person here. It's not that bad. Usually can place within 2-3 tries.
---
That's the right thing to do as a higher level.
---
Always nice to hear these people doing this.
---
Yup, this is why I won't even touch a new character. Made one, leveled to 10, then was crushed under the weight of the impending deluge of repetitive grinding. Promptly deleted the character and decided that 76 is one of those "single-character" kind of RPGs.
---
Bask in the sunshine! For he is the one!
---
That cave made quit the first time I played, at release. Fucking level locks for the weapons made me mad pissed.
---
That's what I like to do too!!!
---
I thought launching a nuke at level 45 solo was gonna be difficult, but the assaultrons were the hardest part. Was still unprepared tho, ran low on ammo.
---
Okay thanks, I guess I'll try that
---
I've already put some through the machine. Oops!
---
I’m over seeing these “Goodbye 76” posts. Like we don’t care. I’ll give your diploma but make sure to wave at the crowd.
---
This reminds when of something that happened to me a looooong time ago (this was like right after it came out of Beta) I was wondering around as a level 8 found this this really nice girl that I played with for a few hours she helped me a lot taught me a lot about the game gave me quite a few things helped me level a bit but we just all around had a great time but then my internet died and I couldnt remember her PSN so that friendship ended early:( but that’s just one of the many nice experiences I’ve had in this game but I sited that one because that had the most impact on me and made me kinda go that’s how I’m gonna be even when I hit level 100 I’m gonna help out the new players and I have to this day being almost level 300
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=OMvyhaE8V5k
---
That’s the video I used. It helped my friend get the trophy too. We only went to the pleasant valley area and served hopped that location rather than going all over like in the video. So just check the pleasant valley spots as seen in the vid. Good luck
---
That's OK if you are enjoying the game you will do by this time next week! For now just concentrate on having fun and collecting everything that isn't bolted down.
---
Once you work out your style of play you will end up with an excess of stuff you don't need that you can give away as you please 😁
---
You know when I was a new, green player, and I'd read about "crafting legendarys in the end game", I always assumed this is what it meant.
---
Little did I know that it was only a handful of items behind a gold wall,  that can't be traded and have very little value to me with my character build.
---
Sad times.
---
Unless they introduce more story quests with each rank up for factions i don't really see the point in forcing a faction grind on multiple characters.
---
It's literally the same quest from ward every day just a different location, with the same exact dialog choices.
---
They used too many single player principles in making a game that is supposed to be played EVERY DAY. The worst part is they don't even do them as well as previous games.
---
In normal fallout games they even have more replay-ability even though it's the same quests.
---
They have multiple choices and pathways for quests and secrets and entire dungeon skips like in fallout 3 through various speech checks and fore-knowledge.
---
Fallout 76 doesn't even really do that for any of these faction quests that they want you to repeat....EVERYDAY. It's all stale and predictable and nothing to discover.
---
They needed like 20 quests per factions with multiple ways to beat them, not 1 for settlers and 4 for raiders that play the same exact way every-time.
---
Yes. Yes, I did which is one big reason I went Vamp Hvy. It keeps me in much more ammo and I heal constantly. That and Batteries Included I can keep a good stock for my UGL and get to the fighting more than the ammo making. I may not do as much damage as Bloodied/junkies but I’m far tankier and usually last longer. However I deal with more asshats griefing at workshops as the trade off.  If there was cheaper way of making Fusion Cores I would be all for it.
---
I'm on Xbox (HPD99). However, you have my condolences. I'm sure your friend was a very wonderful &amp; beautiful person. May they rest in peace.
---
It essentially has 2 swing speed buffs
---
I got that pickaxe skin in the atomic shop right now, and it also unlocked one that has a shark mouth painted on the blade with the sharp mod. It looks amazing.
---
What a waste! As the OP said, it's a sleeper weapon, and the only guaranteed Bloodied Slugger weapon in the game. Not to mention its very low drop chance.
---
It's valuable (and imo, more valuable than the mask, since the pickaxe is actually a practical item).
---
This is how I remember it, yes. Early on PA was almost impossible to find because people were cleaning out servers for the materials.
---
Well stimpaks are relatively easy to get, Wendigos can even drop a couple at the time. If you are on a Bloodied build, you are just better dilute them, with the same perk cards. It produces 4 diluted stimpaks at a time. The main issue is that it takes clean water...
---
But in general, if you have the water, it is just better to dilute them. Like this spaming the stimpak button is way lost costy. All you need is its heal over time to mitigate the dmg taken.
---
thanks for the help
---
Got a two shot reduced weight. Tesla rifle from the scorchbeast queen. Love it. Wish the ammo capacity was higher than fucking 15 tho :/
---
I’m predicting they’re gonna bring back the R91 AR from fallout 3. On several of the illustrations for Fallout 76 such as the message of the day you can see Vault Boy wielding one, plus it was the BoS’s go-to weapon in F3
---
Does anyone have a link to a good explanation of the system ? When I looked on the site it showed “latest updates” but not actual breakdown.
---
Oh, so *that's* why there was a tent there! I noticed it and thought it was a weird place to put one but since I don't know that much about the game I figured there was a reason I didn't know. And now I do. Thanks!
---
I would encourage you to check out r/fo76filthycasuals -- I think you'll fit right in!
---
It’s a weird holdover from early MMOs. It’s basically a shortened version of ‘car*toon* character’, and usually used to create some separation between player and character.  It shows that the character isn’t important, and just another tool.  Other people picked it up as a shorthand reference, and it’s stuck around a bit. 
---
I prefer using terms like ‘character’ or ‘main’ or ‘alt’. Some people dislike the use of the word ‘toon’, but it works just as well.
---
There was a great spot a little south east of the monongah mine that had 2 average sized pre-built structures. It had a railway system run into a collapsed pathway into the mountain and it was well secluded and high in altitude. I had it there for a while until ACP came along and made it uninhabitable.
---
Next patch adds these. Season 2 rewards and ATX purchases
---
Go to lucky hole mine with excavator power armor and mine all the lead ore, about 400. Then go to the floodied trainyard and kill the 6 snallygasters, then to tenagra town inside the tree and kill the cave crickets, then to toxic Larry's meat shack? (I can't remember the exact name) and kill 3 more snallygasters.  You'll get a bunch of acid, around 100.  You'll need 400 acid total, so you'll have to do it a few times.  Then go to a chemistry workbench.  Under smelting you can turn the lead ore into regular lead.  It's 2:5, so 400 results in 1000 lead scrap.  Way more than any barbell you scrap.
---
i noticed that too. each time i went into the event, it was like everyone hesitated before firing. as soon as i seen Earle i just said "screw it" and just unloading my .50 cal into him, then everyone else would join in.
---
Keep one and stash the rest
---
To be technical... 19.9% has the best reduction, not 20%. :)
---
Use multiple chassis's. You can rename them. If you put pieces on one it only weighs ten pounds total.
---
I only made it to level 46 :( I gave up
---
Sneak 3 is redundant with that set up
---
Sorry c\_sans, but bugs like this are better out in the open vs hoarded by those in the know. Here's the info I received upon asking for a description of the bug.
---
" Find a node which usually gives ore, and you'll notice it's an ultracite  one instead of whatever it's supposed to be. Collect the ore and then  keep trying to collect it after receiving the ore. If you look around  scorched will have spawned nearby. Kill them and repeat this as many  times as you want. "
---
It's true. I was obsessed with junk (I still am but now I have the scrapbox) so I built my CAMP near some places with PA for junk. Always the same routine. Scrap the pieces, then scrap the chasis.
---
40%
---
Except... they’re nerfing energy heavy weapons by 80%.
---
God yes.
---
Myth
---
Yep,what the above poster said...
---
I have every set aside from the T-65,&amp; I named em all somethin like a t-51,a t-45,a raider...
---
So that they’re all at the top of my list,&amp; grouped right together.Popped a fusion core in each one,so that isn’t eating up stash space either,&amp; that way they’re all ready to rock n roll
---
Well I had my 5 toons finished before wastelanders so it wasn’t to bad.  
---
Got bored with wastelanders DLC on the 3rd play through but finished it with all 5.  Different routes. 
---
Now the gold/rep grind is a pain in the ass.   I basically gave up on the rep grind early on.  I just stick to the gold grind.
---
I'm not really talking about someone's opinion.  It's a fact that bloodied adds the most damage to a gun, (besides instigating), and I'm pretty sure that will still be the same afterwards.  Sso if your gun is strong now, it will still be strong, but everything in general will be weaker.  But it's really not that bad.
---
It was surprisingly easy.
---
I mean ... yeah ... bullet sponge ... and I can imagine even worse if you're using a bullet-hose. Sneak certainly helps / helped me.
---
Twice as fast. Faster if you hit adjacent enemies with splash. All weapons will work like this
---
Especially during a time like this when you're already *working* from home it's not unreasonable that they have some time away from their job.
---
Just did it during the legendary run, up to neighborly with both factions.
---
It is worth it simply because the shotgun build is a lot of fun.
---
I’ll finish getting my SS Armour tomorrow, got 13 possum badges in a weekend as I knew it was coming and was prepared.
---
Didn’t start the main quests until level 101 :) then they were really easy
---
Ah.  I always just wear the full set for the carry weight bonus.
---
i think they purposely capped how many people can fight Earle at once in order to make it seem more difficult than a SBQ. i mean ACP is capped at 8 people and usually am in a group of 6 when doing the event and found it rough. i did a SBQ fight shortly afterwards and it almost seemed like a walk in the park, but i guess that is the case when you have like 15 or 20 people with you
---
but not as fast as a explo laserrifle or flamer?
---
Crushing my enemies, to see them driven before me and hearing the lamentations of food builds
---
I was surprised, I actually ran into some players who saw me half naked and did not even kill me. They kind of realized I was not a threat and a low level and just ran off.  That kind of restored some hope in humanity in me, as I am not even sure I would done the same if it would have been reversed. :)
---
There are a couple things you have to watch out for though.  Earle's got this stomp that, in some Bloodied cases, is an instant kill if Serendipity and other things don't proc.  It's similar to the Queen's wing attack, only without much of a wind-up.  The other is that Earle can seemingly spray the area around him with that lava spit, which melts you easily if you don't realize that's what's going on.
---
The most irritating thing is that the lava spit, in general, doesn't really seem to obey verticality.  So you'll get into situations where the spit lands above you,like on the structure in the middle of the room where you don't see it, but it's casting damage downward.
---
I always thought since the beginning of the game, that there would be more organization with stuff like that. Like, most structures and pieces should have the metal, wood, junk, and concrete variants. Why there even isn’t by now is beyond me.
---
Certainly worth a shot.  Something that I've experienced is really wanting more than 15 in one special.  To have even just 18 instead would be huge.  I can't imagine what 9 extra points would be like.
---
Same, can't beat that! Very handy for Junk/Ammo runs!
---
Probably due to prefix (bloodied vs executioners) . But that swing speed is just fun
---
I'd argue the exact opposite: do NOT fire up artillery. On the glitched event, it causes lag/fps issues (on console at least), and doesn't even help much. Plus it's loud, which is annoying. Unless you're soloing the event, you don't need the "help" it provides (and maybe not even then).
---
Agree on the recon!
---
It's not 
---
It has this gross metallic taste that you can litterally feel inside your tongue
---
Just picking them up is what matters. The trophy description is misleading as consuming them does nothing towards the achievement.
---
What’s yer platform?
---
I could probably pop on store my junk &amp; jump off of an insanely high object for ya...
---
I CAMP right under that huge bridge actually,so it’d be easy to login,stash,&amp; crash.....
---
Edit:or does it need to be in water?
---
Cause I guess I’d have to find a high object near water,if so
---
Yeah, just good in general.  My base carry weight now is 485, which I boost up to 560 with pepperoni roles that I make.
---
Your time will come young padawan, soon you’ll be the level 300 one shotting the ghouls
---
I didn't say that they were, just as far as I was aware.
---
Thanks, I am on PS4
---
Any particular spawn points?
---
Yeah, that works too.
---
I'd be cautious about these going into the upcoming rebalance.  I played Riflemen toons before PTS, and they both emerged as Commandos, because between the inability to reliably one-shot enemies, the low damage rate of things like the Lever Action Rifle, and their affinity for enemy swarms, you're going to get overrun pretty easily in the boss events and Daily Ops.  The overworld, not so much.  But still, since your guns can only be one or the other, it behooves you to run Commando so you have that option when you need it.
---
It's been brought up numerous times, but who knows if they will actually listen.
---
I never see anybody at my acid camp spot. 
---
It's really close to the workshop with all the acid too
---
I totally want to try this on my unarmed melee - full set of thorn, bloody deathclaw gauntlet w/ more PA damage.
---
Afk
---
Rocksy's quest, Wren's quest, Davenport's daily photo quest, and there are more I can't remember.
---
I imagine that does look pretty cool. Personally I'd still take the crook or cursed shovel purely for the amusement factor. I love the sound the shovel makes. The wiffle bat is another good one.
---
You don't even need to run 2 at the same time to use a mule.
---
I’m level 38 not that good. I don’t have a lot of friends to play with
---
No, I want something for excavator.
---
I always got the vibe BOS was energy first ballistic second. I expect a Gatling laser if I was a betting man.
---
Those fire more than 1 projectile, usually.
---
It's -1 condition per hit marker
---
Like, I don't want to kneecap anyone, but if someone is doing many many times more damage than everyone else, they can take a brake and let others help.
---
I use T-65 power armor with \*\*\*blocker, \*\*\*dodgy, and emergency protocols.
---
Earl's kick TICKLES. He can kick me in the face all day and I won't die.
---
The only thing that hurts me is the lava spit (but I have fireproof 3, so not too bad), and the tick blood tequila just heals that up every time I hit him. I can stand in it and as long as I keep hitting, it can't kill me. The only time I have a problem is when the wendigos stun me inside the lava spit. And usually I survive and stimpack at the last second.
---
I guess you already know it, but won't hurt if posted one more time - if you or a friend has 1st you can finish it on a 'fresh' private server.
---
I don’t mind doing those for multiple characters. There’s a lot of variety and it takes you all over the place. The rep/gold grind is just unbearable.
---
Pls don’t give them ideas lol
---
Oh, thanks for warning
---
I already have X-01 power armor.  I like the carry weight and the extra mining ability.  I know I could just switch when I get over encumbered, but they perform essentially the same in terms of defense.
---
It's being changed because the multiplicative calculation causes performance drops when many buffs are simultaneously active. It's also being changed so they can tune damage values with run off effects.
---
This has nothing to do with bloodied builds.
---
Be careful, his kick can one shot non-power armored bloodied builds if you aren't lucky.
---
Imagine you’re in the fire fight of your life, you need to reload your gatling laser and the game decides to chuck a core in there that has 12 shots left in it. That’s not a good idea prioritising the lower charged cores.
---
They do it because launching a nuke while Monongah is nuked will retrigger ACP. There's a short window to get in, so you need to be fast
---
raiders daily at Crater. 
---
davenport (spy on foundation). 
---
that person who loved mirelurk meat (queen meat is best i think)
---
running around like a headless chicken looking for random events and help the raiders kill the opposition. (gives a tiny small minuscule amount of raider exp)
---
Turn in queen mirelurk meat at the raider camp on the east side of the map on the water.
---
Dangit!
---
I’m Xbox...
---
Not an advertisement by any means,but you could check wit the folks at r/PKOA...
---
As a majority of them are PS4 &amp; literally live too help other players...
---
Might be worth a shot anyhow?!?!
---
Nah, its just me in my chinese stealth armor.
---
Oh gosh please keep sets on their own chassis and rename them. Pieces weigh a ton, but only weigh 10lb if they are on a chassis.
---
You are guaranteed a Bss sledge hammer if you choose the 2h chest from the way ward quest
---
I have a question or maybe I am being dumb, but can you favourite your power armour? I always try to but it won't let me.
---
Well, Power Armor makes a big difference, that's for sure.
---
yea the legacy weapons need a nerf. 
---
magic weapons and armor should also be fixed.
---
At that point why use regular armor?
---
Wait for patch 22
---
Neither rain nor snow nor nuclear hellfire...
---
Dammit, now I really want to see this. My father delivered mail. He doesn’t take anything seriously, but he by God made sure people got their mail as quick as possible.
---
One of the things they don't teach you in FO76 Class!
---
I only ever played NW for the score challenges, but even then, twice I ended up on teams with teammates that were cheating.
---
The majority of players are honorable and very cool. Unfortunately, it only takes a few to ruin the game.
---
Thanks for the advice, I am going to try stalking a low level player
---
There a reason why
---
https://youtu.be/9bSZXucTH4A
---
I mean, that's kinda what I said. The literal same thing happens mid fight in some cases, unless you carry a hundred. 
---
And i said this earlier, I don't always expect to run ACP. Its a rush to get there in order to get a full team of 8. So i don't always think about checking. 
---
I'd rather have a few reloads in the beginning than midfight. And if my suggestion happens, then you'll only have to do that once, as the other cores should (probably) be full. Which is MUCH better than what happened to me, having my last 12 cores be basically empty. Ultracite, that I had to craft. 
---
How I ended up like that im not entirely sure.
---
A combination of the reload bug, and having it swap cores when you switch weapons and then back, which is BS.
---
The ski sword is underrated and a game changer, below lvl 50.
---
What I really want is a bloodied crowbar. So I can run around bashing things to death Gordon Freeman style.
---
People just need to do Earle first. The Queen stays up for 30 minutes. I typically go Earle, SBQ and then do a quick sweep of grove for the Lv90 Colossus
---
No fusion cores?
---
Essentially you have 4 new slots, not tied to special or anything.  You have a list of legendary perks.  Any perk can go in any slot.  You level them up with coins you get by scrapping regular perk cards.  2 coins per scrapped perk card.  First level is free, then 50, 100, and 150 to upgrade them.
---
If you are sitting in unclaimed workshop and someone else claims, you still "contest" the workshop but aren't immediately flagged with the red blip. Once they hit you, you get the red blip and are on the menu.
---
Tasty! I find Radant Lager can be pretty handy too!
---
Helping low level players are the only side quests we have left.
---
Fusion cores are so easy to just find though.  I always just take them from power armor.  I don't run out.
---
How much of a damage boost does it give?  Would have to be more than 20% to make the tradeoff worth it.
---
They cant figure out how to climb ladders either.   Lol.
---
Well i know, but legendary power armour would change the meta a lot
---
Also annoying,  but yeah, getting 650 carry weight when you really need ot is nice.
---
Yeah, but it's no good if it gets patched. The point of me removing my comment is so it's not so publicly visible. I should have kept this to myself.
---
Leave cool stuff in the Overseer’s crate at the Overseer’s camp. That’s what I do. It won’t despawn if you leave the server like a dropped package will.
---
Yeah.  It certainly would.  I honestly don't think essentially anyone would use regular armor.  Maybe you could do a compromise and only have 1 star legendary power armor.
---
I murder players indiscriminately.
---
I think it should be like the secret service armor. You can only craft it and you can't trade it
---
Learning all plans again is something I dont want to go through.
---
LMAO. oh man this is all too familiar
---
i was in a general group of people who just wanted to "help" other players. but i was "taking orders" from some dude who sounded like he entering puberty. after not even a month i said screw it and left the group. how can you take someone serious when they sound like Jeremy Freedman.
---
DID YOU KNOW IF YOU STOPPED PLAYING THE GAME AND SUPPORTING THIS TRASH THEY WOULD FIX THE GAME.
---
I see your point .
---
But with my suggestion, assuming most cores are full (ultracite in my case) you would only have to reload a smaller mag one time, initially. Or at the very least, dump one near empty core instead of a bunch. 
---
ACP is a mad rush to get there for a team of 8. I dont always stop to think of dumping my low cores. Id rather one quick reload early than a ton later on.
---
Uh besides the art team designing Santa outfits for the scorched and pulling a jingle bell sound, the holiday event was the laziest implementation in the world. Like probably an hours worth of effort. If it took more than that, woof
---
Oddly, I was at the Sons of Dane camp on the weekend and when I went in one of the trailers I kept seeing the red health bar for a ghoul, but couldn't see the ghoul. I assumed it was maybe outside the trailer and up the road...nope. I looked from many angles and even checked underneath the trailer, it was showing as standing squarely in the middle of the trailer. 
---
I lobbed two grenades in, did damage and got experience for the kill, but there was no body to be found.
---
Maybe ghosts are the new enemies/NPCs they're sneaking in on us?
---
If you have reddit module and PS messages, send the screenshots to a friend, save them and then you can put them up on reddit
---
Or something like the MF breeder from NV.
---
Great for me all the time because I carry so much crap around, mainly because it can't all fit in my stash.
---
There are two possible chassis in the area. I've done this three times and there's always been a chassis in the room.
---
Lately when there are low-level players around I've started using a shotgun and the Enforcer perk to cripple all of the enemies left+right legs so they're stuck in place and can't move while the newbies go around and finish them off.
---
I do the same thing in group events so everyone gets a chance to tag as many as possible for the lot and XP.
---
That is the only thing I'd put real money into this game to purchase
---
Spam your ally with dialogue, back out then you should be able to access the workbench
---
When renaming the chassis put a "-" at the beginning and it will put it at the top of the list to find it easy. Example: -T60, -Raider PA, -PowerArmor01.
---
Ill wait but damn, they couldn't make it work out the gate huh lol
---
Did you know that if everyone stopped playing, they would have zero economic incentive to perform any more work fixing it and instead shut it down?  I swear to God people just don't know how to _think_ anymore.
---
"Brotherhood of Steel Fanclub"
---
Im searching the building for half an hour and couldnt find one where is it exactly. Thanks for replying
---
I find them near Site Charlie quite often.
---
I do the same. I was surprised as when I did this I noticed a level 250 come up behind me and gifted me loads of plans and 50 super stimpacks. I am level 51. They must have seen me gift a level 24 stuff. It really felt so wholesome.
---
It had a heart attack and died mid air.
---
Wait when did they change this? I always launched all 3 after another? Whyyyyyyyyy did they do this
---
&gt; experienced 
---
I think that's what's probably going to sway me into getting about 3 legendary perks that effect SPECIAL.   We have alot of really great regular perk cards that can't be equipped because we simply run out of points.  True, we can only take each up to 15, but we could allocate them to take the most advantage of this when LP's roll out.  In other words, we could take some up to 15 naturally, and then use legendary perks to increase others?   Maybe anyway.
---
Most I hit him for so far is 12k.   Was out of my melee meats =\
---
Ah! HaHa. I don't have that problem, just carry what I need!
---
Competent pvp breathes years of longevity into games
---
There was a level 2 at my camp who I heard over mic was a bit annoyed that he couldn't craft armour due to a lack of leather. So I went into my supply and have him as much as I could with other goodies too. When I went away on my missions. I could see him hanging around my camp building and end the end he leveled up a bit and brought some stuff off me. It was so cool.
---
You can rename the Power Armor frame when it is in your inventory.  That's the closet you can come to favoriting it, AKAIK.
---
I'm having a blast with Wasteland 3! Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty good.
---
Wholesome!! Love to see it.
---
I just craft Gatling Lasers they each generate 1 core. And then scrap them. Way cheaper than the flux option.
---
My buddy told me about this post, my name on ps4 is (LeTHaL_Mistyyy), not sure when I’ll be available but I’ll be up to join this for sure :)
---
Sneak power attack? What weapon?
---
One of the joys of not having pay to win, I mean fallout 1st.
---
Typical BOS flair suggestion. I saw your updates. Have you changed your tune yet?
---
I want to see if we could do it this weekend
---
She looks adorable
---
Yea. Sneak power with unstoppable monster.
---
It's happened to me on PS4.
---
Even without the Scrap Box, don't need to carry so much on me at one time, is it mostly Junk/Scrap?
---
Reeee
---
Nice. I might have to try a sneak attack build on him. Do stealth boys work in power armor? I need the emergency protocols for the chest, so I can't use the stealth boy mod.
---
FR!! I have 2 other characters that I ONLY use for storage and they are both almost full I need like at least 1500-2000 storage to be able to actually be able to have the stuff I need 💀
---
Downstairs in the room with the terminal and two PA stations. There's a PA station in the adjacent room that frequently has a chassis as well. 
---
Those are the only chassis I'm aware of in the building. 
---
Warning: once you start building the PA, take it with you if you leave. There are many stories of people finding partial sets and grabbing them because the builder left the chassis unowned.
---
But I did get banned from that sub the other day, seemingly for no reason. I was barely active, and I never broke any of their rules.
---
I think there is a Liberator flair because it’s kind of a “faction” in the game and the robot represents them. Perhaps instead, there could be a US military faction flair with a Major Gutsy for the icon representation.
---
I want Murgle the cat
---
Upvote from a fellow filthy 😎
---
Ok, I’ll most likely be able to, have already friended you on psn, my condolences
---
I made handrailings before with shelves and advanced power connectors (the tube ones). But yeah, it'd be appreciated.
---
There is none but i have 2 in my stash but i dont have enough caps to fast travel to my camp and fast travel here again
---
Trap camps are the pinnacle of creativity in this game. They take many hours to build and many more to refine.
---
There is a great perk you should check out, it is called 
---
#LIGHT FOOTED
---
I am waiting for that damn white stair to come back into the store. It's annoying my whole house looks great other than a bloody rushy stair.
---
Oh ok.
---
The game doesn’t handle over charged cores properly. I’m my opinion we should be asking the devs to take a look and fix this issue. If the Gatling Lasers and Plasmas handled overcharged cores properly then we wouldn’t have a bunch of depleted cores in our inventory in the first place.
---
Legacy should be removed, most people are just using duped copies of a handful of legacies that were obtained before the patch that removed them from drops.  And anyone who complains or downvotes is a dirty commie.
---
There just has to be a Gutsy flair... Trying to lump in the Gutsies with a faction to avoid having a named Gutsy flair is a typical commie chickenshit manoeuvre!
---
I have a magic weapon and Idk how people do this? I try to do a fair bit of health, move kill spawn and then help out later. Not sure how people do the 45 second stuff.
---
No, they copy paste generic/unrelated response and close the ticket
---
Go to your camp and find the nearest train station. Sell all the miner junk decorating the place for one cap each until you have the right amount.
---
Dickheads
---
I know this thread is a little old but just curious if you knew of any of these places with the bugged ore. I tried a few places in Cranberry but the ore was still gone when I would fast travel back. I know there's places with 7-10 ultracite ore that would spawn maybe 5 scorched a piece but thats it. Nothing repeatable beyond that. 
---
Really trying to find some good places to nuke besides whitesprings for HRF drops. I know it's random but just looking for options. I am so sick of nuking whitesprings. I really liked your suggestion with the repeatable ore/scorched but just couldnt figure it out. 
---
Also, I tried the syringer bloatfly method but it's just way too tedious for a solo player IMO.
---
Ok I will do that. Thanks dor replying.
---
unlink the accounts, then you have 2 copies of the game.
---
The steam copy would become a new account once unlinked.
---
That’s amazing feat for you to be able to do that while she’s mid air and you’re shooting an SMG as heavy build 👍
---
Lmao. I'm at 55. I'm not that bothered really. I'll be happy just getting the ghillie scout armour. I can't wait for the next season though. The rewards look amazing!
---
Cut Pvp content
---
Original style of fallout 3 enclave power armor that’s just regular armor?????
---
How do you unlink them?
---
Some of it is server based lag. I have a couple “magic” weapons but don’t use them because I don’t want to be “that guy”
---
I hope so desperately that it’s real
---
it's not just weapons with 200 or more fire rate. it can trigger it with a .45 SMG, for example. and I remember a guy in the market managed to trigger it with a handmade. it's just that it's a lot harder.
---
apparently it's tied to your framerate so that may be it. and the 10mm is fast enough as it is. are you playing on PC?
---
I'm Level 20. Not new per se but I don't have much time to play (cause of work) - if you're up for it, I would love to do that! I don't know what I could give you as compensation, maybe caps? Maybe we can talk about it?
---
If you know what you doing and can get SQB to land relatively fast, you should allways do SQB first, and at worst, TP to ACP after 4,5 mins
---
The only thing you can do is cancel Fallout 1st and stop buying Atoms. Stop buying official merchandise and other Zenimax titles.
---
If you want to go a step further, actively target Fallout 1st players in game and grief them so hard that they stop playing the game.
---
Xbox one
---
I use them as needed. If we’re shredding I switch to other, still good, slow ROF heavy guns. My mini, lmg and the like are only when the group just isn’t making the damage
---
Shit I would rather this than what happens to me most time. Get stuck with 3 level 20 and under players and don't even get his health half down before the event fails.
---
I agree
---
Technically his dialogue doesn’t matter on the way as it’s just giving you a back ground really of the vault, but if you made it to him standing in the window then there may be something wrong with his character 
---
I would try on a private server, validate game files same even have subtitles turned on so you can see if it’s just the audio files not playing or the actual cues not registering when your player is reaching certain triggers throughout the quest :-)
---
Good luck !
---
/u/Nvgsnpeas

At this point I completely disregard any dates Bethesda gives for upcoming content.  They are completely meaningless.   I have gotten to where  I only think about new content when it drops.  Before that there's really no point.  It's virtually guaranteed  that nothing will be released when Bethesda says that it will.
---
For example, the road map listed Winter 2020 as the release date for Fractured Steel.  Even before COVID, I knew that it would not be released in Winter 2020.
---
You cant know for sure as its server stavility dependant, and PTS arent the most stable ones 
---
From what I tested yesterday, its still working
---
Haha i was in there once with 4 lvl 60 players and just left. I saw a funny story about a level 50 or so in it and everyone was angry. Guy was running around and reviving everyone like hacksaw ridge
---
I want this too. There is no reason to take Night Eyes perk.
---
I feel like this is the second year that I got nothing of value from the fashnacht event
---
The first time I tried the quest there was a frame, but I ran away cause the colonel gutsy ruined me. I came back the next night with a high level friend to help but there wasn’t a frame. Fortunately my friend had a spare so I was able to complete it.
---
Pm me your PSN if you still need a plan, Ill be online in 8 or 9 hours
---
Sorry to be clear. I was running my commando build. I should’ve said that I don’t take chunks of health like that when I run my heavy build.
---
More like 20 if they were first down the mine shaft lol
---
If you can tank the Wendigo's and make sure there's no environmental hazards directly behind you before you start firing it goes pretty smoothly. I wouldn't call it easy, you do have to constantly react to what's happening and take advantage of that pillar in the middle of the instance.. Definitely have to play it more strategically than Scorched Earth in a lot of ways. I did the event 9 times and went 9 for 9 completions. I definitely like this event.
---
Xbox. Even when people jumped in to help (when frame rate issues happen) still was seeing the same damage.
---
I wrote a post about the opposite. I wont retype it all here, but basically got back some stuff that I had traded away. 
---
Shits weird man.
---
Go back your private server BOS cuck
---
Lmao, pretty much.
---
Still good job bruh, since the magic effect requires consistent hit on the same hitbox, it’s very hard to do when she’s wobbling in the air.
---
My guess would be his intercom character is not loading and thus the quest cannot progress
---
Immersion. I like my CAMP to feel realistic. In the real world, there would be a door and a lock.
---
If you’re on Xbox, ~~for only £99.99~~, you can use my private server to finish this quest.
---
Just don't be super aggressive about it, I had two people follow me and my friends for two hours trying to give us stuff, then started killing all the enemies around us without letting us touch them. We were all alts but one, and he doesn't like shortcuts in games so he wanted a pure experience.
---
the feeling of exploration. there may not be a quest that takes me to that interesting building im walking by, but it is interesting-looking so i will check it out anyway. sometimes all i find are enemies. oyher times i find a note saying the writer's dog got kidnapped and he's gonna go get em back. its depressing knowing that he probably (definitely) died, but still cool that there are little environmental stories in places where you have no real reason to go.
---
I often press reload on most of my guns just to make sure they're full. It is annoying when I forget and do it with my laser gatling ending up with three or four cores with less than 100 shots.
---
true
---
Me too.
---
Oh good...they can pull out the really OP bloody builds, try it out against their latest mission to make sure it's a good tough fight and call it a day.
---
Then everyone who doesn't use bloodied cries in despair doing 1-2 points of damage to super bosses.
---
I really hope they try a mix of builds...after seeing them all run bloody builds playing ACP though...
---
I honestly think this is Bethesda intentionally disincentivizing side characters. When the game launched there was a whole tier of players that had 5-10 characters stocked to the gills as mules. Now that you can't trade the gold bullion rewards around between your characters your rewards are yours. Admittedly it sucks that you can't sell to other players when you craft that dope legendary that doesn't fit your build, but it's the best way to prevent people selling shit on eBay. 
---
It's hard to find a comfortable middle ground tho. If all the later rewards are character locked, then eventually higher level players will be at a point of being too high to help. I'm already starting to encounter it, where I'm crafting up plasma casters and gauss minis that I can't do anything but scrip, and at the same time having a hard time finding players with any interest in formerly second tier weapons.
---
You may be right. The ammo usage is whats keeps me from doing it.
---
#I'm so excited for this
---
May I ask what platform? 
---
This is the stuff I like hearing about fallout, people helping each other out instead of "PVP ME BRO".
---
I run a bloodied heavy build and love it. Might use a bloodied Deathclaw gauntlet since I’m going for a Deathclaw-style character sometime
---
Wait they made that a trophy?!?
---
Edit; but yeah use Wikidys farm route, equip Pannipictiowhateverthefuckitscalled and use the force padawan 
---
And good luck with the RNG gods... because my level 377 still hasn’t even got them all 😭
---
looks like a radstorm
---
Ideally, this it what you'd do. But Scorched Earth alert pops up first and sometimes the second one won't display - noobs go to SE and would miss ACP because they don't know about the feature.
---
Some people are assholes
---
that's ok coz i can build a whole bed with 5 cigarettes and 3 tin cans
---
But it wasn’t. I have my camp near Flatwoods and the sky was green when I came there. Idk
---
Amen to that
---
That would be amazing to see the creation of places like Diamond city and good neighbor.
---
only one level to go. see you in hell, legendary run.
---
I am a simple wastelander. I see BOS and I give downvotes.
---
It's "pay to finish" now lol. Not even pay to win.
---
I've made a couple. Well more of a maze and a suicide booth. I did it because I enjoy building and get bored making traditional homes.
---
Would you like to? I’m getting on in about ten minutes.
---
Seneca Rocks?
---
The nights were way darker at launch.
---
They just want this game to be Candyland.
---
Maybe on a private server, can't account for randos stunning her in the air or screwing her landing with their hanging around tents or the roof ;) if you go acp first you can judge if someone's gonna burn the queen with what players turn up there whilst acp depends on who got threw into what instance.
---
There are a few unknown magic weapons out there for sure.  I discovered one too, was at the ACP event just over the weekend, just me and one teammate on a private.  Was testing out various weapons all weekend, brought a certain one with me that I thought might work... and yeah, it just works... Melted Mr. Williams - in seconds actually.  And what I just read in the comments is correct, I have had the magic effect happen on guns with less than 160 fire rate (Angry Turtle on youtube says this is the magic # to be above), so I don't know, all I know is that if you see me on Xbox nuking Earle, victory is assured.
---
I leveled a third character to 45 to get ready for Wastelanders. He is still at level 45.
---
The point is to entertain oneself and score some junk. Those trap camps also don't build themselves.
---
PS: I don't have and never had one; I just don't understand why everything has to be cushion soft... It is an irradiated apocalyptic wasteland, for Atom's sake.
---
Make them follow you into watoga. And watch the robots kill them haha
---
It the same shit in every single multiple games , I don’t understand why people in this community make it a big deal.. 
---
My advice is to just lvl up slowly doing daily quest , you have rep in no time
---
Pretty sure they don't
---
PVE nazis on the bgs forums
---
Only if you find a player with the gamer tag Jason Todd and beat them to death in a warehouse lol
---
Yeah i put camp down on the top , just missing an extractor . But you cant have it all lol
---
I didn't even know that we could scrap power armor I got two of them now I could get rid of one of them!! You are a hero
---
I’ve had this happen. It’s when a rad storm pleases by and the sky stays green. It’s a visual glitch.
---
Don't like it leave it's simple let us enjoy what we want to enjoy, just becouse the game isn't up to you dumb ass standards doesn't make it a bad game. If you don't like the game leave, trust me you won't be missed.
---
Rose and her maddening keys and flavors of mayhem quests make me want to slowly melt her down.
---
Because stealing someone else's stuff is just rude.  It doesn't make the game more "realistic" just annoying.
---
Nope
---
Oh ok thanks!
---
Negative
---
Ah. If you are looking for deposits there are a few spots further south of Seneca, between Whitesprings, the train yard and The Top of the World.
---
But lemme know how it goes so I can let’s others know in the future that have the same problem :-)
---
Happens all the time. Strangely, some of them will unlock once the timer goes off for you to escape.
---
FYI, the subreddit search option isn't just for aesthetic purposes. It actually works.
---
They are? Do you have a link? That sucks, it’ll make boss fights even more ridiculously hard.
---
Nope can confirm they need to add a *new* tab to the workshop menu because I’m  pretty sure 99.99999 percent of the time when someone pays atoms for an item they want to build it straight away -.-
---
Lol I have sinve changed my thought on the pvp as I now know I have been playing with pacifist off for the last 6 months. Excuse my noobishness...what do you mean when you say "Typical BOS flair suggestion"
---
Because console players were losing their minds that PC got to test it first
---
I ran into one this morning. The player had 50 weapons in their shop, excellent bait. On one hand I really like that this a thing that can happen, adds a bit of anxiety to shopping. On the other hand, was that 4 plastic and 10 steel really worth more than the thousands of caps I was looking to offload? The player logged off immediately after I died, but jokes on them.. I didn't care wasn't coming back for PvP anyway. Some other players got my caps instead.
---
That 10mm pistol will become magic if paired with an legendary armour traits that reduces damage by 15% while blocking.
---
Hey like, i bet you werent complaining😂
---
we don’t really participate in grind heavy stuff or heists and what not. But we will if we can get some good help.
---
Chill. And maybe some events.
---
Obviously but the servers are f2p here on xbox, so maybe before taking money for cosmetics they make sure they work. Not sure at what point in my post I said forget the servers and bugs and fix the cosmetic immediately. And initially it was a question if anyone could get it to mod so dont see how asking that means I want them to stop their future updates team to work on a fix for it.
---
Is this for real? Damn nice info
---
Yes. I guess I’m a *commie maggot*
---
How could I forget about Private Gutsy?
---
You don't seriously expect raider scum to grind and scrap those fans, turpentine cans and dumbbells now, do you.
---
Do they have "glowing" in their name? .)
---
Yeah that’s pretty funny.  Pretty sure I have all his attire too.
---
So... Just use mods because it’s already broken almost beyond repair. Got it.
---
I can kill him in 18 shots with my bloodied dragon, using a glitch to have more ammo loaded into it, assuming it's done at the start of the fight. Drink a ballistic bock, slam down a pyschotat and rapid fire VATS one of his heads before my stealth is broken by other players in the arena.
---
I **don't** do this on public servers but it's stuff like that killing bosses super fast. Magic weapons are nice but sometimes just one small piece of the puzzle.
---
That is more like softcore mode over hardmode.  I mean serious that is like midnight cinemax back in the 90s compared to going to the backroom at your local video store.   
---
Give me hardmode: 1 life that is all (one wasteland is coming anyways) create seasonal leaderboards with prizes boom tons of players.   
---
The only differences is a leaderboard and 1 life, there would be no duped items as nothing could be carried over. Everyone is on equal footing, it would also expand more QoL/utility perk usage instead of pure min/max.
---
Probably my luck, just as bad as trying to get a decent ss armour XD shame they don't have it in a tooltip on the loading screen when people fast travel to it
---
Not in the name, but they share the same character model, due to the rad hazards and power armor is difficult to tell if they're dealing rad damage on hit like other glowing enemies do. Those bright green patches certainly glow.
---
Sometimes it’s a divide between should you and could you
---
yup haha always the aluminum
---
I understand roleplaying is fun, but to a point.  When roleplaying turns into griefing, that when I draw the line.
---
I thought they voted the people into office...
---
I met a serious thief at one camp. They had 50 of each stable flux for 100 caps each. He let me buy a ton, then tried to kill me. Flux is junk, so he would have got my caps AND the flux. But I traveled away quickly enough. What a fucker. I reported that guy, which I rarely do.
---
It is. I've server hopped for a min now. May try again after I get off work.
---
It will. It’ll make the really OP explosive variants crap instead of balanced. https://youtu.be/8KCZp4qPUKE Bethesda said they’ll do more adjusting later but considering they don’t even play their own game that’ll probably never happen, at least not anytime soon.
---
Yes can't find dumbbells quickly  for love nore money.
---
Good (though well known) places to find them (so you might need to server hop):
---
Vault-tech University, (2 places). Some in the vault with your back to Ma ma Dolce's it's on the Right and some in the room tight the training cycles. (Back towards Dolce's and it's the red door facing you
---
The Green Country Lodge
---
Chareleon Fire department 
---
Blood Eagle camps in the Ash heap
---
Camp Venture
---
My problem is I don't have the blood sample anymore and have no way of getting a new one.
---
Thought it was a total of 6 slots with the 6th being when you reach level 300.
---
My girlfriend and I are playing and when it hit noon most of her challenges were completed. I already am at 100 but none of them were auto completed. I thought they fixed this garbage. It's super frustrating.
---
Am I missing something?
---
Bethesda told me that several player were having similar problems and that they were gonna fix it. They never did lol
---
This is incorrect - you are guaranteed a BSS sledgehammer from the Duchess’s quest. But keep that secret - I like selling them!
---
I'm on xbox. My problem is I'm stuck at work for the next 3 hours.
---
I did too, but there are only 4 on pts
---
Same. I cant take the queen or colossus out in under a minute and I have an apparent magic weapon.
---
Because its fun probably. I can Appriciate a well made trap camp but IF its just a removed floor its pretty annoying. When i came across my first one it was pretty fun because it was unexpected but when he took my junk it became less fun.
---
Just make shure you stash your junk often and have fun with it
---
Every weapon you craft creates ammo for the weapon. It’s my strategy for cores and toss on super duper
---
Edit: also works for gauss mini gun and such. Gauss minigun creates 200 rounds.
---
Not really.
---
I'm pretty sure Softshell Mirelurks count as Glowing Enemies in the daily challenge, but they aren't Glowing.
---
I just saw you in another post
---
Yeah I was absolutely planning a second character, I just meant that I'd likely be doing leveling in Adventure or may want to play Adventure on alt some times so an Adventure perk deck to fit into whatever stats I have for NW would be cool, but I guess way too much possibility there until I actually figure out what NW build I want.
---
What would be cool is if we could get a Major Gutsy stationed at our camps. Work like turrets as defense.
---
I agree! Lets Appriciate what many of them built
---
Better now than when it drops.
---
lol yep.  The crystal ones work.  Lead sometimes and aluminum not really.
---
Forgetting the people who do the labor sounds like some thing a capitalist pig would forget!
---
Fair enough, let me know when you get on.
---
It just for fun..
---
I will message you! Thank you good sir!
---
You’d have to be a General in the Enclave to get one though.
---
Which is exactly how one would describe a ton of PC games on multiple storefronts. I'm sure there's a good handful of games on both Steam and Epic that wont play nice with the other version.
---
I have 2 alts ive hardly touched since wastelanders.
---
One is level 89 and has done almost none of the main quest, i made this character a few weeks before wastelanders  with the intention of doing wastelanders from a "fresh" character, but ended up using my main anyways, and im cerybglad i did.
---
The second alt is lvl 135 bloodied commando, hes done the vanilla main quest, but hasnt done wastelanders.
---
I plain just dont want to do the rep and gold grind again let alone two, the or four more times.... So now theyre pretty much glorified mules.  Thats not even getting into rolling more SS armor peices...after already doing hundreds of rolls on my main....
---
Its even worse now with legendary perks on the horizon, id rather stay on my main and grind out levels for him for them perk coins than put anytime into my alts.
---
They actually need to change this as it’s not really that obvious. For example, there is a wandering merchant that sells the bow plans and mods. I bought some and learned them. When I encounters her again I bought some more thinking I could sell them in my vending.
---
Nope. There was no way of me knowing this in game. There’s no warning or such.
---
Ha ok.
---
Want repair kits kill the queen, want extra notes, go for the colossus. Downvoted fine, buts its rather logical.
---
Now flux. They should buff that to be more in line with the queen.
---
Trust me, as someone who had a similar hangup about Commando, you do get used to it.  As long as you tap the mouse quickly, you won't spend more than 1 or 2 shots.
---
I'm on Xbox and already see the trend of Earle not really being the target. I think everyone is tagging him then waiting to see if a legacy or magic weapon is in the crowd. No legacy or magic weapon you kill a few wendigos for screws and leave or hide. The ammo doesn't seem, for me anyway, to show up until after Earle regens.  Last night I tried to get him mostly solo and failed, 1100 .45 rounds for about 100 screws. It was the scenario described above. I would guess this is why so many are hiding in the corner. Got my shovel already so I have mostly lost interest.  God I love the shovel... PANG! LOL PANG! LOL ..
---
Before you start drawing lines at what constitutes griefing, maybe stop hoarding and carrying all that junk on your PA build, refrain from using magic vampiric heavies, let loose of fear of death and you'll be fine. It's a game, penalty for dying is almost non-existent - unless you're a hoarder.  
---
Also you don't need F1st to store all that stuff; buy a mule account for 10 quids, run virtual copy and you're golden.
---
Same boat with me, 55
---
Yup, exactly. Me deciding to wait ends up costing me ammo, stims, junk for repairs and such but everyone gets way more loot and hopefully the pool of players able to contribute in meaningful ways goes up. I'll never understand the kill it before other people can deal enough to roll for drops crowd.
---
I've used that weapon to assure a kill while everyone was alive so nobody lost out by respawning outside, I don't rely on it to get a greedy drop or anything.
---
Keep in mind you can't use unarmed melee weapons in power armor, and Earl will kick bloodied builds to death in one hit if they aren't in power armor.
---
Long story short it's in effect of unexplained damage. You get it with shotguns in Vats with a certain piece of armor. Or with heavy weapons with the pretty fast fire rate and legendary effect that will trigger it. Just watch the angry turtle video.
---
IMO doing more Crits is better and fewer harder hitting ones.. So Four Leaf.
---
Scrap them or drop them. Look up the spawns and server hop. Also the frames weigh less than the pieces. So make sure the pieces are actually on a frame.
---
he was joking.
---
This makes me want to try my Bloodied Meat Tenderizer I got dropped from Meat Week.
---
And if you’re on console, don’t squeeze the right trigger all the way down.
---
Thank you. 
---
Debating moving to cranberry bog.  It's just so quiet there right now.
---
I just hit 50 last night, almost 51. And yeah I'm on PS4
---
Mysterious saviour3* and revenant 2*.
---
They proc
---
I didn't really want to design this idea around permanently dieing like normal hardcore modes because ultimately this game takes forever to get anywhere and is grindy. Also there is multiplayer content/economy to consider.
---
The actual good reason to use PA is for the heavy gunner perk Stabilized, the only way to get top DPS with heavy guns
---
You must be fun at parties
---
Yes. That would be how I was able to get my trophy before I got into Workshop PvP and bounty hunting.
---
As far as I can tell, at least at this time I don't think power armor is actually spawned globally on the server.  I pretty much constantly play with one of my brothers and quite often I can see a suit of power armor spawned for him (on his screen as he plays right next to me), but no armor for me in the exact same place.  In fact, I think the game hates me as I have actually only seen 3 suits of armor spawned for me in over 100 hours, while he tends to see them all the time.  If it weren't for the excavator armor quest, I might not even have a suit if I didn't play with him.  Now, if he gets in a suit of PA and then exits, I can then see and collect it and that's why I have a raider suit and T45 now.  
---
So, maybe it used to be that power armor was a first come first served thing and you had to wait for respawn if someone already grabbed it, but as far as I can tell it is no longer that way.  And if is no longer global but local to you, then they should again give more scrap for breaking down the parts and frames, at least in my opinion.  Not like it would help me any since I never see it, but I think it would be a good idea.
---
FLC is kinda useless. if you're a bloodied/crit build then you should have enough luck as it is for 2:1 cycle. 1:1 with a weapon with 15% faster crit fill, or a few +luck armor pieces.
---
YOU BETTER RUN YOU COMMIE LOVING BASTARD!
---
Nice, that should hit like a truck. I still haven't gotten the tenderizer plan.
---
I ran the numbers on it the other day though on the online damage calculator, and it looks like the cursed pickaxe is still better by a little bit pure damage wise. Especially since it always drops with the power attack damage bonus. It weighs a lot less too. But the tenderizer looks cooler for sure.
---
What platform u on?
---
That's cool...i may reconsider getting one of those lol :D
---
I actually use just for power armor and going around with a 50 cal :)
---
What is that supposed to mean?
---
Oh ok, thanks for clear that out of my mind. :)
---
Surprise surprise! I found another key card at the summer mansion and that worked. Thanks for getting back to me though
---
Couldn’t agree more.
---
And all of them energy... had to redo my mutations to get rid of grounded.
---
But Power Armor was the pinnacle of Military Technology. Why is it a rad infested scrawny little mangy rat with an AK47, deep pocketed armor and a backpack can carry more than a fucking walking tank? Why is it that the same scrawny rad infested rat can shred a walking tank? The walking tank should be the most powerful thing in the game.
---
My shitty box house? What is wrong with you! You don’t even know a thing about my camp or the situation. Why would you post something like that?
---
I get about 50:50 success on this one ... Has been like that for a long time.
---
Look, I hate doing it, but if you really seriously wanna finish, buy some atoms. I had some saved up and used them for the last 6 places.
---
You can do the same to a lower level when you're strong enough.
---
Ehhhh,do what makes ya happy!
---
The story ain’t goin anywhere,&amp; once it’s done,it’s done...
---
Enjoy yer friends,cause realistically,THATS the endgame.
---
Gettin in wit some friends &amp; doin things to pass the time,helpin one another.
---
Feel free to play the way you want, as others will do the same.
---
Running belching Betty for into the fire, went in with a shotgun and hunting rifle, snuck my way in only hitting mobs of 3-5 then I trigger the alarm and get swarmed by the 15+ scorched come swarming in and I immediately fall back to the platform with the corpses and held my own until my shotgun ran dry. Ended with my desperately pitching molotovs. And slamming atoms lol
---
Whenever I get 150 atoms, I spend them to skip the next level.
---
I never lock mine.
---
Same here
---
I like taking level 40's-50' ish players for a tour around the mire/bog trashing scorched beast's and higher level enemies, I tend to blat them to about 20% health and leave them to finish off, I also drop the weapons I loot of the bodies for them as well, i'm only level 187 so its still a fun challenge for me as well.  
---
I help newer players by having cheap plan's and free 10mm and .38 ammo in my vendors, though i've noticed recently level 100's+ are taking the 10mm...
---
Magic weapons have more to do with framerates. The 200 fire rate pushes most weapons into the threshold where it gets fucky within the framerate range most people are in. You don't actually need it to start seeing magic effects.
---
Sure it might be fun for couple first times, but after...
---
It should indeed.  Also I don't think non power armor builds can carry more.
---
I actually made a topic yesterday asking if the legendary run was due another week, because I was really tempted to just buy the final level.
---
either way, same here friend. I'm finally free. no way I'm doing season 2.
---
I found a tunnel behind where earl starts it it...... Precious to me. Me and another guy duo'ed earl without dying. Ps4 players hmu ill run a guide next acp
---
wOw, oUR gAmE iS sO FuN
---
Did the owner of the trap camp force you to visit their camp?
---
Did the person that mugged you force you to walk down the street?  Ideally I don't have to fear for my life when I travel to a camp.
---
The only way he could kill you and your plushies is if you did the pvp handshake. It's on you to make that decision
---
mid*
---
I appreciate the thought though
---
Ahhh thanks, the one in whitesprings mall or the bunker?
---
Yeah wasted some flux after three tries.
---
Bethesda was never interesting to fix base game. Devs will release only new content
---
Social distancing
---
Good luck finding what you want.
---
I’ll agree with you on the magic weapons. However I won’t about the explosive energy weapons. Don’t take away my boom boom guns. Yes they’re OP but they make the game enjoyable to some of us. I have a couple of them and without them the game would be so painful half the time. Besides not everyone uses them all the time. There’s more people using fixers and handmades. I find myself using my bloodied fixer/handmade more than my explosive laser rifle.
---
You realize you’re playing a post-apocalyptic video game, right?
---
Unless your merchant character has never killed a NPC, your argument is flawed.
---
Also, keep in mind hunting regulations.  Unless you have a valid license and the animal is in season, I hope you don’t kill any creatures.
---
Speaking on behalf of post-endgame players everywhere, thank you, OP, for giving that person something worthwhile to do.
---
I found both the witch costume and hat hopping at North Cutthroat Camp (North-East of Top of the World), once you spawn there head south until you get to a cleared zone, there you can find many random encounters, last night i killed 2 legendary sheepsquatch for some reason (when it's always one).
---
He was in build mode and had a punji board and keep trying to put it under me.
---
As I said previously I didn’t know all of that. He came up swiping at me doing damage a few times! I’ve ya people do that as a joke. And he kept following me. My point is why can’t we just enjoy the game without having to go through shit like that? Apparently people always say that it’s a great gaming community. Apparently not.
---
Are you any particular build or just want a decent .50
---
When it comes to the purveyor I feel like got better drops when I chose melee weapons
---
They certainly can, boss. My Bloodied Commando has Unyielding deep pocket combat armor and a high cap backpack. I can carry 445lbs, whereas in Excavator I can only carry 405lbs.
---
It's not you mate, it's them.
---
Have two auto speeds. Ba ba ba ba and brrrrrrrr :)
---
Fun, challenging, suspenseful...
---
You used an example from the teal world to support your in-game views, not me.
---
You should approach each camp as though it’s dangerous until proven otherwise.
---
Almost every suggestion about purging pvp from the game and putting even more restrictions on gameplay comes from users with the Brotherhood user flair.
---
The game was marketed as open world pvp. They're adding many more ways to do it in adventure in the 2021 road maps orally given in interviews.
---
You’re welcome
---
Okay, I have a carry weight of 485 with excavator.
---
Maybe they banned me because I said I haven’t had any negative experiences with this guy they were slandering, Sinseer. And I asked what he did. I was permanently banned shortly after.
---
&gt; Gauss minigun creates 200 rounds.
---
Also costs 100 scrip worth of modules each time. Not worth it IMO. It only cost 40 lead and 120 steel to make the same amount of ammo. You can actually make at least 216 rounds for that, maybe more with Super Duper.
---
Sure.  And also not annoying.  Griefing is annoying, etc.
---
Your Str. is higher than mine. Mine is 3, so I can have the travelling pharmacy perk.
---
You can rename the Chassis if you want.
---
You know you can rename them from your inventory right.. It’s easily missed tbf
---
Mind sharing your perk load out?
---
I started as a rifelman build, but ended up switching to a PA HG build about halfway through, so my perks are kinda all over the place. Gonna stick with the HG for this character. The .50 is just what's had the highest output for me so far. 
---
I've tried using the gatling laser and it's just trash IMO. The gatling gun does ok, but mine is bugged and I cant learn new mods for the weapon. Minigun is kinda meh. Just got a gatling plasma, but no plasma cores so I havent had a chance to test it out.
---
Currently using T-60 armor for fighting and Excavator for general use as they are the best I have, although they are both below 50. I have a lot of farming to do before I can make that level 50 Exc.
---
I plan on making a second character soon that is a pistol/crafting build.
---
Well-built trap camps are not a form of griefing.
---
A trend I’m noticing is people will do the trick of nuking FSP to trigger a second ACP on the server. Then they want to speed-run ACP in hopes of making it to the SBQ fight, too. 
---
ACP is going to cause some turmoil like this; some people (me included) want to farm the event for screws and ammo...
---
 (sorry to the newcomers that may not know all these abbreviations)
---
Thanks I didn't know that!
---
Its gonna take more than just tonight to play the story out if you havent touched it, but trust me, its amazing and by the way, there is a mission named "an ounce of prevention" if it gets bugged for you, dm me and ill explain how to help since youtube didnt help too much
---
Thank you!
---
50. Then 120 for the high cap backpack, plus 15 strength from Unyielding (lost when in power armor), and the shielded Brotherhood Knight suit, iirc, gives me an additional 2 strength.
---
Good tip
---
Says the 75 year old buying lottery tickets :)
---
It's been an issue for over a year. Bethesda can't or won't fix it.
---
We try to do that too but for some reason ppl jump to FSP first and don’t realize that ACP closes after 5 min
---
Or just make a build that can work with both weapon types lol. My build is speced for heavy guns, shotguns, and melee.
---
Lmao goes using two competing stores with exclusive games, really, better be naive than as stupid as you.
---
Now, is Fallout 76 exclusive to Steam or Bethesda.net? No.
---
Are they competing? No.
---
It's just sad, you can't even throw a good example, geez, tiny brain, 0/100, small pp.
---
Maybe you need a lecture on why publishers need their own launchers. You know, it's ok to be stupid, if you want to learn I can teach, I just hope you'd be able to understand.
---
Why did you expect it to work?
---
Even the Legendary Run was broken in so many ways, score auto completing, holding fireworks made your weapon reload 10x faster, crouching with the ghillie skin caused the skin to float above you, applying the future-tec skin to to your camp device causes your camp icon to disappear from the map, the blood eagle handmade paint clips and stretches when applied, the captain cosmos helmet is uncraftable, the planetarium lamp fails to project a planetarium and the captain cosmos game board sinks into the wall when placed.
---
Dork, dork never changes.
---
(I love you tankers and always watch your adds! *bos salute* ad vic)
---
Based on data mines, I thought season 2 had mannequins for outfit displays.... if so I feel like I dont have a choice
---
The mirelurk/blackeye location is Ohio River Adventures down by the nuka-cola factory
---
It’s 1 queen meat, 5 soft shell meat, 10 mirelurk meat, or 15 mirelurk eggs and you can only do it once a day. Also, you can start another interaction by talking to Fishbones in the boat to protect the area in exchange for caps (I think) and rep. This is also supposed to be repeatable, but I’ve only ever gotten it to trigger once. 
---
Other than that, talk to EVERY raider you pass in random encounters as they have a chance to give you rep for replying in a certain way.
---
You must have a pretty decent weapon to deal with those wendigos
---
Pc, to be fair i have 1st so im sure if i went to a private world and looked it would be there. But just normally playing on servers i saw 1 sent of t45 full. Now ive got almost all t60 parts except 2. But i haven't seen power armor just sitting there in like 20 hours
---
That’s sad.  That’s also not a trap camp.  That’s a good example of actual griefing.  A proper trap camp doesn’t need its owner present to function.
---
You can sure roleplay scrap merchant, why not. Just don't visit any suspicious camps, don't do events and stay clear of workshops. Better yet, stay home.  
---
Really though, 
---
a) serious trading without mules and/or F1st is a PITA, unfortunately
---
b) there are mean players out there 
---
c) dying is easy.  
---
That's the best advice I can give you, as a trader, builder, pvper and raider.
---
How much does your armor itself weigh though?
---
What a douche
---
I think people didnt expect to be working from home for the rest of the year, giving many of us lots of extra time.   
---
I log in and play for 10-16 hours a day , 5-6 days a week. I enjoy the new dailies and challenges, but its odd that they dont switch over to caps or something once you finish the legendary run.
---
I don’t actually know. I’ll have to get on and check.
---
I went to a camp that with a sign that said "Trap Camp", went in, being super cautious, still died. Owner was there, so congratulated him on being clever, ended up making a trade.
---
How?  Yes they are.  You're ruining someone else's experience for your own gain.
---
You can name the chassis your self. I carry t-51, x-01 and excavator.
---
Never ran into any of those problems so im unaffected but again those were given to you free of charge, the camo underarmor was a paid reskin so id atleast expect them to make sure it was usable in game.
---
Claiming a workshop is consenting for PvP though.
---
You can block them for session so they can't see your blip on the map. This won't work if he has a teammate spotting for him, though.
---
Best thing you can do is get yourself a pvp kit and blow him away.
---
Consider roleplayers. There will always be people who choose to be a raider or a Gary. Pretend the guy following you around is a random encounter. Now that you're in pacifist, they're nothing more than a buggy companion, right?
---
Yeah unfortunately I'm sure I'll be roped back in for season 2...some of the datamined stuff I saw looked pretty good
---
Nice plan, I'd know I would definitely appreciate someone doing that
---
Yep. Name them Excavator, Ultracite, Betsy, Rufus, whatever you want.
---
Well, i understand that these kind of weapons can be fun to use. But i think they hurt the enjoyment of others more than they bring enjoyment to others. But of course, i could be wrong.
---
This is the way
---
Positive: some rewards from 1 are bullion items so 2 may be the same
---
You have to test it with your build and weapons, but FLC is usually a waste. BC isn't that good either now, maybe better with patch 22.
---
My favorite thing about the game itself is probably the variety in the map.   Every time I leave my region, I find somewhere that I want to move my camp.
---
My favorite thing about playing the game is the people, I’ve only come across a small handful of douchecanoes, everyone else has been pretty great to interact with.
---
I have the opposite problem, whenever I use power armor I lose around 50lbs of carry weight so I only use it for radiation protection and then I have to dump a bunch of stuff and can carry very little while in a nuke zone.
---
Honestly screws are always the biggest problem for me... I currently have like 400+ of everything I need except ultrazit and screws... I even have more ultrazit them screws....
---
It's actually great you haven't done the story yet. Some quests have named items that will now be max level when you acquire them.
---
Those are the moments where I switch into “well, I guess I’ll just be farming screws and ammo for 25 minutes” mode
---
Assaultrons are easy XP. Mirelurk Kings are horrible little cunts. I’ve died less to professional PvPers.
---
Play my character bethesda, its better than prosac for sleeping lol..  
---
I'm foodie build, my character watches paint dry for a bit of excitement then has to go have a lay down to cool off.
---
Mad bro? I would be to if I forced myself to play this trash everyday. 😂😂😂
---
Same way you rename Armor/Weapons. Just rename a Chassis to whatever (I just add "T60", "X01", etc to the end) and make sure it's got the pieces you want on it.
---
This. Some of the named items are useless unless max level and good at max level (Mayor or the Day quest  comes to mind). Bonus for waiting to do the story line xD
---
So I did the math and when you factor in the weight for armor, you only gain 19 pounds over power armor.  But you have to be at very low health, you don't have the passive damage reduction power armor has, or emergency protocols.  You don't get stabilized, (which may not be a problem for you, but I use it), etc.  Imo it's still pretty equal.  The reality is that weight reduction perks matter way more.  Put them all together and they save me many hundreds of pounds of weight.
---
So that’s why my BE handmade will fire over 5000 rounds without breaking, but then breaks twice at an exploited Line in the Sand...
---
It's okay when the game devs build a cell with traps in it, but it's evil when other players do it?
---
Respect the artform.
---
My step son found a frame during one of the beta sessions, our whole group was just in awe LOL he let me try it out and I thought about, like seriously considered, dropping server and stealing it
---
*misses next 100 95% VATS shots*
---
Darn you u/Big-Black-Clock-69
---
Don't play the game how I want to play it because other people are mean, got it.  Or, or Bethesda could just make player traps not do damage to other players, eliminate trap camps, and make the game better for it.
---
You are down voting me because you don’t like the truth. They should be removed from game
---
Pretty sure they patched it out when they added the ballistic fibre requirements to armor repairs.
---
Crush supply, increase demand
---
When game devs do it it’s not to steal your scrap.
---
good thing the other fallouts have taught me not too roam too wildly and free from my mission points.. I mean obviously once I'm strong enough nothing can stop me going anywhere.
---
Queen is dead in 2 mins if you dont go there 1st... at least you have a chance of making it back to the mine in time for the event marker.
---
There are more deathclaws in the wasteland. You were to good for him.
---
I wear a full heavy leather assassin/ap/sent set. I can pretty much facetank teslas with stimpaks
---
lol I had a farm route hit like 4 camps running north near plesant valley Station the last camp had a PA spawn almost every time I server hopped
---
There are ways for players like yourself to stick out like a sore thumb. And you're the easiest to frustrate.
---
Rule one: do not wear unpainted excavator armor while using All Rise.
---
No problem!
---
A good tip for your weapons, add "Zzz" or "***" to the start of the name, it'll keep all the ones you use at either the top or bottom of your list, makes for easier mass-selling.
---
I made my first donation yesterday - kicked in some wood just to see.
---
Got myself 5 stimpacks and 3 bottle o'booze.
---
I feel my 250 wood were well spent...no really...
---
Jesus its like an angry Rat King. Hell no!
---
No, it's to make you reload a save from an hour ago - which is far more deleterious
---
Send me a friend request with a note attached saying reddit donation. PSN Flavoredcancer. I'll give you XO-1 and a 3* AA LMg and a I want to say 1* AA .50 ( I have to look ) I'll be on in a 30-40.
---
I ended up in some rough-ass neighborhoods trying to find a frame. They made that change right away, though, so by the time I actually needed one they weren't difficult to find
---
I'm not going to lie, I wish they would stop popping up. So I don't feel like I'm missing out.
---
Someone else already posted it here with a video, so .. ;-)
---
Umm. Ya I wasn’t wearing any lower armor. And no I don’t get frustrated easily at all. I was simply making a point on reddit. If you knew me then you’d know I’m the calmest guy when it comes to a lot of things.
---
Power armor
---
Sorry phones
---
Because there was already one issued in the region?  Because Vault Tec's goal was never for us to successfully recolonize the wasteland in  the first place?  Because having an all powerful magic box that can do whatever the writers decide is enough of a pain in the ass and handing them over to the players would just compound the problem exponentially?
---
GECK are supposed to act as MacGuffin's, not actual tools.
---
Alright, I appreciate it. 
---
Might run out of time before you get on though, I work second shift and gotta go in soon. I should be on for a bit tonight though I dont have time here soon.
---
Just send it now. I'll get on
---
I've not tried tanking it - I did the whole stealth/sneak thing.
---
I'd try tanking - but honestly, I'm not sure what Wendigo count as .. ghouls? Nothing? I guess I could put on PA and use a vamp weapon, or a sentinel set.
---
Just sent
---
I can confirm that it shreds people with  commando or heavy weapons
---
I hate noobs who beg to get power leveled and be given items. When I was a noob I played on my own, defeated lv 60 mutants with grenades and always found an ingenious way to win a fight, so when a noob always comes to me and asks me to carry them, I say NO.
---
If it would appease you, because the world has mean people in it, for junk not to drop upon death within the boundaries of a player camp, it wouldn’t bother me.  I would still appreciate a well-built trap camp.
---
For now, though, please understand the responsibility **you** must take in protecting your assets...err...junk.  You can still carry junk, but be cautious when approaching and entering player camps.  If something seems odd, avoid that camp. 
---
Most times, it really is that simple.
---
Explosive energy is a big issue.
---
All the youtubers review pts changes with them and state the changes arent too terrible yet in actuality non legacy energy is trash post nerf.
---
I don't get how bethesda can balance their game around gear you can't obtain anymore.  Junior level mistake.
---
i honestly cant wait for the damage nerf because of stuff like this.   
---
Some people are so over powered they ruin the game for everyone else.
---
The only weight reduction perk I could see myself using is weapon weight reduction - my food, drink and drugs are covered under my perk loadout.
---
so how long is the cooldown? Is it silo specific or any silos?
---
That does happen sometimes with certain suits, ive notice the one by the downed vertibird in watoga will spawn for me sometimes and not be there for my buddies and vice versa.
---
Does it need to be a direct hit, or this a SBQ situation?
---
Under my perk loadout?
---
I don’t want to end up with flap limb or swamp gas.
---
https://youtu.be/-faLLXQK8bE?t=154
---
I'm super excited and slightly annoyed by this, as I have a gatling vampire that eats those for lunch. Thanks!
---
True..unfortunately most people on Reddit know what’s going on when we nuke prime after ACP but gen pop might not lol
---
Ya know where he starts when yoi first drop down? Go where he is on the back wall, look to the left. Tunnel where NO wendies see you and earl can't enter. "Almost heaven...."
---
Edit auto correct
---
Good man. Keep random encounter in mind and you'll learn to love it.
---
Ok I'll accept I have the lmg on me, but the .50 is on my mule so can you join me and meet me at the rusty pick. I'm stuck there.
---
😭😫fanks I will try!
---
Monongah mine must be in the blast circle of your nuke. Thats it. It does not need to be centered
---
As long as you graze the mine, you're good.
---
I mean on one hand, I get it... on another hand, what little balance this game has is fragile enough. If you're going to force pvp globally, you may as well just remove the S.P.E.C.I.A.L and perks entirely. That's not even getting into quest structuring, events, ect. I just think there are much better games for that already, and I can't even feasibly see Fallout 76 getting to any sort of stable state where they wouldn't just be throwing most of their work in the garbage to accomplish it. The game is just too quirky for serious PVP.
---
If anything, I think a system akin to what was done in The Division would work much better in a game like this. Some sort of Dark Zone PVE/PVP situation that's a bit more high risk/high reward than dealing with junk.
---
If you're really into that type of play though, I'd check out Escape from Tarkov. I feel that game does a much better job emulating the type of environment you're after.
---
Would you want a 3* radium rifle? It's got vampire and 2 vats crit skills
---
Yeah, you're going to need to wait longer. I don't think they are fixing magic weapons.
---
Thank you. I had to scrap my power armour gatling build because of this issue, which ultimately meant I left the game.
---
No I'm good. Just give a sec I need a power armor frame.
---
I saw this atleast 3 times this weekend
---
My first? I was level 9. A level 12 tried to take my workshop. Neither of us could really hurt the other, until I got the bright idea to use VATS on a grenade.
---
But Ammosmith 2 makes Plasma Cores 80% more full when crafted.
---
I'm hoping it's just a brain freeze when this happens, and not a "I have no idea where the mine is" thing.
---
Wasn't this glitch patched? If not, it's turn in, immediately back out of conversation, rinse repeat?
---
I have a Cursed Axe, maybe I will try that first since I can go in full health.
---
Actually it is normal heavy weapons being fired by too many players causing that sound bug.
---
Just experienced this today. Even as spectating. The hacker can spawn the hostile turrets
---
I have my bar camp set up on the south peak...thought about the North peak but liked the flatter peak on the south....plus technically you can walk up the south peak if you know the rock to start the trail, without any mutations.
---
No it’s hacked there are many videos on YouTube aswell on this matter
---
Yeah hopefully that’ll work, so many damn bugs lol
---
everyone on the servers ive been on does SBQ first, and then goes to earl, which makes more sense, since ACP you have a few mins before it starts and its 8 person max, vs SBQ where you have up to 24 players firing at her 20 seconds after the bomb drops.
---
That's what I mean.  I run traveling pharmacy as well and it saves me a few hundred pounds.  Also thru hiker, batteries included and pack rat.
---
I have never once seen that
---
Idk, try having your friend launch a nuke at a different silo
---
Dirty Sally will sell you anything you want for 50 scrip.  She often hangs out beside the ice cooler.
---
If I’m not mistaken if you change servers you can buy more, it should be 10 per server rather than 10 per daily reset
---
They’re only purchasable inside the rusty pick with scrip. You can server hop and continue buying them as long you have scrip
---
Coming now. I'll meet you outside the pick
---
For real though, just leave me alone and let me play the game.
---
Not about being OP or not. About having the courtesy to wait for a couple min to make sure everyone that joined event had enough time to be loot eligible. I could care less if your weapon takes it down in 20 seconds. If I’m going to join the event with a b2525 fixer or b1090 50 cal I expect to be able to loot the damn thing
---
Go out side as Ill give this to you and change to my mule who will be out side too
---
This has been a problem since long before hacked weapons existed.
---
It's an issue with the sound engine being unable to handle so many simultaneous effects.
---
All it takes is one squad using faster fire rate LMG
---
I've hear a lot about escape from tarkov and I might try it. But like I said Im not really interested in being involved in PVP myself. I just like the survival feeling even if it is hiding and avoiding other players
---
Alright, outside now
---
Pretty vlotse, yes I think. Probably want to finish whatever you launched the first nuke for though
---
Thanks, I found it...I must have been playing blind 🙄😅
---
That bugger spawned in my camp! Though at least he made less mess than the mothman that spawned in my camps bedroom...dust everywhere...along with blood and bulletholes.
---
Again, nobody is forcing you to visit player camps.  If it doesn’t look right, don’t enter.  Otherwise, stash your junk before entering.
---
a bid or a bet?
---
Bit off topic but how do you obtain pa mods? I have never got any from scrapping pa parts
---
Ok... server hoping, gotcha.
---
Just put a disease cure in some peanut butter and he will take it. Had swamp itch once one disease cure and I was back on the menu.
---
I mean, literally Bethesda is for the score challenge.  Also to say to just not participate in part of the game  because other players suck isn't the solution.  The solution is to just stop rude players from being rude.
---
Wont let me trade for some reason
---
Imagine if they added a quad prefix to this
---
Vendors should all reset at 8pm est (the same time the faction daily quests reset) just to keep continuity.
---
You have other options, like keeping your guard up, paying attention, staying alert.
---
Stash your junk.
---
This isn’t fantasy land. It’s not mine or anyone else’s job to make sure you get a shot on an enemy. The goal is to kill them as fast as possible so they don’t kill you. Get good. I spent all day yesterday carrying level 20s and 40s through this event with a friend of mine. It’s miserable. 
---
If you’re joining with one of those two guns and you can’t do enough damage to get loot that’s on you.
---
I use a BE 15 fixer stealth commando build and have never had one issue getting my shots even with guys using magic guns on the queen or earl.
---
Wave, crouch, fast travel, stay crouched for a while until they lose interest.
---
I was using level babies during the legendary run and high levels kept trying to adopt me and give me bags of trash plans. I'm playing until I level and have the intended life span of a fruit fly, don't give me stuff. There should be a fruit fly emote for that.
---
They can kill you as soon as you spawn in, with no chance of doing anything to prevent it.  Stash is way too small to have a meaningful amount of junk.
---
Not home but it’s mostly a copy pasta bloodied melee build with some slight changes for my preference.  
---
I use covert ops and ninja for a 3.5x sneak multiplayer instead of just 3x multi from ninja.  
---
I also use 3 points in P for lock picking silos and 6 for Inteli to Hack silo terminals.
---
No bro , the atomic shop servers are secured in a bunker in Alaska.
---
Found a few bases where they built loads of them underground to keep it all out of sight.
---
😂😂
---
Ugh. Not another perk card to swap in, please
---
Cool cool. I had no idea.
---
I did something similar for my son. Except the faster easier way of letting him tag mobs at whitesprings and me one shotting it after. Went fast and after 2 server hops he was like level 18. O ok not took a couple hours. Also noticed we had a lot more legendaries with him along as a low level.
---
I would almost rather this happen than what I went through last night with a solid group of players attending but I'm guessing the problem were the 1 or 2 tesla users so that frame rates were stupid slow. TLDR we ran out of time and I got zilch like you did, but I wasted tons of bullets and stims in the process :/
---
Yes you can, the timer is per silo, so if you launch alpha you may wait for relaunch it but you can do the other 2
---
Thanks. I've already fixed the problem by downloading Windows 8.1 ISO and copying missing files to System32 folder.
---
It was some time in beta when they nerfed scrapping in general, guns used to produce more scrap too.
---
All my friends don't play anymore. sad face emoji
---
Not crazy at all.ss armor is where its at.i have all buttress but want deep pockets next..jetpack is fun as hell as well.u wont regret it.rolling the pieces u want is a tad harder
---
Best armor I have. I bought the arms and chest first and with in two rolls I got all 3 star unyielding. The legs took me prob 80 rolls each to get but it’s amazing. I bought the deep pocketed for all of them and buttressed and also jet pack. It’s amazing
---
Dear Bethesda: Make Deathclaws Scary again!
---
I would like to fight him. I can learn a lot from the best PvPers, as I’m currently developing my gear set and play style.
---
I'm not super concerned because of the legendary perks that will give me quite a few more perk points.
---
When BoS arrives I am sure there will be new weapons and armor to buy.
---
Yeah they're really screwing the players that have been playing the longest. I have no clue how many coins I'll be out due to respecting and dupe loss
---
i'd love to be able to craft 25 fixers all at once and pick the best one, which is probably the reason why we'll never see it.
---
Please read up on the bugs for the mission "An ounce of prevention" I'm stuck on it and can't progress yet.
---
Even so I can only turn in 20 a day...1k takes 50 days of not earning notes to use. I can spend the gold but not the notes fast enough
---
Even people who duped the crap out of stuff only got a week ban. They havent patched this in over three months and its widely known so they just dont care.
---
Found the last one in the Mire, just north and west of where you find DeGaurre.
---
I guess I got lucky and ran right through that mission...I believe that was the last mission I did
---
The next patch is "One Wastelanders"...
---
The second that comes out, I’m slamming three points into Charisma for the Suppressor perk, and two more in agility, so I can have Born Survivor rank 1 and Action Girl, rank 2.
---
What are these magic weapons?
---
I don’t know about that. I watched someone graze the mine with the edge of the nuke zone and it didn’t trigger the event. I think the whole of the map icon or majority of it at least needs to be in the zone.
---
 LOL. Are you on PS4? If you are add me and I will show you what's up with the double nuke.
---
Minigun with a tri barrel. You can shoot for a very long time at a rapid rate without missing shots even at mid-range. The bugged bonus stacks exponentially per shot, so sustained accurate fire is the most effective. LMG is really good for this but it burns through ammo quickly and is hard to control
---
Martial Artist. It also increases swing speed
---
Thank you, at least now that I have an actual name, I can find the info I’m looking for
---
Guys with magic guns could be heroes.
---
Have you looked to see how much material it takes to craft a piece of power armor? The. Scrap returns are rather generous as it is.
---
You have just taught me something that will bring earle to his knees.
---
[this right here](https://www.google.com/search?q=west+virginia+power+armor+paint&amp;prmd=isnv&amp;sxsrf=ALeKk03cEp66nPtEEHx_R528blLr0D76gQ:1598895094534&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjb0ZGx_MXrAhXPnOAKHV-eBb4Q_AUoAXoECA8QAQ&amp;biw=412&amp;bih=718&amp;dpr=2.63#imgrc=J-Z6yua5AxG5hM)
---
so to fix that mission, what your gonna need to do is server hop, youll need to just keep going into avr medical, go into the basement's terminal, and DO NOT install the type-T fuse, you go to the computer terminal, read every file in there, top to bottom, and if it says the bllod sample has been checked, then you install the type t fuse and enter the inocculation chamber, you have to finish the mission omce the blood sample is tested or it will go back to being glitched, it sounds like a lot but its a simple process that took me and my buddy about 30 minutes each to fix the challenge
---
Go for it. It's a fantastic set. It's easy to maintain with common items, no ballistic fiber necessary. AND it's about as strong as a full set of T45 power armor and I love the helmet, no added protection mind you but that light is awesome, much better than a mining helmet.
---
It's a secret. But it's worth your time to see if you are on PS4.
---
Make Twitter account for screenshots and set it to private.
---
Take screenshot on PS4 &amp; upload to Twitter.
---
Visit Twitter with laptop, mobile, etc to download &amp; share screenshot.
---
That’s not necessarily what you need to do. You just have to be there and ready when the timer ticks zero. Get down the hole and start firing. That’s what I do. 
---
And you don’t have to appease me. I don’t care if you get shots on or not. Either way I’m getting loot. But don’t cry about it when you don’t because it’s on you. 
---
Some people just aren’t set out for boss fights. Go kill mutants or scorched. They’ll wait around all day for you to do your damage.
---
Given the clomp, clomp, pfth,  kinda hard to sneak in PA :)
---
you can put the stealth mod on whatever variety PA you prefer.
---
Sniper....by nature, you should be somewhat out of detection range, and the stealth mod may let you get in closer.
---
I dig this
---
That's most likely what they were referring to
---
They count as Cryptids.. Blocker and the Emergency Protocols plus Dodgy.. I only take damage from the poison and falling roofs in there pretty much.
---
You still have 10 to 15 left
---
ty
---
Ooh, ok. What special is that under
---
That's what you do when you have different sets and all of them have the same name
---
I have "power armor X", "power armor Nuka51" and power armor 60 BoS". Don't use them at all because Unyielding, but I am waiting until I can display them.
---
Yeah, thanks.  I guess I'll just keep waiting for the atom shop to have what I want.
---
Too bad fast travel fixes it, would be great to join an event like that
---
Nice
---
That’s just for the first rank, iirc. When I level those perks up more, I’m not 100% certain what I’ll do with it.
---
I think not everyone realizes that it triggers the APC again.
---
Hopefully as more people realize this they will start going to both.
---
that is, until they patch it.
---
Bruh!where the hell is my projector to the stars?couldn't find that damn thing to save my life yesterday
---
G U E S S. Jk, it's under strength
---
They really are filthy casuals for doing that then aren't they?
---
Ok, thank you!
---
I have a B2525 everything. Fixer, handmade, 10mm pistol, assault rifle. Seems like opinions vary fairly widely :)
---
Bugging through the wall
---
I mean....you can roleplay all you want but you came out of a vault, you were not a miner or soldier in Appalachia
---
(Unless you wanna be some old fart that was cooped up for ages, in which case you would need retraining anyway)
---
This. Heavy Gunners and Melee are basically interchangeable, they all have similar looking SPECIAL distribution. I leveled as melee, swapped into Heavy Gunner, but nowadays running as Shotgunner then swap perks back to Heavy Guns for bosses.
---
Oh while they were annoying my friends and switched characters to my main and my friends were high enough level to be attacked openly, so I turned them into piles of meat when they shot at us and they never came back.
---
A simple life fix is to show Vault Tec Power Armor units at a training room inside the vault. Like, simulators or something.
---
5 perk points is the max rank for one of them.
---
It’s in lights and doesn’t want to project 99% of the time.
---
The camp menu is pretty terrible... but there is some logic to it.
---
The punch bowl and keg you can put stuff into, which you can't do with floor decor, and it's not really a stash box, so... what to do with it?
---
Or perhaps just stick it in decor, and have a note on that item that you can put stuff in it might help clean it up.
---
The tents and other things too kind of feel like the train car vs circus cage. You can walk in them, build stuff in them, etc.
---
You only get them as drops from SBQ or from vendor bots.
---
yeah been testing. kinda tough to judge which is why I was looking for opinions. I have a B2525 Fixer, handmade, 10mm pistol, assault rifle. Opinions are pretty wide. I'm just looking to stop tinkering :)
---
In additional, you can get armor with lower weapon weight legendary effects (up to 5) and there is a grognak mag that temporary reduces weight further.
---
With 5 weapon weight reduction and Martial Artist 3, you can bring the Tenderizer down to 0.8 CW.
---
that's fucking RAD
---
The only reason I don't use those weapons
---
And it also houses of the saddest stories in Appalachia.
---
Nobody's been banned for that yet? Or at least had them removed from their camps?
---
I thought it just made more cores.
---
That reminds me of a certain Frog and the "Beverly Hills Cop" theme starts playing in my head...
---
Sadly, I’m of a similar mind as you. I’m expecting a whole new raft of bugs, in addition to all our existing unfixed bugs, and more unhappy players.
---
Yeah this has been a feature for a while. 
---
A lot of you might hate me for this but what I like to do for some quick fun is to put on the stealth suit and go on the farthest border of a workshop and claim an owned workshop just to mess with people. Sometimes it drives them crazy as I can see them jumping around all over looking for me. I go back and forth out of the claim circle just to make them more crazy. I do that for a little bit and then go about my day.
---
Well the changes haven’t come out yet do it could also be a temporary change
---
Fast. Travel. Bug.
---
Yes, next patch. It will come out in a few weeks minimum, but let’s be honest will it really come out on time with their track record?
---
Mine was last night going through one of the main quests for that lunatic rose. I was a lvl 24 at that time I think, and she had me go into the wendingo cave. Now, the night before I went in for the first time with my friend, but I was super late to the party as I got there after he killed just about everything. A few little things to kill and the wendingo wasn’t that bad. So this time I’m like yeah fuck it, this is easy street. So I walk in, spinning back fists, scissor kicks and Superman punches all the way through with ease.....until I saw not one.....but two Mirelurk kings lvl 50...now I remember these bastards from fallout 4..so when I saw that shit, my butthole puckered up and immediately started sneaking to try and just get passed them....as you can guess, it didn’t work, and I literally ran around in circles for about 15 minutes trying to just soak the damn things, only to die about 3 times before I actually killed the damn sons of bitches...
---
Yarp. 
---
I named all of my frames, have one of each IIRC and got sick of trying to guess which was which.
---
It fills up one core past max capacity with the inner bar like if you over repair armor or weapons.
---
My clientele tend to eat mine. They seem to prefer tabs over sheets.
---
Wonder if this works with plasma cores as well
---
Because it will force players to buy atoms if they want to finish it. For example, people that finished it through harmless xp glitches got immediately banned, while dupers got a slap on the wrist.
---
Doesn't change the fact that it means that you will not see your request coming. This is what i mean.
---
If you are on PS4, I can mod the silencer. Do not know all mods, but I know the good ones (silencer, powerful automatic receiver, etc.) 
---
You can pay me by giving me some plasma rounds for my flamer. If you don't have any, it's free. 
---
Andreslamantis is my name.
---
So I just posted about my experience last night, first time actually in the cave with the shit still alive and reading this thread makes me feel better lmao. Those Kings fuckin beat the shit outta me, they probably recorded it and put that shit on world star it was so bad
---
Yeah, I label mine “1 T51 PA”, for example.
---
I mean unyielding with 30+ luck. with 32 I believe, which would require a shielded raider underarmor and a +luck armor piece, you get a 1:1 crit cycle.
---
or with a 15% faster crit fill weapon if you have any of those.
---
First time I ever did the photo opportunity quest it sent me there and the queen/kings whooped my ass. Every time after I'd fast travel in stealth, take a picture and fast travel the f out. Love the location now, but was weary of it for a while! Good place to loot for materials too.
---
LOL I saw that yesterday too. Oops.
---
I do appreciate those that get the mine on the very edge of the zone, it makes for an easy exit and hang out after it's over.
---
I always scrap my junk.  Even scrapped it weighs too much.  So just accept the trolls, okay, great game advice.  Just accept all the bad things and never try to make the game better, great.
---
Also, there are plenty of other camps for the challenges.
---
You can always use atoms to get ahead if it gets close. Just FYI.
---
So the run is confirmed to stop in 8 days? I’m at level 81. Don’t think I’ll make it all the way unless I dip into my atoms
---
WUT. HOW
---
I've played since beta, I think I'm about to clear 50 today. I haven't intentionally done any of the challenges though. Didn't really like any of the skins or camp items besides the fireplace door. You can always spend atoms the last day to advance if you want.
---
From what I understand you must do at least 1000 damage to be included in the loot pool for SBQ (just learned this yesterday myself).
---
I have 4 spots left. Hopefully I'll finish it off tomorrow with the new weekly's.
---
Trippy
---
Ah. Man u taking me back to BETA 😭
---
Thanks man mucho appreciate
---
Can't agree more, it's not the apex predator it used to be, other things are now a more frightening and scary encounter e.g.. The 4 yau guai combo, assaultrons with spam laser, scorchbeasts,SBQ, colonel gutsys ( especially the rare cloaking version), the collosus 
---
It needs to be top dog once more , up it's damage/speed, give it more health, ffs even give it power armor if you need to just something to make it a real threat again
---
TIL that you can name your power armor frame.  I know what I'm doing when I sign on later.
---
About 2 weeks ago I went there for the photo and found 2 queens and 4 kings.  Wtf.  I don't have enough stimpacks for this.  Luckily I had a stealth boy.
---
Cooldown is three real life hours. It is silo specific in that if you do silo Charlie for example, the cooldown timer starts for silo Charlie so if you hop servers to do Charlie again, it will allow you to do the whole run up until you try to launch the nuke where it informs you that you are on cooldown.
---
Have my upvote! Couldn’t have said it better
---
Only time I burn him down with a magic weapon is when I see Tesla users.  
---
Burn him down before the FPS drops to hell.
---
At least on the pts, damage doesn't really seem to bad for me.
---
Look up "Fallout 76 Magic Weapons" on youtube. There's a video that goes over what they are and what they do, despite us not knowing fully how it works. Basically, certain legendary mods proc the "magic" effect.
---
Damn lol
---
Haha fuck that!
---
Some trap camp owners are doing it for nefarious purposes, sure.  Others are doing it for the challenge of the build.  I can certainly appreciate a well-built trap camp.
---
There is a simple measure to be taken to prevent loss of junk, and you are steadfastly attempting to shift responsibility for your junk to the game developer to prohibit certain actions instead of you taking the simple measure yourself.
---
You’re asking for all others to play in line with your style, instead of compromising and allowing everyone to co-exist by taking some easy precautions.
---
Thank you.ill check it out
---
X Box. thanks for the offer but I've already slaughtered enough Mole Miners and built a new and improved Caps. Cosmos Excavator.
---
I'm not sure tbh, someone else mentioned 8 days and that looks about right
---
I feel the same way. I'm imagining it being like fighting the trash mobs at SBQ just to take a workshop, or farming lead and steel with the super mutants at the prison. I don't want every fight to be a boss fight. Scorched pile-ons will be a nightmare. They can get overwhelming already with the stupid stunlock that makes it impossible to reload or run.  
---
There's a reason i don't play Souls games. I want to PLAY games. Don't drag Fallout into this "every random enemy must be an obstacle to overcome" stuff SOME people like. For ME, it's not fun to die over and over. It's just a waste of time, and not worth the effort just because i don't research builds on the web and follow the ONE that works (looking at you, bloodied) to the letter.
---
I guess I'm just thankful it wasn't my T 65.
---
In my opinion it's Bethesda's problem to fix.
---
It is worth it to finish- and my favorite thing to do is launch nukes to spawn Earle or the SBQ. Brings most of the server together!
---
I do this to new players:) I want the community to grow so I set up beside the wayward and help the new peeps
---
This is incredible.  There must be a dozen Scorched all stuffed together. 
---
Some of the best moments in Fallout happen with clipping issues.  The other day I saw a robot at Watoga just spinning across the shopping area with a shopping cart around its waist.  I laughed and thought “Godspeed, tiny dancer”.
---
If nothing else, the shielded underarmor is a good buy.  +4 STR, +2 PER, and +2 (or 4, I forget which, on another special), +15 DR, RR, and ER
---
Gives as much protection as my heavy metal set (330ish), with better ER and RR.
---
Been fortunate and in 15 or so crafts, have rolled WR (Junk, aid, weapons), +1 on different specials, 3rd star AP refresh, poison resistance, and weightless. 
---
OTOH, also rolled some not as useful - one star safecracker, mutant slayer, zealot.
---
Now I just need to get more leather.....
---
Lol you found a gd hovercraft!
---
Not even really throwing them. Just make the sounds over the mic.
---
Well they did it a second time, and I used my super leech powers to join a group last minute and watch them kill it, then shoot it once and get free shit lololo
---
Ouch, they're probably affected by the daily tmer now. Might wanna check another known location, server hop until you get it,  then move to another one.
---
I've taken hundreds of photos in game, using all manner of locations, filters and effects yet all fall short of one I took that legit looks like a cultist has it's head stuck up a lion's arse.
---
You are entering their camp willfully.  You made the choice to take the risk and enter their camp.
---
Yeah I missed a couple of weeks but the extra challenges only got me to the captain cosmos pa skin so far I was hoping to at least get the thunder pipe skin
---
Angry Turtle! Explains and goes through all versions! My go to when I need details. He tests everything!
---
No you can't please everybody, you're bang on the money there.
---
I’m trying to picture a deathclaw in PA
---
I can't believe the amount of people complaining about being guaranteed leveled mobs and loot. I've always played this game solo as well. I don't struggle now, and judging from the footage and tests I've seen people on the PTS doing I don't expect to be struggling afterwards.
---
There isn't an official end date, just "mid-September".
---
Could be the 14th?
---
That weight though
---
It looks like Darth Vader's helmet mated with a T45
---
Yes you do. After vault 79 raid
---
I keep coming back to this post cause you’re on my mind heavy, you okay OP?
---
Yes. That is the best thing I have seen in a while. Thank you!
---
No way, go to Summersville where the Experimental Pip Boy schematic was, that house has a shit ton of burnt books.
---
We drink a lot? Dunno. But I agree, one of the nicest communities I've been a part of.
---
I'm taking a break from it until next season.
---
Oitside of shotguns, it only affects weapins with a fire rate of &gt;200.
---
Just a bonus for the PA heavies.
---
It used to be a lot, then they made scrapping power armor give no materials at all, it only recently started giving scrap again!
---
Ooh my mistake posted in the wrong one, didnt have my glasses on
---
Yea, it's been a week since it happened now, it hit my best friend and one of my other friend the hardest tho, those three were always playing something together, they didn't play alone often, always played together, when the other 2 were playing something else of not on, the one that died would play with me on fo76 or apex, apex was his favorite... But he loved fallout too
---
Yeah lots of people have posted about that happening. It sucks for sure.
---
Just collect the water and sell it to a vendor (4 or 5 caps a pieces) and you still are giving back to the community
---
You sound like you have a really, really bad build if you're complaining about scorched being too much for you lol. You might want to pick up minecraft, just make sure to sleep when it gets nightime or else you might have to fight some scary zombies.
---
I love it, dont have much to do atm after 2000h ingame. Just waiting for the time to return to all low level areas i have not visited for about 510lvls ( lvl526 atm) .
---
Ofc we can visit but i see 0 point in doing so to go shoot lvl3 ghouls , and same as OP i also play 98% solo of the time.
---
Played alot Eso or still do sometimes and imo One Tamriel (lvl scaling pretty much saved the game) 
---
Its probably the first time i feel positive about something coming to this game ( if they dont break alot of stuff)
---
I’m new to reddit so I don’t know if there’s a way to message people but if you need to talk I’m here.
---
Hah it'd be nice to have more companion options even if they didn't do anything
---
Our character alludes to that potentially being Vault-Tecs real intentions, but without confirmation from the company itself its just speculation.
---
The only exception is when I’m trying to hold down a workshop. Then people insta kill me because I’m like level 20- so it’s virtually impossible for me to hold one of those down
---
I think it's because there's no benefit to killing people, nothing to steal, and the game provides plenty in terms of junk and gear. If there is no scarcity, there is no reason to fight for resources. We have a stash limit and too much ammo. Why not just share it with those less fortunate (aka low levels)?
---
You see it in real life too. When the majority of people can get by comfortably,  there is less conflict. As soon as you introduce scarcity, you force people to compete to survive and they turn on each other.
---
So the issue with Explosive Energy weapons is that, due to weird damage interaction, they ignore both Energy and Explosive resistances. Meaning they do full damage to everything. That honestly shouldn't be too hard a fix to implement.
---
Magic weapons, on the other hand, seem to be an issue with how Servers interpret insane high speed damage. The combination of high Fire Rate and specific Legendary Effects seem to make Guns fire so fast to the server that the damage stacks on itself exponentially in milliseconds. It seems to have similar roots to the "Health Rubberbanding" glitch. I'm not sure how that could easily be fixed, since it seems to be an issue with the server design or possibly the game engine itself.
---
I'm fine, thank you, to talk to people directly, click their name and press start chat
---
During meat week I found server full of afkers and a camp with about 15 just outside of the build area. Every event completed with in a minute and I came out with about 30k 5.56, he had left all the stuff unlocked so idk if I should be pissed or not lol. I'm getting sick of seeing workshops with 30 going tho.
---
It's gotta be project paradise.  Lots of acid, usually 3-4 legendaries, no time to relax and lots of xp. I know I'm definitely in the minority because I often do it alone, but when a higher level player who knows how to do it shows up it is a real blast.
---
Its getting tempting
---
You should get on the mic and communicate with them about how to work together. I can solo earl, I know many my level can. When I see lower levels in the waiting area, I get on my mic and start asking what they have, how they are built and get them to understand what to expect and where to go.  
---
If they listen and respond, whether through mic as well or just emotes, i work with them to get the job done. Some dont and just ignore or cant hear me, and they are left to die for the most part, but if they listen and try, i always try to stim then and havent failed yet.
---
Lol the microdicks only proved my point.
---
Rank 148, only just did the nuke missions and vault raid 3 nights ago. Don’t worry about the story, the later you leave it the better I reckon
---
If they’d put the atomic shop items in the lists the first few were in, it’d be much better.
---
if you choose to have raider punk in your camp, he sometimes request you to kill the flatwood monster.
---
Early game, a set of untouched PA is a great find, should get at least 25 steel per piece(found in the wild only so no exploits for crafting?) &amp;75 steel for the torso. Idc if its as low as 40 but the PA torso is one hell if a lugif you’re on a scrap run, immerse our efforts in steel scrap.
---
Don’t take workshops if you don’t want to get spanked, it’s always a possibility when you take those, and they’re basically worthless unless it’s for a daily challenge. We have no need to split the player base at all, and there are private servers for those who don’t want to interact with others who might murder them.
---
Is that the 2nd nuke triggering both Earl and SBQ?
---
Because people aren't really able to be as toxic anymore. Go back to the first few months and you would have people destroying your camp, tricking you into pvp, worst of all lagging the servers with insane crafting from dupers.
---
Who says I'm being forced I willingly get on and play Todd howard isn't behind me forcing me to play. Hell even if he was I would shake his hand instantly becouse it's becouse of him that I have the games I love. Go play a game where trash talk is welcome like rust or fortnite becouse we don't need it here.
---
It does hurt to see your dps drop so much, but I was still handling my own on the PTS.
---
Math? or I am dumb?
---
Wait until you learn that the photo subjects don’t have to be alive...
---
I never noticed how much I actually carried with my chemist backpack until I put power armor on again... I go from ~300 to around 1000 just losing that 90% reduced chem weight. And after all the work I did to get the backpack with the mod, it sucks that I lose it the second I step into power armor.
---
From what I've read this "nerf" is going to allow for better future balancing
---
I'd love flamers to be able to heal, but I'm pretty confident that will never happen.
---
Honestly, my dps really didn't drop that much.
---
Lol I know. You have to take a picture of the location for the quest, not the creatures in it...
---
You need to server hop after you apply the mod for get the effects to kick in.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
It’s just to say how many times something has happened in the times I have done the event. 
---
The first number being how many times it happened, and the 2nd number being how many events I’ve done
---
take a break
---
I don't mind the current respec method but will start to mind it when legendary cards become available.  Every point spent to respec will be a card that can't be turned in for legendary ones.
---
I got them off a responders vendor bot, specifically the one at whitespring but I think any of them have a chance to sell it
---
As funny and awesome as this is, the other second guy to post this was slightly funnier, and the third guy?  Well that was just gold.
---
Oh I see. I thought you were on a scout quest to take a picture of a mirelurk queen or king.
---
100% agree, I started a second character and it part way through I realized the same.
---
They need to make plans, gold and rep account wide, it would encourage me to play through more, after tomorrow I should be done the Legendary Run, and I'm taking a break after that, I would keep going if I could do a second character with pistols.
---
I'm so bored of Heavy Guns, they are too efficient compared to others weapons on my main.
---
honestly I think it's going to be an issue if everything is "at your level". I go back to the Farm research center to farm resources sometimes to save ammo, as at level 100 everything there is super easy. Now imagine if there are no "easy" farm spots and you're dumping tons of bullets into random garbage enemies just to grab some concrete.  
---
overall I think the rebalance is going to shaft solo players more than it's going to make the game exciting.
---
Trash place for lead ore...lucky hole mine using excavator armor is the place for lead
---
I have 2 NW characters that run it, it works great on commando and shotgun builds
---
Luckily I'm ranking up, I'm somewhat on par now, leading the knights while he leads the Paladins, but technically I'm leading a subgroup of the knights for recon, it's all sorta screwy right now
---
Oh, that’s smart, I didn’t remembered about the US govt supplies, Thanks! :D
---
Okay so u can only do the plans u buy from secret service. Was hoping i could do my fixer plans but wasnt able to thanks man.
---
Obvious question first, Do you have things for sale on your vendors?
---
Firstly, PvP only really happens if you try to take a workshop, which is by design. When it comes to level jumps, the One Wasteland update on the road map should help with that. If you want something now for either problem, you have private servers available to you.
---
I’m with Fordtony I like the variety of different enemies.  I did the Morgantown airport event today and was stunned to come up against a level 68 ghoul in amongst the level 6 ones.  Nearly killed me as I tried to switch weapons quickly.  I don’t want every every enemy to be a slog I like variety.
---
I thought I had a kind player like that. Levelling up a mule went to West Tek at level 15. Followed high level in so all max level enemies. He let me tag them and then finished them off. He opened the door where there’s loads and let me go in. Then ft away and I’m guessing he thought I’d die. He came back 5 minutes later and I’d killed them all.
---
Tyler county fair grounds is good. There's a little house by the frat houses with hundreds of books I've found too.
---
Ill complain wheres the fun in that?
---
I agree with you, i agree with most of the posts in this sub reddit but can someone tell me if any of those wonderful (upvoted) requests are really implemented? Or even listened or bethesda announced that are working on them?
---
There.... Kinda is.
---
The final BoS quest in the main story line (spoilers for a 2 year old quest coming up) gives you a full set of ultracite power armor and the plans to make it. I believe there's ALSO an enclave quest that grants you to the schematics for the x-01 prototype armor after that, but it isn't as iconic of a quest in my memory because I know that I earned it but I don't remember at what point.
---
Not to mention that there's a whole side quest available at 25 where you learn about the technology "battle" between the autominer and the excavator power armor, and follow the design process for its creation (if you read all of the lore terminals along the way) that ends with you building a set of excavator armor AND the reward is the power armor station plans.
---
If you're looking for quests that award power armor and make it feel important, they already exist.
---
Well there goes a waste of 500 gold🙃
---
I got back into the game about a month ago. I'm at rank 55 now. I've figured if I can make it to about 74 I can pay for the rest in atoms. 
---
I really hope they announce some more bonus challenges and an extra week or two for people trying to grind it out.
---
with the way they implemented random teams, it's always a good idea to be a part of a team, even if you play completely solo. You get bonuses for just being in a team. I agree that it seems like they are pushing team play with all of these adjustments but I'm unsure as to why
---
Thanks! I’ll check that place too, very useful.
---
Sounds to me like you want a private server, which is available if you want. Also, you're not going to be level 30 forever.
---
Is it time? I'm sitting on about 700
---
Don't hold your breath. Rather than implement the basics of multiplayer online games that have existed for 20 years, they prefer to introduce MORE half-baked mechanics on top of existing garbage mechanics, building up ever more game design technical debt. Perk card system sucks ass, but lets keep it and also introduce a legendary card system on top of it that sucks ass. Gearing sucks ass, but in a vain attempt to balance our very stupid starred legendary prefix gear system, lets nerf the damage formula. What will be the next stinky, smelly idea they bandaid on top of the festering wound they've already developed? Can't wait to see it.
---
This game needs a brave project manager that walks into meetings and is willing to lay people out to make this game what it should be. To see the Fallout IP mismanaged like this makes me nauseous.
---
I’m looking on the map and I don’t see white spring
---
One thing that I would like changed is if a gun is using an overcharged core(from crafting of course), the gun actually uses the entire core before reloading, not after it has used 100 of the charge, leaving half-empty(or less) core in your inventory
---
The raiders will surely have a crazy story to tell their kids in the future
---
Yes it is
---
some post-completion prizes (not Atoms, it ain't happening kids) would be the way to go.
---
kkkkkk, thanks
---
I just had a new glitch on the PC.
---
Someone managed to go down the shaft before the timer started and began fighting Earle.
---
After the rest of us got down there and killed Earle, the event updated to dropping down the shaft, and nobody got the event rewards.
---
But at least we got to loot the corpses.
---
Same.  Stocked up on scrip and created another toon for the next season.  10 min check in everyday then onto a very large backlog of games.
---
make sure you have the white knight perk installed, it decrease the cost of repair by a very significant amount. secret service does not require it at all  
---
also, i buy it from other people or even the traders as to not waste time to farm them. if you get 1400 caps a day and that is 40-50 ballistic fiber from a  traders, i figure this is equal to at least 10 armor repair
---
-_-
---
on xbox you click the Inspect button on the chassis and it has a rename button. I'm going to safely assume it's the same for the rest
---
In the future try crafting them a bunch of molotovs. They can tag big groups without worrying about aiming for each one.
---
Anything, even if it was just lunchboxes... but something.
---
That is so much easier than trying to drop/place juggle so I can put a particular armor in storage
---
They are cryptids. No slayer/hunter prefixes work against them. The only special buff you can get for them is the one you get for Queen Of The Hunt.
---
Like people are saying collect all the prewar money and also pick every pack or carton of smokes you can find
---
I tried replicating it when I saw one in a players camp a good while ago and immediately felt like a criminal when I figured it out. Now every time I look at my camp budget  I have a tiny little reminder of how much of a Muppet I was.
---
Does your Camp icon show up as the tent?
---
I carry to much stuff everywhere and cant leave my power armor due to weight issues.
---
I see your 5 character notebook and raise you a 43 character spreadsheet that calculates to the cap the value of everything I own in game. It also tells me how many serums I can craft from my junk and when(if ever) I will run out of resources. It's a monstrosity TBH and it was easy to end up spending as much time recording as I was playing. Sometimes more fun actually...
---
Tyler county fair ground is a good spot
---
How can you do this??
---
Useful
---
And Tales from the West Virginia Hills Issue 5 presumably. +15% damage against Wendigos
---
Wow
---
Yeah a while ago it was very profitable, but exploitable. I think they should at least make it possible to unlock power armor mods when you scrap it like regular armor
---
I’m a regular ol’ full health player but I never leave home without the excavator suit. 
---
Holding a mountain of loot and you’re no where near a workstation and you’re trying to sort out what to drop vs. what to keep? Throw the suit on and fast travel to wherever. 
---
It optimizes yield during those times when you find ore outside of mines. Toss it on an a normally low yield becomes decent. 
---
I carry the excavator suit and the t-45 and I use the excavator suit all the time and never touch the t-45 or 51 or 60 suits.
---
Thanks to you both.
---
It did however pay a good tribute to the old radio tower side stories of FO3 where you track down these long lost signals and calls for help, only to uncover the family has been did for over 200 uears and your a little too late
---
Ah yes, forgot about that one
---
Yeah you're right. The excavator power armor quest is the true epic way of getting it. The other two, I don't really consider them PA quests, just rewards. But the Excavator questline is quite good and involved.
---
Agree. Another contributing factor to the issue.
---
Yeah no kidding 
---
Let me see, waste 1000 .556 shells, countless stims and chems, and die 3-4 times v waste 50 shells and still compete the event?  Stoopid!!
---
What's your psn?
---
The Morgantown Airport event Collision Course gives 100 pre war money.
---
agreed. I would prefer something I could display in my Camp. make it something that can only be earned from Score earned past the last stage of the board.
---
I was fighting earle last night and free aiming. No vats on these tests.  It was first time i made an effort to count but ive noticed the issue for awhile i got 19 on all my counts with 9-10 rounds showing in mag than reload. I also have been running into my gun just firing on its own and i have to holster it to stop.
---
 I still need to do more counts on it as almost every gun reloads with ammo still left in the mag but its impossible to count the heavy weapon shots.
---
I'm thrilled for you that only 4 out of 16 has your matchmaking been poor where mine would be in the 90th percentile in the other direction!! I think I have actually only been able to complete the event a total of 4 times and with the RNG hating me have been stuck with Plushie plans each if those 4 times. Today I was even so lucky to snag a 1* Zealots Super Sledge for my time... this event has been nothing but a kick in the balls for me, but my screw stash has never looked so nice and full

Afaik most inside areas are instanced since Wastelanders
---
Ok thx
---
It's okay the real ones got your back.
---
Hate to break it to you. The game isn’t about you.
---
Yhea that is the truth of it, one cheater ruins a whole BR game.
---
As I am newish to this tho I don't see it as such a challenge to ban all those cheaters. Or do they just keep buying new accounts?
---
Damn I thought they would of perma banned those dudes
---
Wrap it up dude.
---
Boozing up aside, we also have surplus of everything and having completed the content have very little to do shy of help lower levels out. I received help early on and have always spread the wealth while I can and try to teach the "pay it forward" mentality to those I assist in any way
---
That’s where you’re 100% wrong. I paid my money for my game so it is 1000% about me. You or anyone else doesn’t have the right to tell me how to play or what I should do while I’m playing the game I paid for. Go cry a river somewhere else lame ass.
---
Sinistrmark
---
Haha whoops
---
You're expecting to see a difference of 25% at 4 caps per. Try it on something with a 3 figure value. Believe me it works. 5 caps is the most you can get for Purified Water. Try food items that boost INT such as Grape Mentats, Berry Mentats or Sweet Roll.
---
Magic weapons are broken. People are using broken mechanics to do things that shouldn't be possible in game. The sooner that's fixed, the better. There's a long timer for the event, people can be kind enough to let others get their hits in before they essentially cheat their way to victory. Call it what you want I don't really care, it's cheating. I can't wait for them to fix magic weapons so people can complain some more. You have to go out of your way to be an asshole, just try being nice for once if people like you can even manage it.
---
See when I see a lower level at a workshop I try to see what they are farming and go on a hunt myself and then come back to drop a surplus down for them more so than the resource generators can amass in an hour. Shy of a power plant for the need if quick fusion cores, no higher level should need the workshop to collect supplies
---
Meh, a quick swap to my chinese stealth armor would protect me
---
I’m grinding to max out class freak perk just so I can have energy weapons that don’t suck. I’ve had to scrap good stuff or sell off legendary items.
---
As I say to all these posts, it’s an online game. You would be a fool to buy it and play it for that long not expecting at least some kind of balance changes coming in the future.
---
I can't upvote more than once this post.
---
I don’t use magic weapons. And I can’t stop anyone else from using them. I get my shots and I’m not on here crying like a bitch because I didn’t get to loot a boss. That’s all I’m saying. As far as being kind, this is a game. I’m playing the way I want. You play the way you want. Neither is wrong or right.
---
Most interior locations aren't instanced actually.
---
Just the ones used by the Wastelanders questline. VTU being one of them
---
I love this. It’s something worth grinding for and it adds another parameter that needs to watched
---
I don't think that they are separating the keg/punch bowl on the basis that you can put stuff in it.   I understand your reasoning, but something tells me that they did not put that much thought into it.
---
Take a number, bruh
---
Nvm I found it
---
Or you know, just bug one of the first Main quest lines. Trying a Charisma alt and Inoculation quest is bugged. Not fun times.
---
I did the event so many times 25+ I'm sure and never got the fixer plan. FML. I just want one from the purveyor damn it.
---
Fast travel to Summersville. The first house on the right has about 200 burned text books to collect
---
Source? I have not heard of anyone getting banned because of any xp glitch recently.
---
 It's not about being right or wrong, it's not about telling people not to use them, it's about being NICE to others. "playing the way you want" is just another way of saying you're selfish. People don't understand kindness, it's honestly sad.
---
Im not denying it
---
Oh, ok thanks man!
---
I am trying to say that nobody dropped a nuclear bomb in flatwoods
---
I’m ok with being selfish in a game that I paid for. I don’t owe you anything. You don’t owe me anything. If I’m not good enough to get my shots on then that’s on me.
---
The ammo machine takes literally zero budget. If there is any "ghost" budget while placing them it disappears when you log out.
---
I have 30 of them. Idk why people harp on this budget thing... it doesn't exist...
---
Where did anyone say somebody dropped a nuke?
---
Because there is no chat.
---
I just want more ballistic
---
Absolutely. The best one that springs to mind is adding (Known) in front of plans after learning them.
---
You’re probably experiencing the instigating glitch not magic. If a weapon fires quick enough, instigating applies to multiple shots not just the first one. So you might be getting double damage for 2-4 shots instead of just 1, causing way more DPS
---
You're right, I'm confused. Srry
---
It doesn't
---
Got a nocturnal roll right next to troubleshooter, maybe nocturnal belongs in pool 2?
---
There's that mentality again. Of course you don't owe anyone anything, that's something called courtesy. I'm done with this conversation because clearly you don't understand generosity. Have a good day.
---
Steel Dawn fatigues.
---
Yes. And it applies to the whole weapon mods and all.
---
Then go on your private server. You live in a society not a cave. Remember that and be nice. Don’t be a troglodyte
---
Why the T-45, if you don't mind me asking?I'm a casual player, and I love PA.
---
I wear the T-60 currently, and I'm waiting to upgrade to the X-01 once I can afford the Calibrated leg mod and the torso mod plans I want from the Enclave.
---
I am level 99 and have done nothing today. If I don't finish today I should tomorrow with the weekly reset
---
Holy crap! I was just putting atom store paint on the one I was actively using so it has that Atom logo out next to it. Thank you for sharing this lovely piece of info! Do I have to do it at a workbench?
---
No I don’t think I will I’ll play on public like your dumbass. The only difference is I’m good enough to get shots on a boss and don’t have to cry like a bitch on Reddit. Why don’t YOU all go play on a private server then you can have the legendaries all to yourself and I’ll not have to see these bullshit cry baby ass posts anymore. Oh wait y’all can’t because you’re not good enough to beat anything without people like me. Get good bitch.
---
Well, looks like I'll need to spend some perk points and test this out.
---
Yes
---
It is.
---
Any way to prevent this from happening in the future? I guess making a blueprint is one option, but will cost materials.
---
My wife had this problem, are you using the CAMP skin from the legendary run? If so switch it back to the original.
---
Good i scrolled first to see ive someone already said what i was thinking. And indeed!
---
Omg yes, I’ve made several posts about this as well! It’s got to be done sooner because later it’s just going to be a bigger mess!!
---
u/LadyDevann can you pass this on? It’s really a QoL upgrade.
---
I should clarify that I have one of each of the base sets: Excavator, T-45, T-51 (my favorite, I'm old school), T-60, and X-01.  I don't have all of the T-65 or the two Vault 94 sets yet.
---
I am pretty sure I did it from the Pip-Boy.
---
Right, because IT IS already the inventory management simulator.  That's what I call it now, and since everything is an acronym these days - IMS76.  And with tiy on the other sentiment as well, leave our damage number alone please (a futile request), lets face it, we've been through this how many times already with every patch?  I expect the game to be properly butchered.
---
Recoil on LMG is miserable. Sad that I passed up BE trade offers of it but just can’t deal with it
---
Best guess is that you've got a wire missing somewhere in the setup.
---
If only I could figure out how stuffing a rag in a bottle requires adhesive...
---
PA never made sense to me so I researched a bit and found an old post here written by a player who specializes in PA customization. In the end t/45 just made the most sense for where I am - it’s cheaper to repair, mods are easier to find and it’s right in the middle with regards to resistances. I was able to get my T-45 suit together and modded quickly since I was holding all PA mods and skins I won or found. I already spend too much time farming stuff to feed my gun or my mouth, I think I would become irrationally upset if I had to start feeding  PA to keep it running.
---
E: I currently have full set for excavator, t45, t51, t60. I have a raider set that’s one leg away from being done and an ultracite set where all I have is the helmet, plans and mods so I’m a ways off.
---
No then heart is what I do
---
What makes a weapon magic?
---
Did someone not get tucked in last night with warm milk and cookies?
---
I’m not telling you how to play I’m telling you how to be a human being. You boasting and glowing about your prowess is a sign of a superiority complex. Hope you get better soon!
---
Yep, there was also a scoreboard based on xp gained, mobs and players killed, and time survived, and the top 3 were highlighted on the map; PvE famers often ended up in the top 3 spots and got salty when they were hunted down and killed.
---
hmm  maybe try to buy something small on a new server.  They may be hotfixing.  The cloth donations went live today
---
Turn in those claim tickets at the ski lodge. 20+ pre-war money every time.

Are you talking about dying and quitting to get double the bonus?
---
If your only concern is that you cant use your build till lvl 50 (not doing all the quests again, hunting for plans and recipes, farming bullions from 0) then GZ.
---
It has to have a fire rate about 200 and it can have 3 prefixes like instigating junkies and stalkers and the second star can also make it magic like 50 limb damage 33vats hit chance. Angry turtle has a video about them on his channel
---
Not that I am aware of, other than having minimal decorations and making sure not to overlap anything (assuming that is the cause of the issue). You can blueprint your decorations/rooms for reference though, even though you probably can't place them at least you can see how you had it set up and replicate the look. I did this before moving two times ago, but I ended up wanting a change anyway. I still have them for inspiration though.
---
Pick what?
---
I did that and purchases are working normally again but it did not give me my lost items which is the part that sucks.
---
Knowing how to do something is different than being efficient at it.
---
Hell you could be good at playing video games and if you quit playing for 20 years you'd be rusty as hell. 
---
Or if you want an irl example, people can usually only have their CDL for about 8 years max before they need to be reverified and go through an exam, and yet those truckers are driving every day
---
Plus the "best and brightest" aren't going to be cutting corners fresh out of the vault, they would want to be prepared and given the knowledge and skill sets they will need to be successful
---
It does work - I spent a few months min-max'ing my weight. It's possible to get weapon weight very, very low.
---
Like that one post before Morgan town airport event drops 100.  Otherwise check any register or safe for prewar money
---
I can’t wait for elementary school to start up again that way you can be in class all day

I think one wasteland aims to equalize some of these concerns. the pvp is another story though. good luck!

yeah may have been just that server you were on.  Unlucky
---
True
---
I'm disconnected since 2 days now, the legendary run is far away for me and i feel better now
---
Or even better...a text chat
---
Been trying to tell ppl this but when I failed my first event Saturday being I was only with 3 other team members that where level 40.60,90 and they wouldn’t take care of spawns I had to do damage to earl and take care of spawns so it was a no go and we failed.
---
It seems like it happened exactly when the cloth event went live
---
Yes it does my buddy deleted all stored and all items in his camp after doing it twice and there is like a permanent 7-10% budget that’s stored for no reason other than that
---
Act like an infant and get talked to like one. Go crawl back into your basement hole
---
&gt; Idk where you got that from
---
I got it from the actions of several developers that actually know what they are doing.  I'm sorry you fail to see the sense it makes to do it that way.
---
Why do you think you read about huge ban waves in games?  Do you really think they have a team of people that actually read all those reports?  Some are read and the rest are caught when they find a way to detect the cheat.
---
I get it now
---
I think they should have tons of data broken down for
---
You. Favorite gun, most damage dealt, amount of nukes launched, etc
---
No it was from doing the repeatable xp weekly, That's why do don't see as many 500+ players anymore. Two friends were banned one was level 600+ and the other was reaching 1400.
---
Okay
---
Or at least power armor frames
---
Actually it does. Did it just 5min ago (PC). Ultracite cores at least.
---
*So that was worth a down vote? Ohhhhh Reddit.
---
Bitch I own a home. I work full time ( I’m actually working now ). I’ve got kids and a wife. You’re the one acting like an infant crying about how you’re not good at a video game.
---
Sometimes i try to talk to them but it’s a 50/50 my game chat actually works :/
---
I was level 28 and decided I had to check out a whitesprings nuke. I don’t use power armor and at that time I didn’t even have marsupial yet. I went in solo with my hazmat suit on. Holy shit did I die a lot. But I ended up running into another lower level and he had a mic so I turned mine on and we teamed up. There was a fifteen minute stretch where him and I were hiding up on the hood of a truck in the parking lot. At least ten glowing ones swiping at us, waiting for us to jump down. We were both so low on stims and Radaway that we started taking turns fast traveling out and back with what little we could find in our stashes. I still remember how happy I was when he brought back 2 Radaway and some nuka cherry’s for me. My rads were so bad at that point that I was spawning and dying within minutes because my whole bar was red. That was also the first time I saw legendary enemies. I ended up with ten or so total legendary guns and armor pieces. I felt like a king heading over to the WS station when it was over. Fun stuff.
---
Definitely, I was really disappointed when scrapped my first power armour.
---
Maybe you should say what system you running? I done more then 50 and have not experienced any problems, except when someone use Tesla (PS4 Pro SSD).
---
I had a deathclaw named porkchop that just disappeared. He didn’t die he just wasn’t there when I went to my camp one day.
---
I gave up on trying to sell interesting stuff. Now I just produce ammo at high volume and sell at deep discount near events.
---
Not all heroes wear capes.
---
God the IQ level on you is spectacular. It’s not about being good you moron, it’s about giving people enough time to shoot the damn thing. I hope your wife gets as turned on as you do in regards to this game and all your dazzling achievements
---
If you were good you wouldn’t need people to play a certain way for you to get your shots jackass. That’s the point.
---
Just stay and loot, you don't have to exit
---
I’ve played for almost two years now and just realized you can rename power armor.  It’s a little clunky to find......it’s under the mod menu when you have your power armor on the workbench.
---
Again, the IQ level on you is spectacular. Now back in your hole please
---
Nope didn’t want to give up the income from them and I don’t blame them. I just wish they didnt let them keep the duped legendaries. It was susposed to be a indeterminate maybe permanent ban but ended after a week. So now you have a lot of quasilegal duped stuff
---
I’ll still be good don’t worry. I play on test and while the bloody nerf is bullshit the stealth commando build still melts shit quick. Not quite as quick but quick enough that I won’t mind. It’s all the lame asses that’ll get hit the hardest because they aren’t doing any damage now and they REALLY won’t be once their builds have been nerfed too. That’s the bullshit thing about the “ rebalance “ it’s didn’t balance anything. It just drug everything down a few notches.
---
I played solo exclusively until public teams.  Now I’m usually on a team
---
I'm not entirely sure but based on Dr.Zorbo's ship and how things usually come and go by the weekly resets, I'd assume that the last day for the current legendary run is the 7th(his ship hits rank 100 on the 8th)
---
Lol I don’t think it’s an issue with MY IQ rather your understanding of simple logic. You are the one asking people to slow down FOR YOU. That’s not an us thing bro.
---
That’s what kind giving helping people do.
---
Back in your hole. There ya go...a warm blanky is on the way
---
Right?  I honestly just want to never go to another player's camp again.
---
I think making you unlock the Vault 79 raid would be fair before you access previous plans on another character.  You could even side with a different faction to make things fun.
---
Ya, i have the 90 rw, i was asking if there was more cuz it still weighs 8 lbs
---
Exactly the thoughts I've been having. Thank you for enumerating them!
---
Got a binky coming for you too..dont worry little one I can sing you a bed time lullaby
---
It’s ok your mom sings just fine.
---
It's a pretty big reduction. I don't have the exact numbers right now and it's not on the wiki yet
---
But would i complete the event &amp; quest tho?
---
I can’t hear you through your binky little one
---
What if that doesn’t match their play style?  While you presented an alternative that has always been in the game, surely you must agree that this is the developer’s responsibility to fix?
---
Honestly your issue is not with an item, it’s with a player. Fix these issues and then it will be another thing and another thing. Certain players will be the way they are. You can take away all the game coded issues and the player will still be a jerk. I don’t need a legacy or magic weapon to ruin an event by killing the boss in 4 seconds, I can do a perfectly legal melee build and get that result.
---
Sort by controversial. Apparently it *was* popular
---
Don’t worry your mom hears me fine.
---
I thought they fixed that.  Just did a melee buiod after patch and I only had to collect a ghoul sample and a T-type fuse to get my innoculation.
---
Everything should give more junk than it does. like.. the things it's actually logically made out of. So many things have screws/springs in them for example, where do they all go? Wouldn't have to horde so much junk all the time if such logic existed and you could get them as needed.
---
lol holy man
---
I think it would be a little op because people can server hop to get power armor easily, like im a lvl 15 and have 4 power armor chassis and other armor i cant equip.
---
The atoms should return, offering score and atoms at the same time, not so hard for them to make that. :( 
---
Doing the maths you were able to get 2300-ish atoms per month, now only 2000 atoms in this 10 weeks and only if you complete the legendary run which kind of sucks. 
---
Do you think atoms will return or Bethesda really became one of the greediest companies?
---
I can’t sleep I’m smashing your mom. Wait here comes your sister too.
---
I can't say you're wrong, because i can't proove you're wrong, but let me tell you, this is stupid man...
---
I think rep should be account specific, but plans unlocked for all for role-playing purposes.  But make a clear choice between factions if you want max rep with either one.  Who would trust someone out in the wastes who served both sides if you were a Raider?  Or who wouldn't get paranoid about an OP Vault-dweller in Foundation?  Especially if they came across experimental Vaults.
---
I’m so glad I never got into this game. Sat on my shelf since I played it for a week or so when I first got it. All I ever see is complaints about how bad it is. Idk how Bethesda can keep fucking up so royally with this game.
---
Thank you, bro. I was looking for lower leveled players to give some starter items and didn't knew that. It makes things much easier.
---
Lol working married man with children reverting to childish mom jokes. I seriously doubt you are any of those things lmao. Have a nice day man
---
Hoverboards!
---
or 75 radaway :(
---
You only need the suit to stealth.  The Helmet is just a gas mask.
---
I don’t really care what you believe but if your argument is I came up with a childish response to your childish “ blankly “ response then it’s not my IQ I’d worry about.
---
The woes of a console UI, even on a PC game.
---
I just drop stuff on the front porch of the wayward. New players will be in and out of that place multiple times for the early mission, so sometime will find it. Also, high label players have no reason to go there other than buying gold on Monday, so the odds of them scooping it up are lower than at a train station.
---
That’s unfortunate, hopefully they patch it soon. Thanks.
---
I feel for you. It's the same in ESO, or at least used to be, where people auto kicked low cp (level) people, but it was usually people that came from console over to pc. Usually those who kick people from groups before see what they can do, are the one that are between casual and pro. Too casual to be nice and not bother, but not pro enough to understand how the game and people work. But they think they are best players, that's the difference.
---
You could try in a private world if you know someone with 1st.
---
No I think they are down voting you because you come across as angry and arrogant.
---
I've heard it works if your the first on a fresh server to do the quest.
---
You're welcome to jump into my private server and try it - IGN: Sayres_Law
---
They need to be fast as fuck, like, three times as fast as a yao-gaui, and either camouflaged in open areas or using trees and shadow very well. Like in 4 they should throw shit at you, like cars, or toss you around like a toy.
---
Always the damned Mirelurk Kings, their like the ultimate bullet sponges.
---
Wait!  People use the pieces that are on it?
---
&gt;They did mess up the Raider and Pipe weapons. You can't truly play one if the gear is crap. There needs to be a few different styles like a lot of CAMP objects have.
---
True, they should also implement transmog on the tier sets.
---
&gt;I should never get a melee weapon reward as a Stealth Sniper.
---
OMFG this. I don't care whether they do it through tokens, points, or random drops that are class-restricted, but if I get one more fucking Nocturnal Rolling Pin off an endgame enemy with my stealth commando I'll go berserk.
---
&gt;Fallout has always been about freedom in character creation and how you play. Forcing types would not fit into the game. What happens when I get bored of my Stealth Sniper and want something different? I'd rather have to pay some sort of in-game cost to respec and rechoose my Perks than do what is currently in-game.
---
Mostly agree. There have always been Fallout archetypes/classes thanks to traits and skill points. You aren't making a melee character without Bruiser and starting at 100%+ Melee skill, not making a healer without Good Natured and 100%+ First Aid, and so on. Here, they should be on some gradient from full class-based MMO to MMO-lite with trinity maintaining some Fallout history, but they went full shitshow clinging onto single player mechanics with the added diarrhea of perk cards. My personal preference would be to completely sacrifice single player systems here. Keep the Fallout flavor, but we need MMO meat. As you said, we definitely should not have this restrictive perk card system that is a painfully obvious artifact of some brainlet beancounter wanting to sell us the card packs. SPECIAL should be totally overhauled, uncapped, and balanced as stats would be in any other MMO. Respecs for caps or bullion. Hybrid classes should have tank, dps, heal trees. Right now everyone just goes for Unyielding because of this horribly awkward prefix, SPECIAL, and "everyone can do anything... sort of," bs. Homogenization is not fun. Controlled imbalance through classes and divergent trees that change the way people play is fun.
---
&gt;Eh.....Fallout is America's and BGS is based here. It would cost SO much money to go elsewhere to get more accurate pics and data for another country. Considering how butthurt many of them are and with COVID it isn't going to happen.
---
Honestly, I don't need photorealistic Shanghai or even the implication that we're in China. I just want them to use their assets to the fullest. Going with the communist atom shop items, the Vertibird can land in a nondescript open field, we enter the communist bunker from the atom shop, fight communist skinned/stealth suit equipped elites in the raid, get our tier set, and Vertibird the fuck out. They have an endless train of assets sold as skins on the atom shop that could ALL be expanded to great content. Instead we pay $5 just to look at them on our own character. Pure laziness.
---
I hope some day this IP falls to a good steward who can make a decent MMO or a decent single player game instead of a reskinned Elder Scrolls cash grab. I fear Bethesda is too corporate to properly turn this ship around.
---
Wasn't this bug meant to be fixed?
---
If you want to totally ruin a budget you can make them with iron posts and conduits, lots and lots of conduits. I have a double railing around a section of my base.
---
It does work, I have level 3 bear arms with a reduced weight MIRV fatman. It weights .6 so I believe the perks and legendary weight reduction should be multiplicative.(on a similar note, putting ultra-lightweight on armor with weightless can possibly make it weigh 0)
---
Um maybe it's for the ss one
---
Seriously, 100% the way the big developers do it.  It makes sense to do it that way at the cost of a few angry players.  It stops more hackers and sends the hack creators back to the drawing board.
---
On the other hand, no one is going to spend the kind of money it would take to have a team of people go through reports that pile in daily for a popular game.
---
PUBG had 3 million people playing at it's peak.  Can you imagine the amount of reports that were coming in?
---
CounterStrike has almost a million people playing right now.  Do you think Valve has a team reading reports all day?  It took them years to just get a customer support team.
---
The point is this way is cheaper on resources and has the best outcome to ban in waves.  It keeps the hack creators guessing and puts more work on them.
---
Do you have a nuka dragon build, I'd be interested in seeing it.
---
I was having severe internet issues yesterday when this happened to me. I dropped connection apparently when someone was in my vendors and the anti duping system locked me from the servers for a span. When I came back online and was allowed back in it disabled my vendors for the rest of the day to be safe. Last night I was able to reload my vendors. If I had not panicked the items would have just clicked back into selling mode when I logged in instead of the third time that day putting them back in.
---
There's no penalty if you don't have the innoculation and don't do the Wastelanders quest.  You don't get the Scorched Plague.  I was in Scorched Earth events and only had casual death and some Blight, but didn't start hallucinating or having Scorched treat me as friendly NPC's.  It would force you to start the main questline if there was a risk of that happening.
---
50 mirelurk kings on the wall
---
50 mirelurk kings
---
You take one down, lose some rounds, 91 glowing deathclaws left on the wall
---
Had the glitch come up probably less than an hour ago. Stupid part was that when I respawned at vault 76, I was still underweight
---
Well if I go and launch the nuke and I’m in the event with friends it would be harder to get us all to leave and then rejoin another instance when we’re all together. I’m glad you haven’t had a problem with randoms but I have lol
---

---
 &gt; Sure I'll bring this up :)
---
I miss the dead bank robbers of fallout 4 now more than ever.
---
Point Taken, and I know WL put the guy out front asking if you were there for knowledge, ec...
---
Given the scorchbeast DNA is a pre-wastelanders challenge - that I recall, The interior was never scaled before - (wheras scaling “new” interiors makes sense) - thats why I was surprised by the high level enemies.
---
White spring but also any responder vendor can. Seen  the plan at Welch and Charleston stations.
---
Can I favorite it so I do not accidentally scrap it?
---
Depends, I've been on since Beta and my lowest character is in the 80s. That one had no problems with the event and was more than pulling their weight. 
---
Under level 50s I can understand as they haven't maxed out their SPECIAL and if they are new to the game may also be new to how to get the most out of that. But I've gone to that event with people much higher levelled who weren't very well equipped for the event and suffered for it.
---
I wish it was just vats that hated me, but everything that can do damage hates me, deciding my armor doesn't exist.
---
They are very quick to ban for basically anything. 😗 I was for 'speaking negative about Bethesda' cuz I simply said Bethesda "doesn't know what they're doing" about a particular broken mechanic that I don't remember. So I joined V9 with other refugees banned for petty reasons. 😏
---
I probably scrapped a thousand pieces of combat armor in order to unlock BOS for everything. Nice to know theres a source for the plans.
---
Well it brought higher numbers down more so than the Lower numbers so it did balance a lot I think
---
I still don’t know why I got banned.
---
Do you have the flux, they require stable flux in order to put it on even if your just put the skin on
---
You realise you are talking about games that actually have an anti-cheat system to actually spot hackers. I'm just saying.
---
Look out it's crazy frog!! Lol
---
I keep my dropped items bag as a gift box for a reason. Low levels and people in need are often nearby. I sell needed plans cheap and often craft items that new players can grow into. People did it for all five of my toons so why not do it for them. If you ever see me drop a gift, it may be anything from a handy wall plan, purified water, soup, or just some ammo for the gun I see you carrying. 
---
It just makes sense to me.
---
Yes, as Chaz says, straight from the Pipboy like you rename your armor/weapons.
---
It might be because many of us came from previous Fallout games.  We were never into the pvp mentality.   Now that we find ourselves in this Wasteland, we find it harsh, we remember how overwhelming it was at the beginning, and we therefore  want to help others.   As long as they don't demand it.   "Give me all your X or else I'll nuke your camp" is a good way to have the person just hop or kill you, depending on their mood.
---
Add Desk fans and Globes to your must grab list and you'll never go short again.
---
Shoot the scorched count would be in the millions for me im sure lol
---
So Bethesda should adjust the entire event for you and your buddies, got it
---
This happened to me a few days ago but relogging fixed it for me. I went through every single entry in the computer and then quit the game. When I came back in it was asking me to put in the t-fuse again (did not have to get it again) so I did that and then it worked fine.
---
Now whether or not it had anything to do with reading all the entries on the computer I can't really say. My guess it was just fixed for me by the relogg but it might be worth trying.
---
You don't. It's not available yet.
---
You can't yet. They need to be released in the atomic shop and then claimed before you can craft them
---
Do you have the jet pack plan for the power armor, you need to know it before you can build the captain cosmos one.
---
Have you learned the jetpack plan for the base armor you're attempting to craft it for?
---
It's the insurgents outfit, anyone who has learned the plan can craft you one. But the plan itself was quite rare from the treasure hunter event
---
Mirelurk kings are the bane of my existence. JUST DIE ALREADY
---
Even better is when they glitch through the wall and then proceed to kill Earle before the wait timer finishes.
---
OMFG you are such a beta. WAHHH My No EmOtE iS ToO mEaN!!!1!1!!2!
---
Returns as Armor Ace in two weeks?
---
Yeah you’re very right. I’ll prob try it out again sometime, I just have so many other games I need to finish before starting something new... again... XD
---
Haven’t experienced that yet but I’ve had to glitch through to find him after he decides to teleport through the ceiling
---
I’m using a PS4 Slim if that makes a difference at all
---
I disagree 
---
I enjoy caps.. 
---
gives me a daily feeling of accomplishment that makes me feel all warm inside.. good stuff...
---
Yeah because I had the free states jet pack on it aready
---
Murderhobo &gt; Murderbureaucrat
---
Whatever man.  Can't show you the way things are in the real world outside your bubble.  Everything isn't always exactly how one perceives it.  Get mad at a company for doing things the sensible way which yields the best results.
---
Plus I still have to finish all the dlc from Fallout 4 when I played through it last year lol
---
Going to a camp with high scrap and find out they’re just selling bone and leather at 6 caps a piece, or going to a camp for plans and it’s just wall mounted taxidermy pieces :((
---
The hell would you allow that. Participate in the event and get what you worked for, or get nothing at all. Tell me if im wrong in understanding, but this is what I say from what i read from this
---
Suggestion to make the tequilas go further - make them into the margarita version! It turns every one tequila into three, at the cost of the hunger restoration. All you need is corpse seed juice, which can be obtained from any death blossoms event.
---
Lmao no. I’m not the only person asking for a level floor there have been a ton of posts about it
---
The gauntlet from foundation? If so no the powerfist is better
---
I expect alot of bugs and think it might be best to stay away for a day or two after release.  
---
I have two characters, one 302 bloodied and one 125 nonbloodied.   I did the second today for the first time since doing the last Wastelander mission on the vault.   What a chore.   If my other one turns out to be like this after they reduce perk multiplication and increase enemy strength, I can't see myself enjoying it much.
---
Do both :]
---
Fallout 4 had this, I remember one of my playthroughs ended with over 5000 human kills, I’d love to know how many players I’ve murked in this game.
---
They could always create a category for “dispenser” or “container” if they want to distinguish those. But I agree it is hard to justify even having a “miscellaneous” category.
---
Aren't those crates instanced? I heard this tip before and leave stuff behind often, but I've never seen anything in them beyond the occasional boiled water and canned dog food (which i think spawns in them after you pick up the holotape the first time).
---
Free time and far less fewer angry people demanding your Fallout time when you’re in the middle of a move are what you are earning after completing the Legendary Run. Go outside, read a book, or better yet, grab a box... this shits gotta get outta here by TONIGHT!
---
Glass cavern was my spot for fiber optic 😒
---
Oh yeah, sorry. I looked in the wrong list. Lol
---
Well, I should go for the armor only then...
---
I use the "no" and then "sorry" and that usually does the job.
---
Check the event viewer to see what's happening when you get in the game. If there's any errors or drivers that crash, it's gonna get logged there.
---
Thanks, I’ll message you when I get home from work and see if you’re around
---
It takes them forever to fix stuff like that, so who knows.
---
One Wasteland has been known about for months on end. People knew about it when ACP released and they still wanted it to change.
---
Vault steel and legendary modules are not limited per day. If you server hop you can buy more.
---
But I agree if the limits were loser I could play more
---
Although you could sell extras for caps, that is not a good argument (and definitely not mine.)
---
With all the possible counters to it, the obvious on is the 30k cap limit. So, its even capped. What then?
---
I agree, a change of some kind should come. Beth and other game developers think adding limits makes people play more. But it really makes them play less - because they can't. 
---
Capped stash box, capped cap limit, scrip, bulion, ect. It just gets frustrating and like you said, no fun. If I'm not having fun, why play? I dont mind grinding, but after less than an hour I've hit all my limits.
---
I had this problem yesterday.  Logging in/out didn't work and neither did restarting the client. I ended up scrapping / rebuilding the Ally console and then I then logged out and in again. I was then able to talk to her again and progress.  
---
I think it has something to do with Emerson not spawning correctly as at that point the dialogue should switch to him iirc.
---
The clean metal stairs are nice too
---
Shows how much you need to learn about the whole process.  Cheat programs don't always just pick up a cheat as soon as it's released and used.  That is what the cheat maker does to make it undetectable and what I've been trying to explain.  You dismiss me instead of seeing the common sense I'm trying to explain.
---
I'm done.  Do yourself a favor and do some research before you tell someone what they are saying is stupid and don't make sense.  You make yourself look stupid instead.
---
Edit:  Cheat programs usually have more than one cheat in them.  Why ban one of the cheats so that it's obvious and can be fixed to work again when you can keep the hacker clueless which was the reason for the ban and make them do the whole program over from scratch and give players a longer reprieve from hackers in their game?  Does that make sense?  Works for games with or without anti cheat programs.  I'm not going further into it.  Done
---
There's an ammo converter and an armco ammo machine you can get legit from legendary race and raider rep.
---
But if its the actual machine from the munitions factory that's different
---
The stones are part of the lore in real life. Those stones exist in the real world and were really controversial when they were first erected because it says to limit the world population to like 65 million or something like that... meaning the anonymous person who paid for them to be made thinks billions of people should die lol why wouldn't they add that gem into a fallout game it fits perfectly!
---
I was level 34 when a couple of 150s gave me a lot of stuff and explained about how power Armour works and , more importantly,  how to get the super high jump
---
So you can craft a t65 jet pack if it’s free states with Out knowing the plan but other skis. Like this one and the moth man I own I can’t craft because I didn’t buy the plan. But being I’m able to have a jet pack With just a different skin on without spending 2000 bullion I’m ok with it
---
ty, I didn't know that about the Vault steel.
---
we did not know it would be applied to ACP until 5 days ago.
---
Yeah I get it.
---
Yeah I didn’t linger. I immediately stealthed through site alpha and launched a nuke.  He left server.
---
It’s for x-01 armor which in hindsight I should go for t65
---
Well worth it I have it on all of my characters,  my 2 heavy gunners have full unyielding and full vanguards on each
---
I realized on the 4th and 5th that mixing it up on full health was better than going full vanguards.. what I do Is get the plans use 5 modules on each and pick the best 3 star .. when I have all 3 stars I’ll start to refine it to get what I want..
---
This is the ONLY online game I play, and probably will remain so, simply for this reason. I'm not a PvP person, and I just prefer getting along with others. I'm so thankful this game allows and encourages that. I just can't see myself playing GTA online or RDR2 online, because they both seem like they could get toxic fast.
---
No free states let’s you craft it like I said in my post to you I never learned the plan for t65 jet pack but I can have a free states on there so I just kept it and same goes with x01 you can have free states jet pack on without knowing plan but if you want the other skins you have to buy the plan
---
I read on here that someone put a rug down and put the stuff on top of it and then removes the rug and it's not as bad.
---
Lol damn
---
and yet I have seen many posts asking for the same thing I’m asking for
---
There definitely is a benefit to killing people and you can steal junk.
---
That gauntlet couldn't hold a candle against the power fist especially the puncturing one with the rebar hanging off of it.
---
This is an old bug that was fixed, but has came back. Bethesda needs to fix it again.
---
There are no crashing or errors that happen when this problem occurs.
---
That's not how things are gonna work. Areas will have different min. values for level scaling, so you won't see lvl 5 enemies in the Bog.
---
Go heavy and get a gatling gun!
---
Ok thanks
---
Only if you want to pay to win.
---
Unfortunately not.

I'm one space behind the ship since last Thursday (when finished all weekly), I have a similar story, played fallout when it had a free week on xbox for about 5 hours (like early May) then since July 12 when it arrived on xbox game pass. 
---
I wasted most of the challenges until the end of the first double score weekend because I had no idea about the score system, then I been doing all the challenges and I'm at level 90 I think, just one behind the green ship. 
---
I think the season ends next September 7 or 8 (when zorbo's ship gets to level 100), doing the maths as every level asks more and more SCORE I will need to buy the last 1 and a half level (unless they add more challenges or something this upcoming week). :/
---
for sure, until you have your lvl 50 you change gear so often, you d'ont even need to repair it. and once you level up a bit, you do the scorbut queen and get repair pack
---
stand proud then.
---
Noooooo im sneaky like a snek tho
---
Gauss minigun because it's more powerful.   I use a modified plasma caster as a sniper weapon.   The Hunter Gauss minigun is used to really hurt the SBQ.
---
This a is a mobile game what do you expect lol
---
I actually quit playing a few months ago because of how horribly, endlessly grindy this game is. And I hate quitting so much, because I love the Fallout universe.
---
But JESUS, that grind.
---
So the Power Fist is basically the best unarmed weapon in the whole game?
---
straight up, and they non stop stagger
---
Did all of the scavengers die?  You need at least one of them too.  Not sure otherwise.
---
Yeah. Navigating through the categories is an absolute nightmare. I always seem to not be able to find stuff and when I do, the item is under an irrelevant category
---
ScorchQueenBeast
---
No, all scavengers were alive. I'll add that to the main post.
---
not me, friend. not me.
---
I had a few want to trade for my scout mask or my b handmade. Most the time nothing good on their end.but this last clown that wanted my hm had several legacy's 2 b2525 fixers b2525 hm be HM's 
---
But gave him the thumbs down.with that arsenal why would you want mine?
---
I have a noob cabin: garden water purifiers, ammo collectron, and yes, shower. I love when lowbies come and buy some of my stupid cheap inv management vending. If they spend 100 caps i deck them out in whatev they need. I love my camp visitors!
---
No one deposited ore because they were all farming ghouls for xp
---
Ford Defiance.. they're not special or rare, but people like to collect the different colors.
---
Here's the list and where to find the clean variety:
---
[https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Asylum\_worker\_uniform](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Asylum_worker_uniform)
---
they serve different purposes. plasma caster is supposed to be an ammo-efficient way to deal with trash mobs, gauss minigun is supposed to be used against stronger targets.
---
unless you can somehow keep the minigun fed, of course.
---
Thx
---
When I switch characters there is a nuke counter on top..is that how many scorched earths I been in?its low like 56 or something
---
The gauss mini with out a doubt.
---
I was updating my camp by Purveyor Murgh when it happened today. It’s not a huge deal, I just want that damn secret fireplace!
---
Which is all fine and dandy until the first person that reaches the body takes everything. That would be worse than having the afk guy get loot in my opinion. Everyone would be more focused on positioning than actually killing the thing.
---
No, its only in a few places within fort defiance, there is videos on you tube that show you where to look.
---
You have to have done the brotherhood part of the main storyline as you need access to the 3rd floor of the asylum. 
---
So. You spawn in at the fort. 
---
Run past the mobs and inside. 
---
Go through the left security door then right and up the lift to the 3rd floor. 
---
When the door opens you'll see a room with beds straight across from the lift. The bed you can see is a potential spawn point for a uniform. 
---
Go out of the room and go left. 
---
There is another bedroom and the middle bed is another potential spawn point. 
---
Leave the room and go into the shower room straight ahead. This is the third and final spawn point for one of the rare uniforms. 
---
IF you pick up a uniform in one of these spawn points another will not spawn until you have picked up x amount of items in the world. Once you get the hang of the run it takes like 2 mins from spawning in to logging out and then logging in to check again. 
---
I spent 150 hours looking for a red and never found one. And i only found a yellow and a forest after 130 hours (within an hour of each other) but then found another yellow and forest in the next 20 hours. 
---
Prices based on my experience of selling lots of them and trading.
---
Hats are worthless.
---
White dirty/Withered - worthless
---
White Clean - up to 500 caps
---
Brown - up to 1k
---
Blue - up to 5k
---
Green - up to 5k
---
Pink - up to 12k
---
Yellow - up to 15k
---
Forest - up to 25k
---
Red - trade only. Easily 100k+ caps
---
I'm pretty sure its not..so if you dont mind just pass that on to me.I'm sure a lead pipe would be a reasonable swap? 👍🤔
---
Same happened to me mid way through ACP
---
Isn't that the whole point of the event?
---
Only 3rd floor Fort defiance in the room across from the elevator on the bed, down the hall last room on right on a bed and final one in the bathroom on the bench, I've got a complete set with some extras, only took me since release to get them all, got the red one 2 months ago. Good luck
---
do events and other things to level up
---
Well that sucks.
---
I found whitespring an excellent spot, but eventually got bored and moved to the highest point on the map I could find. No enemies there, but less business.
---
Gatling plasma for the win!
---
Thx a lot
---
Pretty sure those are in Georgia
---
if you waited until the last second it sometimes doesn't register for several seconds
---
I want an emote to laugh at people
---
I waited for around the 30 second mark
---
AH; cheers for that bit of info!
---
This is a problem with a number of events, the people working on the objectives get screwed on XP and loot.
---
I dropped about 50 lbs of known plans/recipes that I didn't have any space to sell in my vender off to a new player yesterday.  I just dropped one of each.  They joined my team for about an hour and they told me 15 minutes later that it was still naming stuff they unlocked.
---
Have you run into a trap camp yet?
---
upgrade your gear.. always use whatever is "best" at the time until you hit 50 and start getting max lvl gear..
---
this only applies until 1wasteland.. but right now you should be spending most of your time in the toxic valley and ash heap doing events and side quests and unlocking locations.. maybe a little bit in the savage divide.. but stick near top of the world until your gear is better..
---
forget about main quests in the bog and mire until youre better prepared or 1wasteland drops
---
your right at that place where the best perks are unlocking so now is the time to dial in your build so youre ready when you start getting max lvl gear
---
Technically, yes. Most players would rather get the kills, XP, and legendaries.
---
Silver Shroud Plushie has been on sale the whole week.
---
The others have been changing out every day, and Croc is the last one in the rotation.
---
Didn’t the cap limit use to be 25k?
---
thumb up!
---
The Plasma Caster for Ammo efficienty play style
---
and the gaus minigun for the dpm it can produce
---
it depends on the person its self, i got both. for normal playing the plasma caster is the way to go because most die oneshot and bigger mobs take 1 or 2 shot more cost/gain top weapon. but for hunting big mobs like the queen sure the gauss minigun outrun the caster but the costs are pretty high \^\^
---
Right, thanks for the advice. I’ll move around ash heap for a while. Thanks.
---
WELL!
---
That’s what I’ve been told which sucks cuz I just reupped first and then my Xbox crapped out on me lol I was hoping to not pay again and I’m not at least not any time soon.
---
Then you are stupid!
---
If you put something on top of a rug, removing the rug will store the items.
---
I hate Mirelurk King as much as I hate mole rats.
---
It's not meant to be easy.
---
Did it 3 times today on xbone with no problems. joined a team of 3 and 2 of them were together. and each time we had between 6-8 people. Once i felt like i'd do enough damage to the boss i took care of the wendigos fast.
---
Jesus christ i'm not that stupid, like c'mon wtf are you saying man. You're shit only make some sense if there's a freaking anti-cheat system to play with. Im sorry you feel stupid about that, but i'm saying that if it is true, in the Fallout 76's situation thats a stupid tactic to use. There's hackers everywhere. If there's a proof...ban him...there's no point to keep the dude in the game as the exploit can't actually be detected by anything.
---
It's all i'm saying.
---
I feel like GunFu will go bye bye with this update.
---
That's my #2 spot for plastic.
---
I haven't run into anyone there during MonsterMash thank goodness. It's crazy XP if you stick around for it with all the XP buffs.
---
I figured it out, my computer had my headset set to default for Recording Devices, so going into ARk and FO76, those are games with open mic, so the game would turn off my headset as an audio output and change it to a recording device, which made me lose sound. 
---
Noticed this when I opened the sound device tab and i opened the Recording tab and my sound would immediately turn off whenever i went into the recording tab.
---
Yes I had this problem also with my .50 Cal machine gun. It was the first time I have experienced that, but this is also my first character that uses heavy guns.
---
I get what you mean. But unless you go there while the event is on, this shouldn’t be an issue. 
---
Assuming you have pacifist on, loot to your heart’s content and don’t worry about who shoots you. 
---
But if you decided it’s a good idea to loot the place while the event is going on and people are fighting each other. Then there’s nothing that can be done.
---
I have, but it was actually nice. The guy let me take my stuff back- I think they’re a little fun when they’re creative
---
The game itself has beaten it out of us, so it cultivates a strong sense of sympathy and empathy for fellow wastelanders.
---
What is your SPECIAL loadout? If all of your perks are geared toward weight reduction, you might be missing out on some damage perks. What kind of weapons are you using/build are you building? I can give better advice once I know what you're working with.
---
This bug happens a lot to me. Super frustrating, but not enough to quit playing LOL
---
So he went through your stuff then gave it back?
---
Welcome general. We members are glad to have you.
---
*siren* warning soguyswedidit6969420 is launching a nuke! "Warning please check your area"
---
No, he just didn’t take it at all- or, if he did, it was something I didn’t even notice
---
Blue ridge mountains!
---
Dont lose hope. You will do just fine.
---
It seems to be really, really bad with the gauss weapons. You might consider going back to a western revolver until they sort it out. Still happens with those, but at a significantly reduced rate.
---
I hit lvl198 on the weekend, over 18 months of playing and over 600hrs, still have yet to launch a nuke. I haven’t even finished off the wastelander quests because all my limited time goes to the legendary run score.
---
I want to be mean, but I wont. Instead, some constructive criticism; I can't see a damn thing in that walkthrough.
---
Maybe the adhesive is flammable too? 🤣
---
Thank you for actually responding
---
&gt;  and Croc is the last one in the rotation.
---
They saved the best for last. I bought every one of the 24 hour sale ones except for Grognak and made a totem pole out of them.
---
Fun video. A bit dark (yes I know I know, it's supposed to be) but for those viewing the video and not actually running through it, it would help to lighten it a bit so we can see all your hard work!     Good stuff!
---
I'll never understand how this bug is still happening to people. I thought it was pretty common knowledge that you need to log out 5 mins before reset. At this point it's your own fault
---
mirelurk king is the worst
---
Yes, Teslas are a No No during ACP.
---
Well they should add some stuff i feel its been awhile since anything was addded
---
Nobody is one shotting anything now. And what other damage type does as much as bloody? None. Junkies is closest but it still lags behind bloody a fair ways. The new nerf doesn’t touch legacies. Not even a little. It also doesn’t touch magic weapons. 
---
I like the idea of raising damage resistance instead of blanket nerfs.
---
They gave us the sleezy bed and rug last month. But I agree more outfits.
---
Bingo

If you're on PC I'll make you one for free.

Im right there with ya.... dumb molerats
---
I would, but my Fo1st ran out a few weeks ago.
---
Thanks that’s what I suspected. I could only hear sounds but screen is like a horrible slide show. I don’t know how they could keep playing until the end. Maybe it doesn’t affect the user, only other participants?
---
I noticed it a ton with my shotgunner...noticed if I fired immediately after I got into vats I’d miss...giving it a half of a half of a second pause before firing helped immensely. Tiniest pause...
---
Edit...Non gauss shotguns

Honestly I had no idea what I was doing at the start so wasted a few perks. I’m not really building towards a particular build either, mostly because I have no idea how to. Any help giving me some sort of direction would help massively.
---
VATS is pretty borked right now. Most of the time the miss happens on the first shot you take when entering VATS. I found that if you activate VATS then exit and reenter seems to be the only work around. Also Western Revolvers (and I’m sure many other weapons) have high VATS accuracy for a split second when entering or swapping via Gunfu, kind of gives it a quickdraw feel to it. So if you are fast enough you can hit some really long shots.
---
Not a "build" video but will do some soon
---
It was an Atom Store building set.
---
We can help you level up. What timezone you in?
---
It's the contemporary camp bundle from atom store (when available...).
---
Whitesprings is probably your busiest station...maybe not quite as busy since ACP but still pretty busy
---
Yeah that guy is completely wrong. I built my camp at the guide stones and am certain they're supposed to be something related to the Zeta aliens. Nothing to support that of course, it just seems the most logical answer.
---
As a side note Mothman and the Flatwoods Monster spawn there often.
---
The "fix" for that is a long range weapon w/scope, standing on top of the prime event junk tower things if you have marsupial, then watching for that legendary at the end. Just VATS tag it once, or if there's other junk around scope aim and tag it, then let the other people kill it. Loot's all yours.     Or find some high ground for the same effect if you can't jump up on the beams.
---
Hardly missed a single one doing this.
---
I name them * T45, * EX, * U and so on. That way they all appear together at the top of the list.
---
So I’ve run it 3 times with only one real completion because the other 2 had technical difficulties. Earl flew through the floor, and I died at the end of the last one and missed out on the completion. I think that the event rightfully punishes low levels for existing, and realistically they should be joining teams to power level and make their builds. 
---
I am also on Xbox and have found success with an explosive .50 and a bloodied plasma caster. No magic weapons here. Everyone is collectively dumping maybe tens of thousands of rounds- make sure you’re using crafting perks when making ammo too. 
---
Overall this isn’t meant to be easy, make sure you’re well prepared.
---
Just inspect it while in inventory
---
Hi Ho, Silver! Awaaaaaaaaaay!!!!!!
---
You will search forever my man lol it's an Atomic shop item. It's actually a floor.
---
What kind of weapons do you want to [primarily] use? Keep in mind that even the most min-max'd builds can use weapons outside of their specialty to nice effect so you're not really limiting yourself from too much by choosing a weapon class, but you are deciding into what you'd like to pour most of your power. The weapons you want to use will dictate what perks to build toward.
---
 Bloody will always be strongest but now I guess furious wouldn’t be bad or even an anti armor gauss minigun. But if the level of armor mattered for damage it wouldn’t be so bad to hurt the boss. Basically from what I understand if nothing hits over 400 damage a hit you will be doing crazy crap damage. But if armor Tati nu a did matter we would actually do more damage but it would benefit all builds since it would be enemy
---
Related and not personal damage related. Armor sucks in this game. If you have a full vanguard set it could be wood and it’s no different than vanguard SS in terms of damage protection.
---
With great power, comes weak ass durability
---
You can stand on too of Seneca rocks and do it.

Ah, thank you wise dweller
---
I’m definitely more of a fan of old fashioned guns than anything else. Rifles mainly.
---
Yeah I'm 2 spots behind the guy. It's got really slow leveling up. Maybe I'll pass, maybe not, not too worried about it.
---
I'll collect low level stuff and wait at the 76 to give new vaulters guns and stims
---
I think I'm gonna make it around the place where you get the asylum dresses since some of the higher level people go there.
---
The gta and cod toxic players can stay in the cesspool they belong in
---
That must be some really good nukashine because I think you got the stories muddled although now I want to know about the radroach and the Grafton monster... Do you remember it at all or is the alcohol drunken stranger?
---
A tale for another time perhaps
---
Edit: updated my question.
---
Old-fashioned meaning what? Each weapon class has old fashioned and newer sci-fi type weapons in them. For example, the rifle class encompasses both ballistic rifles and laser rifles; heavy guns are both .50 cal machine guns and laser Gatling guns, etc.
---
Try using someone decontamination shower as they log off. then head to a queen fight. no one knows this bug.
---
I just started playing few days ago i cant even deal damage to the wendigo
---
thanks
---
What’s your build? Do you have a build or is just random cards? Have you looked into armor or being stealthy? Are you using chems for buffs? Are you joining teams? Are you playing solo? 
---
As far as caps and fast travels you can join a team of 4 and use their camps as soft free Travel points or use the perk card travel agent like 30% less to fast travel. An easy way to make caps (1200 caps a day) would be to kill enemies like Super Mutants and mole miners, they drop guns and melee weapons that can be sold for a pretty penny if you have a few “unyielding “ pieces, “Charisma” is what you need to sell items at a higher value or just use the Hard Bargain perk card. 
---
As for having stealth and armor I suggest going the settlers route for the wastelanders quest not necessarily siding with them but going as far “Invisible ties” this will give you access to the stealth armor Extremely high radiation resistance (like P.A) and also give you a “perma” stealth boy field as long as your crouching you can still move and be invisible as long as your crouched, this not only gives your survivability but extra damages as a successful sneak attack can la d you 2x the Damage and with perk card you can even raise that up... well I ranted enough idk of this helps you but yea enjoy your time in the wastes!
---
I remember in the early days of 76 frames would give you a shit ton of stuff
---
Stick a forceful stock on it.
---
Until you hit level 50 I wouldn't worry about being able to take on all comers. Once you pass the level cap for weapons and gear and all your drops are max you'll notice a massive difference.
---
lights in the table lamps section
---
Some mods improve the durability a bit. Some hurt it badly.
---
Also get Weapon Artisan rank 3 obviously.
---
$100 that never happens
---
The desert variation is nice
---
I'm level 106 Heavy Bloodied build and I can put damage in, i think ACP is all about team work.
---
i didnt even know you could place those extractors thanks for the tip
---
I'm not sure if the pools change but I'm going to have another  hundred crafts and I'll compare. I wish I started from the beginning but who thought it'd be this consistent
---
The Fixer has the highest damage output for rifles and the handmade is just behind it. The regular combat rifle is just okay.
---
Really showing my noob ness now haha.
---
Rifles 100% would be my ideal.
---
whats meat week? im a new player
---
Honestly pick a location you like...if your selection is enticing enough on the map, shoppers will come
---
My junkies explosive handmade has been in my arsenal for over 100 levels. I have not found anything better.
---
Indeed, it's gotten pretty bad.  In theory, my Western Revolver is supposed to crit every-other-hit.  In practice?  The hits don't count a good 30% of the time.  This makes it wildly unreliable, and because revolvers aren't fast shooters to begin with, that's a lot of damage I'm missing out on.  Gauss-anything is only worse, because the charging mechanic doesn't play nice with VATS.
---
Partly because of the PTS rebalance, and partly because of issues like this, I gravitated my Riflemen to Commando and Gunslinger to Guerilla.  At least one of those bullets is bound to count.
---
And I'm saying it's not that easy.  Granted the playerbase is pretty small, but do you think there is actually a large team that sits all day reading player's reports?  
---
Not sure how the system I mentioned would be any different.  Does Bethesda not update their game to get rid of cheats?  Every search I do shows that they do.  Even without one they wouldn't want to ban every player right off the bat that they can prove cheats.  Why?  I already told you why.
---
Ultimately, what Bethesda does is what Bethesda does.  Do you sit in on meetings and hear about their plans for dealing with cheaters?  Have they done an interview and said they don't want to ban cheaters?  Have they never banned anyone for cheating?
---
The truth is no one knows (except anyone banned) but Bethesda.  I can't say what their plans are.  You can't.
---
I only state what properly run multiplayer games do to curb cheating.  You called it stupid and that shows your lack of understanding when it comes to cheating and how it's dealt with.
---
You tell them stalin
---
Most of the stuff on him is crap anyways. I'd rather it be an in and out with no damage to my stuff most times I end up with a pack of lowbie assholes who bitch and complain that I'm not saving them from the pack of wendigos they pulled.
---
As a fellow solo player since beta i think i can commiserate about the incoming nerf.
---
Especially since my Unarmed build relies heavily on stealth to be effective and if i have to believe the reports from the pts they not only majorly crippled Unarmed damage but also managed to mess up stealth too.
---
I have no intention to start a melodrama but i think i'll be taking a good, long break from FO76 if these changes make it to the game.
---
It shouldn't fail if you put in 40. It can get frustrating though. I'm quite happy to heave on my janky old power armour, snort handfuls of radaway and trudge around collecting ore.
---
But one person only collecting ore isnt enough, it doesent respawn in time for that same person to collect it again.
---
Also, the people farming xp and not collecting ore are missing out, when you go down to collect ore there's usually high level nasties just hanging around a  corner just begging for a grenade or two.
---
they are supposed to be inconvenient they are the toads defence
---
Not yet had a problem, only ran its about 10 Tims now. Was doing a trade on here the other day and by chance the event popped up so we both joined, it was only the 2 of us and we still managed it easy with 10 mins to spare.
---
Holy scrip that’s scary, does it also affect the tesla user? During the event when I checked the map I saw two higher levels left the event, I probably wasn’t alone.
---
It would be magic but the fire rate needs to be atleast 200
---
I would like to (try to) roll a bloody harpoon with reduced weight to play around with as they seem really rare that they drop at all, even the useless ones.
---
but I actually don't know what to do with my Modules/Scrip anymore cuz of inventory weight. They made them heavier a while back and keeping up with the daily scrip limit and buying them when capped has been weighing me down along with the untradeable items when I try to roll something. They could certainly go for some more use and a lot of QoL.
---
Ok thx I'll look into it
---
I give credit to the BoS quest because it does talk about ultracite and the need for better defense against the scorched. For a group of power armor users to have designed better power armor, it feels meaningful. Personally, for story reasons I would have preferred that they awarded it BEFORE you go into the glass cavern so that you could be "suitably prepared" but I understand that it's more of a capstone reward and I'm sure that at least some people would never do that quest if they could get the armor without it.
---
That happens with any interaction item. I was on an armor bench last time I was playing and this happened
---
Thats cool
---
It did. Just as stash used to be 400, then 600. Better. Not great.
---
That’s not correct about the wood not being different than SS. The damage resistance numbers are very different. 
---
And I still hit way over 400 damage per shot with stealth commando on test server.
---
It affects the user &amp; whoever's around them. For me, it was one area in the Mine that nobody could go to for the rest of the fight as it looked "Fuzzy" and if you stepped into said area your frames would drop while you get screamed at by wendigos.
---
K thanks
---
That’s a nice, uh, codpiece ya got there
---
No I mean vanguard alone is enough to protect you from the damage protection cap. That’s what I find dumb
---
I mean, if you don’t do that just don’t take workshops and expect to be safe all the time. It’s that simple
---

Hey, we all have cravings for late nights snacks so why not make it 3 Star Legendary?  
---
I LOATHE Bloodied and Unyielding. I LOATHE gear that's effects don't kick in until you underpowered or have some de-buff.  
---
Fallout is largely American fan based and I don't have much interest in going to every place every fan thinks the story needs to go to.  
---
However, considering the timeline and all then Russia and China would be the top two, IMO.  
---
They are a business like any other and without a good profit margin they'll put Fallout in limbo and focus on the bigger money makers. Thing is if you hire fans to work on something they love then it mostly b/c work and not fun.
---
It’s very bad with gauss weapons, but I’m having a ton of issues with my fixer, too. Many times VATS will hit, I see the damage that should have been dealt on screen, but the enemy takes zero damage.
---
I also notice my VATS shots do significantly less damage than manual aiming and I don’t have the aiming effect on the weapon. It’s all borked.
---
Well, honestly my issue is with the vast amount of broken weapons, which are more or less encouraging this kind of behaviour. I dont see 3 out of 5 people raping earle or the sbq in melee combat. OP melee builds need at least some kind of effort/knowledge, whereas anybody can pull out a gun with broken effects. But i get your point as if somebody wants to ruin your fun he/she will find a way. Doesn't change the fact that there are too many broken weapons in the game.
---
Difference is negligible. I run around with intel over 30. Have a buddy with about 3 intel. 
---
Both With scrapper perk i might get like 2 more steel and 2 wood a piece than him.
---
I’m excited for you! I wish I could start over sometimes without knowledge of how builds work. I had the most fun when I played casually and not always trying to find the highest damage output.
---
Welcome back and I hope you’re here to stay!
---
Oh in that case I’m not sure. I haven’t messed with vanguard a lot. I know I see a difference when I switch from my heavy leather unyielding wwr set to my SS unyielding sentinel. The SS seems to protect much better.
---
I literally hate earle.... this wendingos are so annoying. 
---
SBQ any day of the week lol
---
200 is a myth that has miraculously not died out yet. You can achieve the bug with an automatic laser rifle, which is I believe 91 normally and 114 or so with ffr. It's a bugged version of the furious effect resembling the fo4 uncapped one being applied, so the most important thing is having a *respectable* fire rate and hitting shots consistently, with minimal variation between limbs. Accelerated barrel on the minigun is too inaccurate to consistently trigger this beyond point blank range, while the tri barrel makes it much more consistent and only slightly slower. Due to the extra damage, you are also able to hit that ridiculous instakill point with fewer shots anyway.
---
However, this is easier to do on PC, because due to the dinosaur engine, framerate affects how your hits are registered, so playing at a higher framerate makes it easier to trigger this bug. It's harder on consoles but should still be possible unless it gets to a point where the enemy moves around too much too quickly to get off the required amount of shots

I have a legit vendor with good shit and reasonable prices, but inside my house I have one room filled with traps with a vendor turned off ,
---
the room has signs and warnings that this is my private vendor, and another sign that says do not enter but players go in anyway and get mad when I collect their junk.
---
Good to know. Not that I don’t trust a fellow Enclave member, but has there been any proof of people rolling SS armour or weapons from these events yet?
---
You’ll get there. But I agree they are annoying!
---
This happened to me while playing banjo, it was hilarious and I wonder if other players see you like this or normally?
---
Those Blue Preservation Shelters would be a decent Copyright free version.
---
Plus the game already has one that is functionally a door.
---
Shared scrapbox! it's ridiculous that it isn't
---
Ella Ames' Bunker is an easy source for some each day.
---
It's pretty wild seeing 1500 to 1700 damage listed on the weapon card and knowing it's really four times that since it's a shotgun blast. I think the highest I've taken the listed damage to was 2100. Going to enjoy it while I can... hard hitters like that are getting nerfed the most after all and once they fix the ammo glitch it will pretty much only be used to shoot the SBQ when she wont land. Stupid thing has a range of 400 something.
---
Anyone?
---
lol
---
Yeah that seems odd. Maybe the combined damage of all the gutsys was above 880? That’s one thing I’m not really clear on is how damage resistances are calculated in this game. I mean obviously I feel like the higher the better but if no matter how big the number you still only get credit for half that’s not right.
---
I typically wear the worn dress I think it's called. The Mistress of Mystery related one. Then I switched to the asylum dress with a welder's mask just to be weird. More clothing would be more bettererer.
---
I have good luck finding them at the random spawn just north of where you load in when you map to the Miners Monument south of Whitespring.
---
How else would you know what cool items you are missing out on?! Or what lame items you never bothered to buy/get the plan for?
---
Now that scrip is an integral part to crafting it needs to be raised to 500.
---
It used to just be a way to get more chances at legendaries,  now you need it to build your gear. Time to change it up Bethesda!
---
Weapon artisan perk lets you repair beyond the usual.  Pretty sure thats the name of the perk card under intelligence ...
---
Oh i see, those guys just kept spamming it so I thought they’re probably immune to it. I tried to move around but it was all the same lag, even when I’m respawned upstairs.
---
Play on public teams, and try not to fast travel so much. there are loads of cool little locations (future FT points, and side quests) that you're probably missing out on. I'm on xbox. I will be on in a few minutes, I would be happy to help you mod and maximize the gear that you have. GT is Deviant Monster
---
Meanwhile a level seven has 3 other 400+ level alt accounts.
---
And it might randomly explode and take out your camp
---
Did a line in the sand with one guy using a .50cal that showed exploding shotgun round. Basically was insta killing everything so noone else could get any exp.
---
Lagged the hell out of my computer with the amount of flak they were putting out.
---
So yes, I agree with removing hacked weapons and banning the people owning one.
---
Are Police Boxes unique to Doctor Who? I was under the impression that they were similar to phone booths in the states.
---
I think your seeing your level in nuclear winter?
---
Ok.ok that makes Sense...
---
It also sucks when you have everything working right and a ton of people join who are a high enough level but just leave halfway through so you just wasted ammo for nothing
---
Seriously. Its so annoying. I got 900 scrip yesterday and got legendary modules, I dont play every day so 900 scrip isn't just 8 days for me it can take weeks.  
---
Looking for a good unyielding secret service right arm. Rolled 9. Didn't get a single one. Now have to wait over the span of a few days to get rid of the shit I rolled and several more day to find and scrip more legendaries.  
---
A little would go a long way with RNG and the limits they have imposed on the game.
---
It's a jerkomatic 3000
---
Personally I just started a new character to experience it from start to finish again. There's enough new stuff to make it feel fresh.
---
Ah my mistake, I should have had junkies in that list.  I never run with chems so I forget about it sometimes.
---
Or you have complete dumbasses who have no idea how boss events work
---
it's not meant to be easy
---
as for the lag. maybe someone had a tesla. that seems to be the main problem.
---
No, but a too on the nose reference may make Bethesda a bit timid for legal reasons.
---
Lol, "not special or rare".
---
It is a lot of fun. I enjoy all the random encounters with other players and helping out low levels if I can. I gave one a them a TSE FR (I forget the 3rd star but it was fairly good) combat shottie, next things he's off to the scrip vendor hahaha easy come I suppose
---
Fallout 76 has the least toxic community of an online open world game.
---
Heavy Duty
---
True! We also have the small letters to write on it.  
---
Also, there's the Secret Society elevator thingy that would make a really nice shelter/secret entrance :)
---
Lol....oops....but honestly that's more accurate...lol
---
And does age matter because I’m 11 and don’t want to annoy you-
---
Yes its magic. Any gun with a speed of 150+ will trigger the magic effect as long as you have one of the legendary effects. I've been doing this with a B50LD LMG or galling lasers.
---
Angry turtle explains this at 7:10. https://youtu.be/9mRX-MEPzhs
---
Crafting some of the armors.
---
Oo a fancy pencil skirt would be nice. Even the little aviator hat for a stewardess would also be awesome. Do this Bethesda!
---
Ah ok, which ones are the best?  I’ve only crafted a gauss shotgun so far.  It’s alright...
---
Exactly
---
Id vendor the fusion vores I usually sell them cod you can get a few caps for them even like 10-20%
---
Open the “share” feature in PS4. Link your PS4 to your twitter account. Post the pic. Go to your Twitter. Save it from the post and delete the post (if you want to delete)
---
Had just run Lucky Hole and activated Mt Blair.
---
I know. I missed out on the Bog Wanderer outfit.
---
Really plan a build for yourself thats the biggest thing that can help than you can look for the right gear to be able to compete with the higher lvl enemies.
---
 The biggest thing that helps for mission completion is stealth. Yes you lose xp from enemy kills but you stay alive finish the mission. Sometimes avoiding a fight if possible is the only way in those areas. I finished the game twice under lvl 50 this way. Also Join teams to cut down your travel costs.
---
interesting, i thought 200 was required for all the heavy guns. yeah i play on console so it's probably way easier on PC to achieve it.
---
You mean fallout vigil
---
What legendary effects?
---
alright, guess it's not just me then ;)
---
Yeah, the same with the dead robots in Welch.
---
Yes it been a week
---
..........
---
If you go to the mine near the fissure site, I don't remember which. There's a couple of ultracite veins in there, also if you do scorched earth and line in the sand a lot, or just duck about in the cranberry bog
---
 Scorthbeast bones give you ultracite
---
Ikr 🙄
---
Toxic valley doesn't count
---
Yao guais also drop screws and springs, up by the black bear Lodge there's usually like 4
---
Gotcha. Alright, so, a powerful rifle build wants to have the majority of points in Perception, Agility, and Luck, with the rest scattered around elsewhere. Perception is where all the rifle perks are; agility impacts AP and VATS; Luck impacts a few different things.
---
Perks to look out for/equip if you have them:
---
Perception - all the Rifleman perks (Rifleman, Master, Expert); Tank Killer; Concentrated Fire. This is assuming you are using VATS.
---
Agility - Keeping with the VATS assumption, you might look into: Gun Fu, Adrenaline, AP Boy/Girl. I also use Evasive between it gives nice buffs the higher your agility level.
---
Luck - Bloody Mess is a must. I also suggest Starched Genes and Class Freak, which I'll discuss in a minute. You could also look at Grim Reaper Sprint if you use VATS a lot.
---
Charisma - Don't sleep on Charisma. There's a lot of perks here that will help you overall in big ways. For example, if you have Inspirational maxed out and are on a team, that's 15% extra XP for everything you do. Strange in Numbers enhances your mutations. (More on them in a second.) Travel Agent makes fast traveling cheaper. Hard Bargain makes vendor prices cheaper and allow you to sell to vendors for more. Lots of versatility in the Charisma perk tree.
---
Mutations: Hop around the map, look for people selling serums. So long as you try to remain on public teams and have both Class Freak and Starched Genes equipped, mutations are a necessary part of higher level game play. They provide amazing buffs and with the perks I mentioned equipped, almost no nerfing. Mutations to look out for: Marsupial (that's the one that lets people jump crazy high, it also increases carry weight capacity); Adrenal (you do more damage the lower your health); Egghead (increases XP, much like Inspirational, and they stack); Eagle Eyes (buffs perception, useful for rifle builds); Herd Mentality (when used with Strange in Numbers, while you are on a team, you gain +3 to ALL SPECIALs); Speed Demon (faster movement and reloading); and Healing Factor (health regenerates when you're well fed and hydrated). Each mutation also carries a penalty but those penalties are almost negated by the Class Freak perk.
---
So aye, those are my big tips: aim for perks that increase your damage and mitigate the negative effects of other great perks; if you don't use public teams, start doing so, especially with Charisma perks; and if you're not mutated, get mutated ASAP.
---
OH MY.... YES.
---
I always have to throw my equipment on a stash toon and inconvenience a courier to help lol... Why is there even a limit on scrip, should I not be rewarded for having a ton of weapons to scrip? Idk, I hope they address this somehow and maybe the stash weight. Without Fo1st, 90% of your stash is junk.
---
Vault 94 gear, save the mask.
---
Also the caps limit is ridiculous
---
Out of curiosity, which weapons? I’ve never had that requirement when I crafted my gauss pistol and plasma caster.
---
I tried about 30 rolls today and unfortunately my experience has not matched the results posted above. Stuff ending up in pools they shouldn't be in. Was worth a shot :(
---
Would love to see this grow with more data
---
There’s no daily limit on legendary modules and vault steel. If you manage to run out for the day just switch servers it resets
---
I've never been to a colossus event that's lasted more than 5 minutes. Never had it lag either including when the wife broke out her auto Tesla. And this is in Australia where the internet isn't fast enough to be classed as 3rd world. But the game seems to have a lot less issues on PC too.
---
I do the same.  No point in firing a single bullet at Earle.
---
It is strange way to say god mode bug but sure yeah
---
Most points you need for heavy gunner build is strength if I remember correctly
---
Pools are subject to day by day change. Once I do a few more tests I'll be able to write a strategy up that might at least help
---
I think I may seriously look into getting a SSD for my PS4 - thanks OP. I am growing sick to death of the textures not rendering properly in game; it's seriously impacting on my enjoyment of the game. Bethesda engine is fecking tragic.
---
My bad. It’s for crafting some of the armors.
---
Yes it indeed is, make sure to upgrade it to 3 stars for twice the durability.
---
Only issue I have isn't the difficulty it's I can't change my weapons using the weapon wheel with out my game freezing to 1/frame a sec.
---
So this is still a thing
---
This is how the group I run with does it.
---
How about the dude either just sell them at a discount, dump trash Legends (obviously can farm more than he can use) or just take a break from playing except to scrip?
---
You know, maybe if this wasn’t a blob of info and you weren’t fuming the entire rant, someone would actually (might) read it.
---
Lmfao ok so nice. What time will you be on?
---
About 3 and a half hours from now
---
Yea. Someone else pointed that out. Ty. I didn’t know that. I’m more into getting them to raise the scrip limit though.
---
I have been waiting for the croc plush, thanks for the heads up to login.
---
Luck of the Draw
---
This.  Not sure where I started but am over 10k in screws currently.  Always get ported out at end with full rewards.  If the battle lasts long enough, you’ve got four team members and all are doing Wendy control you can regularly leave the event with 300 screws.
---
No problem. I have older videos up on YouTube with some PvP before present nerfs. I quit YouTube before a lot of the PvP stuff changed. Still happy to answer questions, though.
---
This is the way. I don't care what the other mods do for this slot, forceful stock is on all my auto rifles, shotguns, rifles, lasers, etc.
---
Unfortunately too few people actually care about the objective.
---
You can also fast travel to teammates in the mine after the event starts so smash queen join the one rando public team i. The mine and poof you in
---
When I have lowlevels in my team I usually drop stuff in suitcases at train stations and then DM them
---
If scrip behaved like treasury notes, I’d be really happy.
---
These are the same people that fuck someone in the ass and don't the common courtesy to give them a reach around.
---
My video in my side looked good, but i will make a new one. Thanks for telling me!
---
What are your requirements
---
I will make a new one! And photos! Thanks ❤️
---
Simp
---
Bah, lmg is a lightweight when it comes to recoil.  Try a railroad rifle on full auto. Now that is recoil my friend.
---
I personally have gotten them from Fasnacht and Meat Week. No pictures though, you’ll just have to take my word for it I guess. Haven’t gotten any from the purveyor though.
---
Personally I'd prefer to make the power armor chasis not scrappable at all.  I've accidently scraped it a few times.
---
barely anyone there? it's 8 max and there were 5 of you. 
---
did you try killing the wendigos?
---
I mean they are definitely not trying to play some mind games...they need to deal with the amount of data they receive from reports.
---
Anyway peace man im out.
---
Thank you. Just trying to help those who haven't given up on energy weapons like I have
---
Honey beasts, mutated humans, and snallys.
---
I agree with OP. I'm a role player,  not a powergamer so I'm going to miss lower level areas where I can actually play the character and build that I want to. Level scaling blows, part of a rpg is leveling and getting stronger than enemies.  This ruined swtor(now you have to fight past every single mob, there are no trash mobs anymore) and im pretty sure it's going to ruin this game for me and anyone who's not a powergamer.
---
Lol! I don’t mess with those choo choos even though I have a j2525
---
Yeah I use a furious faster fire rate gatling and I love it
---
Oh you mean the 70s porn bed that sized for a teenager or is there a new one?
---
I don't no if it will be tougher. Yes they are bringing in a damage nerf but if that means your damage actually counts instead of putting 20 shots to the head for 3k without moving health bar yet one shotting them in the chest for 700, then it will make life life easier.
---
I think there is a dead honey beast there already.
---
I have done it maybe 30 times, lost only twice. First loss was completely my fault, dumb me didn’t bring enough ammo to the fight lmao. Second time was due to Tesla lag. The battle itself is fun and very doable. Watch for the hazmat piles, falling debris (some are barely visible) and bubble bath summoned by Earle. Keep some distance, aim for the head and use structures for cover.
---
Wait, there was a legendary enemy at the meat week? I didn’t see it once. It was the same with the legendary mega sloth at the Fasnacht event, I wouldn’t have believed it if I didn’t see it once out of the 30 times I did the event.
---
nope
---
Honestly, I have no idea what they use for anti cheat.  What I've searched is they do have one currently.  No idea what it is but I hope it's better than the one they used in 2018 that was a line of code that listed the cheat programs and could easily be edited by the player.  lol
---
I've seen people explain the system better than I did here.  Probably should have just linked you there even though I thought it could use more explaining of certain reasons and so forth.
---
I am sorry if I offended you during my spiel.
---
Wow - for once they actually have a good reason for nerf  things
---
I started up a new playthrough of FO4. Taking a break is a good thing! Start up an new game!
---
ive had numerous things not show in my inventory and they come back after I close the game completely and restart. Hope that helps.
---
I wanted that red one so bad... spent hours server hopping trying to get it, to no avail. I just gave up on that grind.
---
Then, months later at a SBQ event I spot a player wearing said uniform, and me wearing my "Pink Uniform." 
---
He thumbs me down, then I see him going into his Pip Boy, the paper bag drops..... and ...... it was the Red Uniform. 
---
It was probably duped but I was the happiest I've ever been in that game. Good dude.
---
Workshop PvP, collecting weapons, and farming xp.

Try this build to work with the special points you currently have: [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwgMBAEKBwcBAQEIBgkKDA0PEAIsQAEnAvABA8QBAxABxQEDzQEBpgEDDQNwBYIBBacBA14CbAOsAQHrAQM2AuUBBLsBA9UBAdcBARkDAA==](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwgMBAEKBwcBAQEIBgkKDA0PEAIsQAEnAvABA8QBAxABxQEDzQEBpgEDDQNwBYIBBacBA14CbAOsAQHrAQM2AuUBBLsBA9UBAdcBARkDAA==) I recommend an instigating gun for this build. hunting rifle would be pretty good. combat rifle or handmade would also be serviceable with hardened receiver.
---
and this bloodied build for later on: [https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQMBQQECgoBAQELAQIDBQYJCgwNDxAuQAEnAncD8AEDxAEDEAHFAQPMAQPNAQGmAQNwAgoDggEFpwED8QEDwgEBbANRA+sBAzYCGAG7AQPXAQEA](https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#AwQMBQQECgoBAQELAQIDBQYJCgwNDxAuQAEnAncD8AEDxAEDEAHFAQPMAQPNAQGmAQNwAgoDggEFpwED8QEDwgEBbANRA+sBAzYCGAG7AQPXAQEA)  with this build use 3 pieces of unyielding armor and 2 others (bolstering, chameleon or lifesaving). This is a team build. use a bloodied hunting rifle, semi auto combat or handmade rifle. for further awesomeness just replace rifleman cards with commando cards and go full auto!
---
What mod is that you're using for chat?
---
Same here. By the way - vanguard or bolstering?
---
Tesla screw any event, put them away until they fix it.
---
Welll if your fine with cringy and rapy and fucking about me and my buds would gladly execpt and yes we do missions but we don't expect anything of any were all fairly low im level 69-70 the highest is 80 i believe we all have a pretty good knowledge and have done most every mission so if your interested heres my gt Husker#2068 we are all Americans
---
I haven't even been playing 2 full months - and I have a backlog of 350 treasury notes, and 3500+lbs of extra legendaries to script.
---
PvP, making unique camps, and collecting all the plans
---
N O
---
When people hear god mode they think only of the unkillable part and not the other effects, so i try not to use that term.
---
motion assist mod for power armor torso gives more strength
---
It is if you play on PC, thanks to hackers. I have a set of unyielding/ap/sent strangler PA sitting on my mule account.
---
finding a goofy gun, like a quad revolver or a quad lever action, and just running around with it. shovels are also acceptable. i think anything that makes me abandon my high damage build like this can be lots of fun!
---
I dont know whats going on in the art department, but there are a few PA skins with big power crotches. Check out the Settler power armor skin.
---
Honestly it's kinda daunting. I've heard of builds but I'd rather ignore them and play. I guess I have the benefit of no friends to play the game.
---
I actually barely need it... It's honestly more so the screws and occasional PA repairs... But since I don't use that much I'm not to tight on that...
---
The marketing part didn't occur to me, but it's obvious, isn't it? Guess it'll never change.
---
Gonna day the same thing, this is the only place I’ve come across them.
---
Thought power armor could be scrapped was nerfed around the 1 month to 2 month mark that it released because I remember doing it after beta.
---
Anyone know exactly what the final day is?  Looking at the game board, I'm thinking one week?
---
I wouldn't mind seeing an Ultracite workshop out in the Cranberry Bog. Maybe put it kind of close to Glass Caverns for continuity sake.
---
Speaking of Alphabetical order suggestions
---
Should be Rifleman, Rifleman Expert, Rifleman Master.
---
Instead it's just scattered everywhere in the alphabetical order of perks.
---
What do you mean? You found a low pop server?
---
The day they add instanced houses is the day you pay literally hundreds of dollars or real life money to get them all.
---
If they follow ESO, any 'mansion' can climb to like 10-15k of crown credits which is in the $100-$150 range. Its fucking stupid for an imaginary house. Even your mid level houses are about $50. With the smaller villas and apartments like $15. 
---
I think the camp interiors will end up the size of maybe the log cabin pre fabs. I don't think theyll be huge.
---
ROFL!! OMG! That had me wiping tears out of my eyes! Thank you SO much for taking the time to share this!
---
There are plenty enough places to go to snag a workshop for a challenge and avoid 99,9% of the rest of the time
---
It's nice to see this after getting my Dad got his workshops stolen by a level 240.
---
I only pull mine out if it looks like any event is going to fail.
---
1st time ever that I’ve seen that .... was going to launch a Nuke to do ACP ... lol
---
Seems like the new “Public” Event has pushed a LOT of people to private worlds for Farming this event
---
Yeah I do something pretty similar. If you play on PC I highly recommend using the load out mod because it lets you switch with a push of a button.
---
If you are gifting junk the best way is to secret service jetpack into the sky and land with a deathly splat right in front of them. Quickest way to drop junk from inventory and it gets their attention too.
---
I tried that and sadly it didn't work.  I'm only out 270 caps so it's not really a big deal it's just annoying that it's still a problem
---
It is indeed open to all.
---
https://discord.gg/ZZRqHsG
---
You’re the hero fallout 76 deserves
---
I make the gift emote first, and then drop, so they know what I am doing.
---
I think they should just put a warning like "you don't have the minimum level, are you sure you want to join this event?" because otherwise that would be kind of discriminate, imagine having to reach level 100 just to play this event.
---
I have completed it with teams of very low and some high levels (once we killed Earl in the last 5 seconds), with just one more guy and more than 8 minutes left, also failed one with high levels because all were bloddied and died a lot. 
---
So it doesn't matter a lot, if you have at least 2 good teammates, a lot of stims and ammo you can complete it without much trouble.
---
 For the most part people do it cuz they wanna do the queen after earl and half the time we cant cuz everyone wants to go do the queen over earl
---
Thank you all! Excited to start building my collection
---
Put the radio on, pick a direction, and wander off with my sniper rifle at the ready. Explore locations I pass near to for any enemies and interesting junk, and pop to a red rocket/train station when I need to stash stuff.
---
Oohh ok well hopefully the scaling is still a good gap between lower and higher level areas
---
I'm not saying it should be easy.  But to give a monster an across-the-board 80% damage reduction is the laziest possible way to make a boss tough.   Think about all the other interesting boss battles in games  -- there are a LOT of ways to make it a challenge  without just nerfing all incoming damage.
---
I’m referring to thorn, solar and strangler heart armor. Each takes 10 to craft, provided you use armor and power smith.
---
The mask is a separate item.
---
This game is pretty intimidating compared to the other fallout games. I had a few people chase me down to give me much needed aid and ammo when I first started. I’ve even had people pm me that they’d give me plans or help me out with armour/weapons or builds. (I am awful at this game, I’m not going to lie) so it was really nice. There are some people who are all business and hot heads, which I can understand in some instances, but I overall it can be a turnoff, especially for people who are actually trying. 
---
I offer low levels what I can spare and I sell stuff for super cheap if they happen upon my camp. I remember being sent a really mean pm because I didn’t do much damage during an event but I used up all 50 of my stim packs on myself but mostly others as I was running around reviving. I was about to sign off and someone dropped a bunch of stuff for me including a legendary and did the heart emote. Made my day. I’d like to be one of the people who positively impact the community.
---
MLK was nerfed two patches ago I believe, used to be even nastier. Now a couple of bullets from a gatling gun can melt them.
---
Oh ok, thank you for the information. I had only heard about that requirement in angry turtles videos
---
I don't think anyone should be banned for acquiring the weapon without running 3rd party software.
---
That dangerous rhetoric would knock out a large chunk of the pc player base. Might as well take the game offline as there'd be under a thousand players left.
---
Not sure what that had to do with the sound bug I was talking about.
---
Could have sworn that things "placed" out in the world, meaning not in containers which are "personalized" and everyone gets their own loot were one and done.
---
So me and Bob both see a bobblehead on a desk, only one of us can pick it up.
---
junk
---
Ammo. Reasonably priced 50 cal, 2mm, fuel, and 5mm.
---
Thanks.  I'm on PC and I don't know of a method to DM another player.  Not possible on PC?
---
Lead, all the lead, I crave lead.
---
I buy most other scrap at 1 cap each, just to burn caps.
---
Also all the flux if it's cheap (100 caps) or some flux if i'm getting close to max caps (up to 250 caps ea)
---
Not right now as i'm at weight limits, but i'll buy cheap legendaries for scrip, i generally pay up to 100 caps per star on weapons, 50 on armour, might pay more for lighter stuff as i can carry more of it.
---
what group are you in just wondering im in one too
---
Yeah I'm thinking the Jangles Backpack will probably be good enough for me, I like the idea of changing the PA jetpack but I rarely use PA in the first place.
---
Thanks.  I've done that but its only worked once.
---
This isn’t some shitty mobile game. These limits have got to go.
---
never seen anyone say that tbh 
---
i got one from grahm. a furious one.
---
No, no it shouldn't.  They should fix the bug that creates these low charged cores in the first place.  Or give you a way to repurpose or re-use partially spent cores.  But if I have 800 Ultracite fusion cores and 30 of them have 10% charge, I want a reload to select one of the fully charged cores first.  If I'm in the middle of an Earle fight or SBQ bash, I want 999 shots, not 99.
---
I usually but plans or recipes. Sometimes I'll buy 1 ammo 3 times just to do the challenge.
---
you can also get them from mumbles.  Note you must know the plan to get legendary variants from any source.
---
I LOVE IT HAHAH, yea nah i sell all the ammo even nukes for 1 cap just to rid myself of the weight, sometimes ill just dump it all on a freshy near vault 76

Absolutely this. The number should also tie directly to rewards. If you’ve killed 5k wendigos with a handmade, you get rewarded a wendigo skin for your hm. If you want another one for your fixer, use it to kill another 5k. This will make people play like crazy and also the skin becomes very special, not everyone with a few atoms can get it, nor can they get it by doing boring dailies. Target-specific skins, how awesome would that be.
---
My only real question is why? Have you actually missed it? There is more functionality at Foundation...
---
 
---
​I don't think this is going to be a positive change at all. When I started playing you went into areas outside the forest at your own peril. The sense of dread if a SB or SQ spawned by you was real. Level 62 Feral Ghouls swarming you was something to be very wary of. I can remember my 1st encounters with all 3 very well. It gave me the drive to level up, get better at the game &amp; grind for better gear &amp; I'm a better player for all of it.
---
I "earned my stripes". I don't want to have to walk around in my best gear to farm the Forest areas, Toxic Valley, or the Divide for resources. I earned the ability to one shot something if I needed or wanted to. Mommy Bethesda didn't hold my hand &amp; give me a cake walk through the entire map. And to add to the fun I walked everywhere, didn't FT at all. I learned where I could go &amp; couldn't, how to get out of trouble, how to use everything in the game as it exists today to my advantage. Those of you that want the map handed to you are just cheating yourselves.
---
But Mommy I cant fight the SQB...well if your below level 50 you don't belong there. Learn to walk before you run.
---
But Mommy I cant do ACP either...again if you aren't leveled enough &amp; have decent gear don't even try. All you do is screw up the event for the people that do.
---
Division 2 did something similar, the game is still a wreck. Builds &amp; weapons being nerfed or changed every week to satisfy players that couldn't handle the areas they ventured into. I gave up on that mess long ago, I might as well have tossed $100 in the trash. Fallout 76 looks like its headed in the same direction.
---
You're not really missing out by not capitalizing on that STR boost. With PA, you're benefitting more from the damage resistance than anything else. If you're running a melee-focused build in PA, you need at minimum 9 STR anyway for the three base damage cards, Incisor and Martial Artist. My Junkies PA melee guy runs 15 STR for those, Traveling Pharmacy and Blocker, then stacks food, chem and alcohol effects for some really nice multipliers. If you want a fun melee PA build, run Core Assembly, the arm mods that reduce the cost of power attacks, and eat some AP stuff (check out Hard Lemonade for something that never spoils). You can spam power attacks for days and days.
---
If you want to capitalize on that free STR boost, though, and don't want to focus on melee, get rank 3 of Incisor or the three base damage cards, get the biggest Instigating melee weapon you can find, and power attack trash mobs.
---
I guess it’s an attempt to stop dupers being able to get crap loads of scrap from duping random sets In the world and scrapping hundreds of pieces. That and the perk super duper can sometimes result In you getting two of the same piece from building one, happened to me the other day when I built an excavator set, ended up with 2 torsos and 2 left arms which I didn’t even know was possible. Didn’t help in anyway since I’m pretty sure I got 1 steel scrap each upon scrapping the extra pieces.
---
Any in particular?
---
Yeah, other ways to fix it are great options too. Our situations are reversed because i don't have resources for even 50 ultracite cores. 
---
With a lot of cores, your reasoning makes sense. 
---
With not as many, mine makes sense. 
---
No perfect system currently. Both a fix to the reload bug and a way to mix/recharge cores would be great.
---
But thats what gets frustrating. So many people say "no because it would effect me poorly due to having so many cores". That can't be the only mind set. Everyone else matters too.
---
Theoretically, my way would still be good. If they fix the bug AND prioritize the lowest, you would theoretically only have one low core. Assuming it works as intended
---
PA stops being an advantage and starts becoming a disadvantage very quickly.
---
Blowing up cars
---
Likewise here...I have 8 different (skins) P.A. between 4 characters. Waiting to display them. I carry around one set on each character. Just in case if I want to jump down high altitude or if I need to jump higher. (Step up ladder with marsupial). Also if I get stuck somewhere, glitched.
---
Resource management is pretty much what the entire game is built around. It isn't a question of "playstyle," managing your ammo pool via crafting, scavenging, trade, etc. is what the game is. It's everyone's playstyle unless you're melee
---
So a common thing im seeing in the comments is Flux, does it really go for 100 caps each, what it used for? I have an absurd amount of it and can only make 5.56 ultracite ammo with it
---
It's cool, but this would be more efficient to let you start the ghouls then he finish them ;)
---
Let us have a behemoth with radioactive farts, we feed him out depleted cores, await the fart and have a charged core.
---
40mm grenades, Oil, and Flux.
---
People buy a lot of adhesive, lead, fiber optics, ultracite scrap, nuclear waste.  Probably more but my mind is going blank right now.
---
Any useful scrap will sell if it is a bargain.
---
And Rad-X/Radaway.. it better be cheap because that stuff is everywhere.  I don't put it in my vendor any more.
---
Buying mutation serum plans is a good investment, the serums sell for 350+ and go like hotcakes.
---
40mm Grenade are the bane of my stash haha, but good to know thank you :)
---
I'm 100% down with pvp but never got the whole camp destruction thing.  Just doesn't rustle my jimmies I guess.  
---
But yeah this is why my pvp characters all have camps that are easy to fix.
---
awww shucks, there now were even
---
Oh, thanks - good to know
---
So you decided PVP was bad and causing people to leave so then you stopped doing that and then you went back to doing that. Sounds like you really learned your lesson.
---
I’ll play at 5:40
---
You can have more than 150 scrips per day. A lot of daily quests gives you additional 8-11 scrips.
---
What is it with scrapper perk
---
I think its done with camp spawning fir example by placing the table and chair where the deathe claw spawns in
---
I think the building is called Arktos Pharma, in the South West corner of the map. You need Ghoulish to survive it. 0, 1, or even 2 briefcases on the second floor. Plus a ton of yellow crates. You could get lucky enough to have 2 cases and 4 codes right away. Congrats, now you console people know hah.
---
Good to know , i have a full shop with plans and recipes for 50 caps a pop and they seem to sell fast
---
It's bogus that arches cost so much to repair, but they won't ever think to address it unless people complain. Destroying it causes them to complain.
---
Imo- camps should be free to repair. I'd love to battle it out in someone's custom fort, but everyone's too scared of the repair costs.
---
stat buffs from equipment don't allow you to take perks you couldn't otherwise take.
---
So for example if you have 1 str in your level up screen but pa boosts it to 10, you can only take 1 solitary str perk at rank 1. 
---
So if you are making a heavy gunner you are likely going to want at least 9 str for the heavy gunner perks if not more for other stuff like bear arms or what have you.
---
So read the terminal and if it doesn’t change from “analyze blood sample” then server hop and try again?
---
I mean....in all fairness SBQ is a "boss" in the online Bethesda game version of the word..... while I agree deathclaws need to be buffed it would be very scary if they were a bunch of mini-SBQs running around, legendary status and all.
---
Glitched quest items that don't get removed from your inventory. I want them all!
---
Still in the works if I’m not mistaken
---
Croc. I. Need. *ok bry just gotta finish work"
---
"Baaaaaaaaabe. I neeed a faaaaaavor"
---
Back at ya hahahah
---
1) Go look at the map.
---
2) Hover over any quest objective marker
---
3) press it and select "make only this active"
---
4) press it again and select "hide marker (?)"
---
Congrats, right side of screen is free.
---
Whoever designed the UI for this game needs to be blacklisted from the industry
---
Amazing how did u get the post so close to make it rounded. And are those double brick walls?
---
You do realize that bulking certain items makes them heavier, correct?
---
Unless that has been fixed, you may not be getting the space savings you think.
---
As far as selling goes, I believe anything that can't be bulked, the vendors will buy loose.
---
Large, modern howitzers have a range of 22-25km with normal rounds and 30km or so with rocket assisted rounds.  Given that this isn't a modern howitzer and doesn't even have a crew manning it...and the map covers basically all of West Virginia (130 miles x 240 miles give or take), I think it would be pretty unlikely for it to cover the whole map. :(
---
All that steel you’re dropping because you don’t have fo1st, I’ll buy that from you. All of it
---
yes, and make sure to not install the type t fuse until after the blood smaple analysis is complete
---
My first time doing encryptid was on private server i thought it was just a regular quest.
---
Didnt go so well
---
I kinda agree. I set my base near the SBQ nukezone, just within range of her, and my artillery can blast the minions she spawns. Being so close though is an issue, obviously. I think I'd be way cooler if you could call in a strike from at least halfway across the map
---
You can make radshields though, and they are worth 50 caps.  Not hard to make, you can get about 40 if you get on a roll finding the strangler blooms.  And Berry Mentats, I can make a thousand of them in one day if I have enough mentats.  The berries are easy to find.  Good caps source.
---
Sorry for the late question, but do different workshops give different CAMP plans? Or is claiming one sufficient? Thanks!
---
I wish I could upvote this harder.
---
No, it hasn't been enabled on the Nintendo Switch yet
---
I have 2 months worth of treasury notes. I don’t know why I play anymore.
---
Thank you! Yes, using double brick walls and if you stack two metal beams on top of each other then blueprint them it allows you to place them anywhere without them snapping, meaning you can place them close together
---
While PA caps your Str for carry weight, your damage bonus appears to be based on the Str points you put into your special (tested on my own melee PA build). Sure, you'll lose some carry capacity, but you can correct that eventually by applying calibrated shocks to your PA legs for +50 carry capacity each (yes it stacks with 2x). If you are interested in melee weapons and heavy weapons you're going to need all of those Str points to get as many of those perks as you can. The damage cards are both under the Str category, so don't short yourself there. If you're going to split between melee and rifles, just keep in mind that every point of Str you have adds to your melee damage even without using perk cards, so spending the points elsewhere will make your melee less effective.
---
It happened again today, a lovely girl gave me loads of stuff after a quest then told me to come to her base to get more. I love this game and it’s players, it’s so wholesome.
---
How about a tab just for my
---
atom shop purchases? I'm tired of looking for them.
---
Only if you guys don't make any Doctor Who references.
---
That sounds terrible. 
---

The truth is, you are a low level until you pass the level cap, especially if you play solo. Really, you might still feel pretty low level past 50, depending on your build. And most wont have a completed, decent build until past level 50. 
---
It helps to join public teams that boost xp gain or stats. Those teams don’t mean you actually play together, though you can. Most people join just for the boosts and then do their own thing. 
---
This is not regular single player FO. You are not going to be an unbeatable god any time soon. It is “balanced“ for coop, even though a large number play as singletons. You want to at least 10 levels above your mission or region level, with the best weapons suited to your build that you can get. And I’m talking about your build NOW, not what you want it to be in the future when you have all your stats, perks and mutations the way you want them.
---
I was frustrated too. More so because I was not thinking of the future when I started, so I paid poor attention to my stats and perks. But you’ll get there.
---
They're almost always stuff under the misc tab. Some of my favorites that I've found are moist radkelp from Project Paradise and Greens from Meat Week. I also have a couple barrels of toxic waste from that one daily for the Mayor of Grafton.
---
I really wish I could give you an award for this post. Not that it would help fill the void...
---
I listened to the gamescon interview with the devs and the takeaway was that it is coming relatively soon.  They mentioned that everyone would get a "Vault Door" and we would basically have our own vault to decorate as we wish.  I'm interested in how it will all work.
---
Okie dokie.
---
I just want gunpowder moved to junk. The fact that its miscellaneous and weighs a million kilos is ridiculous
---
About 8 days I think
---
Is Ultra 5.56 popular? Because thats all i can make atm
---
Yeah, your last paragraph is exactly what I’ve done, which is frustrating. I tried to play it like New Vegas which is my fave game ever, and it is just too different lol.
---
I do like this though. Just taking some getting used to.
---
Can someone explain what constitutes a magic weapon?

I like it. But in my opinion, they should do a minimum amount of damage across the event.
---
Thank you. I only started after Wastelanders and don'tvply that often
---
They call it "The brotherhood of Steel of the Apocalypse" just tad of a mouthful

Zorbo’s ship moves one space a day, there are 8 spaces left so 8 days left

1 roll tp... sorry..
---
Thanks all, will look out for it in the store.
---
Yes, and if you need the rebar puncturing mod, you can craft three or four power fists if you have the plan, and then junk them, it doesn't take much to get the rebar modification for the power fist. Then go knock them dead.
---
Really glad to hear you're enjoying it!
---
I have a ring that gives ap refresh and weapon weight on that mule account as well lol. I have a character filled with hacked gear in his stash.
---
Steel is typically 1:1 (steel scrap, not bulk) not sure how many are in Bulk ... had 1st to long to remember 🤣🤣
---
Yeah. That literally happened to me. Its in the post. It can literally happen both way. 
---
But if they fix the bug and prioritize low, you'll only have the one low core to start with (assuming the rest are full, which would be with ultracite.)
---
People keep throwing that scenario up which is LITERALLY in my post as it happened to me mid fight. Not everyone can afford to carry or craft  100+  fusion/ultracite cores.
---
Hmm rad-shields are something i learned how to make not to long ago but haven't really went out of my way to craft, ill have to start producing them they're pretty cheap to make now that im looking at it
---
Edge lord crossover from fortnight. Cool it on the adderall bud
---
Could anyone tell me where the display shelf is? Its not in displays unless its glitched somehow for me
---
There'll be demand again once they rebalance the game and add interesting, complex, story driven ways to PVP with plenty of repeatable incentive.
---
You sided with Foundation? Well the Raider players are always marked as aggro.
---
You want to set up lures and robots for MODUS? BOS players are here to stop you
---
Hmm. Never played fortnite and I havent taken adderall in years, but nice rebuttal.
---
I have these stupid Inert Bombs from one of the daily's, could that be one of them ? I know you can craft the into mines but they dont weigh anything and have been there forever
---
I’ve been a melee/PA for somewhere around 180 levels.  It does work.  
---
Motion assist servos on the torso will give you +2 STR.
---
15 STR, 13 PER.  3 pts in INT for Stabilized.
---
Some mutations will give you + STR, as will some underarmor and + (random special) it also possible on legendary weapons.
---
after all the adding subtracting, I’m at 19 STR.
---
But I like 1H weapons - switchblades And combat knives are my best friends.  You can kill a scorchbeast with a switchblade, BTW.  
---
That said, I do have a heavy weapon or two for cargobots, and usually use them on SB’s, as they dont land very often,( and I have not bothered to configure the fast change weapon wheel.)
---
Big difference between controlled PVP team death match with your discord mates and exploiting Electrically Charged to kill junk hoarders
---
Its gonna suck when we un-sub and are overweight asf haha
---
4LC is a much better value IMO.. even blind as it is 
---
I mean.. if i already had everything I wanted in luck and there was somehow a point left over.. I might use it
---
hits are much easier to come by than kills
---
Well, I never used it. But I took Billings Homestead for gold when I was making Speed Demon serums to sell. Maybe the dude liked his gold.
---
Yeah, some idiots just use it for XP farming when they could get ore and hold off on depositing until the last minute and get a potentially rare and expensive plan for sale.
---
Dominate the Capitalist Wasteland as a Communist. I head over to player camps and gesture for them to see what i dropped them. Suprise fool, ITS A PROPAGANDA FLYER. I launch a mininuke at my feet then run in the opposite direction
---
That's what I assumed they was doing and then they all ran up the ramp to the exit right at the end.
---
Nah those are intended to stay in your inventory since you can make the mines like you said. I had like 40 of them that didn't stack inside my inventory at one point but thankfully dropping them all and picking them back up turned it into a single stack.
---
It will fail unless you get a minimum of 50.  The rewards are at 50 for minimum, 75 for better, and 100 the only way you can get the rad barrel plan.
---
The mobs need to spawn in the mine forcing everyone down there. So while down there may as well grab some ore too. Atm its just too easy to camp at the top and go for your life.
---
Bravo!
---
You would have gotten them as a reward for an event in the Savage Divide like Uranium Fever. It’s a weird quirk that’s when they drop they drop together. And yes, deffo lucky
---
Yeah, thats about right.
---
They are but they drop in a bundle so I'm almost 10 percent sure you had them drop in a bundle for you.  Good deal!
---
If they could fit me with a fez, suspenders and slacks beneath a brown coat, and a bowtie outfit, that would be nice too
---
OOOooo Thats good to know, I might aswell just craft the mines and post em. Idk do people even use mines?
---
Keep trying at Phoenix , only place to get it. You just have to keep server hopping until it's there.
---
Hell of a lot of luck. 76 is nice to me for a change
---
Yes i’m on pc I don’t know how the ids work but all I know right now is that my username is Articalex if that helps...
---
Lmao ... you get to keep items in Scrap Box ... just can’t add anything to them 👍🏼
---
Wait , it isnt like that ? My buddy found a T60 that i couldnt see
---
Yes. I’m talking about what a player can scrip.
---
That would be nice.  FO4 had a few mods that recharged them.  The only downside, was tyat they had a tendency to crash the game when doing so.
---
In March/April it was toilet paper at 30k caps
---
Thing is if people just made the run to get ore, higher level enemies will spawn, pretty sure the ghoul levels are like 40 which means you won't be getting max level legendaries.
---
When I see people not doing the runs I fire bloodied grenade launcher rounds into the spawns and take all the kills sorry not sorry.
---
I sell TP for ridiculous prices. I sell almost all my scrip gear for tree fiddy.
---
Thats reasonable haha
---
The junk stays in your scrap box after you drop 1st. Just don't take it out of there and you can live off it for a long damn time. I only had 1st for 1 month and stocked up about 1k of each material and about 24k steel in that one month. 
---
It only took me a few weeks off the sub before I filled my tiny baby 800 stash box back to the brim. Such a sad storage amount for cheapies like me.
---
Whatever is 1 cap. . . Three times. .  .
---
I've probably only been there 5 or 6 times but it was always populated by a few honeybeasts. That made sense because there's a corpse of one in a cage. Family coming by and killing the people sort of thing.
---
Not necessarily the workshop itself but the total amount of workshops overall, they had the chance of making a new/better workshop but never did with the release of wastelanders. It would be nice to see a new workshop that offered better materials then the old spruce knob did, and perhaps a new unique workshop for players to enjoy. :)
---
On level 160 and I'm on the nuke quest now I'll probably launch one tonight
---
I didn’t see any copper at Hemlock Holes... So unless I’m missing something then I don’t agree. You get more acid (3 nodes), but less gold. Taking both at the same time gave you 4 acid nodes and 4 gold nodes. While this is arguably not game breaking, and almost nobody actually did this, it’s still a kicker for the one guy who did do this.
---
Lol.  Why was it so mad?
---
Awww dang it you stretched it out.now it won't fit.
---
Hits are kills for Unarmed against mobs.
---
I'm looking with all my other plushies/floor decor
---
Yeah, it’s not with your other plushies for some reason. Think it’s at the bottom of floor decor.
---
Do you have a claim ticket....
---
Checking claim ticket ....
---
Since when can you set the price over 30K?
---
An Ultracite workshop would be interesting. :)
---
I want to see how many queens and earle’s I’ve killed and then hit a blue screen. Has to be a couple dozen by now.
---
Sry. Had to recheck what i was saying.
---
Dude for some reason I found a full set of ultracite PA in my stash. Idk where it came from but when I found it I was no where near level 50 but now I'm level 42 so I'll be able to use it soon.
---
If you have a team you should be fine. 4 average builds is enough dps to kill all the hoards that attack you.
---
My and my friends were talking about it a bit ago some new workshop ideas we came up with was stuff like the nukacola plant with a nuka machine, the damm in the mire for pure water, something for ultracite, a hospital machine for chems and stimpacks.
---
And an update to the ammo machine so i can make my 2mm ammo in the ammo crafter
---
Yah I got it there
---
The fall through floor glitch is baad, but I've only had it twice, and I've done the event between 20-30 times.
---
The fast travel issue I've never experienced. If you're too late to join the event, tp to a teammate that's inside. Or walk through the opened mine if you spawned outside.
---
The frame rate issue is due to people using Tesla Rifle.
---
Matchmaking is purely luck based indeed, unless you scout the server before deciding to launch, or advertise it on textchat mod/Discord. Or get a private server.
---
Is the non registering damage from VATS use? vats sucks big time these days because of this bug
---
Ammo. 556 and 45
---
Surgical mask for max caps
---
i see what you did there
---
That's not the point of this post though, it was about getting a new workshop to spice things up as a replacement for the one they removed from Wastelanders. It would be nice to see them add a new unique workshop that offered a special resource such as the food packing, ammo factory and etc. I listed some simple suggestions I thought of in the OP, but another user suggested Ultracite as a resource for the new workshop too.
---
Everything is for 420 caps Friday night. Even .38
---
nope. JUNKKKKKKKKKKKKKK
---
They're absolutely worth it.
---
Verdant season in the mire, at night.
---
If every single DLC wasn't free, or if there wasn't any way to earn free Atoms at all, they would definitely be *the* greediest company. Especially if EA, Ubisoft or Activision Blizzard didn't exist
---
It’s always worked for me. Even tested it with a buddy and he always saw what I left in that crate.
---
Camp destruction used to be a lot more popular before certain aspects of it got nerfed.
---
Traveled out to a vendor as it said they had a load of weapons. Get to the vendor and its 30 level 1 combat knifes with maxed out durability.
---
Whovians unite! :)
---
I keep and sell military grade duct tape for 40 caps. 0.1 weight, lighter than the sum of the components (4 adhesive, 2 ballistic fiber). New players always buy me out.
---
Dont forget cans, can traps, paint cans, empty paint cans, wooden blocks

Trust, I went around in circles with it last night! Probably the most unnecessary item placement in the editor mode.
---
I bought the colored wallpaper. I am about to make her something pretty when she starts! (Yup: Time and relative .... :)
---
There's been times it's taken well over an hour for them to drop, kinda buggy, used to get them as soon as you get close to the circle and now it's random
---
Honestly they aren't that great, for very low level it's meh but you can get way more stuff in an hour running around doing quests, kind of a "if it doesn't drop when you show up forget about it and check later" thing
---
Duely Noted good sir haha
---
Leader of the pack is 3 guaranteed legendaries
---
So repair kits and the scrap kits?
---
Mutation serums at a reasonable price, ~300
---
I make shielded underarmors to sell for 1200. They sell well.
---
Dont worry the one wasteland patch wont ruin your solo experience.
---
i have being playing one wasteland with a new character on the pts and its really enjoyable.
---
Gone are the days where a level 67 super mutant would suddenly drop while you are still 20 doing your quests or your exploration.
---
Resource wise it wont change anything unless you were one shotting mobs.
---
And the sad truth is bad weapons remain bad, good weapons remain good, and Scourgebeast queen still drops legendary rolling pins.
---
Time to go berrypickin haha
---
I would gladly pay 30k caps for a j5050 fixer
---
Only aluminum and lead are worth bulking for saving weight. All the other junk is the same weight.
---
I don't know why the Scrapper perk doesn't have a rank 2 like it did in Fallout 4 where weapons and armor give your more material like screws, nuclear material and ballistic fiber
---
You might try other BOS vendors, like the one in White Springs.

How long does it store food? I have one and haven't even tried using it

I feel like the fallout 4 settlement menu was way better. Want to build a wall? Go to buildings select walls then metal wall and viola there you go. None of this nonsense where every wall is jumbled in a single line with no rhyme or reason

Nice suggestions! :D
---
Legendary drops are random.  I do ACP because it’s fun, not because it’s efficient.  If the rewards aren’t worth it you, then don’t do it.
---
I'd say collectron, but i don't what variant (if any) are currently available.
---
If the raider collectron is available, if collects chems and booze, both useful for a low level player.
---
Need flux and ballistic fiber. The plans for the shielded mods are fairly rare.
---
Wasn’t the real mission to get a hold of all the nuclear silos in Appalachia with the cover up mission was to rebuild America

Doesn't seem that way.  I was using a deathclaw gauntlet in a daily op.  They would get down to zero and I kept whaling on them with the gauntlet and nada. Finally quit fighting because invincible super mutants is no fun and a waste of time.

Vampire weapons are the way to get Earle.   I have a gat-laser and a plasma gun with flamer-mod, both with Vampire effect.

Eats ammo like crazy, but I never failed an event.   Of course much help from the other players, especially keeping the minion wendigos off of me.
---
I've gotten the mask 7 times as well as each plan. Ungodly amount of cursed weapons too tho
---
i've read some discussions regarding this however most people fail to realise that lower level players are encountering enemies of lv 60 at lv 20 and struggle to progress. this change will allow them to move more freely rather than avoid high lv players who spawn high lv enemies
---
Grinding faction rep and gold/modules for a full set of Unyielding Secret Service armour is what I've been doing for months now (and I can still go for better rolls on each armour piece too). I'm with you, but I also wonder if I'd log in and play at all if the limits weren't there?
---
Ill have to have a chat with good ole google to see where the plans are found mostly
---
Fair enough, I say this as a level 98 new player who still doesn't have stockpiles of ammo. One earl kill took most of my reserves
---
*primal fear intensifies *
---
Fair call, will try server hopping over just dropping in once a day. Cheers!
---
Have you tested the PTS? It's fucking solid
---
Will we still be able to build around Appalachia outside if we wish? The surrounding environment is one of the main things I take into consideration when I'm looking to build a new camp. I feel like a interior vault cell would get boring real fast
---
ACP is worth it because i go in with 1500 2mm ec and come out with 1800 2mm ec.
---
Seconded. We are in desperate need of stuff to do.
---
They drop from certain events. You usually need to know the treated, resistant, and protective mods first.
---
How can you possibly struggle with scorched I can destroy them with my full health furious .50cal with all my weight reduction perk cards up
---
And I’m saying that there’s a superabundance or workshops and resources already and the effort in making one could be better spent making something new (or fixing something broken). Honestly rather than add a new workshop maybe expand on the cage fighting arena from the raider quest and make a new pvp opportunity in game that makes sense lore-wise. 
---
Workshops are obnoxious. I dint want an existing location ruined to make one. Better opportunities for pvp for those that want it would be better
---
Scavenger collectron. They can collect stuff for you. I'd buy one of those if I don't want any of the cosmetics.
---
Repair kits are useful, but you can get them from the Scorched Earth event for free. And repairing with junk is easy if you loot all the things and put them in your scrapbox.
---
I myself have not used or needed scrap kits during my over 1000 hours of gameplay, it's easy enough to find stash boxes around the world.
---
It’s for the best.... I spawned into a world once and found my Mirelurk King lying face down in the dirt in front of my home. Dead for no reason. I kneeled next to him for few minutes.... I was actually sad to see him like that.
---
The trick to these carepackages is to forget about waiting for the circle. Instead go do whatever else you need to do and check in time to time to see if the circle disappeared and replaced with an active marker. That way your more proactive with your time
---
I did the event practically every hour each day it was active, and didn’t have my issue
---
Good to know, i appreciate it  :)
---
It's annoying how much it weighs so I almost never have gunpowder unless I'm using it then and there to make ammo. I'd suggest just holding onto acid/cloth instead as it weighs a lot less(and of course since it's something you can make, super duper helps)
---
How many notes did you have??
---
I read other players can take them, does that get rid of the quest or the flair?
---
No they only added tools for tracking why it may be happening. They don't seem to have any idea
---
Once I got porkchop at my camp my mirelurk hunter (Walter) turned hostile so I put him down and mounted his head in a memorial with letters saying “Walter”
---
You don't contact Bathesda, Bathesda contacts you
---
Bethesda’s automated systems are perfect!!! You obviously must have duped a bunch of treasury notes that you cannot even turn in. Bye bye duper
---
First off it stores only 15 food items, each listed singly not in stacks, just a fyi, I use it mainly to keep cranberry cobbler. The description says it reduces the spoilage rate by 50%. I know I put fresh cranberry cobbler in at the start of meat week and it was still usable at the end of it for me.
---
I earned between 40-60 in a few hours of playing Primal Cuts
---
Number two is the most frustrating thing about CAMP. Not only that but where is the Survival Tent? In the favorite selection menu. If I don't move it for a long time I usually forget where it is.
---
And as for your idea of eliminating the misc category, my wife and I have an accounting business and she absolutely refuses to let a client have a misc account in their system because no one ever knows what goes into it until you look for something and after a frustrating search in places it should be you eventually find it in MISC.
---
I agree, Get rid of MISC now!
---
I don’t think that there should be no limits. I think the limit should be a little higher. Just for QOL. 150 for scrip is too low.
---
Naming it, and then also giving it a custom paint job. You can't scrap it with custom paint. Naming it makes everything so much easier. For a while I was spawning all of my chassis to see which was which. Now I have them named. So much easier.
---
PC?
---
Backstory:  I replied to a person that earlier complained about a mechanic of the game instead of accepting the use of another game mechanic to avoid the scenario.
---
Eh, either or. I’m fine with both. :)
---
Yeah, range should be at least doubled.  Not sure it should be whole map, but it's far too small.
---
Also if you're on PC you can use Shift &amp; Ctrl to scroll through items quicker..
---
Shift + mousewheel = a little faster  
---
Ctrl + mousewheel = a lot faster
---
I have to use this because I carry around a ton of outfits. Ctrl + mousewheel takes me to the top of the list very fast
---
You will need to be level 20 to access the bulk of the Wastelanders questline.
---
I haven't actually seen it in there though.
---
How much Wood was collected? 
---
(You said it was barely reached)
---
151 million?
---
So if I make a little village, other players will have to sit through a loading screen for every door they go through?
---
I've actually ran out there before with ghoulish, just out of curiosity. Never knew there was so much inside. But the few times I've got there, ghoulish stops healing me and I die.
---
Not really anything notable.
---
I've no reason not to be? It's a game, something I do for fun.   
---
I don't find any form of PvP fun in games like these, except maybe hiding in Nuclear Winter and turning it into a glorified game of hide-and-go-seek.  
---
If I wanted to fight another human being over something, I'd invite a buddy over and we'd play KoF or MK 11.  
---
I play this to relax, and I enjoy helping others.  
---
Kind of that simple really.
---
Good to know. Thanks for the information.
---
If it wasn’t so tragic, watching a legendary mirelurk king kill player after player at scorched earth would be worth the price of admission. A legendary mirelurk king will. not. die. I’d rather fight 14 earles
---
That CAMP skin was just fixed recently, so it's safe to use now.
---
Personally I think there are already more workshops then needed.  I would not want any dev time invested in it.  Much more worthwhile endeavors.
---
Filter owned atom shop and filter unowned atom shop .
---
It's a reward for an active community. Anyone who was helping out was probably online to claim the rewards as well
---
Camp hopping! 
---
I love shopping and I also love to see other people's camps and the imagination of some builders. I've seen so many awesome camps.
---
You’ve also got to progress some of the main quest as well, but not the whole thing
---
Make sure you have starched genes in luck or you’ll lose the mutation as soon as you use a radaway
---
No, because using VATS isn't aiming.
---
I may have come across as rude.  I apologize if that was the case....sincerely sorry. 
---
When playing my heavy build I appreciate it when someone ‘adopts’ me and keeps the windegos off me, or at least stims me when I go down.  Maybe focus on a more support type role.  Tag as much as possible, and keep your heavy hitters in the fight.  There’s more than one way to contribute to the event.  
---
If you’re a comando put in Tormentor.  Keep all Earls body parts crippled.  It helps a bunch.
---
I agree, I have seems these posts before and never agreed with them, but now that I also done with the first season I have nothing at all to do anymore.....
---
Yeahhhhh that comment came about hour too late 😂😂
---
Ah well at least I know now
---
Ok gonna try now, just recently getting back into the game and this quest being bugged is killing me
---
&gt; I'm still fairly low level and keep getting put off by all this high level stuff lol. Seems I need a lot of dedication to the grind.
---
Ignore it.
---
The high level stuff / grind is all about... WTF do you do when you aren't low level anymore, and are out of content?
---
The first 100-200 hours are the most fun.  Don't worry (or even think) about the grind.
---
But you can only get so much scrip per day though. Unless you milk the dailys but at best you only get 2-6 scrip per challenge.
---
So many good suggestions so far. I upvoted and backed those who said;
---
-Seedy Shed (compact and almost instant 'build a base' for like 500 atoms).
---
-Silent Vault Tec generator (easy to store/hide, and so space friendly!)
---
-Fridge (not *necessary* but if you make XP food it'll assist in ensuring every time you jump back to base to refit that you'll top up your boosts).
---
Collectron is okay, but I find that a dedicated loot run here and there easily makes up for it. Plus I hate having some loud numpty robot kickin about making a scene while I'm trying to do it. Blocks stairs. Doorways. Generally a nuisance.
---
What about Bethesda?
---
If you blueprint, then move your camp, you can dismantle the auto-created blueprints to get access to every single item that was used without having to recreate them. I also heard you can blueprint everything except the floors, then rebuild the floors the same way in a new location, and the blueprint will snap onto the foundation with a higher success rate
---
I really want it to happen. I want to use the whole map and do all quests and events to be actually rewardered for it. It will make the game easier for newcomers and more challenging for veterans. That's what online game should look like.
---
Wait, whats a magic weapon?  Just a legendary or is it special?
---
Won't lie, stopped reading when you took half a paragraph to claim you were the first to discover something.
---
Impossible claim to make on an online MMORPG without evidence lol
---
Shush. Remember when we complained about the ammo converter menus? They fucked it up even more, and didn't even fix it being usable in PA. Not to mention you get 5000 flares when you buy 100x railway spikes.
---
Please... just look it up
---
Sad! My replaced pets never went hostile and would hang out at my camp with my new pet until I logged out of the server. I have pics of my boys (King, Claw, and Ace the Raider) hanging out. I created a "tombstone” for my KIA pets - a concrete barricade with mounted heads and RIP letters.
---
Totally random. While certain events and bosses do have a three star legendary enemy at the end it is still random whether you get a 1 2 or 3 star legendary from them. I find farming for them quicker and easier than only doing the events. Rolling the purveyor is the only way to make sure you get a 3 star anything.
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
&gt; They just need to make a proper way to respec. You shouldn’t have to start over or gain 30+ levels to respec to what you want to do.
---
In a way I assume legendary perks will make that significantly easier;  at least my assumption is I'll be using at least 3 (if not 4) of the special skill perks;  and will use that to be able to swap builds around without respec'ing special points.
---
Then - assuming on PC (and using the mod to handle perk loadsouts), changing just becomes the click of a button.
---
Calling in Artillery Strikes and orbital strikes onto other people's camps.
---
I've never damaged any camps, oddly enough, since structure health just rubber bands back to normal almost instantly..... But it certainly makes other players run around like ants in a kicked nest for a couple of minutes, then everything goes back to normal and they carry on.
---
Just adding some variety to their routine.
---
Yes, as a person who walks around in it all day, yes
---
I figured but makes the perk useless for vats builds
---
Does hip fire accuracy buff in vats? I mean if you mod your gun to
---
No, the Tesla affects stuff like water or other players to become sort of "pixelated" which drops the frame rate to oblivion. I even modded Ash piles into NW loot bags, and it didn't help. I just recently thought the same as you though, but it's not correct unfortunately
---
That is impossible to get that many in a few hours.
---
I am right there with ya hahah
---
Being a respectless piece of shit is a sign of weakness in any game, pvp or not
---
There’s a camp near the creamery I’ve found a few times were every object is sold in some iteration of 69 caps (69, 690, 6900). 
---
Part of the problem is overcharged cores. With Power User equipped I get my 1000 shots then the game decides the core is empty when in reality it still has 20-40% remaining. The game treats the used core as an empty at the moment of reloading and grabs a fresh 100%+ core.
---
**If the game would simply reload the remainder of the original core(ie use the entire core up) before trying to reload in a new core that once more only gets partially used we wouldn't have this issue.**
---
u/Ladydevann I bolded the important part here. We just want the cores to be used up fully before trying to grab a new one.
---
Count your lucky stars. I’m still super upset I lost or can’t find the t-45 jet pack mod a random player dropped for me after watching me work on PA in a public space.
---
I shall give that a try , my 3 star 50 cal with consecutive dmg and explosive rounds doesnt do the trick hahah
---
One fertilizer grenade 10,000 caps
---
Yeah I just have the repair Perk card maxed which when I repair a weapon, gives it full condition, plus extra, like 200% condition or something like that. I can usually got about two days of play without having to repair, but I also use three different weapons, so that spreads the condition load.
---
It's annoying there isn't a Perk card like that for armour.
---
I can’t even get myself to do the main quest for my 3rd and 4th characters.  Between the bugs and the grind, I’m just skipping it.
---
I have my original characters passing over everything they can to the newer characters: plans, ammo, armor, weapons.
---
Fortunately being a Fallout 1st member has made the shuffle of supplies easy on the private server.
---
The whole grind discussions has delayed my wish to do the Wastelanders quests.  Yeah, I haven’t gotten into the vault yet.
---
I wanna ride into events on a nuclear bomb like that.
---
Hip accuracy is what you want for using vats so yes.
---
I regret that I have but one upvote to give.
---
Maybe I’m missing something? I’ve launched a Nuke ... but didn’t have to hack a terminal to do it?? Just went under Misc and selected the Briefcase 💼
---
Yeah, and the Shelters are a much better analogue. They could just do one with like a scarf, fez, 3D glasses, or something inside. But it honestly seems like they would rather tie it to one of the Unstoppables or something already in house.
---
Here is the whole story about how I got that picture. 
---
 I had just set up my camp above the Watoga power substation. I heard a terrifying roar and when I looked below I saw a deathclaw, the deathclaw, my deathclaw, tearing some giant ants apart. I was enraptured watching him disembowel and then feast upon the critters. He had caught my eye, and against all odds he caught mine.
---
He sauntered over with a confident gait that exuded raw masculinity. He asked if I wanted some ant meet, I was shy but I managed to squeek out something about being a herbivore. I thought that would scare him away but he persisted. He asked if i lived around here and I told him I'd just moved in. He let me know that he'd lived here since 2018. I invited him up but he said he couldn't go up stairs. I told him it was easy but he said something about how his pathing wouldn't allow it. His vulnerability in that moment struck me, sure he was 10 feet tall and made to kill but the truth is that the only thing he was slaying was my heart.
---
I moved my camp to ground level and invited him in, he was only planning to stay for a bit, but he ended up staying the whole night, and the next, and the next. As we lay down in my heart adorned bed, i told him he would be my first, that i never found anything to love in my life in the vault. He told me I would be hist first too, then we melted into each other. It was as if we were opening the secrets of the universe as we opened our bodies to one another. It was a whirlwind of flesh and scales, lust and passion, sex and sensuality. I was covered in claw marks, they burned, I burned but deathclaw and I burned together. I'm not ashamed to admit that the protectrons in Watoga must have had to check their sensors because the sounds me and deathclaw made were unearthly.
---
Looking back at it now I suppose the game was rigged from the start. My friends all saw it, Sophia, Wanderer even the Forager hated my new found love. When they were at my camp they would go so far as to try to kill him. But I was blind and insisted that they leave, I wouldn't let them get between me and my love. But they must have known he would break my heart. I should have known too. When I found him with vendor Phoenix, when he stayed out all hours of the night, when he came home late and smashed my turrets and when he gave me the woopsies. The evidence was there but he always had an excuse, and I always wanted to believe me. He'd put one of his big talons up to my lips and assure me that I was the only one for him. My brain knew I was being conned, but the heart wants what the heart wants.
---
And then, one day it was over. It seems like something that shatters your world should come with sound and fury. A tempest that breaks open a dam and envelops you, but no, the world can change on a dime, on a day like any other. He sat me down, told me that he'd always love what we had together. That word, had, past tense not have but had, it was over, we were over, he'd used that word had. I never imagined three letters could hurt so much, but they did he broke me with three letters, H-A-D. The picture above captures it all, his hand on my knee, looking into my eyes as I gazed back at his. That image, a heart breaking, my heart breaking. And then he was gone, he took his things and left. It was all so... quick and yet so permanent.
---
It makes me sad, … my Deathclaw being gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged. Their feathers are just too bright. And when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice. But still, the place you live in is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. I guess I just miss my love.
---
I suppose I've moved on some, I moved my camp, the old one had too many memories. But I'd be lying if I said I didn't go back to Watoga every now and then, stroll past the substation and hope to catch a glimpse of him. I never do. I'm not sure where he went but hes gone, though when I see a slaughtered brahmin I like to think it was his lunch. I still care, I won't tell you I don't. It hurts to care, but I suppose that hurt is all I have left of him, I'd rather have the hurt he left me than nothing at all. I know its messed up, but this whole thing was messed up and yet it was also so very right. I have the hurt he gave me I suppose that will have to be enough. I don't regret it, I hold onto those memories, they are sacred to me, special, they can't be tarnished. But those memories are like a nuke blast, you can't look at them directly, so I tuck them away until the creep back into my consciousness and I relive all of it again. I’ve learned to love that pain. So I guess in a way I still have the love he gave me.  Some wounds cant be healed by a stimpak, and others, like these scars I bear, shouldn't be healed at all.
---
The next time you see a deathclaw, I know you'll shoot it, I have no illusions to the contrary. But after you down it, once its gone, spare a moment, say a prayer, the deathclaw you just killed, may be the deathclaw that stole my heart and if it is, don’t tell me, because even after all I’ve been through, I still like to image the world as one with him in it.
---
Shotguns were great and a viable weapons during beta and early release!
---
GOD DAMN LOCH NESS MONSTAH
---
OMG! is this Bathesda?
---
i work in IT and audit technician's tickets. We removed the MISC category for "problem" because of this exact thing.
---
If you want a building tip, the Communist Bunker has a cool design when hit with a nuke( or just broken ). It looks like something you would want for a raider, bloodeagle, cultist look kinda thing, if they were to use it.
---
Honestly, I haven’t ever gotten the chance to see the damage of this. How’d you get it to hit things?
---
DON'T TOUCH note...3k or more every time
---
I'd also like there to be two options, show what I can build right now, and show what I know how to build but lack the resources.
---
So what build y’all prefer? Don’t like melee build the power armor build looks fun
---
Sutton has a great area on the other side of the junk wall , you can build right next to the station and the worst critter spawns you get are a few mole rats
---
Here's the list of things I've found to have practical benefits  
---
**Collectrons**: scavenger for a variety of scrap which can include black titanium and ultracite, communist for food and stims if you find you need a bit more, and/or raider for ammo and weapons (this is my favorite).  
---
**Rain water collector**: each one passively collects up to 2 dirty water for you, which means you can have some waiting at your camp for cooking without taking rads or sitting there clicking the pump/well repeatedly. If you place a few you don't really need to collect dirty/boiled water while adventuring which saves your carry capacity for more important things.  
---
**Refrigerator**: this can only have a few items assigned to it, but can be really helpful if you have some extra food that you want to hold on to for a later point in a longer play session. You might store some cranberry food for a later XP buff, or extra raw flux while you gather the necessary materials to stabilize it.  
---
**Communist fence**: a defensive wall that your turrets can shoot through. This is great for holding back wolves and mongrels while still allowing your defenses to take them out. Just keep in mind that enemies with guns can and will also shoot through it.  
---
**Small Vault-Tec Prototype Generator**: still the same power output as a regular small generator but it's smaller, stackable, and doesn't spew out smoke. These will save you a lot of space for an early camp, but if you already can make a fusion generator then don't bother.
---
Griefing people and cyberbullying them
---
Do you know if they will give out score to those who missed them because of this issue?
---
Its fine, I also just want to pick up plastic. I especially love the big amounts of plastic in those brown bags!
---
It's called Fix It Good and does armor up to 200% for level 3
---
Gauss Minigun is better damage than legacy energy weapons anyway in my experience!
---
Until one wasteland that is.. :/
---
But this is the internet, and people can't lie on the internet!
---
If that nerf hits im leaving lol
---
Spent over 150 modules, rolling for a full Unyielding set. You know what I got? A full 3\* Vanguards set, a full 3\* Weightless set (since DR becomes moot on SS), full 3\* Troubleshooters set (for Encryptid), but Unyielding? Two 3\* pieces and three 2\* ones - in grand total I had only two 3\* Unyielding pieces, while the rest I scrapped enough for 2 sets. Fucking RNG man...
---
The only saving grace is that one of those 3\* Unyielding was a chest with Action Point refresh speed and Sentinel's, so I don't feel guilty about putting a jetpack on it.
---
It just hurts.... err, I mean works.....
---
September 7th :(
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Grahm%27s_Meat-Cook this should help you
---
Isn't the chance of legendary spawns tied to depositing ore? Seemed that way in my experience.
---
They can take them i think. Or it could be public loot, as in it is individual loot for each person who touches it. I always just make sure to consistently check the circle if its gone. Either way, it isnt that big a deal, cuz the drops dont have anything that good in them. You'll find tons more US Supply Requisites as time goes on
---
No. Please, no more! 84 tickets in a row... Never again.
---
Still no shotgun.
---
Three revolvers though.
---
Doesn't seem like it to me but I don't know for sure
---
Those are both keeper weapons.  Damn, gone for scrip???   Live and learn I guess.
---
Seriously, the raider collectron is incredible #1 on the list 100%
---
There’s been like tons of Deathclaws spawn towards the end a few times is this why?
---
Likely because you didn’t dupe them.
---
The new Planetarium lamp could be the Heart of the Tardis ;)
---
The stainless steel variant was just in there a week or so ago, but it'll cycle back.
---
Amen.
---
I just got this from Whitesprings the first time I ever even looked at the Brotherhood vendor there 
---
so I would recommend Whitesprings.
---
3 primal cuts at a time 3 times an hour * 2 notes each = 18 an hour meaning I could get about 40 in 2 hours + doing the Grahm event on the hour
---
It's been awhile since I last played, so I don't know if it still works... but yeah; that's how you do it. Sometimes you can do it so fast it doesn't register. Just wait that split second for her to say the first word of dialog then back out. You'll catch a feel for it. And it HAS to be the middle option. I think it was the one that says, "Applachia has a new Corpse". there should still be Youtube videos about it. that's where I first learned of it.
---
Could not resist after seeing the perks.  
---
[https://imgur.com/2g5fuYL](https://imgur.com/2g5fuYL)  
---
Already sold, though.
---
Apparently it bugs out if someone has done the quest on that server that day.
---
Damn that early? Did they even change anything? What do u think the new meta will be doe
---
How did it go?
---
In theory yes, in practice no, that would be a disaster for those trying to complete sets as they would be competing with junk farmers...
---
Well, I guess my favorite steel spot is going to be empty for the next few days.
---
Mercifully the guy who killed me didn't also go as far as to take my junk after I died, so I suppose I should be thankful for that.
---
Damn man, see we could've swapped sets! After 20 odd modules I got a decent Chest Piece but still working on the other ones lol
---
KPIs for Games-as-a-Service include those about engagement. They don't want long, less frequent sessions. They want frequent, shorter sessions so they can capitalise on the atom shop FOMO. You dont know what youre missing out on if they cant shove it in your face.
---
Gamers want long sessions when they want/feel but that doesn't correlate to corporate benchmarks for optimal milking of the playerbase for every dollar they can. 
---
I want the grind to go too, but all these reddit poata asking for it are going to fall on deaf ears. The community managers will pay the occasional post some lip service making it seem like they care about community feedback, but cmon. After 2 years we know better right?
---
&gt;but I also wonder if I'd log in and play at all if the limits weren't there?
---
Yes, yes you would. No one who played Diablo/Path of Exile/Borderlands/etc. thinks "Whoah, that's a lot of good gear I could have but I don't - guess I better go do something else." Instead it gives you a reason to play. If any of those games had Daddy Howard pop up on screen and give you a frowning finger wave "Nuh-uh-uh, that's enough gearing attempts for today young Timmy, it's bed time for you!" after half a fucking hour, the playerbase would vanish into thin air.
---
And I completely forgot to do it! Lol I'll try to do it tonight if I have time. Sorry about that!
---
Haha, it's alright mate! No worries :)
---
Hahaha that's funny and deviant, you sicko.  I never bother to reclaim a camp if someone takes it,  but that would make me chuckle.   You should try it while playing goofy music over your mic just to spice things up.
---
Something similar happened to my wife and I. We were about level 10 and some level 300 helped us complete collision course then dropped 100+ water, stims and cryo grenades. Then last night we had a level 5 join our public team (Im level 69 shes now 57) and dropped him a whole bunch of ammo, water and stims. Felt good both times
---
Terminals are fairly reliable sources of launch codes.
---
Isn’t worth it? You get a guaranteed 3 star
---
Plus whatever you loot off him, plus tons of xp... also it’s just fun
---
At 200 Gold a day capped why the fuck would this even be a system to flag ya know.... I liken it to Shawshank Redemption if you wanna dig a few rocks out of your cell wall every night for a hundred years and crawl through a shit-pipe to freedom then *you've earned it*.
---
Two Earl's and a daily and you're already maxxed out basically.....

I pulled like 180 notes through the 'week' and am still trying to burn them.
---
No.  :(  How did I miss it.  Oh well.
---
Seems like the complete opposite to me.  Now that I am done, I'm dropping nukes when I log in instead of trying to "score" and others are doing the same.
---
Get to log in for the little bit of time I have and actually do the things I WANT to do now.
---
Ahhh... misunderstood... and yes they are 👍🏼
---
Player count hasn’t gone down... even if it had it would have zero impact on number of people per server...
---
It probably has decreased number of public teams though.
---
I see you've played Knifey Spoony before..... Those are mine and I'll shiv ya with a spoon for my plastic.
---
i’ve had it i think twice in my current acid location. northwest corner of the forest. i refuse to move camps because of my “interior walls” lol
---
Wait, was that an attempt at role-playing the upcoming raider/BoS feud?
---
You've missed two potential briefcase spawns at Pioneer camp
---
Same happened to me 🤣 was still holding a ladel too
---
I don't get anything from scrapping power armor
---
Hope they fix it. I don't mind nukes but a guaranteed briefcase is pretty lame.
---
Lol sometimes ill log on and think I'm gonna farm a bit of aluminum.. then a nuke drops on ACP. 
---
And another. 
---
And oh, an SBQ nuke, kill her and join a team at ACP for a third go. Oh, has it been more than an hour? Guess I'll log off. No aluminum.
---
;)
---
At least on Xbox NA, looks pretty stable as always. If anything, there might be a slight increase due to Colossal Problem dropping.
---
Thanks I'm crying now
---
I have so many Treasury notes, I don't need to play for months before running out. Whatever their logic, it's flawed. But then so' s much of the game.
---
And not meaning to criticize... you missed 2 terminals ... Pioneer Camp
---
I hunt for the sad few remaining plans I need to complete the collection.
---
Yeah idk where I got it from I just had a PA chassis I couldn't scrap and lo and behold it was a full set of ultracite.
---
The enclave is the only way forward.
---
i use xbox chat if i need to converse
---
I like the shark paint, but not with my current outfit. Rn I run with a reclaimed deep mining mask, miner outfit and black shovel backpack. The pickaxe with no skin goes best with the outfit (imo). I plan to switch to using 2 handed and use the cursed pickaxe when the damage calculations get reworked because unarmed will be worst, but until then I’ll use my mole miner gauntlet
---
Until the damage nerf...
---
I...... Thank you. #) what a timey wimey wobble non linear solution.
---
Niceeee
---
Blue smoke flares which the artillery generates.
---
God bless
---
I sell wedding rings.... but my CAMP is themed as a brothel....
---
Can we get a “new” tab?
---
I placed mine across a doorway with a little patience.
---
No just 1 door to your instanced interior which will be like a vault
---
Score points. Sad but.
---
Thank you so much for passing this on!
---
I was able to get mine to display correctly, but admit it took me awhile to position it just right. Now I’m unable to move it anymore or scrap it...
---
Yeah, I don’t have any doorways to use. I’ve been able to place it, but at an odd angle so half is floating
---
Then miss out on the B2525 fixer for 130 caps? You’re insane lad.
---
It can do magic damage if it's over ~100 *or* fires multiple shots. A higher fire rate is connected to the amount of extra damage it does and higher fps also increases the chance of extra damage.
---
Yeah, it’s like that with a lot of wall deco, when using wallpaper. That’s another issue. I’m using wall paper
---
The isolation and desolation of the wasteland make contact a rare thing. IDK, when I do meet someone I'm likely to let them pick anything out of my vending machine, help them at any quest, or upgrade their stuff just for breaking my isolation.
---
More awkward when people try to talk to me imo.
---
I prefer the emote system. It's limited but I can't say I've ever needed anything more than thumbs up or down, and the cash emote.
---
Lol they can't even count the ONE sbq for that 80 atom challenge, no one has killed her yet😝
---
I'm usually one of those idiots, because no one else ever shows up. I have thrown on my Stealth suit after people have showed up to go try to grab 25 ore, but then the latecomers aren't doing an effective job of defending the scavengers. So, like /u/Wildlust says "it's damned if you do, damned if you don't."
---
Similarly with Project Paradise, I get there shortly after the event pops, and do some housekeeping, kill the Assaultrons, kill the Sentry bots, knock out most of the robot pods so I can collect as much venison or whatever as possible, but invariably, latecomers will show up just to start shooting things and not collecting the food items, and all of those robots respawn and everything goes to hell.
---
Yeah. I don't like talking in video games because some people can be inadequate hearing my voice which isn't even anyhow special.. I really wish there was a text chat officially. Yes I know there are mods but I wish it was built in the game. But even though I would really like that Fallout is a pretty dynamic game and text chat can get distracting I guess.
---
Yea if they go through with it a ton of people are leaving lol. Maybe even like half the player base
---
Vault 76 was issued a GECK. Just because the overseer decided not to take it with her or use it doesn't mean it doesnt exist. Her mission never required its use, so it collects dust locked behind a story wall.
---
10%... I think you’re being a bit generous !....lol
---
If you haven't gotten it yet, I believe you can get it in NW. That's where I got mine
---
No, I meant how you get it to actually *hit* what you throw the flare at. Because they move.
---
Ok, but the guy just kept doing 'follow me' so I did. I never asked, I never even used my mic.
---
I suck at NW😂😂
---
It's bad, they look great when working. Shame they never work.
---
Collectron, slowly gathers you scrap plus its just neat having a robot patrol your camp.
---
I like some of the premade buildings. like the seedy shack, redrocket garage and the bungalow ect. Just really handy if you wanna do a quick and dirty camp build, plus they look cool. At low level you'll likely be moving your camp pretty often so they help set up something cool quickly.
---
I’m using wallpaper too. I forget the name but it’s the one that looks like rough cut rocks you’d see in a lodge.
---
Please provide the terminal, dialog, holotape, or note that provides this information.
---
Upvote for use of “headass”.
---
The biggest issue with these limits is that at the time they were introduced, from Bethesda's perspective, it made sense. Now that time has passed these limits seem ever more restrictive than they originally were. 
---
Legendary Scrip, Gold Billion, and Caps all need their maximum limit increased. But prices also need a rework.Gold Bullion is useless once you get all of the GB plans you want, Scrip is useless once you have all the legendary items you want, Caps are useless once you have purchased everything you want in game. 
---
For starters, a way to exchange each currency for another is a good step. 
---
Next, raise the max scrip limit to at least 1,500-3k, and the daily scrip limit to 300-500 and also adjust the amount given for legendary trade ins across all gear so that it divides evenly. For example, 1*, 2*, and 3* weapons can be adjusted to 10, 25, and 50 scrip. 1*, 2*, and 3* Armor can go to 5, 15, and 25. This way  no matter what you're trading in, you should be able to better manage your legendary inventory and still come out with your daily scrip limit. This would also ease the grind for getting the roll of the GB legendary items you want because you could purchase more legendary modules. 
---
Gold bullion at a 5k limit honestly isn't terrible, but the daily limit of 200 is. Now I understand the point was to force daily logins to get the max daily bullion, but you also have to add the cost of also spending scrip to get modules to even craft the GB items you want. (PA excluded) Thats essentially 2 separate grinds stacked on top of each other for 1 desired item, and that item isn't even guaranteed. So for GB it would make more sense to eliminate the daily cap altogether, just allow players to grind treasury notes and spend them at their leisure. If you are able to hit the 5k GB cap daily then so be it. When you consider that you have to have a high enough faction alignment to get the plans you want from them, that you have to rely on RNG to get the legendary roll you want, and that you cannot drop or sell/trade to players it makes sense to remove the daily limit. No one cares if joewhatshisface grinds his ass off for 10 hours straight to come away with enough gold to buy all the SS armor plans at once. Joe still has to grind for legendary modules and resources and then craft 100+ right arms before rolling one he wants. Sure those extra 99 right arms can get back some of the scrip he spent on modules, but he still takes a net loss overall because he has to repeat the process for 4 more armor pieces. 
---
Then finally there's caps, which are really good at being spent on travel. Let's remove player vending for a second and assume that the only source of cap income is the daily 1400 you get from selling to NYC vendors. After 7 days straight, if you spent 0 caps on anything else, you would have 9,800. So 3 weeks later and you're 600 caps shy of the 30k limit. Idk about you, but thats a long fucking time to reach such a low amount to me. For newer players still collecting plans, that probably seems fine. But for players who have been here a while, we've run out of things to spend caps on. Now we bring in player vending, suddenly both new and veteran players have places to maybe off load some caps, but thanks to that 30k limit it can end up hurting the buyer and seller. Joewhatshisface travels to Cindyshitkicker's camp and finds she has all the goodies he has been looking to buy, but Cindy has been selling shit like there's no tomorrow and suddenly she logs off the server because Joe went on a spending frenzy. Joe was buying too much too fast and Cindy went over the limit and lost her well deserved caps to the ethereal planes of oblivion,  because Mehrunes Dagon apparently also needs steady income. Poor Joe didn't get to finish buying all of his needed .308 ammo, and both players now are cussing each other. 
---
How do you fix that? Raise the cap limit to 100k and add a banking system. 100k cap limit for players would change both how much is spent and how prices are set. Then also, add a bank to collect any caps earned from sales after a player reaches the 100k limit. This way, when Cindyshitkicker has 100k, she can still keep selling old Joe all the .308 rounds his LMG desires.
---
\*with melee
---
What platform are you on? On PC none of the "projected" lights like the Planetarium or Nuka Lamp look right if I have my textures set to Medium or Low. They're fine if set to High though.
---
What now?
---
Hopefully hours per session per week/month are checked for reference.
---
Ps4. They come and go.
---
Textures are a mess in this game on ps4. They load very slow and since Wastelanders have been made even worse.
---
I won't get into how horrible it looks with hdr on.
---
Oh, yeah. I’m using the simple gray one. Looks great with the black wood floors
---
13!
---
According to the challenge menu... I still havent killed any of the SBQs Ive killed.
---
We are getting the legendary perk to recharge from energy attacks soon. No clue how effective or how much each hit absorbed restores, though.
---
Lots of awesome advice and insight! Thanks a lot guys.
---
PC
---
That would be awesome. I'd flip the bird to everyone that follows me around spamming the trade emote. If I wanted to unload something I'll put it in the damned vending machine!
---
I stopped doing that myself but I saw a lot of funny stuff in people's vendors. There was one time I opened someone's vendor and the bottom of the most there were 2 notes saying"I'm Watching You" and "Your Dumbass". Had a good laugh :p
---
You're insane for thinking anyone would ever sell something like that.
---
Aaaaah I see. So I still benefit from maxing strength anyways because of DPS. Thanks for the tips!
---
Bath and Thesda Bodyworks
---
Quality content. Not a dry eye in the house you misunderstood lost soul.
---
Let’s get this out onto a tray....
---
I'm terrible at pvp so usually my best option is to try to get a kill within the first minute or two before the other person has a weapon
---
Nukashine roulette. Dump all my weapons apart from a shotgun, 100 shells, and 10 stimpacks. Drink the Nukashine and walk my way back. Half the fun is the fact the sever might disconnect at any time, so no screwing around!
---
Please provide the same evidence that states 76 was not issued a GECK. 76 was built to be top of the line and to act as a show piece before use. They even had color television sets for pete sake. Just because a GECK wasn't used doesnt mean it wasn't issued. Especially with reporters everywhere and a press conference on site.
---
How does that work??
---
bAthesta is the NY pronunciation
---
That actually checks out with my current playing experience.  I’ve found the power armor to be most useful for reducing damage and radiation. I think I’m still gonna go melee and put points into strength because then I can either split between heavy guns and melee for events or go straight either or depending on how I feel. Thanks for the advice!
---
I'm not sure they're sold at all... I learned the plan by scrapping a bunch of harpoom guns... they  very occasionally drop from blood eagles... or you could just craft and scrap harpoon guns yourself... I know the harpoon gun plan is sold by some vendors
---
It doesn't show on the armor piece's stats, but it does factor into the total resistances shown on the armor tab of the pipboy once equipped.
---
You’ve convinced me! I’ll probably keep buffing strength and just slide in heavy guns perk cards if I wanna be more effective during events or bosses.
---
I sell mine for 999 and nobody seems to want them :(
---
It’s happened. While I was able to dupe, I was selling B2525 for 2k, E lasers for 200, E gat plasmas for 3k, and ass/sent for 6k. About a year ago (no dupes we’re running around then), I found a B2525 handmade in a player vendor for 87 caps. Almost broken. Being the dumbass I was, traded it for an AAE AGI Ultracite laser, not knowing it’s true value.
---
I thought it was 25 when I saw your comment, and [this guy, manages to solo the event with just 25.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qivO0C8c-Yc)
---
Of course we’ll still be able to build outside, they wouldn’t just remove that especially considering all the prefabs, building kits etc in the Atom Shop
---
When you do things right, people won't be sure you've done anything at all.
---
K
---
I’ve seen some chat about that, but I think I still really like the idea of a melee dude in power armor so I’m gonna try and make it work. Might side optimize heavy guns for when I wanna b serious and just rock melee weapons for more casual questing and scavenging.
---
Give this a try:

Not idea obviously, but better than nothing.
---
Note: this wasn't my idea, just posting a link to it :)
---
now i need a shower
---
would really like to see in game area/team chat fixed.  
---
Only workaround i know of at the moment is console level party chat
---
Just go on area chat and make motorcycle noises🤣 lol
---
Rocking the Shotgun or Minigun?
---
I once put the ‘your the dumbass’ note in my vendor for 25k and somebody bought it like a week later.
---
I occasionally put those ‘treasury bond (100)’ notes in my vendor for 5k and without fail, somebody always buys them
---
Just use the orbital strike! I forgot about them until I saw one mad dog use it on SBQ. So fun to watch
---
I believe all stats are adjusted to show with affects, mods, perks, and so forth. Sometimes you'll have to equip the item for it to adjust(it can be weird). Gear that has a +25RR or poison resist and such will have it listed(at least it does for me). I'm not sure about the mutant's prefix, I'll have to check that one.
---
On PC!
---
If you pick up an item in the world it will not respawn until you pick 150 other items. So if I was doing a junk run I would go there afterwards and pick up 150 burnt books then drop them on the ground. That would reset all my world items for my next run.
---
Hybrid and food builds are going to become a lot less fun once One Wasteland drops. I recommend starting a new character so you can have 2 highly specialized, powerful characters instead of 1 compromised build.
---
With PA melee, I can't imagine running less than 15 base Strength. 9 points for Slugger, then your preferred mix of Blocker(stealth isn't feasible with PA so every bit of damage reductuon adds up: and it could be anecdotal but I swear I draw ALL the aggro in PA melee during events!), Incisor, and Martial Artist. Anything less and you're gimping your damage output or ability to tank. That's also ignoring the damage bonus Strength gives to melee.
---
Keeping your Strength at 15 also makes stealth Unarmed a very powerful option with only a few perks swapped.
---
theirs a big difference between "magic weapons " and HACKED ones, please watch angry turtles vid on magic guns.
---
here's a example, if you can one hit a lvl 70 super mutant in vats with a shotgun then you have a magic gun,i have seen magic shotguns take out the  imposter sheep with in 3 to 4 hits in vats after it has mutated 
---
 if you watch someone spray a million bullets with a sound  like a splash of explosion from every bullet. so much that it lags your sound and it kills a lvl 100 + legendary mob ( that hasent mutated yet and is close to full health ) with in a few seconds then its probably a hacked gun
---
Works none of the time on my OG 1st Gen Xbox One.
---
Misunderstood?!? Someone understood me.
---
I learned the game on the hunting rifle. I went deep with it and tried hard to push it. I think the best stats I reached with that was, .50 cal receiver (whatever the strongest one was), fire rate of 4 (wowee wowee), 112 damage (no modifiers). I think it was my main man from levels 12 to 35.
---
Da frick I just read
---
The chance of finding a base like that seems low though.  It's just not something I'm interested in doing.
---
I buy .45 for my sniper or .50 for my heavy gunner at 1c each.  Also, any cheap legendary gear for the scrip grinder.  If you have a bunch of 3star junk for 10-300c, take my money.  Mules always need extra for Purveyor sales.
---
Didn't they have this feature in FO4? Oraybe I'm thinking of Skyrim...
---
Anyway, the capabilities are right their in the engine so why not right?
---
I always say the Communist Collectron, it gives medical supplies (Stims 
---
,radaway) food, and drinks with the proletariat setting. You can even get cooked and crafted drinks/food that also add up with their bonuses. Parried with the herbivore mutation its bonkers. The only tool it gives is a hammer but kinda good/bad, but i don't care about scrap. 
---
If we're talking prefabs, I think the seedy shack is way to small. The cabin is awesome and looks right in the mountains. But if we're talking the best of the best its probably the red rocket garage. Its got 3 build in light sources and a powered door. Along with a side entrance. Oh yeah the rocket and neon sign is also awesome. 
---
Some any kind of fridge/cooler is actually really helpful if you dont wanna eat or drink whatever the bot gives you right away. 
---
Alot of great suggestions from other commenters as well.
---
Cheers. I will pm regardless and see if can match up sometime.
---
I have mine placed slightly above my armor workbench which is up close to a wall. There was a tiny fraction of invisible geometry the board would attempt to place on that makes it look like it was placed on a wall. There is a slight angle to the way it sits in relation to the wall but you have to be very close to spot it.
---
You’ve convinced me! I’ll likely just move some of my other points around and just keep pumping strength. At the very least I can also get the perk cards for heavy weapons and optimize that build so I can mix things up a bit! Appreciate the advice.
---
Players wanna play, drones wanna drone
---
because they dont understand the  difference between magic guns Guns and hacked guns
---
One base in over 100,000 easily had a good deal like that.
---
No aluminum for you.  Earle has been an ass today and needs to learn a lesson....again.
---
Well, that’s not good.  I’m closing in on getting a new TV with HDR finally.  Was looking forward to that.
---
Yes, it is really frustrating.  I can only play when everyone in my house is asleep.  Since I can't talk to anyone, I don't bother with group activities and I can't make friends in game.  Can't give Discord information out with emotes.
---
I mean, let's say it's as high as .1%.  I still don't care.  I'd prefer to just play the game, not frantically search and server hop to find good deals like that.
---
xbox one s. works every once in a while.
---
You can put in a ticket at https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10
---
However I can save you time by forwarding the emails I got when I lost my first set of X01 power armor due to server crash during  (fully modded, btw) and the other time I lost some legendaries to server-side trading bugs:
---

---
No. They started giving extra daily challenges out in the first few weeks as "compensation". 
---
Originally we only had 4 or 5 dailies, then they upped it to like 7 once the reports on the bug started coming out.
---
Customer support will tell you they don't have the capability to help people affected by the bug.
---
I might try that, but I have a piano next to my workbench (it makes sense in context) and I don’t know if I have room. But I’ll try!
---
I sold an "I'm Watching You" note you can pick up from Sugar Grove for 20k once. Also for awhile I was picking up Surgical Masks and selling them for 1k a pop, sold a total of 6 lol.
---
Yeah, I’ve seen that. It looks great, but doesn’t fit my camp’s vibe.
---
Well there's only one DLC. XD
---
And some challenges to get atoms need ridiculous amount of time "get 760, 7600 of wood for 40, 80 atoms, kill 1100 robots for 40 atoms, play 7600 hours to 760 atoms". What can you buy with 80 atoms besides a useless picture? Nothing! 0: The minimum is up to 500 atoms.
---
They may not be EA or Activision, but surely they have become greedy, especially since F1st. :(
---
Still, I enjoy this game, but these things are just the ones I don't really like at all.
---
Definitely not the mini with that little ammo.
---
If people would use there mic's and use them right
---
Fair point, but your arsenal will forever remain inferior to the Brotherhood’s if you don’t hunt for the good deals soldier.
---
Well, i bet you we will mostly all work on dmg buffs and enemies resistance debuffs legendary perk cards...
---
In the actual build menu in game? I'm talking a tab just for atom shop purchases.
---
I can make thousands of ammo just farming West tek and lucky hole mine.
---
You know. I asked a very legit question. If you make everything account wide, so you don’t have to do things like earn gold or scrip or whatever. After you do the quests. Then what? 
---
The fact no one really can answer and instead just uselessly downvote me kinda answers it for me.
---
Maybe not the entire map but maybe an entire region? So a circular area roughly as big as the cranberry bog or ash heap?
---
The prison yard has a set
---
 :)
---
 Vampire weapons are quite useful in melee.  I’ve been using a vampire switchblade as my primary since I was about L65.  (I’m 237 now).  Recently supplanted it with a SS ghoul slayers.  Just melts the mobs at WS (and radiation rumble.) 
---
As melee, you will take damage - Healing factor mutation helps keep down the number of stimpacks you need to carry.
---
Twisted muscles mutation - nice melee bonus, but negative effect on ballistic accuracy.   Classfreak2 or 3 goes a long way in offseting it.
---
Didn't check the holo-tape did you...
---
I put a large painting on the wall and popped the game board on top of that.  It’s not the perfect size, but it looks alright.
---
If all three have been launched and still in the cool-down, sure.
---
Ok, so a legendary?  I just started playing a few months ago, still getting the hang of this game
---
I have good weapons already though.  That's the thing.  I have top tier legacies, so why look for anything else?
---
It's all washed out. Looks bad, real bad. But if you turn off the hdr on your ps4 it does still look a bit better than on a normal HDTV.
---
carefully. It took me quite a few tries to get it.
---
I finished it a couple of days ago also and have not touched Fallout 76 since, lmao.
---
Communist propaganda for 23k caps 
---
Someone bought it
---
I mean, its just me talking... but being able to just craft three pieces of secret service armor a day (150 scrip/3 legendary modules) is keeping it interesting... I feel if I could get my perfect set too easily then id be complaining about "ugh, I already got everything I wanted perfect? that was quick... wish that would have taken longer"... its an RNG grind, but I like having three lottery tickets to roll a day... I feel if I could roll endlessly it would be less rewarding when that glorious unyielding, action point refresh speed, *fill in the blank* secret service piece of armor happens.
---
Thought maybe it was a server load issue, but they behave th e same alone in a private server.
---
Oh, that works? What painting? Could I see? Are you using wallpaper?
---
You don’t like going to an event and hearing someone sniffling and breathing like a dying seal the whole time?
---
I'm not even halfway through. Took a break from 76 awhile back to play AC odyssey. didnt expect odyssey to be like 300 hours long lmao
---
Very viable. As far as all the main missions and most of the side missions they can be done solo.
---
Most people will tell you the beginning part of the game with all the story missions is the best part. Once you get to the point of “endgame” is when a lot of people drop off for various reasons. And yes, you can solo all the story missions very easily
---
One of the most useful parts of running around in PA is skipping the stim animation haha, I am always trying to heal myself. I maybe avoid mutations in this character altogether for role play purposes, but I’ll see how everything shakes out when I’m a higher level and a bit better specced.
---
So do I soldier, but while I have a BE handmade and a BE laser, I could use better armor. The Brotherhood of Steel shall reign superior to the Enclave all the time you’re not searching for better weapons and armor.
---
Drop a nuke to sus out the big bois. They’ll show for Earle or SBQ.
---
Think fallout four but with worse loading times and even less consequences for your actions
---
Just a hello emote is nice to see.
---
Yeah if all 3 silos have been used recently. there is a cool down timer. You have a missile silo status holotape that tells you which ones are available.  It's a useful tool when it works (sometimes it doesn't).
---
I’m not in game right now.  I believe it was a large landscape painting of a barn or farmhouse.
---
I remember it was after the kitten and dog paintings when scrolling through.
