Interesting, what if legendary effects were removed for PvP? Then what would happen?

---
I live on the Whitesprings snake and built a little player hub out of a circle of 10 tents- each with it's own purpose (Power Armor, music, kitchen, guest quarters ect.) There are 4 open purifiers and enough crops to make 10-12 adhesive without perks. The trading post and Moonshine tent are also built and mostly ready (just waiting on the updates) 
---
Where’s watoga?
---
I turn on all the radios &amp; activate every ham. 
---
Definitely going to try to come visit you guys! :D
---
You are doing the good lord's work there son. 
---
I feel you. I also am terrified from the multiple grenade traps from stalls in Fallout 4. 
---
I tested this in two spots.  Area chat is ineffective beyond the distance from WS Station to Blackwater Mine right next to it.  That is a painfully small proximity.
---

---
However, your direction effects audio, and what's more audio is badly implemented, you can't hear anything right behind you at all, and players are glitched so their mic audio sometimes comes through weaker or stronger than it should be.
---
From my experience anyways.
---
Speaking solely from my own experience-
---
I upgraded to a One X from my Day One Xbox shortly after getting 76. There was a very noticeable difference in both loading time and stability. I managed to scoop one for about $375 off eBay. I highly suggest it, but if the issue isn’t that bad then I think you can get by.
---
i hopped with a team on pc and got all of it in about an hour.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I messed around with building a maze with traps and such, but I never thought to put a deathclaw in it lol. Comedy gold.
---
Well that's good then right? Then he could sell his duplicate plans? 
---
Definitely banned. You're like already banned and you don't know it yet. Can't be just cooking food in this game willy nilly. For sure 100% banned, probably a hefty fine and some community service too.
---
Yeah I know what you mean - it also makes low levels incredible suspcious when a high level walks up to them and tries to trade.
---
I had a bunch of plans I wanted to get rid of, and saw a lvl 2 fresh out of the vault (I was lvl 70) went over there and no matter what I did they wouldnt trade at all
---
I always re-enter the vender screen and check the weapons and armor for “my items”.  Worst case I’ll have to buy it back.  I do wish there was a lock feature though. 
---
In game there might be somethi g in there. 
---
IRL you may need to seek help. 
---
Does the super duper perk only modify the base not the bonus from chemist? So when it triggers it give 3 not 4?
---
I can never find the food and water plots I think the game lies to me
---
I can see that being a being a problem for the PvP is a part of the game crowd but it would be a cool feature to add for a “kill for a coin” event every kill nets you a token you can trade in for loot or junk. Similar to monster mash. But the game gives you leveled non legendary gear. 
---
Eyyy tas the spot where a 3 star legendary gulper despawned instantly upon death and respawned hanging from the tree without being lootable.
---
Classic Fallout experiences amirite ehh ehh eh eh ehehehh?
---
&gt;That PA is weak and usually incomplete as opposed to a full set of X-01
---
X01 just looks the coolest. T51 is the best for the type of damage you encounter the most in the game. You don't much need the extra ER/RR, just the DR and it's best for that.
---
&gt;Thus making it redundant for PVP which IMO shouldnt be the case.
---
There are a couple viable PA builds for PvP. The best way to mask its vulnerabilities to is get on a team that can counter everything it's vulnerable to. That original post I linked was from a guy claiming that PA PvP builds were too OP. They aren't. It seems like you want them to be despite the fact the best PA in the game is much, much easier to get than the best armor types for PvP. Good loot should be hard to get. That's kind've a hallmark to every game.
---
&gt;its obvious not much thought or work at all was put into making or designing PVP.
---
I think with how staggering and crippling has worked its way into the game for almost every weapon, a lot of thought went into this. I think the problem is most people aren't interested in taking the deep dive into the game's mechanics to find out how to play it well. If you can't figure out the counter system, PvP isn't going to be fun. PvP is only fun when you win. So if you have no interest in the counter system, you're not going to have any interest in PvP - because you will die.
---
&gt;You cherrypicked a few points that support your opinion, there are also PVP players in the same thread claiming the opposite.
---
I don't think they were PvP players because they don't understand tactics employed and their counters. It only takes a while of playing PvP before you figure out the counter system.
---
&gt;Wrong, and ive already explained why 1 shot killfest devolves into broken, boring, tacticless gameplay. See last post again. No weapons should 1shot ever.
---
Ok, difference in opinion. Nothing empirical here. My stance is that if you want this to play like an arcade FPS then there are plenty of games that play that way. These types of games are more about character building. Build choices have consequences.
---
&gt;See above post again why 1 shotting is just stupid game design.
---
Yeah, it's all opinon, that's why I'm ignoring it and will continue to. I don't demand that others have fun the same way I do. Obv what I enjoy you do not. Play the game the way you like.
---
&gt;Thats not real tactics, thats just trading his one shot for your one shot by camping and hoping he runs into your preferred area of combat.
---
Certain builds I can sustain multiple shots from. Others one shot me. Build choices have consequences.
---
&gt;That doesnt mean i dont understand it and your experience doesnt invalidate my opinion or views.
---
It doesn't invalidate your opinions, but it does invalidate whether or not you can claim that melee is OP. If you think 1 shot kills are boring, that's fine. If you think melee is OP, then you just don't understand what your vulnerabilities are as a melee PVP player. Melee builds have a vulnerability that's easy to bring to the surface. You probably won't see it unless you really get into the PvP aspect. I don't argue your opinions, I just argue the things you're putting forward as factually incorrect.
---
I opened a porta John and found a gold brick. Bombs go off and this dude literally shit a golden brick
---
You guys online yet?
---
Put on the perk Can Do 3 and just walk around searching the whitesprings garbage cans
---
Force others off the server?? Sounds like someone likes to try and be a little online bully.  
---
You can also dilute them for even more healing!
---
Or give every player who didn't dupe and joined before the duping patch a full set of the legendary armor of their choice, a legendadry weapon of their choice, and three mutations of their choice.
---
Do you need to repair it? There's a bug with queen fights currently, it breaks but you don't need to repair. This means it actually has infinite durability until the bug goes away. Happened to me once
---
He was running around. I wanted to team with him
---
To find out if any of the buttons work!
---
Alright! Figured it out. Don’t nuke Whitesprings alone or your game will most likely crash.
---
Bulking isn’t worth it other than a couple of items, Aluminum is one of them.  Only do this if you are going to sell junk. 
---
I invested in the Pharma Farmer perks and the Chem weight reduction perks early and sold those for caps, I didn’t bother selling junk.  Besides, the plastic that you use for bulking can instead be used to craft shotgun shells.  
---
Also invest in ammo reduction perks.  That way you can craft bullets as you get lead, steel, and plastic. 
---
You don’t need more than 50 of most items early on.  Keep 50 of each and the figure out which junk you’re using the most, then bump that item up to 100.  Exclusions are steel, lead, plastic, wood, springs, gears, and screws all of which should start at 100. 
---
I'm not disputing that they activate your mutation. I'm disputing that the mutation puts you into pvp.
---
Daaaaamn, MODUS. Think if I equipped Hard Bargain that would go down a little? I got some grape mentats somewhere...
---
Welcome to fallout 76 bud
---
I am always farming it. I'm on pc. gt is newt341.
---
I'm of the opinion that they should be banning characters, not accounts.  But this is a dead horse argument and this sub thinks 100% of banned people are dupers.
---
Funny thing though is Bethesda encouraged you to break their game, then banned you.
---
They exploited you, then said you exploited their product that they purposefully left duping exploits in at release that existed since Fo4.
---
Downvote, I don't care, shitty practices should be called out.
---
hashtag teampoopiepants
---
[removed]
---
Meeee!
---
But I also brace myself EVERY time... Cause one of these days something will pop out at me, I just KNOW it!
---
I thought that was just me. I keep some half way useful low level stuff to give to newer players but most gets tossed in the chest 
---
Psn is FluffyHooves, looking forward to possibly seeing your camp sometime!
---
Maybe they shouldn't encourage players to break their game AND leave known exploits from Fo4 in the game for several months to be exploited.
---
CONGRATULATIONS!!
---
The email 900 hours guy got from Bethesda showed that reg 5.56 and 5mm was flagged too, not just the Ultracite. His main account was flagged first with only Ultracite but that doesn't mean the 5.56 and 5mm wouldn't be suspect on their own. They were flagged on his second account
---
Show me a single instance where they have encouraged players to break the game
---
Are the Mireluck Kinds all in the same area of the cave?  I am trying to figure out the best and quickest way to navigate the cave.
---
My buddy and i double drop nukes all the time. Occasionally freeze on non hotspots, Whitesprings or the queen is almost guaranteed to freeze us withing 3-5 minutes. Reload in and its all good.
---
Any low level stuff for sale that would be good for a noob? Or would I just be better off finding stuff on my own at this point(lvl 13)
---
He's gonna begin moving the ammo tomorrow, will link you the vid
---
I feel like I want Fallout 76 with adventure mode/pacifist doing more for the casual people and a *new* hardcore mode for hardcore people.
---
Your reading comprehension seems pretty bad.  Especially considering Bethesda encouraged players to exploit and glitch and break their game that they left well known exploits from Fo4 in.
---
Guess companies can do no wrong even as they encourage players to do stuff that'll get them banned.
---
Well I wanted the loot but when I got it (Had to run around naked because my Hazmat was doing the same shit) I realized the Scorchbeast Queen doesn't even drop a legendary despite being a three star, does she? She didn't have shit for me, in any case, and I laid a ton of rounds into her. 
---
Seemed like it, but I figured it was a bug so I took it off and went to repair it, then everytime I repaired it it instantly broke. Same for my Hazmat. I ended up going back to the zone running around naked and barehanded. 
---
There isn't one build set up for PvP, but there are certain perks, legendary armors, and legendary weapons that are a massive help in PvE that don't help much at all in PvP. There's also the same kinda of stuff that's a huge advantage in PvP that aren't the best in PvE. It's just like any other specific build. 
---
I’ve completed this quest 3 times on 3 different characters,never had a problem.However like the other poster said I just followed the quest instructions and picked up the dirty fatigues and helmet from the dispenser like you are supposed to do.Just like the quest tells you to do.
---
Same here... just wanted to comment so I could see if anyone else had an answer
---
I haven't gotten any reciever plans in ages.  Once.youve learned them all I'm pretty sure they're removed from the loot pool.
---
This post and this comment is just crying
---
Yeah why should a paying customer encouraged by the company to break their product and then get banned for doing what was encouraged of them be allowed to play the product they bought and were encouraged to do things that'll get them banned in it by the company.
---
Naw we should just buy cars and be encouraged to do things that'll purposefully blow out the engine by the dealer and be SOL because they didn't know not to listen to a company they trusted in......
---
There are multiple youtubers who've done cap stash run walkthroughs, look into that. 
---
Better idea, make the "raider arena" by "Top of the World" functional and allow arena fights between 2 players with fixed armor/weapons and/or allow player vs creature fights similar to the F04 DLC.
---
Tried you the other day wouldn’t it couldn’t stay connected then you just disappeared and what I saw was very impressive will keep an eye out for you :-)
---
I do, but this isn't about that. This is about 24 person Hunter/hunted. This is about team workshop contesting events. This is about full server trade meets. I would much prefer to just be able to host a server and invite people but until that function is implemented the only way to really open up slots on a server is to get people off that server. Server scale events are pretty much the most fun you can have in this game and it would suck to lose the only method that currently exists to make them happen.
---
Your idea why this is a good system makes you a fucking shitty person. "get off my server, I want to do a thing here?" Who the fuck are you, asshole? I've found someone who's even shittier than the griefers, and that person is you. 
---
 Bottom right side of map in the Cranberry Bog region.
---
It actually dropped a gun?  
---
You lucky son of a cunt. 
---
I have. Most of them are just vender tutorials.
---
Yup, same here. I would be willing to bet, they will be making more stuff that will continue to tell the story.
---
They just need a new psn and ps subscription, don't pay this company for the exact same product they used to get your money then kept you from enjoying, OP.
---
Seriously, they don't deserve another penny from you, in fact, they owe you for encouraging you to do things that'll get you banned in the first place.
---
The food and water values for almost all of the workshops aren't actually a thing, baring the one junkyard with a water purifier and the food canning plant. 
---
Question: if you mod a lower level item, does it come up to the higher level (the level you're at)?
---
Look man there aren't private servers. I would be happy to not invite you to anything and have fun with my friends but it just doesn't work that way right now. I know it's a shitty system and there should be something better but with private servers over a year away and slap damage changes being talked about now there's a real chance that server wide events won't be possible. 
---
Same issue here, it's a pain Inthe ass. Apparently it's got something to do with if you played beta it won't complete
---
Thank you u/Ladydevann, Very Cool
---
Well how can it say 10 and have 0? 
---
I agree with op 
---
I randomly got a 3\* legendary pipe rifle.
---
\+30% Ghoul damage, faster movement while aiming, and +50% limb damage
---
It's a level 1. 
---
LOL. 
---
Because toilet jet was a thing and jet is a hell of a drug.
---
On a side note Bethesda can you put water back into the toilets. I kind of miss the days when I would accidentally drink chunky water.    
---
It works fine in VATS, its just a crap VATS weapon, because its designed for casuals.
---
If you do a sneak build, the 2.5+ multiplier will make a huge difference in real damage. I have one AA lever one star, and a non-legendary lever w a lot of upgrades does more damage for me.  TS and TSE were lowered in damage in a prior upgrade. What weapon? That makes a big difference. 
---
To me, it's still just as broken as when it released.   
---
It has 99% of the same bugs, it's literally just tiny little shit they've changed that people keep bitching about, like increased stash limit etc.   
---
They should be focused on fixing the game before they start adding shit into it because of what players want.   
---
It's still a broken pile of shit. I play it daily. 
---
It's available to you on the launcher for the game on PC. I don't know about on consoles. Otherwise, plug in "fallout 76 road map" into google and look it over.
---
I don't use chems or alcohol, so I stash it until I have a decent amount. Then I go vendor hopping and make a few hundred caps that way. 
---
You're not alone, needed a friend to show me where to do the EMP Research Project stuff in Sugar Grove because I legitimately missed one of the rooms due to trying to complete the enclave quest portion at the same time.
---
What's even worse, that room I actually accessed before finding the first part of the Order of Mysteries quest portion BEFORE doing the enclave portion.
---
They REALLY need quest markers in interiors or at least a search area so you're not searching an entire building's interior for a single terminal or container or item...
---
-gestures at bethesda's track record of mistakes, bugs and poor communication-
---
whoa, you still got them mini nukes?
---
So basically you’re a little bully then, picking on people because you’re online and you don’t have to face the repercussions of your actions. You represent everything that’s wrong with online gaming, I would say you should feel ashamed of your actions but people like you just don’t have that facility.
---
This is why we need a reliable method. A hundred things could go wrong doing so, like the server being full, or a crash, getting your items jacked etc
---
Fusion cores from a power plant?? Oh lordy that's the hard way. Kill 2-4 sentry bots at Whitespring, hop servers, repeat till you have as many as you need.
---
I agree that private servers would be GREAT. I hear they're coming one day. Until thin, deal with the system that exists and don't be a _sack of shit_. 
---
Remove vats and legendary effects. And with the server support already coming, maybe? Still not my cup of tea for pvp. If I want pvp, I'll go play battlefield, cod, apex legends, pubg, etc etc etc. 
---
Right now it's mostly just a confusing mess of are you trying to fight me or was that an accident? 
---
And take a moment to consider an assassins cav/sent set. -8% from players per piece. -15% while sprinting/standing still. 5 pieces of armor. That's a lot of damage negation going on. And you'll prolly come back and say there's ways to counter it. But there's a large portion of the player base that doesn't give a shit about pvp and aren't geared out/know how to counter it at all. So what happens? They're forced into pvp by some asshole, then get totally wrecked and cant figure out how/why. Does that sound like a good pvp experience? Lol. 
---
In world time would make sense..  local time would not. 
---
So, opening the door for John Wick role-playing huh? This is a dangerous path we walk...
---
I do it also. It's an impulse really I have to check every square inch of a building even if I know nothings there in fear I might miss something game breaking even though that's never the case haha
---
I throw out heart emotes, I ask nicely, sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do though.
---
You sure the guy you responded too was talking about the marine helmet? I got the impression he was talking about the regular combat helmet.
---
Sounds like you just got unlucky and a higher level player went through the area first and set the spawn level high. Or since it was glowing maybe it was left over from a nuke? Just server hop and try again. Or if its the Wendigo cave you're talking about, it's just a more difficult enemy. Get creative. Use chems power armor and mines. Mines are underappreciated in this game. They are the great equalizer. Throw down as many as you have, hit the guy with a sneak shot and kite him through your mines. 
---
Can you post some hard numbers?
---
Your weapon/its damage/legendary mods.  Your combat perks, etc.
---
Are they in power armor?
---
Super mutants. West tek, generals steakhouse, grafton steel, sometimes harpers ferry. 
---
Yikes.
---
Happened to me last week too.
---
Jumped into some water at the edge of a "you cannot go that way" area whilst trying to find a new place to set up camp and fell through the world. Still had the swimming sound effect and was taking rads for being in the water but couldnt get out- was just stuck. Had to relog to fix it.
---
I got the unexploded bomb there on my run today😁
---
I don't use workshops, because I don't want to be attacked by sociopathic douchebags. Unfortunately, that's the reality. Don't touch em unless you want to be murdered by some creep who probably has a bunch of dead puppies in his basement. 
---
Oh, I still got them mini nukes
---
Since I am not a doctor, I was never given his real name. I can tell you he was a young (teenage) male. He had lost a friend killed in a car wreck, and his girlfriend of like 3 years broke up with him. He was obviously suffering from depression before these losses hit him. I never asked his real name as I know that my friend ethically could not tell me. I don't remember his screen name. I believe he lived in Ohio. I was in AZ at the time, and my friend still lives in Washington state. 
---
 This is a last resort. I ask. I bargain. I say please. At the end of the day though 24 predetermined people need a way to get on to the same server.
---
Waaaait a min 1400 a day? All the vendors are sync’d no? I get 200 a day and all the other vendors have 0 ... do tell!? 
---
Farm legendaries and sell to other players.  I saw a weapon get sold for 25k caps the other day.
---
This was using one of the Facebook groups.
---
I didn’t know sentry bots dropped them. Is there anywhere lower level sentry bits spawn? I’m a level 30 at the moment, and I can take one a sentry bot by itself easy enough, but it turns all the whitespring robots hostile on top of the ghouls. That shit is tough haha
---
Ah I see. After seeing your comment I looked back and yeah, his second account was flagged for 5.56 and 5mm ammo too.
---
 I just found it weird that Bethesda would flag these types of ammo. While, the 900 hour guy did have 55.9K 5.56 ammo and 72.8K 5mm ammo gained in the past 30 days I still found it possible to acquire that much ammo within the given time. 
---
As I said, I don't look to defend the 900 hour guy or anyone that has been banned. I just want clarification on what is considered a "rare item" or if 55.9K 5.56 in one month is considered a violation. Either way, the bans are final but I feel a bit more clarification on these bans would help with all the "I've been unfairly ban and here's why" post.
---
Bestest tip - Whitesprings Nuka Cola Vendor.  Nuka Cola Grape is perfect for nuke zones offering crazy huge rad removal and HP restoration.  
---
YES! Owner of two borzois here. Such a great companions they are
---
Each faction has a vendor and a pool, there are 7 factions in the game, which refill their caps every 20 hours. 
---
Search for “fallout 76 vendor map” and it will show you better then I can describe  
---
Well I was afraid to get my account banned because i craft a lot of ammo.
---
At the time of the 900 hours guy ban, I was about to craft 100 000+ ultracite 5.56 ammo : i did not because of that story, and mostly because of all the commentator saying 100 000 ultra ammo is impossible to do legit...
---
since this story, I guess I crafted around 100 000 5.56 ammo and some other caliber, but more casual. still unsure about my account safety... 
---
this is my character's role play : the ammocrafter, spreading love across the wasteland.
---
thanks for this thread, and please transfert this comment to the dude that made this video, thanks :)
---
Sweeeeet! Will look that up, thanks a ton!! Cheers 
---
Haha interesting thought. That does seem to be the law of the land. This post I guess was more or less bitching about that. 
---
I can find enough junk from scavenging, but fusion cores always seem to be already taken/not spawned in at many generator locations. 
---
How do you get yours?
---
Ok- I’ll let you know if I find some
---
You may be a pervert.
---
We all paid for the game my dude. You haven't paid to rent a private server. Sooo uuuuhhhhh, don't see where you have the right to be a dick to people till they leave. "I ruin other people's game experience to benefit my own" is a really shitty thing. 
---
 I seem to be good after cleaning it. I did pull a lot of crud out of the Prolimatech Megahalmes Cooler. I bought it partly for the name but my i5 750 did do 4 GHz solid, before I discovered that was a waste of time.  ;)
---
Can you point me to ANY statement that came from Bethesda encouraging the exploiting of glitches? Actual posts that give players the apparent right to go nuts with any coding errors they find in Fallout76. Seriously, I'm willing to offer a full unconditional apology to the OP, as I must have missed these posts somewhere.
---
Never been over there, thought you were talking about the place by the power plant
---
You can play the game your way. No one stopping you from picking up ski polls on a server that isn't filled with people trying to host a shindig.
---
I know my ailment stretches all the way back to Fallout 3. When they'd cleverly hide chems and other valuables in the reservoir tanks and bowls.
---
Pretty sure theyre refering to the fact tha tthe quest stays in your log even though you have completed all the steps / collected all the holotapes.
---
I'm thinking it was sarcasm
---
Well the wiki makes that place sound like hell
---
Oof
---
I like gamerMOMover50 her videos are short and to the point, content every day and great series of videos of places you can camp.
---
Just a nice positive person.
---
I like to bounce around and do events. You almost always get a decent number of caps for completion, not including what you pick up from the environs, and fair chance for a legendary or plans. Plus, the events tend to be kinda, you know, fun. 
---
This 100%. Even when my TSE was doing 600+ damage I didn't bother killing them. Hardly worth the effort, and that's significantly more true now. They simply aren't worth the ammo, which is very sad. 
---
Look at what you have. If it's not plastic, lead, steel, ballistic fiber, springs, or screws, you probably don't need more than about 200 of it.,..probably significantly less for a lot of components. Look at your armor, and weapons, see what those need to repair. Look up the crafting and repair cost for excavator armor, and see what that's going to need. 
---
If you don't need  it to repair your weapons, your armor, or craft stuff you're going to be using in the next 10-15 levels, dump down to 50 or so. 
---
Not working with energy weapons? You probably don't need more than 20-30 circuits. 
---
Built up a big base? How much concrete do you have left? is it more than 0? Then you have to much. It's only used for base building.
---
Got more than about 200 wood? That stuff comes so fast, and is so easy to farm? Dump it!
---
People keep recommending you bundle and sell mats...and yeah, if you're desperate for cash, it's an idea, but you're probably going to do better for caps making shotugns shells and selling them, if you don't use shotguns yourself.  The junk isn't THAT valuable, and it takes up inventory space. farming for crap is easy, especially as you progress in this game. 
---
Do you use missiles? mini-nukes? 40mm? Grenades? Not "I might use them in the future" are you using them now? Toss em. Sell your grenades. Keep 5-10 of whatever you like best, (cryo and plasma are my favs, personally) and dispose of _everything else_.  
---
Also look at things like rotten food. That shit adds up.
---
Also, when looking at your stash, be sure to un-equip any carry weight cards you have. Those don't affect the actual weight of stash items, but they DO affect the displayed weight, throwing off your decision making process. 
---
4 stories? Can't use 2x1 stairs? Theres always a way [https://i.imgur.com/0OBTvNl.png](https://i.imgur.com/0OBTvNl.png)
---
Not a sneaker just brute force for me lol. They’re handmades I just didn’t know which effect was better two shot or anti armor 
---
Better yet, remove the stupid fucking PvP mechanics and focus on making this a decent Fallout game. 
---
From what I can tell, absolutely nobody ever even partakes in the PvP.  That or the people who actually try to PvP are only cowards who only go after players who are under level 50. I haven't run into someone actively trying to PvP me since the Beta. 
---
Regardless, their whole idea for an economy was fucking moronic from the start. Why trade with other players when you can server hop/wait a half hour for loot to respawn and just make a looting run. At this point, the duping and infinite exp exploits etc etc have ruined any future for any economy in this game.  
---
They should've just gone straight PvE, let people abuse the bugs they KNEW were going to be in the game at their leisure, and keep it from effecting other players. Not have dumbfuck ass vendor bots with only 200 caps per pool. Who can sell something to you for 500+ caps and only have 100 caps added back into their pool. Whoever decided on that is an absolute fucking imbecile. There should be no limit on how many caps a vendor can hold. It puts a limit on the in game economy. Those vendor bots shouldn't have their own inventory, but should contain only the caps spent by players as well as the items sold to them by players as a sort of trading post/auction house. Put the item in the vendor bots inventory, have the price set depending on your charisma score, and when you come back later if someone has bought that item, you can pick up the caps.   
---
I am still on the process of completing my camp. At the beginning, I just ignored the whole camp building and was one of those guys which camp was a stash box in the ground with some workbenches around. However, after seeing some nice looking camps near Watoga I am starting to take it more seriously. 
---
Now, I spend most of my time farming for materials and junk to sell. I would like to trade with others to make the process more easy, but after being scammed by two players I just lost trust on the current “trading system”.
---
Also, I lost most of my junk after a week of roaming around Appalachia. It just puff went away. This happened just 3 days ago while exploring Sugar Grove. The weight of the items are still affecting my character, but I can not even use them. [I have already submitted a support tkt for it]. 
---
I have 14k worth of 308. You're good
---
If there’s someone on the server you don’t want there, tough luck, it’s not your server. Then you act like a child and throw a tantrum until you get your own way, ruining somebody else’s experience.   It’s people like you that have given this community its shitty reputation.
---
Nah, I recently dropped my collection of 556 ammo.....was like 2000 rounds. I would think it’s a safe bet anything under 15-20k is reasonable since I’m relatively casual and don’t actually grab every 556 I see.
---
3k should be an excessive number 
---
Just another crying baby that don’t want to farm and call it “unfair advantage “ because the others have better gear and stuff then him. Go play the game dude , and start talking bullshit here 
---
Not a single Legendary drop from SB, and i've killed many, trust me.  
---
At least it's easier and less annoying to fight them now, but they never feel rewarding to take down sadly.
---
Thanks. I guess it's the picking it up all at once from an unknown source that made me queasy.
---
It's certainly coming in handy at Sons of Dane, though.
---
You should be good.  
---
I thought i had heard none fell in appalachia.  There is one big radiated crater between freak show and monorail that ive always wondered about.
---
1. It seems to be best if your naked under your power armor, but that’s ridiculous, when I was a power-armor only user I would just wear the vault suit and clothes, and then store my armor to save weight. Now that I’m trying to switch back and forth between PA and not, I wear it
---
2. Missiles suck :(.  Get a rifle or Gatling gun, and VATS onto the thrusters, of both the cargo it and it’s convoy, for the cargo bot once you start hitting the thrusters it’ll stop flying around so far and fast.  A +50% limb damage legendary is nice here, it helps on the damage for taking out those thrusters 
---
Personally, I server hop in watoga. There are four power armor frames and a generator there, as well as multiple ballistic fiber spawns. If a server's cleared out, just hop again. You either land on a server that's cleared out, or a server with 3-5 cores on it. 
---
 Buy low sell high. Its the same everywhere. ;)
---
Nope
---
You _don't own the servers_ and have zero right to force people off, you sociopathic douchebag. 
---
Well I’m turning them right back off again!
---
If it's not my server then it's theirs? I should be allowed to play with my friends, even if there's a lot of them, if that's what I want to do.
---
I rest for 2 weeks and i did craft more than 100 000 rounds of 5.56 legit.
---
Had i spent money buying steel, i would have crafted 200k... still legit.
---
you can't ban legit hardcore players : the cash shop isn't sustained by casuals...
---
No but its more than likely someone offloading unused ammo. Its very easy to accumulate 1000 308 just by farming scorched.  
---
 So those of us who would like it to be purely skill based are out of line? 
---
Absolutely. The pvp of fo76 is a complete joke. Duped magic armor not skill or strategy rules the wonderland, and if you’re not interested in pvp, Bethesda says death to you or GTFO before you’re robbed. 
---
I love that place, and it definitely looks like it got hit by a bomb (all the buildings are kind of blown down the side of the mountain). But it doesn't feel like a nuke crater because the surrounding area is otherwise pristine. Compare that to the Glowing Sea in Fallout 4 where the trees around the area are all facing away from the blast zone.
---
Something exploded there but it wasn't a nuke.
---
Yup. Me too. I would like no Legendaries, no VATS and no Fast Travel. ;)
---
killing  **scorchbeast**  not a challenge, just borring and nothinge else.
---
 Just another guy who cannot stand on his skill. ;)
---
actualy the food what u can nake form sb parts is pretty good. i always hunt down 3-4 every day.
---
It's still skill based with gear. If you want 100% skill based look into a first person shooter where everyone has the same gear. Open world pvp games are all gear and skill based.
---
What do you mean? Vender prices are way more expensive.
---
HEY CLOSE THE DOORS BC IT'S NOT ONLY YOUR WORLD. #FO76courtesy
---
As long as this habit doesn't carry on in the real world. 
---
Please show evidence of encouragement. Oh, and your point about purposefully buggering a car because the advertisment for it says 'It can take anything you throw at it' probably won't stand up in court when they find you put dynamite in it.
---
If you're having difficulty sustaining fusion cores, use rank 2 Full Charge (strength perk), and don't use VATS, melee power attacks, nor gun bashes. This will allow a single fusion core to last practically forever (I've been using the same fusion core for over a month, and have only drained 4%).
---
For more details, see my [observations on fusion core drain](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/a7he9s/some_observations_on_fusion_core_drain/).
---
I agree, the stash limit is per server, so having extra items on a alt would not hurt anything.  Having a safe transfer like Borderlands locker, would be great. 
---
You're playing Fallout 76, that's literally the only explanation. I'm sorry. 
---
They aren’t being rude, they are doing exactly what Bethesda encourages them to do - death and robbery to lower level players or let them GTFO. 
---
There will probably be more when the other vaults open and stuff like that
---
 My alt has a Quad Lever Action, that's 20 bullets before reload, which takes a while. 
---
 My present has an Instigating Lever Action. 
---
 Guess which I like better. ;)
---
There is a counter for every build but how did all if you flickers get a full set if unyielding armor, 3-4 star legendary bloodied weapon and the 3 most beneficial mutations?

I've been looking at making the same swap.. 
---
May I ask what armor youre wearing to be able to tank like that? I wear Vanguard gear but I take less damage in power armor :/ it always seems that if I take even 1 hit in melee, Vanguard is negated and I die before I know it.
---
Oh also when you come to a vendor it will often show 0 caps, but they actually do have caps, give it a test sell, and if they did actually have caps, the total will be updated correctly.  
---
The situation: 
---
Two shot - +25% base damage
---
AA - ignores 50% of armor. 
---
The answer: it depends on what kind of armor you are up against. With the awareness perk, you often see super mutants with 150 or so DR. In that case you should see better results from the AA, I would think. I don't know the formula to crunch the numbers. 
---
The other option is to mod your handmade with penetrating clip and have the best of both worlds. The clip bonus is 40% armor penetration, only 10% less than the AA rifle. Of course, the AA rifle can stack AP as well and now I'm down the rabbit hole again. 
---
You should do a test run and report back what you find!
---
That’s what I’m starting to think too, but I figure there would at least be one - like in the trailer.
---
I used to have my camp just north of there for a very long time. It's amazing for farming .308 rounds  
---
It's bethesdas servers, which have a 4 player team feature. You wanting to abuse the system past that isn't _my fucking problem_ and you being a _dick_ to try to make it my problem, well. makes you a dick? 
---
How cool would a bloodied enemy be! It just keeps getting more and more dangerous!
---
I like the nests idea as well  
---
They said in at least a year from release so not anytime soon
---
I’m not totally up on pricing for this stuff, but I searched falloutmarket76.com and looks like stable flux goes for about 150 caps per. I’d do 1500 for 10 violet (that’s about all I stock up on during nuke runs). If you want, msg me your ps4 username :)
---
That's my camp. 
---
 Ok I'll do it. 
---
 If you put on Power Armor all your other armor is removed. Capiche?
---
Yes, but that is an *optional* objective. If you can not complete the quest without doing the *optional* objective, it is not an *optional* objective. That is a bug. 
---
The fact that the master sergeant allows you to start training with regular Fatigues, not the Fatigues and helmet you get from the voucher, is also a bug. This causes the quest to not allowed to be completed. 
---
I’ve also received a response from Beth after informing of this fix that they will be forwarding the info to the developer team. 
---
I genuinely do not understand why people are trying to argue that in order to complete a quest, you **must** complete the **optional** objective. It can not be spelt out any more clearly this is not the way the quest is intended to function.  If something is **optional**, it should need to be completed to advance. 
---
"Nobody deserves your tears, but whoever deserves them will not make you cry"
---
Hahaha nice camp
---
It’s everyone’s server, 
---
your self entitlement just astounds me. 
---
(I’m in the same boat- saved up and bought the plans, but didn’t realize I’d have to farm violet flux to finish up the shocks. Violet is a pain to get in Whitesprings nuke zones)
---
Zing!! Lol
---
Sorry for your bug.
---
That place is creepy AF.  Just went there for the Raider Rose quest.   See the quest marker at the end location.
---
No, no, no.  SOOooo much no.
---
PA on, down a 5th of whiskey,  take a big hit of Fury, creep forwards with super sledge cocked.
---
Fucker drops like a spider from the ceiling.
---
Vats. Spam.  I did NOT shriek.  I did NOT pre a little bit. 
---
Still looking, found a strangler bloom that i couldnt pick, but no swamp plant yet. Was it on the trees or where?
---
It happens.  Scorchbeast loot is dreadful.  At best you can possibly get another explosive vent armor mod or ultracite leg, which requires flux to make.  You might get really lucky and land a prime receiver plan that you can actually use, which again requires flux to make and more flux to produce ammo for, which isn't any better than a standard hardened receiver against anything but scorchbeasts and their minions.  Given that I can blow through 2000+ 5.56mm rounds with a semi-auto handmade during SBQ, it's laughably not worth it.
---
If I had the stash capacity to store a 25lb prime handmade rifle and 3000 ultracite ammo that I only use during SBQ, I might start accumulating extra flux.  Hoarding stable flux isn't an option because of the weight it takes up in the stash.  Like 1lb apiece.
---
No. As you reread my post i clearly state my marine armor perks work. Also my strength perks work.
---
Close your fissure. 
---
Archimedes? Is that you?
---
Yes. For me it popped up where a couple of gulpers are. I picked up 20-30 and eventually it gave me a swamp plant. Good luck!
---
Here is a suggestion, could you add giant creature spawn locations. I keep running into a scorch beast on the mountains by moss town.
---
Timing is important for some perks? And them showing the time would look better aesthetically 
---
 I'm sorry I was being facetious. If you can grab high value item for little effort the you can easily make money. 
---
 I manage to fund my travels by scamming up crap in the immediate area and by knowing what to take, and what to leave. ;)
---
On ps4 ive seen it at a few train stations. Try Charleston train i know ive seen it there a couple of times
---
Wow
---
Yea thats true. Are you high, though?
---
Did it look the same as the strangler pods?
---
You on PS4 I think I have one just logging in
---
No just letting you know to stop crying because it's not worth it :)
---
Yes it was a strangler pod. When i picked it. It said strangler pod and swamp plant. 2 notifications
---
ewwwwww
---
I didn’t play beta though 
---
You clearly enjoy the game and, regardless of how we all got here in this moment, I hope this all works out in the end. Also, I hope you stop getting hateful messages—that’s just unnecessary.
---
Now, without either casting aspersions or making declarations as to who or what I believe, I simply must state that I have some confusion as to the generally accepted notion of Bethesda’s methodology for sniffing out (allegedly) duped rare materials.
---
That notion being (1) Bethesda is able to track the bandying of items to/from different accounts while (2) logging the destination and accumulation of said items between those accounts; also while (3), Bethesda tallies the entirety of these exchanges as a number entirely separate from the actual items being tracked. In a system which would also allow Bethesda (4) to see the current and full inventories and to (5) query the income/outflow of other related inventories contributing to the tally of exchanges.
---
Essentially: “My right hand has a quarter. It dropped that quarter on the floor. My left hand picked up that quarter but then dropped it. The exchange ended when my right hand picked the quarter back up.” 
---
The system you suggest (as applied to my quarter) tells me that my right hand must have experienced an income of 50 cents. But my eyes, which allowed me to see those exchanges (the same as Bethesda’s logs) would show that the entirety of my exchanges involved only a single quarter. Add 5 more people and 10 more hands, no matter the number of exchanges we still have only 1 quarter between us.
---
Simply, and less tiresomely, this pick-up/pass-through/drop-off/repeat system might not be the culprit. Especially since my buddy’s mule has had a great deal of ultracite ammo pass through it’s hands in the same manner I described my quarter. I mean, I’ll be happy to eat crow if he gets banned but it hasn’t happened (yet??).
---
 ROYFLMFAO!
---
 Its coming. Build up your Atoms as the data mined PA skins are just amazing. ;)
---
All I want is an interior cieling so I aint lookin at rafters lol. Nicely done, been trying to stack stairs for months!
---
Yea thats fair. I can see how it comes off as crying, but its just hella dissapointment. Same shit tho.
---
I suppose if you actually have a build where you care about the bonus effects. Where I'm at, I'm just eating to keep the hunger meter full. I don't need the wasteland's version of filet mignon for that. Mole rat, mongrel, and glowing meat do the job just fine. Heck, I even eat dog food or moldy food in a pinch. 
---
Game Transfer Phenomenon is a hell of a drug.
---
I was hoping youd like that😉
---
You are an artist, like Davinci, or like Sander Cohen from Rapture.
---
I freaking hate it...thinking next time I bring a king with me see if they fight each other.
---
Yeah no...I'm right there with you. That shit was a me "boarding the nope train to fuck that Ville" moment for me.
---
I was hoping you liked that😉
---
same
---
Oh ok, oof im at like 34 right now
---
They drop from assaultron dominators, which can be found in the missile silos.
---
Do you have links to this info?
---
Idk why people down voting when you are giving counters lol.. and pain train perk works really well my friend can Sprint into me and knock off half my hp while im in sent assassins. Pulse grenades also hit through it with the electric damage
---
I have an instigating one myself mainly ammo conservation.  But the quad is for when I’m going to be gone from camp a long time. 
---
Eventually it will work. I did a couple of runs of 30 though :)
---
That would definitely be very cool, even as just something to look at while bored.
---
I'd personally take a lot of pride at having 1000's of scorched, super mutant and ghoul kills and 0 squirrels/frogs/foxes/chicken/rabbits.  I might even run away from sloths and hermit crabs to actively preserve a no-kill mantra if they didn't show up in SBQ.  I gotta defend myself.  I do like sloths, though.
---
That's completely unnecessary and you should be ashamed of yourself. It's far better to lead over Whitesprings sentry bots from nearby and have them do it for you instead we are civilized West Virginians allow the robots to deal with the riffraff. 
---
Is there an easy way to deal with super mutants, I feel like they just tank all my shots
---
How long did it take them to respawn? Or can u server hop or something?
---
Two shot uses double durability per shot, so anti armor is better for long fights, and against high armor targets.
---
I’ve never gotten this?
---
I did a run and waited a couple of hours for another one
---
You only get banned for acquiring 100k of a item within a 30 day period or for having lots of rare weapons with the same roll aka duping
---
Ah cool, thanks man:)
---
Had someone build a camp at the golf club last night after we went and double nuked whitesprings. No respect. I'd have dropped a 3rd out of spite if it wasnt in cooldown from a queen run.
---
Just put a vertibird sized load of mines on their property. Free firework show and you send a message. 
---
I have an explosive Gatling laser, but haven’t seen one drop in forever.  
---
So if you drank a pint of drain cleaner the company would be responsible because, although they told you don't drink, they didn't actively prevent you from doing so? 
---
No problem but i've been grinding a long time for this... there's no guarantee you'll get it.... so keep trying. I did it too en eventually got one
---
So is a using whatever I feel helps not a pvp build
---
 Can you google "Fallout 76 data mined Power Armor Skins"?
---
 If not I will find that for you. (Internet Post Graduation Education Society) Yes, I have been drinking!
---
You keep your hands off of my life preservers sir. 
---
Plastic, glorious plastic.
---
Some enemies, such as the grafton monster, super mutant behemoth, and mega sloth, drop around 10-20 caps each time you kill them. I set up my camp near to where two grafton monsters always spawn, and I kill them whenever I return to store my junk and repair my items. This gets me about 200 extra caps a day.
---
You can get a guaranteed Deathclaw span at the Deathclaw Island west of the Race Track Workshop location.
---
That should help you in finding one for the future.
---
I was just trying to see if you where trolling or not. And have you been drinking anything good?
---
If that's the case, then they should be confined to fissure sites, events, and quests. First one I encountered was as soon as I discovered Welch Station. Second one while exploring around Big Fred's BBQ Shack. And the third one attacked as soon as I fast travelled to Sunnytop Station. All three appeared out of nowhere. No warning, no nothing. Went from hidden to danger in a snap and got hit with the scream before I even heard their wings flap. Broke all my armor and weapons before I finally gave up and left the server each time. Not fun.
---
How do I post my ps4 screenshots?
---
I’m pretty sure the shielded sells at the enclave vendor for around that price.  Only will appear if you’ve bought the others though. 
---
Appalachia was spared from direct blasts but was hit with the aftermath of the nukes.  I always assumed that zone by fort defiance was a fusion generator or something like that seeing as lucky hole mines not to far from it. 
---
If you don't have a build set up to have weapons do damage over her Dr, then ur not gonna do any damage. With the vats Dr stats and my stabilized perk, she has a dr of 180, stabilized takes 45% of her armor off. So with no anit armor perks I would have to do roughly 350 DPS for her to take damage. According to my stragey book she has a base damage of 32,000 health, and scales with the people on the server. When she is flying her Dr seems to go up cause your weapons to less damage at range. Cripple her on the ground and set up ur build to have weapons do damage over her Dr( multiple people shooting her with heavy fast fire rate guns us a good way to do that)
---
You can buy the power fist plans from Phoenix in watoga. I would wait until max level to buy any items, as lower level items quickly become obsolete. If you really need a good unarmed weapon, you can find a power fist on the top of tangra town.
---
Wish you better, good luck friend
---
&lt;3
---
I have a level 45 excavator armor repaired to 130 and with mods on all limbs if youre interested in a trade
---
 Oh yeah. An IPA called Six because of the amount of hops and Scotch. With my daughter and granddaughter yet. ;) 
---
 No I'm super serial, that stuff is awesome.
---
Unfortunately you can only set 2 mines at a time it would seem.... Unless it's been fixed? 
---
I would’ve said yes but the reason why I’m trading is because I bought a t51b jet pack thinking it would fit on the ultracite set and it doesn’t. Should’ve made researches before lol
---
I’ve had upwards of 7 before. 
---
That's where chems and bobbleheads like to chill
---
I’d make a new character. I was in the same situation as you, and wanted a heavy gunner build instead of a rifleman build. I think it’s good to have two characters, so if either rifles or heavy guns get a massive buff, you can switch back and experience it.
---
Ooof. They’re military facilities with nuclear launch control at the end, three of them on the map: Silos Alpha, Bravo, Charlie. It’s an endgame area. If you’re on PS4 and not leveled I don’t mind running in for you and grabbing you a couple. No charge of course :) 
---
 Nice I'm not to much of a beer fan I'm more of a burbon fan
---
I’m in ps4, what’s your psn?
---
Thankyou.
---
Strength is maxed at 15. Will have to look through my perk cards.
---
This has happened to me a couple of time and it always makes me chuckle. Glad to hear it’s not just me lol.
---
Does fires faster affect the charge speed? If not then it’s still a good weapon, you could use it well until you found a better one.
---
I dm’ed you 
---
Your rediculous dude
---
Hey sorry, I'm on now if you are still interested! 
---
Ahhh why dont you just farm mutations and get marsupial bud
---
Hadn’t thought of doing that. I’ve learnt something today.
---
Ahh i gotcha why dont you go mutation farm and try to get marsupial its the same thing no?
---
Blackwater mine has a good few. 
---
Yeah and no, jet pack let you jump even higher. Marsupial is reliable half of the time but if it’s higher than a bus you can’t reach it every time and get killed by whatever is attaching you. 
---
Awesome y'all
---
Tyvm
---
Thanks guys really thought I was going to get bashed for posting this. Was just getting tired of seeing these lazy people.
---
How did you get them to stack?
---
You on ps4? We could power level tomorrow or something when im on
---
Thanks everyone, some really useful advice here!
---
Haha, 
---
We almost got the deathclaw... oh crap now it is angry. 
---
 You will, if you persevere, become powerful enough to hunt Scorchbeats for sport. That's what I do and I am testing weapons against the most powerful monsters in the game. 
---
 I killed a level 50 Mirelurk Queen with my dagger yesterday, ;)
---
Nope, your punishment for meta is School Bus yellow.
---
Players really sleep on leather armor, especially late game.  I have a very nice heavy unyielding, +25 poison resist and "harder to detect while sneaking" chest piece, with shadowed and dense mods on my sniper character, and the ballistic DR is only a few points less than the shadowed heavy combat piece (mutants/+1 str/+50% durability) I was wearing, while the energy resist is way higher.  I had a padded mod on the combat piece and would regularly kill or severely injure myself with my own explosive handmade rifle, while I can literally stand right next to a car, shoot it point blank with a TSE handmade, and take maybe 10% damage from the car explosion and explosive rounds combined.
---
If you have a rifle/shotgun/pistol build with an explosive legendary weapon and conventional armor and don't have a dense chest mod, it's a game changer.  Please no comments that "you're doing it wrong".  I can use a stealthboy mkIII with 20+ ag and full shadowed/muffled armor when sneaking around the exterior of whitesprings gold club to wake up the mobs, and I'm going to be in \[danger\] before I can jump on top of the short bus in the parking lot, so taking almost no damage from my own great weapon and perk investment is incredible.
---
Dude marsupial is everything. 
---
100k of a rare item. i've cycled through 100k of 5mm easy within 30 days
---
Ahhh gotcha
---
What system are you playing on?   
---
You can't. Have you ever tried to set the pip boy ? Every day is October 23. These are powered by tiny fusion reactors. You can't set them or change them. 
---
(This is a simulation)
---
I have never seen this.  What platform are you on?  I play on PC.
---
I'm a trash can raider and a dumpster diver. I ain't ashamed.
---
 Whu! A solid hit!
---
Marsupial is good but not 100% reliable. Hate it when I walk backward with a bunch of ghouls or super mutants then try to jump just to fall back in horde. Doesn’t happen every time but when it does it’s annoying 
---
Beer does not have scotch, Beer is hops ( or gruits) barley, water and yeast. But kudos to you for having taste and drinking something pleasant other than corn water ( basic bro beer) 
---
Well, it's *supposed* to remove all your other armor when you get in power armor. It just doesn't always do it. This was a bug in FO4 as well. A couple months ago, I had a right leg that always maintained the perks even when in power armor. I said something to tech support and now it doesn't do it anymore. By bringing it to their attention, yours will get fixed as well and you'll no longer get the perks in power armor. My condolences.
---
i agree.  shame on us for having an opinion amirite?  and yeah, seems uninspired and nothing more than a decent location... 
---
Yes
---
Well shit... with my luck they WILL actually fix it. I figured there was a bug but wasnt sure on what end
---
 A nice IPA is a great chaser for a moderately good Scotch. ;)
---
I'v taken 10 shots at 95% and some days will land 7, some days 9, almost never all of them.  Sure, at 95% that means there is a 5% chance of missing, but it seems much higher then that.
---
Any chance you could link the perk cards you’re using? I used Vanguard at some point and didn’t have any issues.
---
They say none but near the train elevator, it looks like a crater and there is radiation emanating from the center... So i dunno. Head up there and check it out.
---
At least 2 hours ago i killed a 65 or 80 can't remember and got an ultracite gatling laser gun. It's the only best thing I've ever gotten from these monsters. Even when i fought the SBQ I've gotten only known plans and junk. I only kill these things for xp or if they are in my way. I always solo in this game but i don't mind teaming up with people if they need help.
---
Not of a rare item but if you have for example 5-10+ max lvl 3* deathclaw gauntlets with swing speed and strength you obviously are duping. For the 100k of a item it’s if you craft over 100k rounds of one type of ammo or possess a unusually large amount of ammo that raises flags with the devs 
---
Xbox? I saw something like this and learned a lot from it.
---
Yeah, serves us right. /s. I've got a couple other bugs up my sleeve that I'll never report now because they improve my QoL in the game. No duping, exploits, or anything that would impact the server or other players. Just some minor things that are obviously not working as intended, like the armor thing, that benefit me a little.
---
I’ve been running around in the vault tec boiler-suit (costume) and hard hat with a  pipe wrench. 
---
I’m yet to convince other players I’m a vault tec employee trying to fix the disconnects and black screens in the simulation. 
---
 Of course.
---
I want a cat.
---
...Cranberry Bog? It's where the craziest mutated plant life is and home of the biggest giant glowing green fissures, makes sense that would be ground zero if one dropped around these parts. 
---
Nice!
---
Borderlands tough you there's crap...but sometimes that crap turns out to be a sweet quirky gun
---
Same. Well down by the water at least. I made quite a few caps off of that wedding ring 
---
I use it, I hope it gets nerfed.

Hoping someone else will chime in, but the only way I know is to wait until you see an event in the mire called 'Heart of the Swamp'. Join the event, and then leave and go to where the blooms spawned during the original quest. They should be there. The event is rare, so I'm hoping someone else has a better way.
---
It works.
---
This just fuckin killed me!! 
---
 Yes tell us!
---
 I can take the pods, does that fuck up the blooms. There is a lot I don't know about them.;)
---
there are 3 armor piercing mags, they all have the same armor piercing.
---
stinging has 35 round magazine
---
Honestly fishing in fallout would be cool as hell 
---
I hope this works-  https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3f238eb&amp;d=sb2e60ek0c71ib4s12l71lt2lu2lv2a72s70an2a04p00pd2pk2p61pp2pl2ar1&amp;w=&amp;n=
---
That’s really good
---
No plan sorry... but don’t do the drop thing. If you get disconnected from the server your stuff is gone forever. 
---
If you're wearing conventional armor, even a +25 resist full marine suit, eat a radaway, glowing stimpak and radshield, you'll die within a couple seconds in a nuke zone.  Hazmat suits and Power Armor have some hidden multiplier that allows you to take very little rad damage, while conventional armor is exempt.  
---
I like to play a sniper and don't really care for power armor on that character, but I'm forced to either wear a hazmat suit with 0 defense, or begrudgingly jump into the X-01 suit that I saved, swap in commando perks and stomp around with a quad automatic tesla rifle to participate in a whitespring nuke.  That is, until the rifle bugs out and I stop dealing any ranged damage and miss out on loot from most of the golf club mob when I swap over to a last ditch mutants/SS/-90%weight bowie knife.  At that point I have to hope someone present will accept a friend request so I can rejoin the server and deal damage for another ten minutes, then keep repeating the process.
---
My alt only gets out of his power armor to make food, occasionally repair his sledgehammer, and possibly sleep when I need to pee.  I can stand right in the middle of an entire golf club nuke mob with a tesla coil torso mob, take very little damage, tag and aggro everything without swinging my weapon once, then help clean up after everyone else got their free hits.  Enemies relentlessly aggro on power armor and tesla coils.  I started the alt about a month ago, and he's already higher level than the sniper I'd been playing since the first BETA Thursday.  Never any damage bugs, glitched weapons or perma \[danger\].  Just smash and enjoy.
---
Where is this place?
---
No way.... Every time I set one down I can only set one more and then the third will explode the first one. Maybe I set them too close together, but the radius shouldn't be that sensitive.... It usually kills me too. 🤷‍♂️ 
---
Depends what your hopping for...
---
Its their mic settings.  Unfortunately had a lvl 4 running around Flatwoods yesterday heavy breathing into his mic, coughing, etc, and I could here it just fine.

Cranberry Bog is due to a malfunctioning G.E.C.K. from the nearby vault.
---
They flag the pinatas with stars, and they smoke crazy colours to catch your eye. The big "reward" of fighting tough enemies is experience points. 
---
Because when you stop to take a shit, you want to make sure there isn’t something in the stall next door. 
---
I'm currently working on a kinda bunker style metal box base that utilizes a cliff. It's working okay at the moment but I want to get more of that Free States vibe going on!
---
If you quit and just hit play again it will put you in the same world you left. I load into my friends games to server hop.
---
I think it’s become better in general except now there are high level grievers if you set up camp but other than that I think it’s improved a good bit from December 
---
That’s not a problem any more. I’d suggest googling “Fallout 76 Inside The Vault” and reading up on the changes over the past few months. They’ve changed a lot for the good. 
---
They're in the river alongside dryer chemical on the trees 
---
It’s rare AF.    They come up when someone is doing heart of the swamp 
---
All I run is .308 and .45 so I drop everything else at train stations.  If you found a bag sitting in front of the vendor with a bunch of random ammo along with some spoiled meat/fruit/vegetables and useless holo tapes there is a slight chance it was me.  Probably do it a couple times a play session.
---
I don't have one of those, but I'll keep it in mind. Thanks.
---
I did not say the bans were justified. I am not in any way on Bethesda's side lol
---
Me too, it regenerates so frequently.
---
I love finding dropped loot in lockers or suitcases at train stations
---
Woah you read my mind. Btw ty for your tips and methods I love I will make sure to save this spot. So I was going for full Trapper Armor with +25 radiation resistance....just collected my final piece. I did calculations and I saw it would come out to around 315 rad resist if the effects worked. I saw my power armor got me to a little over 500. So I thought with a rad berry I can go in the nuke zone with some nice legendary effects. So you’ve already tested this? I’m disappointed but maybe  the highest radiation resistance normal armor will come in handy some day! Thank you for warning me so I don’t keep going for this stuff
---
This
---
Nope, the datamined PA-paints are for T-45, T-51, T-60 and X-01 armors, OP asked about paints for Excavator, Raider and Ultracite armors which there has been exactly zero stuff datamined for. Community manager claims there is Excavator stuff coming though.
---
They drop ultracite and +3 stat food. Where else you going to get that easily?
---
The AMS mining headquarters in Watoga has a bunch of Ultracite ore sitting around. You will need to kill some robots and turrets, but it's probably the easiest way to get Ultracite ore outside of fissure sites.
---
I agree with you. With the Wasteland feeling so empty with the absence of NPC's a pet would be very welcome indeed. like a reason to come home and find your deathclaw wagging its tail waiting for you.
---
Oh, I was under the impression you had left it as the default, sorry.
---
The fact that they don't, considering that they are essentially the game's mini-bosses, is a gross oversight.
---
You should pick up the Blocker perk to reduce incoming melee damage.
---
The budget used by each thing we build decrease when level increase. But to take avantage of it, we have to rebuild everything. Some things use a lot of buget. Turrets use the most. I bet vending will use a lot.
---
Garden gnomes can be scrapped for concrete,  theres also loose pieces of concrete in the are. There are better places to get concrete however now.
---
Is it better than launch? Sure. I'd say give it a shot again! Just keep your expectations low.
---
What if you need to feed canned dog food, bring it out to poop every 30 minutes? Will you still want it?
---
The pods are, but they are not blooming. I haven't seen a blooming pod since I did the Dyer Chemical quest.
---
I can recall ONE single stall that has a grenade in the entire game.  I was kind of disappointed.  
---
thanks dude. if the division 2 flops then getting back into this game is definitely happening
---
Check out the road map for content updates over the next 100 days. These are just the first. Tuesday's is a small update with a new crafting ability, consumables, questline, small location, and dailies. Then Friday they start the first holiday event, the Faschnacht parade. Should definitely look up what else is coming over the next few weeks, man. It's a lot to type out
---
That's a good suggestion, thank you. What in my build should I sacrifice to gain those 3 points to add it? Or should I just swap pharmacy for blocker when going into an area where melee is likely?
---
I was just thinking, I do take the most dmg from melee- ballistic weapons from enemies barely do any dmg at all.. it is just melee that smushes me- even in power armor. Thank you for pointing out this card- I hadnt realised which dmg type was dealing the most pain.
---
In average, yes, it get worst if you are moving, even worst if both your target and you are moving.
---
I do the same thing, but instead of dropping Stims I drop propaganda flyers. 
---
Another way to look at it is that Fallout was-the-way-it-was because that was the most practical way to do a sprawling adventure game back then.  Graphics in 1997 hadn't advanced far enough to do the Bethesda version, but we could do 2D exceptionally well at that point.  This was the same time when hybridizing the two approaches was popular, like in Final Fantasy VII.
---
Had Fallout been created in 2019, it probably wouldn't have been a 2D game.  This is somewhat vindicated by how the The Outer Worlds is, in fact, a first-person RPG.
---
Haha that's a pretty good one.
---
That's XCOM baby
---
Are we getting accounts back on Tuesday after patch
---
A Pomeranian. My 8lb one can’t carry much but he’d strike fear in an enemy. Oh he thinks he would. 
---
I had a few tamed ones at my base, but they kept attacking passers by who retaliated (fair enough really) by blowing my shit up, and the sloth kept making his noise and attracted other players to do the same thing. 
---
Pets are nice and they certainly keep super mutants and mole rats at bay, but they just make other players the monsters instead
---
I always seem to be dumping mountains of .38 and .308 rounds. I wish we could box up unwanted ammo to sell, or recycle it into ammo we use.
---
If i recall, you stack two support beams onto the stair case, then delete the first beam.  You should be left with a floating beam above the stairs. Then you can slot a staircase into the space.  Theres guides on youtube to do a walkthrough.
---
Yes. They said since energy weapons don't fire actual bullets they can't be explosive so they are temporarily removing them from the drop list
---
I have a fetish for fallout darks idea I suppose. That and the teddy's reading nespapers😅

Shitter is the best place to find a magazine. I mean logically it is. I keep looking and all I find is skeletons in compromising positions.

Go there at night. They bloom at night.
---
That's brutal, why does everything have to be RNG in this game? Why can't I set out and make stuff happen? That is incredibly frustrating, like getting my X-01 calibrated shocks from the bunker store, urg!
---
I really think it should be as straightforward as nuking the area, which is still enough of an effort to make it rare but at least you could actively make it happen in that case.
---
Well, I still do not think that calling Bethesda out for "killing fallout" is a right thing to do 
---
There is a perk in endurance that reduces roads over time during daylight. You only need the first star, it works fast enough to deal with minor raids. Anything higher and you'll probably need radaway anyway.
---
It definitely helped 
---
It has been consistently improving, but there’s still a way to go yet. I’d give it another go in the knowledge Bethesda seems to be reacting to the criticism and feedback from the community and taking responsibility for improving the game. Unfortunately this won’t happen overnight, so some patients may be required lol.
---
Get GunFu level 3 and level 2 adrenaline
---
ditch the hardened hunting rifle and get a lever action and handmade with a calibrated or tweaked automatic receiver.
---
This is my build. I vendor 200+ stim packs a week, and use random full auto rifles/pistols with tweaked receivers with zero weapon perks. i use a TSE lever action at the queen with 3 level 1 rifle perks. I've ditched bloody mess and gone to level 1 four leaf clover to swap on starched genes and class freak.

There is not a fusion core generator for your camp. He is talking about the fusion generator that when you build provides 100 electricity for your settlement.  If you can build that, then you can power up the fusion core machine without messing with the actual power plant

Maybe pick up a vampire's weapon so you stay close to full health?

I wondered about a  lvl 32 guy one night, ended up taking my ski sword to him smh

Ive seen this too. But it appears to be part of the tricentennial addition of the game.

Is it really that simple?

As has been suggested, Blocker ends up being important.  Melee attacks, for whatever reason, tend to cut right past Vanguard's defenses.  The same is true of our dear friend Colonel Gutsy.  As you also noted, Vanguard's effectiveness is based on your total HP.  If you're irradiated, it chews into the benefits of Vanguard, so enemies like Glowing Ones pack a one-two punch of rads *and* melee that can get out of control very quickly.
---
Someone once told me that DR/ER is overrated in general.  At the time, I shirked at that, but now I'm starting to realize where they are coming from.  I've run Vanguard for a while, but I'm also starting to gravitate into Unyielding because the benefits of things like Radicool on melee are impossible to deny.  I don't think Bolstering does much better than Vanguard, for the same reasons.  If something gets your HP that low, seemingly ignoring armor, then I don't trust the armor to protect me.
---
Prestige is month or so, pvp is 26th of this one

I use a tse quad exp combat rifle for just running around- tse handmade for when I want to hit harder/snipe from a distance, and a tse dragon for queen.

Dont automatic receivers stop you from using rifleman?

I have tried gunfu.. honestly it annoyed the heck out of me because I'd spin 180 and target the furthest away friendly instead of the ghoul running at me :/ has that been fixed?

Do you spam drop stuff?

Having an OP weapon isn't necessarily the result of duping.  They might have come from duper, but it's just as likely that someone got lucky and found an OP weapon legit. But that's like hitting the jackpot at a slot machine or winning the lotto.  Having a built in PVP advantage simply because you got lucky is a broken game mechanic, IMO.  Nonetheless, I agree.  Legendary weapons in PVP is not a great thing IMO.
---
Any one of you have the Confederate soldier outfit plans?

 Oh my. As a fellow stabby stabby guy I can sympathize. 
---
 I'm not sure Bloodied would work for me as I often take damage with my various knives as I kill all kinds of things.  
---
It was GREAT, thanks guys 😎
---
Thanks for the tip.  I found it right where you said on the first try.
---
You can eat them, or use them to craft Super stimpaks 
---
I have definitely tested vamp weapons- trouble is they dont heal rads- so if your health bar has been eaten into by rads, it doesnt help :( thank you for the suggestion though
---
We fought a 3 star SBQ in Watoga last night. I guess it was bugged because it was there and it wasn't in a blast zone. I got an Executioners Rolling Pin and my buddy got a Berzerkers Lead Pipe. We spent like 30 mins on it and blew through a ton of ammo for vendor trash. Never again. I don't think I'm going to bother with SBQs unless I need stable fluxes from Scorched Earth anymore. 
---
Hmm, hard to say since you're pretty much all in for the damage perks.
---
You could drop a point from either Endurance or Agility and put 1 into Charisma to get Max Rank "Lone Wanderer" for the 20% Damage Reduction. Sacrifice the Rank 1 "Well Fed" for another 10% AP Regen on "Lone Wanderer" passively sounds like a good trade off.
---
There's conflicting reports on Concentrated Fire (so I've read on reddit) that it actually doesn't increase damage per shot. 
---
But the main function I use it for and maybe you do too is the ability to quickly select body parts, mainly the head in VATS.
---
I'm not too sure about the "Sneak" perk. If you are approaching enemy encounters from long range and have high AP/AP regen, you should be able to pick them off before they get to you.
---
Another perk you can drop to add to Strength might be "Thru-Hiker." Stock up on non-perishables like Boiled Water and canned food. That way you only need to carry what seems reasonable for your weight limit and you don't have to worry about them spoiling.
---
Recap:
---
If you looking to add points to Strength to pick up the "Blocker" perk as well as Max Rank "Lone Wanderer", consider dropping:
---
- Rejuvenated (exchanging for similar bonus on Lone Wanderer)
---
- Thru-Hiker (not fully maxed to receive benefit, strength already low = low carry weight)
---
- Sneak (you are fighting from long range and once you're discovered, Blocker will help against melee attacks)
---
I hope this wasn't too long winded and helps you with your build!
---
Yeah I would love it! I don’t know if you’re still on but I should be on in about 20 minutes. 
---
I have several characters who simply use the default icon. I've only seen this message once on each new character after a few logins/levels (not sure which). When it pops up, I just pay it little attention, and press esc, or click, or tab, or whatever it is wanting, as I am already accustomed to "error-handling" my own input in this failtastic UI.
---
I have seen many people suggesting the ability of building camps more closer to each other as a way to create little towns or neighbourhoods. Personally, I like that idea as I always wanted to have a neighbour. I built my first real base [still in progress] near the Poseidon power plant (on the cliff between the road and the cooling tower) just because it is close to a popular CAMP site near the nearby train station. 
---
Agreed! Fishing trips with friends, a camp fire and a beer. Reminds me of the early days of WoW.

Consumable item used to make 'Corpse Seed Juice.' A beverage that grants 15% thirst, 10 to max AP and HP.

Recipe is just boiled water and the seeds. Not sure if having the seeds grants the recipe or not. Or if eating one does, etc.
---
I thought super stimpaks were corps stamen?  I don't have super stimpaks recipe yet to test
---
Yea no it’s being rude man. Why would I play a game that I can’t advance in because higher levels that no-lifed the game became invincible and take what they want. 
---
It’s not encouraged because there is a system in place to prevent it, In the form of you both “having” to do damage to eachother. Pvp is encouraged between players who want to fight, and they tried to deliver a single player experience to those that wanted it, but they failed on the second part even though there are measures to “prevent” it. 
---
It makes people not want to play the game, and that’s why it’s dying.

Can you wear the roach's ring? I really miss seeing the ring from FO4 on my hands.

I do Heart every time it appears.  Go start it. Whack the Heart a bit. Then run to that little bend in the creek behind Dryer Chemical. Collect the flowes, they glow. Return to finish the Heart. Easy peasy.
---
Thank you for the suggestion. Ill try 1 card of it and see if there's improvement there. Your point about melee seeming to slice right through Vanguard makes sense- I wonder if that's a bug?
---
Unyielding does look like fun but yikes for having to be so close to death all the time *lol* 
---
It's possible that rad-resist armor might be patched someday.  However, even with a full set you're looking at +125 resist.  A Radshield that prevents 300 rads makes no appreciable difference in power armor.  I use T-51b, which isn't even close to top end power armor rad resistance.  The whole system is completely broken.  Your two options are a power armor suit that offers "good" rad resist with "excellent" protection, or a hazmat suit that offers "excellent" rad resist with "that's funny, dude" protection.  The choice is very clear.
---
Power armor seems to afford something akin to the damaged hazmat suit that has a rating of +500.  You have to periodically suck down a radaway or use a nearly shower if available, but it's a mild inconvenience.  An undamaged or prototype hazmat suit with a rating of +1000 will read less than 1 rad a second, and you might have to use 1-2 radaways during a full blast zone from start to finish. (somewhere over an hour)  The trade-off of a hazmat suit is that one...you have only DR from perks and mutations, which is generally woeful against literal hordes of ghouls, and two.... that horde will break your hazmat suit in less than a minute.  It doesn't seem to be bolstered by White Knight or Fix it Good perks.  I used to carry like 10 of each diluted rad-x (doesn't suppress mutations like regular rad-x), glowing blood packs and radshield.  The difference they make is negligible, but they take up a lot of weight unless you have Traveling Pharmacy 3 (which I swap out for Blocker 3 in nukes, because 100% of your foes are in melee with you in whitesprings, and probably 75% during Scorched Earth)
---
However, hazmat suits are very good for farming flux (assuming you have the glowing mass, hi-rad fluids and hardened mass from previous enemy engagements to stabilize it with).  You can sneak around an entire blast, gathering tons of plants (literally they will encumber you without rank 3 thru-hiker), fast travel back to camp and stabilize (don't forget to equip Super Duper while doing so) before they go inert.  You can wander around gathering every little flower and take very little rad damage.
---
If you need to fight, you can pop the power armor out of your inventory, engage and step back out into your hazmat suit for quiet foraging.
---
I've accidentally popped out of my armor in a blast when I'm spamming the E key looting all from meat piles and someone walks in front of me to block the loot, stood in the rad storm with only a dirty suit and nearly died trying to get back into my suit with 3-4 other players jammed up together blocking my way.
---
(psa: fully looting the meat piles so they disappear seems to de-strain the server and you can loot those endlessly looping bodies much faster.  Don't be a slob and take a couple minutes to clear your inventory later.  Everyone will appreciate it.)
---
You just really like encountering people who died while pooping... ya nasty
---
Not sure either...I might have had it before but can make it now for sure.  Was hoping they did more than that.  Kind of a time suck to get them if that's all they do, won't be doing that event again.  Live and learn 👍🏼
---
Holy crap, really? I've never noticed that. Level 250. TIL 
---
Thanks!
---
So how does that work with explosives? When ge shoots a player it's a normal shot instead of explosives?
---
Man, I don’t understand how you die so easy. My low health sniper who sits between 10-20% health, and has *maybe* 300 armor (I think it’s more like 240) can still take a hit or two from most enemies without dying. I mean, not a Yao Guai, but still. 
---
Then again I’m always in a team with someone with Empath, but that’s only a 25% difference. 
---
I’ve even only got 1 endurance! I do run 1star of Blocker with my 1str but that was a recent change 
---
Oh I’m with you. I’ve had a setup where someone left one there, or another player I was working with built one. 
---
It isn’t even really about the method of powering up so much as that it gets taken from me the second I claim it. 
---
I eat cans of dog food, but never dogs themselves. Does that make me weird?
---
My camp is underground so no one but me gets in anyway!
---
I just helped kill a scorch beast queen and got nothing for it besides about 6 rounds of ammo on it body. I got to the fight when it was down to about 75 percent health so I am assuming thats why.
---
Someday... someday I will be funny. 
---
It gave me an assault rifle and a little 5.56 ammo last time it found me. 
---
Why the downvotes? lol
---
Nope maticulous
---
No
---
Crits always hit, I never have a problem in pve.
---
That all made perfect sense, thank you. 
---
Dropping Rejuvenated for the extra point in Lone Wanderer makes good sense- as they probably even out.
---
Sneak does feel broken at the moment - I haven't noticed a difference between it being on or off.
---
For food I only tend to carry dog food and purified water... buuuut usually carry over 120 of each at any one time.. I probably shouldn't do that xD 
---
Honestly haven't even tried server hopping in a while.  Just kind of got sick of it. 
---
Maybe its different on console, but GunFu generally will not instantly pivot more than 90% unless something is within Melee range. There is still does strange stuff, but z/c or some other button combination will switch targets, but most of the time its hilarious what it will allow you to do for a split second if you have a banked Crit.
---
Auto receivers require commando. you don't really need the base weapon perks, because concentrated fire 3,  gunfu 3, and level 2 adrenaline add as much damage after powering up as 14 perk cards.
---
You could take some rad x and take a break to eat some rad away. Hell take Nuka Nut and leave Nuka Grape on your hot bar. Health back and rads gone on both
---
Heck okay, Ill give it another try &lt;3 thank you
---
Oooooh yay! I used to show mine, not a pro just for fun, and they were wonderful to travel with. Always so sweet and dignified. And of course, traffic stoppingly gorgeous!
---
That's a good suggestion too, thank you.
---
The game is full of douche bags. I did the feed the people event (started when I got there for another task so I thought what the hell) and some level 117 douche with the marsupial mutation hopped his happy ass up on top of one of the out buildings, crouched down, and watched me do the whole thing like he was freakin batman or something. Then took off once I was done and he got his stew. 
---
This is entirely normal. You'll get a lung or brain and some bones or the like.   My normal play is hunting SB's in the bog and it's rare to get anything other than a sense of satisfaction and revenge from all the times they picked on you when you couldn't fight back.

---
I've got a few. Which ones are you looking for?
---
Its alot better now Ive only been disconnected one this week and I think it was because of my internet.
---
Not necessarily, the system in place might just be adding up to a "ammo obtained over a month" number, which is what would make most sense. The problem with such a system is that, say you have a 100K ammo on your main account and then decided to move that ammo back and forth 4 times for whatever reason (STASH budget being too low, really) then you would end up with a 400K ammo obtained count just from that.
---
I'm not saying this is definitely what happened and that the infamous 900 hours guy didn't cheat, but it could be a possibility. 
---
That's the only time I've ever gotten a significant amt
---
I mean... if it’s an explosive modifier yeah, but like mininuke would still explode

Maybe he doesn’t have the time to farm for the best stuff, or they don’t want to spend a while just grinding for something
---
The game shouldn’t require grinding for a balanced pvp system

I’d like to see arena battles, that’d be pretty cool, betting and all

I like that arena because one of the fights scheduled was some guy against a radroach, and the bets were all on the guy

It works

Don't forget to level houses at the charleston vendor bot spawn. Hate it when I go there to try and get the clothing bot and someone's house is ruining the spawn point.

Chameleon armor is better. The mutation is garbage. Not only because of what you said about dropping the cloak after firing each shot, but in my testing, enemies spot you a lot easier and you also stay in danger a lot longer after being spotted. It took me no time at all to switch back to chameleon armor and not look back. 
---
yes but the cargo bot is flying...

Sorry for the late reply. There’s three perks you’re missing that are absolutely needed when running no PA: Ironclad (Endurance) and Barbarian (Strength) and Evasive (Agility).
---
Those three give you resistances based on the perk rank, while not using power armor. Max those three.
---
Unsure on which mutations you’re running, as you’ve got starched genes, but there’s a couple mutations that improve your general resistances (Grounded should be one, can’t remember exactly about the others).
---
But yeah; lacking those perks is 90% the reason you’re taking that much damage. Run them and you’ll notice a huge difference.
---
Thanks for the response and the advice!
---
They keep getting better. Not to say they’re perfect yet though.
---
seems to work for events and monsters but not for things like cap stashes
---
Minibuses doesn't get a legendary modifier tho. It's already explosive so it doesn't apply here. I'm simply showing how the op's suggesting doesn't work.
---
Nope, they cannot be legendary. Yet.
---
How does that work? Aren’t the diluted ones half of the normal ones?
---
Like if they healed 100 the diluted would heal 50
---
Thanks
---
Where?
---
Thank you for the great suggestions :D I do tend to run PA most of the time because my carry weight is way more than I should actually be carrying (about 300-400) and I cant fast travel without it. Ill give those a shot :D
---
Thanks! yeah, was crazy to me that so many missiles couldn't even scratch a level 25 flying drone haha
---
Weightless armor not only weighs 90% less than normal but you can wear it and keep your mutation. Chameleon armor has weight , and if it breaks- no more mutation. The added bonus is that you don't have to waste any cards related to mutations. Is just another option to build a stealth character. Not everyone uses mutations. So they can still pretend there the predator without breaking their DNA. I use a chameleon set when making vendor rounds. Keeps me from getting ambushed while selling.
---
Get the last laugh perk in luck that drops a grenade when you die. Destroy a small thing in their base to get like a 5 cap bounty. They show up kill you then an orbital strike rolls out of your pocket annihilating their base and leaving you with no bounty.
---
Can I know them?
---
For a friend of course.
---
You and I both know pain train and power armor are weak in PvP. Ive never fought a PA user I couldnt whoop.  3 star Legendaries all the way.
---
As for the downvotes.. The sub hates raiders plain and simple. 
---
I have a .50 Cal that id sell for 3.5k
---
Hmm. Only way around that would be switching over to a strength based build as it gives you like 10 carry weight/str level.
---
Other than that, pocketed mod for armor would be your best friend.
---
Eh.. the suit looks dope with armor over it.
---
Reminds me of that one old game that tested you by asking a question that was a reference to some old thing
---
Ruined by the internet now though
---
I'm on PC. BUT, I'm going to change icons again, maybe I'm wrong about having done it since that patch. I'm willing to admit I might just be messing up my own stuff lol. 
---
True but that's missing the point.  They *behave very differently.*  I understand all you've said, but nowhere have I been able to find confirmation that the behavior of chameleon mutation coming out of cloak every time you fire is a&gt; normal and b&gt; intentional!
---
I loved that part of the raider quests
---
*casually walks up to a deathclaw* wassup my dude
---
Now I need to get a toilet plan so I can do this as well. 
---
Sure , and for everyone that spend a lot of time farming that stuff it’s the best solution . You guys are asking to do the same then epic did with paragon : they changed a lot of the game core mechanics , the map size and the card system , trying to help the “new playerbase,” , that are struggling against the Og ones because they simply Doesnt wanted to spend their time actually playing that game and learning to get better (it’s easier to start making shit posts on the forums crying for nerfs and / or changes ). The result : the old players in the vast majority didn’t liked the changes , and started leaving . The game closed server on April last year .
---
I don’t know what a cricket is?
---
Ok it's not just me!  That's a start.  It still feels #bethesda to me (i.e. possibly not intended behavior) But for now, definitely back to armor for me and $3500 caps wasted!  Thanks for the confirmation that it's normal anyway.
---
What?
---
I completely agree. I'm at 224 hours, level 101 and I've met so many awful people. I one time just finished building my new camp and three people come up to it and shoot EVERYTHING. They're wanted for 700 caps between all three of them, and I can't do a thing even in my power armor and pretty good guns. I've also put so much into workshops and people just come and one shot me, claiming all I worked on. I get workshops are pvp hot spots, but if someone claimed one, I just server hop until I can claim the one I want.
---
Just earlier I was at the munition factory because I wanted some 5.56 ammo, and these two kids level 36 and 77 were hitting me with melee and guns and I die in one shot... It makes me not even want to play the game. I don't like pvp, I much prefer fallout 4 just because there's no assholes.
---
If you ever want a teammate and you're on ps4, I'll gladly explore with you! Every day, hopefully there's less and less shitty people. 
---
Congratulations! Full dink status. Here's a pin. Wear it proudly. Mayor of Dinkville.

Do you have blocker? Speed demon?  Why are you within Melee range with a long range character? Just because you have face tanker gear doesn't mean you can face tank if your not specced. Why is a stealth character using vangaurd? You should be in weightless or chameleon or something else. I'm not into stealth builds but i have seen people with stealth sniper builds looking like badasses at SBQ wearing only hazmat suits. Right in the thick of it with enemies running right past them as they pop skulls. Maybe trade some strength for more Agi related stealth perks. You can go end game with 4 STR no power armor and zero damage resistance related perks. You just have to kill stuff before it kills you. 
---
Yea as far as I know
---
Yeah, really hope they either nerf mutations or legendary effects. It will be unbalanced otherwise.
---
Lmfao. Pot. Meet kettle. Some people have jobs and lives man and don't have "a lot of time" to peruse Reddit and grind whitesprings nukes or west tek for all this god roll shit. Your comment is brimming with arrogant entitlement. 
---
Some people have jobs and families bro. Not all of us are sitting in our moms basement perusing fallout markets while grinding for legendary gear. Get over yourself kid. 
---
That say stupid things when we pickup stuff? I used it when meating the other synth one time...
---
Your very wrong. Pvp is the end game my dude.
---
Do you have experience with end game PvP? 
---
Are you 5/5 3 star equipped for PvP? 
---
Have you even gotten to the point where you can make the statement you just made?
---
"Nothing about pvp is balanced. Nothing about it is skill based. It's just what you bought on Reddit or eBay."
---
I doubt it. 
---
I am and pvp had a really good balance right now. Theres a counter to everything. 
---
*them
---
And I didn’t mind it that much
---
If you're looking to sell, yes. If you want a complete collection with fewer "dead" drops, then it's handier to not have repeats.
---
This sounds fucking epic
---
Yeah i still have my BoS weightless combat set saved so once they fix all the sneak problems in general, Im going to try it again. I did like having a full, strong armor set on that only weighed under 1lbs with ultra-light mod.  At least the chameleon mutation con isnt really bad for anything else and can be a use it or not use it thing. 
---
I'm going to add Blocker thanks to some suggestions below.
---
I do have Speed Demon.
---
90% of the time I am at long range, but when I get swarmed (which is admittedly rare, say at Whitesprings) I get smushed.  
---
I have seen people in no armor in SBQ fights wondering what on earth they were running to do that - I assumed bloodied/unyielding.   
---
Just use optimized bracers for the power attack. It's the only one I would consider.
---
I put up a scarecrow and stared at it all day, I do not feel like anything was lured, I saw a single angler and a ghoul that I did not expect as spawns for my location, but I don’t usually spend that much time in-CAMP. 
---
I did have a lovely time in CAMP though, I bought a cow, added a small addition to the shack, dragged one of those whitesprings chairs all the way back(figuratively) to really  class up the joint.  
---
Are you using ALL stuff you got as drops? Or have you bought and player traded until you were just op as fook?? Bc most of the playerbase doesn't give a shit about pvp and doesn't carry a gamma gun to counter a bloody build or know how to stagger a sentinel build. My guess is your trash at actual pvp games and you like fallout pvp because you can be op and wreck shit. Just go play on your special little servers when they get here and have all the fun you want man. You won't change my opinion of FALLOUT 76 PVP IS TRASH. 
---
Ya I mean everything is weak compared to sentinal or cavalier. I'm just naming some ways to staggers them, they aren't invincible. But ya youre right you'll probably be one shot if you start sprinting at the guy, but if they are bloodied melee and miss an attack on you or are to slow you can def stagger and maybe just kill them if they are low enough health
---
I carry one gun for that purpose.  But 99% of the time, melee works well.
---
The game allows you to start almost any quest if you go to it
---
Because the old fallouts didnt suck 
---
With chemist it turns 1 stimpack into 4 diluted. So twice the total healing.
---
r/nuclearrevenge
---
Get it?
---
Re: your PSA, I have to say I noticed this too. I usually wait for all my kills to turn to meat and then loot every single thing off of them. They disappear, the game is smooth and I just proceed to dump 100lbs of ionized meat and nuclear waste into a single container over and over. Helps massively to make sure I have also looted everything as well. Glowing blood sells for a pretty penny at the vendor and weighs almost nothing with travelling pharmacy. I always end up with tons of it after a nukesprings run.
---
Damn that's perfectly evil I'm definitely going this 
---
I haven't found a fix. But it's only been since last patch for me 
---
None dropped in the war. They dropped a bunch in the mines because nukes made magic green glass
---
Just kill prize bot, its smoldering corpse is satisfying to behold
---
Maybe Bethesda could sell us in the Atomic Shop a doghouse that can be placed in your C.A.M.P. And it would spawn a specific kind of dog you can take around as a companion... Beth, time to make some money!:)
---
I haven’t accidentally sold stuff to vendors, but I have discovered spam-dropping stuff will sometimes drop things it shouldn’t. I can switch to the Apparel tab, spam drop a bunch of armor, go back and check the bag, and it’ll have a grenade and a pistol in it too. Totally different category that wasn’t even visible when I was dropping stuff. Somethings funky with the inventory management. 
---
Anything that shoots a bullet 
---
Geez some of those are great I'm gonna have to do a deep dive into that sub later thanks. 
---
I'm honored that you think I qualify
---
God I moved just south of the water park from north of new gad(I think that’s the name)
---
NO MORE SUPER MUTANTS SNIPING ME
---
now just anglers and one time a semi close mirelurk queen
---
That's why all of this is so undeniably insane to me. I never did anything wrong but play the game and decide to stockpile ammo. My drop trading reasoning is the only thing that makes a tiny bit of sense to me. 
---
Everything I've stated is truthful and I want this to still be an issue until it is resolved. The only other thing I can think they don't like is using a secondary account purely for storage, but how many end game players don't have some form of secondary characters for storage. Me owning 2 accounts cuts out the need of a middle man to transfer items to a storage character.
---
It frustrates me endlessly that I am still being punished without any word on the actual reason. It can't possibly be ammo right? It's not nukas, its not crazy amounts of rare scrap, its not crazy good gear, its fucking AMMO. Even if I did have the ammo amounts that they state, why is that a problem? It's ammo in a game where the economy is already handicapped by months upon months of cheaters and AMMO of all things isn't the problem. Releasing a game too early, giving unethical players extremely easy ways to cheat is a problem.
---
Players are refusing to trade with people they don't know because there is almost no value in any items except similar strength legendary items. If you want an Ass/Cav item, you better have a BE gun to trade. Caps usually won't get you anything close to the best items possible. The game's economy is in the toilet because of duping. Fucking check eBay from time to time, shits being sold for real money. There are so many larger issues than players with a lot of ammo. 
---
The thing as well which doesn't make sense to me is I'm almost entirely a solo player. I think I've bought/sold with other players maybe 10 different times in total. And I think I've only sold ammo once. I'm hoarding it for once player vending comes in. I was planning on being an ammo/explosives vendor. 
---
Kind of ranty but fuck man, I'm extremely annoyed and frustrated by this entire situation. It's a waste of Bethesda's time and they literally lost money because I wasn't playing. I would've easily bought $60-100 of atoms during the time I've been banned. I fucking loved Fallout 76 and wanted it only to succeed. Now though, eh.
---
One of the best trick i learn from reddit ; after building your house, you can pick up the camp device and move it anywhere. Go into edit mode, if you can move furniture around, you're in the right mode and you can do the same with the camp device.
---
I see so many people leaving outside...
---
That’s not correct. The mag with superior  penetration in the description has the best penetration. I believe it’s called perforating. 
---
Please just do it the "hard way" with in the world containers. No point in continuing to ask them to finish the container system or improve it. Let's just be happy with what we have before it gets broken also please. 
---
Perfectly balanced as all things should be
---
I have a 72 hour work week and family.  If you think this game is hard in any way, getting dressed in the morning must be hard for you. 1600 caps for 10 minutes of play time is hard for you?  That's the bare minimum, it's a video game its literally set up for you to win. I am a casual player and it's a walk through.
---
Reiterating what the other users said.. what you're experiencing shouldn't happen in the sense that all your armor perks should go away when you step into PA. I've sadly never had any of mine bug out and stay on while in PA :( I stopped modding my main armor sets with pockets because I was always misleading myself. Ultralight for me now, especially to help save on weight in PA or when storing in my stash. 
---
They’re... nasty. Short, very tanky, almost always in a group, and I think they either just hit hard, or have some armor piercing. Their legs are their weak spots. 
---
The game's stability and performance is a TON better now. But being released as it was pretty much handicapped any chance for long term large success. If they did an entire gear wipe and re-released the game right now, it would be so much better for everybody. Time gated content is now being released and seemingly all the cheat/hack methods are gone.
---
The issue becomes everyone has insane amounts of gear/supplies from the duping epidemic. Re-release the game where rare items are actually rare and the long term health has potential.
---
I did know this, but there's no way the Ultracite did that much damage, right? Right!?!
---
My brother runs an unarmed build he has about 300 of each resistance without power armor. He matches my defense when I'm in excavator armor. The drawback is he devotes about 15 slots to durability while I devote 3. 
---
Maybe if youre lucky. PvP in PA is not advised! PvP at your own risk!
---
Ok you caught me off guard with that. I award you +1 Internets for the laugh. 😆
---
I'm not sure what disturbs me more, what it is that you are justifying, or the idea that multiple people would even want to be your friend.  Birds of a feather I guess. 
---
Very few know this, because even those who have the strategy guide miss it, but those numbers do mean something.
---
They are the speed at which water and food is produced by machines you put down, to put it simply.  
---
Not that a single purifier will produce more per hour, but every area has a limit to how many water can be produced in a cycle (I think it's like 5 or 10 minutes per cycle).  So at berkley springs you can put down 10 purifiers and get a water from each of them every cycle. 
---
Similar concept with crops.
---
Now you know something that less than 0.01% of FO76 players know.
---
I have a lvl 5 legendary laser pistol if that's of help, found it today, I'll be on tomorrow
---
I think the pvp is trash. The game is easy. Dunno where caps come into this? The player trade market have caps where they are almost useless. So dunno where you're going with that. 
---
You have the best weapons and armor in the game. Sounds like a casual player man. 
---
Your opening statement, "i have never duped anything" you may not have personally but it didn't stop you from supporting the people that duped all the weapons and armor for your god build eh? 
---
Personally, I think you're full of shit in more ways than one. So I'll just leave it that. 😘
---
I really hate that a lot of people panned it because it wasn't like the book. The first 3/4s is amazing, one of the best zombie movies ever. The last bit is okay, but doesn't really drop its score too much for me. It's the same with Starship Troopers. Really good sci-fi on the surface, really funny satire bubbling beneath. But people have it shit because it wasn't like the book it was based on. 
---
 I'm high level and I try to trade with low level to try and get technical data. It's not a quest item for me and basically I can sell xp

I've heard that if you pacify them then log off they should always be chill.

Don’t you have to be teamed up?
---
Cheeky bastard, pissing off on the job. Last time I'll spend my caps there, I tell ya whut.
---
New DLC new bugs
---
Yeah I would agree with this. Use the AA for heavily armored mobs like Super Mutants, Robots, Mole Men, Mirelurks, etc. And then the TS for everything else like Scorched and Ghouls, etc.
---
Ya def not haha, idk what you would really have a chance with if you don't have sent/assassins 
---
Yeah, but it's still fun to do. Fast travel to teammates camp, crouch and build. Fast travel back.
---
I can do 100 per ,on now. Usually on evening and late night.
---
One thing Ive wondered.. Does Concentrated Fire Level 3 still work with non automatic weapons?   
---
I figured it means increased damage per shot on the same target in the same location (eg head).   
---
That's normalish. The enemy pool can spawn robots there instead. Also, it seems like if you're the first one at the club for quite some time, the spawns are low-level, presumably so anyone can get the golfer ghouls.
---
it does not work for instanced loot (containers, safes, cap stashes, vendors, etc, those all have a cool down timer 20-24 hours it seems)  
---
For world spawns and "put" objects (stuff laying around) it does reload with the caveat someone else has to have been in the area before you spawn in. I still farm the top of the world for plans / treetops for lead / camp venture for misc.  
---
You can also still server hop random encounters like the one by overseers cache (confederate uniforms) and by crevesse dam (halloween costume)
---
I'm hoping these changes also come and maybe they just weren't announced in Inside the Vault but might be in the patch notes. We won't know till Tuesday though.
---
U mad bro?
---
Whats an actual PvP game?
---
I dont have to apologize for being pvp focused since day 1. Im just giving advice in this thread. 
---
Balance betweeen pvp focused people is pretty good right now. Shame you have no  experience to back up your "unbalanced" claims.
---
Nice, I like it. I've tried to get a few action shots but they never work out
---
Maybe I'm lucky on Xbox, but I've never run into assholes of this magnitude. The only time I've been attacked was in the beta and when I used the "start building at a workbench" bug to break into someone's house. I've had to beg people to kill me to erase a 10 cap bounty a couple of times.  Sorry you're having a hard time with it though. 
---
Hell yeah, gonna make the strongest brew this side of the Bog has seen yee yee
---
[PC] Me too. It seems like fully half of people don't have their mic turned up
---
You have plans for 10 Caps each?
---
Blocker and lone wanderer will do wonders. I use those with dmg reduction gear (from ghouls) and farm whitespring at lvl33 and I can take quite a few hits. Rads mess me up far more than physical dmg.
---
There's a woman in a portalet wearing a dress, legs spread wide, holding a corn cob.
---
Fast as hell too 
---
Yeah I’m on Xbox, still looking
---
Oh yes, I've already made a room for the brewing station and fermenter in my C.A.M.P., thinking about opening a nice cozy bar somewhere along the road. Can't wait.
---
Would you mind crafting me a few? Since they gave the ok for it to stay in game ive wanted one but never came across one. 
---
Pretty sure Brotherhood of Steel on Ps2 would have been the last Fallout if Beth hadn't bought the rights, so really, they saved Fallout by practically any metric
---
Shame you're still trying to convince me it isn't trash. Different strokes for different folks my guy. To each his own. If you enjoy trashy pvp, I won't stop ya. If you think I'm foolish for thinking a game with a mechanic like vats is trash for pvp, I don't really care. Ima sleep just fine. And wake up to a rainy Monday and go make some money. 
---
Actual pvp game? Are you new to gaming? There's so many games on the market right now that are ACTUALLY PVP based and focused. 👋
---
Soooo can you ask someone what's happening in this picture. https://imgur.com/kCi3Sfu.jpg
---
You'll get access to certain parts of Whitesprings as you advance the story. Other spots or for dlc I guess. Just play with your cards, you'll understand with time. Loot Whitesprings all you want!!
---
1. Most of the hand scanners do nothing besides beep. 1 does open a secret passage, though you'll need to join the enclave to use it. 3rd floor, end of a hallway. Middle of the wall with no visible door.
---
2. What have you forgotten about perk cards? Just read them. Take what suits your play style. Dont level up 1 card if theres 3 of the same. Slugger for example. Take slugger 1-3 for 30% bonus then work from there. Leveling 1 slugger to 2 and taking a second will only give you 25%.
---
3. Turrets are a huge cost in camp budgets. Build somewhere calm and use less. You don't need 10 of them. I have 3 at my house and I'm near Alpha Silo. This week the budget will be modified in the update. Everyone has the same budget. I have a 3 story house with a balcony to watch Alpha missiles leave the silo. Its beautiful. All the work benches, doubles of some actually. 4 small water purifiers. Decorated house. Less turrets means more budget.
---
4. Loot away. As long as you don't harm the robots you should be good. If you do, you'll be loading soon. Put on Can Do 3 and loot all the trash cans (press Y for extra search on xbox) and load up on food. Tons of materials there, but not all useful.

'Now lets see whats behind door number 1!' (or 2 or 3 depending on which stall it is of course). \^\_\^ 
---
Yes. Loaded into Whitesprings just to see my character fall over from rads just yesterday.
---
Also; it's not only when you first load your game: I ran from The Top of the World to The Whitesprings just tonight and found myself damaged and irradiated by invisible ghouls upon arrival.
---
This is correct
---
It's a robot, it's a thing, it's a "that". Lol.
---
Yes, super stimpacks use Stamen, not seeds. You get seeds for doing Event: Death Blossoms. You get Stamen if you are on the same server and someone else does the event. Weird, and broken like Event: Feed the People used to be. Corpse Flower Seeds are worthless.
---
I was called the n word multiple times today. Im not even black. People are nuts.

\*lol\* I was waiting for someone to say this.. 
---
Haha, well then I guess everyone else... You're welcome.

Thank you, Ive adjusted my build to up those two.. took a bit of a hit to my carry weight and storage but I guess I need to cull a few things to even out. No more carrying 300 stimpacks right? \*lol\* 
---
There ain't no way in hell I'm reading this entire post, but good for you.
---
I'm a bit of a noob so sorry if  I'm being dumb about this, but does the damage fluctuate with your health? Only asking cause I see you have adrenal reaction mutation... 
---
None to my knowledge
---
Rant much? but you kind of do have a point. But then again If I was a workshop owner I would have become one due to me taking it from someone else. The cost of resources to build a good work shop never pays for it self in the end. For the time it takes to get the resources I can get 10x if not more in that same time frame.
---
Yeh does suck loved my super fast stab weapon of doom 😟
---
They are only up while Event: Heart of the Swamp is up. You don't need to join the event. Just trigger the Dyer Chemical zone while the event is up and they should appear. About six of them. You can get 12 with Green Thumb.
---
lol it is funny.
---
Trying to farm mods for the submachine gun. I know two spawn locations but server hopping doesn't work. Usually 24hrs works for both.

Huh I bought mine cheaper from modus

Id prolly use my atoms for that lmao

Channel5 Gaming is good as well 
---
You can make sure your opponent cant Vats you with the right consumable. Again, you have no experience in what your commenting on... 
---
As for the last part you can't make it so someone who is lvl 20 make a camp that is a flat out trap you can't get out of [everything else is perfect]
---
This, pretty much. If you want a 4-story staircase you stack the beams up 4 high, then snap the stairs to the top one, then remove the beam you just snapped stairs to. Repeat the process until you're back at ground level. Be aware that as soon as you snap a floor piece to any of these stairs the floor an the stair become unremovable (unless you build regular stairs up to them and start from scratch), so don't mess up your floor placement!
---
I wonder if Oxhorn will go on live stream of FO76 again. Hopefully he'll find a X-01 jet pack for his character.
---
Yea usually 65+ if not 150+. I’ve had plenty of good experiences with high level players, but just as many bad ya know. And ps4
---
Nice. That's where I'm headed next then. 
---
Unfortunately no. It should though!
---
I usually have rad sponge 2 shared in our group. Just my designated job. Combine that with Healing Factor and that means I'm almost always full health and rad free. Tons of cure disease too so thats usually not a problem either.
---
Problem persists whether I'm diseased or not. In power armor or not. Alone or in group.
---
I should be ridiculously strong in a group, but the numbers dont show that way. With my armor mods, mutations and someone adding Strange in Numbers or something else.... no difference. Sometimes 360, sometimes 220. No reason....
---
Hey that sounds awesome. I’ve had similar experiences. I am fine with pvp being in the game, buys it’s a fallout game, and I think Bethesda owed it to their fans to give some form of passive mode or private match. Maybe we’ll get that in the future to avoid these problems. 
---
Yeah
---
The post was clever, funny and full of truth, a bitter pill for many players to swallow.  It’s worth the full read!
---
Just camp over an ACiD extractor for a while and stock up. 
---
and this is the problem i have with the clunky communication system of this game. Hate using mics and emotes are archaic. A simple player to player text system could have prevented this.
---
To be honest I was just frustrated due to recent events. I got the game, played for a week, stopped for a month or two, and now I’m about 2 weeks back in. The first week back was fine and I didn’t have a big problem. It’s only when I got past level 20-23 that people started giving me a problem. Maybe it’s just that sweet spot when I’m just weak enough to easily take down but have just enough stuff to make it worth while. Who knows. 
---
Yesss. I'm okay with it being a thing, I just wish people wouldn't abuse it and be assholes for no reason. I love Bethesda though and I'm glad to see what they'll be adding in the future to protect people hahah. Hopefully we get some good updates soon!!!
---
No bro. You aren't getting it. Vats shouldn't exist in a pvp environment. I shouldn't have to take a consumable. You should have to actually aim your fucking gun. Again. Showing you suck in actual pvp games. Now. I'm done arguing with a brick a wall. You're going to have live with the fact that a huge portion of the playerbase thinks pvp is trash and really doesn't want anything to do with it. 
---
For every good story there are bad ones as well.
---
The ganksters that got our level 15 group of friends were a level 150+ group with all the good gear that can be bought off ebay. They were following us around and even waited to our health was down while killing mobs. We thought they were going to help us. Wrong, they slapped us to death while we were still fighting the mobs. They even took out junk which was more of insult to us than a reward to them.
---
Bring on the PVP mode worlds so the bored PVPers can go there.
---
Chameleon mutation works while standing up. Chameleon legendary effect works on while crouched.
---
I could not agree more. That would've stopped this misunderstanding before it started. Plus it would've been nice for trying to find additional players to help with the nuke drop. 
---
 - Kill players. Bait players into PvP...
---
Average loot:
---
5k caps + 2000 lbs of junk every 3 hours. 
---
Im on the cap limit for multiple toons.
---
 - Pick flowers in nuke zones with green thumb. Easy to get enough flux to wipe out all vendor caps quickly. 
---
Other things that come to mind:
---
The mutation activates when standing or crouching when your weapon is out.
---
The armor only activates when crouching and makes an audible noise.
---
I am not the least excited. To be fair I started a week ago and I'm currently around lvl 30 so I have not yet run out of things to to do. But after Fallout 4's, in my opinion, very lackluster DLC I couldn't care less. This game has way more important issues they should fix first before the opening the floodgates for new bugs and issues with new content.
---
Yes it does, I just wanted to see if I ignored every other quest what level would I be after dropping a Nuke.
---
I love reading these tricks and tips for getting around the limitations. Very nice. 
---
It's easier to farm materials than claim and defend a workshop, which probably explains why they are mostly unclaimed in the servers I play on. Additionally, the built in PvP mechanic certainly isn't a draw for me and in fact makes claiming workshops even less appealing. 
---
I wish that when the PvP "Survival" mode comes out, the "Adventure" mode was entirely PvP, including workshops. They would still mostly suck, but they would suck less than they do now with the PvP enabled.
---
Yes you do realize I was being sarcastic. No there’s NO system to prevent it. A few so-called measures can be easily bypassed if the player has 70 IQ. Instead of protecting new players by giving them real protection, Bethesda allows them to be killed and a few hard-earned caps robbed. The aggressors face zero penalty when they have zero caps in their account, wasting bounty-hunters’ time and energy. The system was designed to benefit in-game criminals that’s all.
---
As long as the recipes don't cost 4k each. Lol
---
They really just need to reword it. When players see "people may initiate PVP", it's really easy to take it as "Okay, they may try to attack me but since I'm in pacifist, as long as I don't attack back, I'm fine." When the game first released, this is what I thought. And I'm positive a lot of people aren't aware of this (lots of threads ranting about being one-shot is due to this). The game explains the pacifist part pretty well when it's introduced, but not really workshop claiming. It really needs to just say, "Claiming a workshop will put you into PvP mode, allowing others to attack without mutual consent." Then give an option to turn pacifist off if they wish to fight back. That's a lot more direct than the ambiguous "others may initiate PvP." 
---
I forgot what was in the mine
---
They’re full of crap.
---
The Apocalypse skins apply to the same power armor frames as existing skins. And each of the four aren’t that great, IMO. Just weird.
---
We need base color skins, Bethesda. Stop fucking around and just give us some fundamentals to work with.
---
I don't use anything that is organic. I love my pesticide filled genetically altered items. 
---
Besides, anything that is made up of carbon is organic. 
---
I did the same with a glitched gulper hanging from a tree, I stood under him as if he was gonna eat me was pretty neat
---
Need a good chunk of caps to be a bar owner, eh?
---
I'm on xbox and see people actif weirdly bad all the time. In fact, when i was writing a tip in another thread not long ago, suddently i hear gunfire at me. I put down the tablet, pickup the controller just to discover a level 10 firing at my level 37 immobile character.
---
Guess what, the guy had his camp at about 200 meter from where i was. I was on my way to the north of the map from vault 76 (i still don't fast travel much). I went by his camp, looked at it a bit then went on my way. But i had an idea for a discussion on this sub...
---
So when the guy started shooting at me doing almost no damage, i turned around and  stood there a bit. I used the salute emote over and over. I ran way to the north, he followed me. I ran the other way, all the way to his camp and around. He just kept firing at me. I ran north again and then crouch behind a tree. I see him pass by. I follow. When he notice, he still fire at me.
---
At some point he was running backward and i think he fell down a cliff and died. I decided to fast travel to vault 76. He respaned there before i arrived still wanting a fight. I fled in the direction where there are thoses litttle commies robots. Thankfully he stopped following.
---
Thinking back at this. I wish i would have used the perk card card that make you drop a grenade when you die and would have went inside his house and let him kill me.
---
Solo-non-PA players need more rad resistance options. Shared level 3 Rad Sponge is incredibly powerful for groups.   
---
As for forcing things into perks, I'd be less opposed since stomping into rad-zones doesn't tie up your perk cards that often. Even with PA we swap perk cards between dropping a nuke and going into the rad zone, so it's a fine time to swap cards. Of course, that could be less-true if they add more nuke-zone content (e.g. Nuclear Winter?)

Got my mothman bar about to open this week!
---
Good point!
---
Too bad there is not some sort of self flagging system, so if you are there to trade, they can see you are trading with an icon or something. Once you flag yourself, you cannot PVP for a set amount of time after you un-flag yourself, unless attacked.
---
😭😭😭 I shouldn't have to take a consumable😭😭😭
---
Lol 
---
Theyll probably be coming in at some point. They already have spider assets from skyrim. Quick reskin and you got rad spiders. 
---
Wow should have tamed that !
---
Hopefully Tuesday will bring some more budge for everyone with Patch 7
---
This isn't trying to be nitpicky,  but remember shadowed helps you hide in dark areas.  It is not a flat buff to sneak. 
---
Please, read my comment to that other guy. Thanks.
---
Very cute I bet he loves climbing trees
---
Never anything in them, but I still do...
---
Zombiland. 
---
They shouldn't have taken part it the glitches I don't feel bad if it was single player I would say go for it but sense this affects everyone that buys the game. I say ban them for ever 
---
I like building giant fortresses with comfy, cozy, secure living quarters and high technology woven throughout the base.
---
Dead Brahmin my bad. Needed food,
---
You didn't invent Radspiders. They've existed in mods for ages.
---
Hopefully they release home server code, and then we can play it solo/with friends. Sadly, the rumors I've heard is that it will be bethesda hosted paid servers, so... I dunno. 
---
You've played the game a week and you're already so cynical you're dumping on new content? It would be impressive if it were not so sad
---
upvote for visibility (pun intended) 
---
Can't wait to ferment a massive load of firecracker whiskey for that explosive round effect
---
u/srsly_dang 
---
Interesting 
---
It's almost impressive how ignorant this post is
---
Why did u buy the serum of the trade sub Reddit for 300 caps
---
Good thing no one gives a shit what you think
---
I say delete the inventory and reopen the accounts. really, people start buying the ATOM stuff and they will make cash money. without the items what are they going to hurt by letting them play again.. even in real life you get probation or parole. 2nd offense perma ban them.. 
---
In the last 12 hours I have not dc
---
I was chasing nuke zones for a while, but now I have a decontamination shower so I've lost interest. 
---
Now if plans for light and heavy(?) metal armors were a possibility...
---
So much better feels like night and day
---
Not really. Oh look, everyone now can make X. So much for having a reason to contact people and trade.
---
This person dupes report him
---
Last I knew they can only destroy the workbenches and containers. The structure itself didnt take damage. 
---
That sucks. That’s exactly what happened to me earlier today. I don’t know why Bethesda hasn’t done anything about that.
---
I took on three. 
---
Organs and some ammo. I took them out with weapons better than what I got. 
---
I don't play with mods so I didn't know.
---
Mine is closer to, "[There's also a lot of drugs in there!](https://youtu.be/p5y0l3kJADo)"
---
The message quest always give a 100 and are super easyalso have more that one max character
---
Look better than my last camp build :
---
https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/lechattricote/screenshot/11699089
---
I'll take more screenshot if someone ask for it.
---
Dude 72 hours is to much quit and find a new job family is more important that money
---
Currently, you have to move 1 point at a time. 
---
You get the option to move the point when you level up past level 50. 
---
To be fair you really have not seen the amount of issues FO 76 has fixed since release, So I feel compelled to dismiss your lust for more bug fixes as rubbish. This game has came a LONG way and ANY new content for us is a great thing.
---
Dromedary doesn't rank high in PvP builds. Probably ought to just stick to the bare necessities.
---
Hmm ok, well thanks for taking the time to reply and I'll be watching with interest to see if someone can answer this - assuming it's not just one of the games 'features' of course... 
---
So basically once per level? Is this something they might change with a caps amount or ???
---
I don't want to get downvoted, so I'm going to pretend I'm excited.
---
I see camps at the back door all the time with rocket launchers running. no one around. it's killing mobs alright and taking resources and XP from people that want it. but they did say in this patch they are changing the no camp zones.. Hopefully they wised up and are going to block most of WS&gt; 
---
I wish there was. They should make an item that resets ur special. Maybe bought with atoms to make it worth having to reset your special. But they are doing this legendary character patch thing down the road. Going to have to see how that turns out. 
---
Doesn’t sound like it. 
---
It would be nice to respec your specials all at once, but sadly I don’t see them doing that anytime soon. 
---
... And for those who have mutations but don't have starched genes yet, Nuka Grape won't remove your mutations! 
---
Yeah i know that, but it still helps sneak really well
---
is it a visual bug or are they squirming their way to you? I thought that was intended
---
There are two radioactive craters in the game. They are not marked locations. It is quite possible these are the impacts shown in the trailer. It is also possible that the trailer nukes are only in the trailer (just like the garage shown in the Fallout 4 trailers).
---
I won't say where they are. Have fun looking for them. One is fairly obvious, but the other not so much.
---
Its 3 24s and I get to sleep in between calls. I rather work 3 long ones and have 4 whole days with family, it's all about balance. Thanks for your concern, you're correct 72 at a 9 to 5 would be too mutch.
---
Well, that's what the text says. As Bethesda don't believe in testing, you can't even be sure that it's a buff, let alone that any conditions are functional.
---
Not sure how players could test this one. Does the stealth indicator work in PvP? Maybe use a previous death bag to determine distance.
---
Did he sound like Mick Taylor (John Jarratt) you know the protagonist from Wolf Creek!?
---
Oh I thought 9 to 5
---
I just wish I could pick up Fallout 3 again for the very first time, with no idea what to expect
---
Your comment just brought back memories of timidly searching through post apocalyptic wreckage, 76 and 4 are pretty but they just don't give me that mystique that fallout 3 did
---
My most frustrating thing about this game is killing 3* monsters and not getting 3* items. They should make it so that they are gurateteed to drop 3* stuff, even if they have to lower 3* monster repawn rate. 
---
thats just great man im happy for you
---
As a Puert Rican myself, I can tell you a lot of PR’s play 76, so they might not have been Mexicans. No way to know without hearing the accent though.
---
There's a spot right by the bus moving from the whitesprings golf course to the resort. I always crash when I walk right next to the bus, nuke or not.
---
Floors and stairs don't take damage. Most turret bases only have floors and stairs. 
---
I think we've already seen what the Excavator's alternate skin will be. If you go to Garrahan Mining HQ there's a lot of cardboard ads around the building that show the Excavator armor in a black motif.
---
The current skin kind of matches the prototype pattern of the X-01 armor, but there seems to be a finished darker version in their promotion.
---
I have 28 OSB's burning a hole in my pocket. I can't wait to do this 
---
Mr Messenger still gets stuck in certain places almost every time. Berkeley Springs especially. He’ll go on a roof and just stay there forever and interacting doesn’t do anything 
---
I like this build a lot, but I would hate to play it unless I'm constantly in pvp combat
---
So much bitter
---
This....all of it
---
I don't know about Ultracite but for the X-01 power armour mods can be found at the modus terminal in the command center of the whitespring bunker. Random mods the change if you server hop. 
---
Whenever I go to Whitesprings the lag is terrible. I figure that's why we don't have a player hub where we can all meet up. I once walked all the way through the shopping precinct before my character had properly spawned in. It's like horizontal bungee jumping.
---
You salty bitches.  The game is more than loot.  Read and enjoy the lore... or go find your next game.
---
If the wasteland was like Fallout 76 shows us, I think everyone would use screws as currency instead of caps.
---
Lol no actually had this item for months my only one and I sold it thankyou haha 😀 go annoy someone else
---
Sometimes retreat....better part of valor...
---
It's actually the right wall, at least in my experience. The left wall takes you through side passages and such but the right wall just loops around to the wendigo. I usually only see one of the mirelurk kings this way too and killing them takes a lot more ammo than the actual wendigo.
---
It'd make sense, given the scarcity of 'em
---
Its. Not your build.  It's your play style...
---
My head canon is that all of the player characters think that a screwdriver is only used to unlock locks, and we're all breaking things open wishing there was a special tool that would help us remove screws.
---
Aw, look at his bushy tail
---
3 times this week for me 😔
---
It’s 100% not worth it to build there. The scorchbeast attacks destroy so much of your camp that you come out at a net loss of resources. They seem to spawn every 30 minutes or so. 
---
Workshops and power plants are pointless right now because it's market-legendary-clad dudebro gankers magnet.
---
I'm convinced that there's this certain dev who will never admit that workshop PVP is a failed design, and we're stuck with it.
---
Atomic Shop is going to explode as soon as they release an Excavator paintjob that's dark and actually looks cool. 
---
You are over leveled and a cry baby
---
In your opinion its the most fun...well that's all that matters.
---
What an absolute entitled prick you are. 
---
The real world is going to eat you alive buttercup. Bully online, coward face to face.
---
That makes a terrifying amount of sense and explains why items that *should* have screws just... Don't
---
Why would that even matter if it is 3pm in game and 3pm for someone?  The idea here is that the accelerated time is unrealistic first of all, and 2nd, it would influence players to use cards / weapons more often that have bonuses for that time slot.  Your lack of imagination and critical thinking is *garbage* dude.
---
There is at least one stall,  in the Morgantown HS, that has chems and other items in the toilet reservoir...
---
That's just griefing at that point.
---
thank you man
---
Play other games
---
What do you think is wrong with it? I saw him show up today in a nuke zone. It was for a random farming ghouls with a bunch of other randoms, but he seem to engage the whole mob, not just a single ghoul...
---
You missed MxR mods and Juicehead.
---
Now Juicehead doesn't hate the game but he doesn't like it either, it's complicated.
---
Yes, yes he does.
---
Sounds fine to me.  I’ll be back on Monday after 5pm Arizona time.  I’ll PM my PSN name. 
---
Welcome to FO76
---
I really liked this perk, and I maxed it at one point, but I found that 90% of the time he just bugged out and stood there doing nothing. I would use it more often if it worked consistently.
---
Yo sorry I didn’t realize where you were coming from. I was just crazy frustrated earlier when I posted this because I had a decked out camp close by Poseidon which I had also claimed which both got destroyed and taken, the latter before I collected any fusion cores. 
---
Sorry man I was just frustrated and taking everything as an attack 
---
Afraid not, Xbox :(
---
My game got freaky by Poseidon and right before that train station / by that factor where all the communist bots are. CTD every single time until I got far enough away. 
---
he just stands there for me
---
Strange in numbers is currently glitching some players (myself included).  If you’re not running a low health character with adrenal reaction (where Damage is scaling with hunger) that’s probably the cause.
---
I used to equip it (first weeks after release of game) and I never saw a benefit from it. He never showed up. What are the probabilities involved though?
---
Thank you. That was excellent. 
---
Sounds like fun, I'd do that if I could test any of the amazing looking weapons higher level players have given me lol
---
Is our base fund limit going to increase?
---
Yeah all in it will cost...3 to 3.5k for all 5 level of under armor plans depending on your charisma and hard bargain perk levels.
---
PvP is encouraged when it has anything to do with workshops. That's it's function, it even warns you that claiming a workshop may initiate PvP. PvE players need to stop being so ignorant of this fact.
---
You have no reason to mess with the workshop mechanic if you do not want to risk PvP. Leave it alone. Resources are plentiful outside the workshops. 
---
I am a casual PvE player and explore everywhere solo. I have only engaged in PvP and lost mostly a handful of times, none of which wasn't my own fault - accidentally hitting a person without pacifist mode on is my fault. 
---
I have stacks of resources and power cores just from looting locations around the map. You can get cores from random generators, some places like in the mining areas down south even have 3 generators together (with a chance to give 3 cores). You can constantly find empty power armor chassis and they always have fusion cores to take. You can find sentry robots in certain areas that reward it as loot. You can use the scrounger perk and that will occassionally give fusion cores.
---
Alternatively, you could farm Harpers Ferry vendor. Believe that’s where I bought both of mine (just outright mods). He sold 2 of them one time and I couldn’t believe my luck. 
---
Hey!!! I just added you (I'm the Grace girl) I can't use my mic right now, but if y'all speak or anything I can hear you! 
---
I just tried to give a L6 player an instigating L1 pipe rifle, he shot at me &amp; then left, didn't even take the rifle.
---
I'm level 170, strange times indeed :)
---
Good points!  See it would totally be an advantage if it wasn't for the becoming visible when shooting thing.  And it's a mutation, I feel like it *should* be superior to the armor option.  
---
I think QWERTY is just more common and they didn’t think about the people with different keyboards. 
---
Didn't even think to look despite buying other stuff there! lol.  Ahh well it's only 3 days profit.
---
Killed two SBQ in 81 levels and got Handmade Prime and Lever Action Prime plans so my incentive is kind of gone. Thank you RNG gods.
---
Never actually killed a normal SB I just run.
---
Omg rofl. I had one enter a trade screen back out hit me say sorry then entered trade and did it again.
---
Some people are strange
---
Folks getting bored of the game maybe.
---
Below lvl50 its easier to use a weapon the drop it when it breaks then use a new one. Rank up perk cards that you absolutely need for your build. Try to stop scavenging or picking up random junk and only pickup junk that you need. Join events and enjoy the rewards; plans and armor are sweet.
---
Make a fight club then. Dont pick a fight then get annoyed. Hey isnt dlc supposed to be released this month?
---
I don't think the game should encourage people to use mules. Dump your stash and sell those legendary items for cheap. Chances are they are pretty useless. Clear out your junk and ammo. Keep what you realistically use and you won't have these problems
---
Yeah you're right. You either loose alot of dmg resis, or legendary effects by using armor/no Armor which is specified for using it. And its worse than the 1 legendary effect.
---
If it made you invisible all the time; running, shooting, etc. Then it would be worth it.
---
Or make the Train Stations like a mutual bank with the rest of your characters.
---
Me and a random lvl 6 watched a random lvl 9 unknowingly pick lock a supply drop and went ham on him when he got wanted. 
---
Survival mode and nuclear winter mode is coming but it's still weeks or months away. If you'd like to make a new character maximized for that it's right time to come back. I'm making a guerilla build to stick it to the murderhobo dudebros.
---
On the other hand, there are less ganking dudebros and chinese dupers. *Less,* not none though.
---
My CAMP has everything available for everyone. The first floor has cooking stations in a diner-like area, the second has four beds, a trombone and a piano so folks can get well rested and well tuned bonuses. There's a platform with all the crafting benches, a farm with the ingredients for Vegetable Starch, and a lot of seating so players can go AFK in a safe area
---
I have a tiny area for myself, and when I can, I'll lock the door. I love building large structures, but I prefer living in cozy quarters, so my private area is snug.
---
People can't grab my gear outta my stash, and if somebody's enough of a dick to destroy my CAMP, locks aren't gonna stop them. As far as I can see, there's not much point locking anything other than resource extractors up.
---
It matters because if it's "real time" then if you play in a given time zone, in a given time period, you will ALWAYS play in the same llight conditions. 
---
I don't know if you understand why that's horrible, but imagine ONLY playing this game in the dark. Because that's what this stupid fucking idea will do. 
---
No game I've ever heard of uses this system because it is, to ANY fucking rational sense, fucking insane. 
---
&gt; who knows where safety posters plan show up?
---
this problem is a decade old (all Fallout games, same crap) so I don't think so they are going to move a finger to solve it...
---
Its really not. Considering the game isnt even remotely balanced for PVP. Or set up for it. And it has the worst PVP system ever seen in a multiplayer game. The PVE is fine without the lag and shitty servers. 
---
Adapt master race. . .  lolz
---
Sp00py shit
---
Thank you, I thought I was going crazy for a minute. I can't play the game right now to check or test anything. 
---
I never had any problem with him. He's always doing his job.
---
The only bug is he appears sometimes with his hat missing. Spoiler alert: he's bald.
---
I think it is a mod for power armour
---
Take the money+scrap it+make civil war era hats=caps
---
Seems like it is giving us caps😀
---
I'm so down to test this out as well. It sounds hilariously awesome. 
---
I don't know, I got one shotted by a guy with a sniper earlier and a guy using a gamma gun to sky rocket my radiation. Legit just find ways to counter them, because nerfing things will just make the game less enjoyable on the PVE side lool.
---
I’m finally going to come back now that energy weapons are getting a buff. Becoming a moonshiner is just icing on the cake. 
---
I've heard about people using the grenade drop perk with orbital bombardment beacons. That sounds exciting. 
---
Its the internal database mod for the ultracite power armour helmet
---
Lol no, each power armour has their own mods. X01 you get from the enclave bunker. Excavator from various vendors, it will say black titanium under the mod materials. 
---
I still wonder why anyone ever believed the 900 hours guy. Like people somehow didn't think it was odd that a guy would make a post about his amount of time spent in game and his farming habits, 1 or 2 days before he got banned... I don't get it.
---
8am est time till 12pm I would assume
---
No spiders please, ticks and mosquitos already make me itchy enough :(
---
I'm sure that once Survival Mode is released a lot of these types of players will migrate. The risk/reward payout of spending the time murdering someone is a but low on PVE servers. 
---
First time I encountered one my life flashed before my eyes, Scorch Beast Queen whom?
---
As mentioned, you can check the mod materials for Excavator mods. It won’t say “Excavator” in the mod name. Instead, it will say just “Blood Cleanser”. 
---
I didn't think of that. 
---
Thanks.
---
Are they finally fixed? They didn’t actually do anything when I tested them a few patches back. No change in power attack cost.
---
I feel like I ran into you before.. lolll
---
Yup
---
I would love rad-centipedes. They would be creepy as hell
---
I do my fair share of pvp lol but you sure? I’m on Xbox 
---
Are you me? Fallout 4 memories... check. Scared of the damn grenades... check. Expecting loot? Check. Funny thing neither of those seem to happen in f76 but i still check em and I still jump back.
---
I'm looking forward to the player venders and legendary vendors. Curious of how much these backpacks can carry. More missions are always good too.
---
Yes, you can pick (or receive extra in perk packs) any perk, always. Sometimes in late game you might want to mix things up, like I run 3/5 gunsmith (after I’d already got 5/5 gunsmith)
---
If you can’t see perks- are you running tmods? Disabled them and test without. Also,  are you saving perk points? You have to spend points for “high level” cards to actually unlock, you can’t “save” them. Like if you are level 46 but have saved 4 points, you can’t pick a level 46 required card- it treats you as if you are 42 still
---
Lol no playstation :p
---
More like a:
---
Sounds like a cool console game to play after a busy day on the couch turned into it was cheap for PC and I hope it is playable there and it manages to run even worse on my streaming/gaming PC. 
---
The vendor at Camden park has all the excavator mods available. At least he did last night on ps4. Go look there.
---
I am from Poland and I always start building C.A.M.P from a place to drink alcohol.
---
False, the excavator mods are listed as excavator______ 
---
Check Camden Park.
---
Melee is the meta in PvP right now solely due to slap rules. Survival mode will effectively kill it, because all that STR bonus and one-shot melee weapons are no good when someone can open fire on you from afar.
---
Of course, sneak attacks and sucker punches will still work... So you should check the station restrooms before you trade with vendor robots.
---
https://nukacrypt.com/solved
---
False. Those are the plans. Actual mods do not say excavator. 
---
Those are plans
---
Same thing for me but I just like to break the petrified corpses 👀
---
False. Actually probably tru3, I just felt like saying False a third time.
---
Melee has nothing to do with pvp mechanics. Stop asking for shit that has nothing to do with the actual problem. 
---
Was it duped?
---

Lights and turrets are supposed to take up less budget, but no increase in the base amount.
---
It’s part of the game unfortunately. Some people are whack. People come by my camp all the time and start attacking me. I never engage 
---
Yeah I've never had this issue not even in beta. Most people I meet just wanna trade just recently ive seen less nukes dropping and more raider like players
---
It's a bit complicated but this was one of the best guides early on.

Sit at a desk and think about Fallout.

Relax tough guy 😂
---
Thank you for this information 
---
Just found one of these. Hit me up and it's yours. Same IGN.
---
I love the very detailed response and explaining it through examples and evidence. And yes I love that meat pile method it works great. I’ll set my Trapper Armor aside and hopefully some day it will work and maybe go off of straight radiation resistance stat. Through 180 levels I actually never even tried the radiation suit...sounds like with barbarian, scaly skin, and evasive I could get around artist and farm a lot of flux (not enough endurance for ironclad). Very pumped to give it a shot. Did not know about the diluted rad x tho! That is a completely game changer I’m happy you mentioned it. I’m huge on mutations and just thought rad x was completely pointless. 
---
Nice
---
They're really already pushing out DLC when the game is still fundamentally broken?  
---
It's fun when it isn't being a pile of shit, I'll give them that, but seriously.  
---
They really want to repeat the rushed mess fiasco, again? Really? Smh. 
---
I had a similar stalker experience a couple months ago. Guy was wearing a cultist mask and left some religious paper that I've forgotten the name of. He followed me for a while but eventually I was able to track his movements, we teamed up for a bit, then he wandered off. 
---
Totally! There’s a clock on the pipboy, why not the ones we craft?! 
---
I expect the patch to take longer to implement than usual. Gonna guess... 6 PM servers will come back up. Last patch was the longest it has been been, and that was like 4 hours, I think
---
Only by definition is it dlc. I don't know anyone who's actually excited for more holotapes
---
yes finally new stuff to do, with that said I need to rethink and re-do my camp, but I can wait to see whats instore for us. 
---
They've fixed a lot of stuff, but it still has a loooong way to go. New content is good for the game and what little player-retention it still has though.
---
It's *starts* this week but we're barely getting anything tomorrow.

Um. Im not venturing into the build, I just want to make sure you understand what you’re getting in to- flamer damage is... okay... and flamers are Energy so armor reduction effects don’t work for them (currently). Flamer ammo usage is high, and crafting ammo is about 10x as expensive as it should be. 
---
Right but it’s only a 20 rnd mag. Perforating is supposed to be 40% while stinging is 30%— according to what I have read. So most people thing stinging is a good balance
---
This \^ So let us melee players enjoy our pve :( Then you can start bullying them in survival once survival comes :)
---
That's some crazy disease ...
---
Trust me I’ve been playing for awhile, after you first loot a core from a location it’s really rare it spawns again. I’ve never gotten it to
---
The excavator and ultracite PA mods have incomplete unclear naming. If something just says Tesla Coils you need to check it and see if the mod is black titanium-for excavator 
---
Internet whining should be “nerfed.”
---
I've heard there's a Raider Suit that autoplays an audio message when you first climb in, but I've never been able to find it. Could you tell me where or at least give me some good clues? I've heard near the southernmost raider train station, in the mountains, but that didn't really narrow it down for me enough haha
---
Build houses.. And think about fallout.. 
---
Place yer camp somewhere else, ayy? Quicker to delete that shit when it's in the stored menu innit?
---
Seriously. It makes my game lag so much when the asam turret is trying to kill the scorched inside it. It's just an endless stream of explosions.
---
My camp is a three level affair.  Porch has storage, seating and a banjo leading to bottom floor.  Base level is an open garage with workbenches, storage a power armor station, and a lvl 3 locked door with my generator, c.a.m.p and private terminal.  Second level is some seating, a kitchen(stove/chem station) , beds and more storage.  Third level is secured by a powered door and leads to my private quarters with personal amenities and balcony access. 
---
Outside I've got my locked junk and lead extractors, which are my entire reason for my choice of location.
---
There are also 3 publicly accessible water purifiers, crops so people can make adhesive, my four arty cannons and a bounty of melons to feed the masses. 
---
Everyone is welcome, so long as you behave. 
---
If you're ever up in the hills north of graniger farm and south of the crashed space station, feel free to drop by for repairs and refreshments.  :D
---
I cook. 
---
I mean he isn't wrong.   
---
But this isn't a PvP game, and Bethesda isn't a PvP company. So it's shit regardless. It's just an aforementioned pile of shit slapped on top of another to try to appeal to a wider audience. 
---
Yeah, they did mention "a whole bunch of bug fixes". Anti-armor effects not working for energy weapons HAS to be a bug; I only hope it's one that's being addressed sooner rather than later. 
---
The Mutation is pretty bad as is since even 1 piece of Legendary armor with Chameleon is better without you needing to farm up an entire (decent) set of Weightless armor, which means you have to sacrifice better Legendary armor options.  On top of that, the Legendary effect doesn't reveal you while attacking and works better at hiding you from enemies.
---
The Mutation is 1 of 2 that desperately needs a buff to ever be worth using, with the other 1 being Plague Walker.  If Chameleon actually decreased detection while sneaking, while also allowing you to move a certain amount while sneaking or attack with silenced weapons without dropping the invisibility cloak, it be worth the effort to use.
---
I made a blueprint that included everything possible in the most compact space possible. A 4 story high 4x4 structure. 
---
Has water, vegetable starch, all work stations, a brahmin, generator, bed and storage.
---
I used the stairs stack exploit, and campfire exploit to do it. It has no walls, Doing all this conservation of space and objects allowed me to fit it all into one blueprint for easy setup.
---
You spin me right round baby right round like a record baby right round round round
---
You have multiple posts of the same nature sir
---
The game is missing a shit ton of features. I'd rather have a complete game with bugs rather than an incomplete game that runs flawlessly 
---
And think about Fallout 
---
Thanks to all of you. That's what it is.
---
I thought it was something useful, like the prime receivers I didn't bother to get during the firebreathers' quests or something. 
---
Tis k, I could see a feral ghoul screaming at you in response.  Classic Fallout comedy, "WHO POOPIN IN HERE!?" "HHHRAAWWWGHHLLLLGHH!!"

Lolllllllllllll you seem to be under the misconception that Bethesda wanted to make a functioning MMO and not a cheap knock off multiplayer mod of Fallout 4.   
---
Nah but fr I agree on some of this shit. Get rid of the robot vendors / turn them into auction houses exclusively for player trading. Everything should be attainable through drops from enemies. To keep the economy functional and not based on player discretion, set prices for the items in game and have those prices be effected by charisma.

Web design, waiting for Rage 2, browse for better games, can't find any as not many other games these days other than Bethesda titles are worth it.
---
I didn’t think you could fast travel into the nuke zone?
---
I've killed a couple that have dropped literally no legendary at all. So I guess count yourself lucky if you get even a 1 star. Lmao. The legendary effect I get the most is melee weapons with 100% VATS chance at a cost of more AP when not in combat. AKA - Entirely fucking useless because it's on a Melee weapon.  
---
It's not even a legendary effect I would use, regardless though.   
---
I've dropped some many "legendaries" on the floors of caves, smh. 
---
Even night time is way too bright, hardly considered a "dark" game.  Also, if you are afraid of the dark, guess what? Server hopping is an option.  It's a damn shame that your vote counts the same as mine. 
---
Explosive is 20% damage increase right off the bat. Anti-Armor is something like 23-25% damage increase, but it diminishes with other armor piercing effects (if I remember the math right), so if you have the Tank-Killer perk, Anti-Armor's effective damage bonus drops down quite a bit.
---
Furious has no up-front damage bonus, so on enemies you kill in 1 hit, it's not that great. But against big bads like SB's, furious will stack up, and that combined with the Explosive effect will make it win in any fight that's more than 2 shots. I believe the Furious effect stacks up 5 or 6% damage per shot, to a max of 30% bonus. So any fight that's over in just a few shots, furious doesn't really do much. Once you get into 5-6 shots, it heavily depends on what other legendary effects you're comparing it to. 
---
Nope found legit from mutant at westek
---
what are slap rules?
---
* Ability to clear trees / bush from camp area would be good.
---
* Add notes to map and multiple markers
---
* Lock items so you can't sell them accidentally
---
I will likely go in a corner and cry with a flamethrower if they did that 😂
---
Hah!   Nicely done.  
---
I see less and less people taking workshops on the servers i am on anymore (PC).
---
And I do believe it has to do directly with the way PVP works for them.
---
The assholes have figured out that they can grief somebody just by:
---
- Seeing who has the workshop
---
- Find them on the map
---
- Send friends to the owner's location
---
- Start a claim
---
- Kill the owner
---
PVP *for workshops* should 100%, without a doubt, unconditionally be limited to the building area of the workshop.
---
If I was watching this live and you didn't go inside I would be disappointed. That is one of the best player interactions a streamer could randomly come across. I wish this didnt bother me.
---
Look. At. Every. Other. Comment. 
---
No one has agreed with your stupid fucking idea. 
---
I'm a homemaker... homeschool my kid cook clean take care of my 3 pets... grind fallout take care of my spouse when they get back from work
---
Yes, that helps a bit, sometimes. Faster to delete from storage. Just wondering if there is a better way.
---
Oh, you're the type of dude who wants to build a fireplace in his house when it has no walls? Cause ya know it won't really keep you warm... without the walls. 
---
I like stuff that looks like it's part of the game. Here's some shots of my place. [https://imgur.com/a/bsXtuNi](https://imgur.com/a/bsXtuNi)
---
You can't see the workshop area in the photos, but there's a workshop and a boat dock down on the basement level on the lake side. The first floor is the pub, and the second floor is a guest room and the master bedroom with the roll up door and balcony.
---
I legit use them to afk in if I get hungry or want to smoke a hookah or if nature calls.  Good to know they're apparently used by griefers.  I'll stick on top of roofs from now on.
---
My hardest was a 3 star legendary colonel gusty . Came across one doing a daily event  AWOL by the Robco building. Since I was the only player doing the event, I must have died 5 times. When I finally finished the event.....he gave me a nice weapon. Level 45 3 star legendary .44 revolver that was a two shot, explosive round and +1 perception.....it was worth the dying....lol
---
You know, extremely reduced damage to unprovoked attacks.
---
For PvP to properly initiate both side should deal damage- So getting a drop on someone is pointless unless you discovered a way to deal massive damage. (Like bobblehead stack that fixed out)
---
In short, even if you snipe non-wanted melee player from afar, they'll only get scratched, and you can't stop them from delivering *Oh no you don't* minmaxed one hit kill melee attack.
---
Having played since beta, the game hasn't come a "long" way in any sense of the word. It's come a very short way towards being a functioning game. The only shit they've achieved is shit the game should've launched with. Don't go sucking Bethesda's dick just yet. They're poised to shit all in ya mouf. You know damn well they'll be dumping an ass ton of new bugs into this game.   
---
There are still game breaking bugs in Fallout 4's DLC that they never fixed, ffs. 
---
My only advice is, stick to like four per plant, if that.  
---
They can each spawn up to 4 a piece, afaik. You don't need that much food, fam. 
---
Gotta mic?
---
I could see that genuinely happening on accident, I've been known to accidentally chuck a grenade because I mash R1 as soon as I *think* the trade menu will come up.  Once did it twice even...
---
This happens a lot at my brother's camp. There's sometimes super mutants spawning at exactly the point where I end up after fast traveling. I hear them, I hear gunfire, I see my health drop quickly, but I can't do shit for the first few seconds. Until I can finally move, I'm already close to dying. 
---
At least they arent charging us for the dlc am i correct? Because they easily could and debatably should charge real money for dlc....
---
Prizebot is KOS for me, until it starts giving something of actual value.
---
I think that before releasing new content they should fix the most basic things of the game...
---
I played on release, paused and tried again last week-end. Its sad to still see the game stutter, freeze and crash on random moments...
---
The C.A.M.P issue is still a problem half of the time.
---
I know that they are trying their best and have to release new content, but a lot of issues aren't fixed yet to enjoy the very basics of this game :/
---
Correct. 
---
This.  This.  This.  This.  No joke I had 100 dog food at one point, so this.  This.  Absolutely this.  And that.
---
Or do I just say yes?  Yes.  Add more, please and thanks.
---
It says "Workshop Budget" in top right corner.
---
Waiting until the new questline to jump in.
---
Melee is the only viable option in higher level pve, though. I just think literally every other weapon in the game needs a massive buff. Lasers and bullets doing less damage than a wrench with some hooks glued on is bullshit 
---
Not extreme.  Usually when this happens, I just do not feel like dealing with the trolls with TSE anymore and usually log out.   Not much to do end-game anyways.  So this ruins what was keeping me playing the game..  Chances to get legendaries.  That's the only way I can improve character now.
---
I do the groundwork for building houses... and think about fallout
---
Well, in my mind the grenade perk would do just enough damage to send a message without destroying his house. No need for more. But, he already wasted between 10 and 15 minutes of my time, not worth wasting more.
---
Yeah because this subreddit is an echo chamber of single player pacifist role playing beta males.  They don't want challenges.  They want TGM and their hand to be held through everything.  
---
I like Oxhorns lore videos, I did not like how he completely ignored all the garbage that was going on with this game while he continued to advertise it .
---
Maybe try over at [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76bazaar) you would probably have an easier time looking for it there
---
Same here, although I use the term "facility manager" instead of homemaker. 
---
If they charged a god damned dime for DLC for this game, they'd be shooting themselves in the foot. For one, it's got microtransactions. Ones that charge you for content that is in previous games. Re used skins, re skins, etc.   
---
For two, they already tried ripping off how many people who bought into that special edition bullshit with the bags and had to fork out in the end?
---
I work in IT, and wish for a nuclear apocalypse.
---
I have.   A person came to my camp, poked around a bit and started blowing stuff up.  I noticed he had friend on cliff a bit of distance away.  They had planned it so I would attack wanted guy.
---
Another guy at whitesprings attempted to kill me because I was low health from rads, I popped the Radaway-Stims and proceeded to ignore him.   He chased me for 10 minutes trying to kill me while I was on Pacifist.  He even attempted to Mini-nuke me.    
---
All of those trolls are on my perma blocked list.   Now, I am more apt to block anyone coming to my camp than risk them blowing up my camp...  No I do not want to move it.  Its built around terrain and I know I could not place it back down.   I would have to spend over an hour building the thing again.
---
I have been trying to enjoy the game more. I seem to spend a load of time thinking about the game rather than actually playing, and then when i can, i simply don't enjoy it.
---
Idunno. I run no armor at all, because I find even having the lighest pieces of armor make the mobs 99% more likely to sense me. With no armor at all, I can literally walk up into their face and still be hidden 9/10 times.   
---
But in theory, yes. Anything that reduces armor weight should increase your stealth. 
---
That's the kind of situation I'm in. Bought it at launch, took a big break until some issues were fixed, but now it seems a tad barren, and like we're expected to grind for our lives to hit that coveted Level 50. That could just be me being stupid though 
---
When I look at the comments everybody seems to reply about the game play so i am the only one who experience frequent freezes and stuttering when I just turn my character around?
---
I have less random crashes, but technically the game is still running like a retirement plan...
---
Idunno anyone saying Bethesda killed Fallout.  
---
I do know a lot of folks who think 76 is by far their worst game. 
---
Oh i have traded there for a long time, just wanted see if someone would have something to trade in here
---
What platform? There was a thread on here last night saying how original xbone were having trouble loading and running some of the larger areas (like Harpers Ferry) but the new model was fine with it.
---
You know it's coming.
---
I'll gladly spend money on skins for doggos in the Atom Shop.
---
Ok, then how are people going to be able to find the venders to buy things?    Force people to move CAMPs into well known places or maybe put an icon on map where your CAMP is located.  Then pray the griefers don't hit them?
---
Griefers will hit them first of any CAMPS because they are easy to find.
---
Yes, I have been hit by CAMP griefers.
---
Ahh i see, good luck i hope you find what you're looking for ♥️
---
I usually don't get too near camp of other players uninvited because i had several weird experiences (on xbox) were the owner start firing at me as if to say "go away".
---
A few hours ago, i posted a comment on another thread that give a good example if anyone care.
---
That's exactly what I was thinking - a reference to Dunwich, or an elaboration on the cult that was also there. The fact that these creatures actually exist in the Fallout verse... dang! 
---
from what i read it does not work since it is not an actual fire. its more of a spray of gassy plasma
---
Hope your right about that.   But I expect the worse.
---
Yeah, sometimes he does nothing but i continue to use it anyway because it still help me some.
---
"The Timeless Art of Seduction"  
---
You are welcome.
---
As the guy who did the testing, did you read all the updates? Someone pointed out to me that a wanted player CAN trigger your mutations and put you in PvP even if you are in pacifist, and I verified it to be true. 
---
You can add me at ArhenDante if you want, I'm going to be starting an alt build soon anyway; however, I don't have a mic.  As for leveling, I usually do the main quest up to finishing the Firebreathers exam and then clear out the areas in the Forest and any side quests before heading up into the Toxic Valley.  Occasionally I'll fast travel over and join the "One violent night" event, but fighting the Wendigo can be pretty hit or miss depending on whether anyone else joins in, or if I have Blocker 3 by that point.
---
The only time I bother with Workshops is if I need a specific resource or can take and hold 4 or so workshops(as you can pretty much jump between them doing defense events for xp).
---
I finally got a level 45 legendary ant-armor, shoots explosive round auto handmade......very cool
---
I uh, don't think I'd want to sell screws for merchandise.  Can't we just have a Rum and Nuka Cola over some Salisbury Steak and Instamash and talk some prices with cold hard caps?
---
Same here, Belgium.
---
WHAT.
---
Im on PC. The freezes and stuttering happens frequently so not in a particular area.
---
My pc is decent enough to run the game:
---
I7 4770K 3.5 Ghz
---
16GB ram
---
GTX 970 4GB strix
---
If a wanted player attacks you and you have Unstable Isotope/Electrically Charged, it absolutely puts you in PvP even if you have pacifist. I tested it. Only Wanted players can do this, which is (one reason)why they tap his base for a 5cap bounty first. 
---
I consider it a bug, but it is what it is
---
This is funny, and the downvotes too... Good stuff
---
My comment was about that there was a time when I felt it useless to take workshops because you would get disconnected and never reap the benefits. Sorry to be unclear. English is not my first language.
---
How does this work? Attack the robots then head for the camp? Will the turrets shoot at the robots? For how long are the robots hostile towards you after?
---
Lol nice, at least it didn't add all of that weight on you.
---
Heavy weapons. There’s almost no damage improvements to heavy weapons outside of Prime receivers. I’d still limit my usage to scorched fights, the ammo is too expensive otherwise.
---
If you aren’t a low-health build with an appropriate bloodied weapon, get yourself an appropriate Zealot’s weapon, Prime it, and save that for fight Scorched. It will fucking melt them.
---
Call your local internet provider and get you isp address changed. If your PS4 ...you will be able change you psn name soon. 
---
Trade with other players. Hands down fastest. 
---
we agree !
---
Got mine from the prison event, I think
---
While I agree, I must admit I never get to appreciate it because a giant lvl 91 glowing deathclaw slashing me in the face usually gives me something to scream about.  In a terrified yelping kind of way.  Usually followed by a death squawk.  And revenge!
---
But that loud whapping smack noise does make me feel bad for my armor.  It takes so much and for what??  To be repaired and do it all over again until you get a better piece and replace it??  Least my pockets don't get shredded off lol
---
This. + adamtium skeleton or what it’s called. Then just sit down and have a smoke when the scorchedbeast attacks
---
This is the key point here. To find the large items they run a script when the servers are down for maintenance. I would not be surprised if this account was banned on Tuesday when they release the new update. I would not support that decision but I would also not be surprised at all by it.
---
From fissures to fissures

Emergency psych assessments lol 
---
What drive are you running?  
---
Fire up afterburner and use stats overlay to check your frame times.  
---
My kids machine was having massive stutter doing anything other than looking at the floor or the sky until I moved the game over to an SSD.
---
Was it a bloodied Bowie? That’s my fav weapon. Stab everything fast af
---
Idk but it's bomb with some rumchata
---
(I'll see myself out)
---
Are yall getting this have fo76 installed on a hdd instead of a ssd?
---
Even a slow ssd might not be able to keep up with the texture streaming, game is glitchy though so you never know sometimes.
---
I haven’t seen that one lol
---
Open the atomic shop and interact with a few things before losing back in for a new server. Otherwise it’ll keep putting you back in your last server
---
You mean nopes?
---
How much armour can you realistically avoid. I run tank killer and an AA Dragon. Is it possible to ignore 100% of an enemy’s armour????
---
Yuuup. Figures you're one of those sociopath griefer douchebags. Why am I not shocked. You have shit ideas and get violently offended when people point out how fucking stupid they are. I should have figured. 
---
The "beta male" dig's a fun and exciting addition to your lot's usual nerotic bullshit, though. Good job. 
---
Best pointer so far. Thanks 
---
I realized I started doing this in Fallout 76 after watching Oxhorn streams.
---
+karma
---
They're doing weekly updates
---
I don’t care why are you all still playing this game 
---
Raider groups seems to be the new ' thing' at the mo... Bumped into a trio of them last night at pleasant valley cabins.. To be fair they didn't start on me but they were well equipped and could have taken me out easily just for fun.
---
I could totally go for like half the recipies being common, 20% rare, 20% very rare, 10% camo jumpsuits. It would make your bar exclusive based on what you had
---
Yes! Personally I cant wait to rebuild my camp :D Been holding off since last week - I wanted to build again with the new individual item budgets in mind and see how creative I can get :D   
---
Not having a camp until then though is driving me crazy \*lol\*   
---
but what if the dog food is made of dogs 👀
---
What's prestige mode? I'm somewhat behind.
---
WHO DOES NUMBER 2 WORK FOR?!

HYPETRAIN CHOO CHOO ALL ABOARD

I'm level 135 and people griefed my CAMP.   I dont do PVP.   
---
I want all slap damage removed and ability to damage CAMPs removed.
---
"Simple Clean and effective."
---
Slap damage is not an excuse to replace emotes.
---
Lots of PC players play with gamepads too.
---
why am i reading this like a ghost story? haha
---
This is a genius idea. 
---
Did this today. Some already grabbed but a good run!
---
That’s a 32-but integer under-run. It’s 4.2 billion, by the way. 
---
Or craft a miniature nuclear bomb for that matter 
---
I'm at college, studying Physics. 
---
?? So  ??
---
Do you even play this game? I said it's INSIDE CAMP. 
---
Are you disagreeing that as you CLEARLY IMPLY you do?
---
looks like the item quantities are an unsigned 32 bit number, which underflowed somehow.
---
No. Optimized Bracers, same as all the rest of the mods, apply only when you are attacking with your 'bare fists'.
---
Is a good way to use materials/miscmods and reduce the max durability of the armor part for no return whatsoever though.
---
Work on my Phd  and take care of “sick “ airmen.
---
Prepare to be banned.
---
You can clear them. If you place a CAMP object over a bush or rock, the obstacle disappears.
---
I found a cigarette on the sidewalk a few years back and thought 7 caps without weight, before realizing it was real life.
---
I did pick up a zealot’s handmade today, I’ll give it a spin
---
And how exactly would you suggest this rebalance to work?
---
It's a visual glitch caused by integer overflows.
---
I have a friend who used to do that, my other friends met him and were going to destrpy his camp, found out he was nice and now his camp is there without turrets so other people can't do it.  In return I put down like 50 flamingos in his camp.
---
Your mudcrab seems broken.
---
Um... You do know that "Workshop Budget" means items placed inside a "Workshop".
---
If it was image taken from CAMP, it would say "CAMP Budget".
---
CAMPS != Workshop.
---
This image provided offers no "proof" of vender created in CAMP.  But Bethesda has said that they will add player Vending to camps. 
---
I like that even less.  CAMPS will need icons on maps to sell things and currently CAMPS can be damaged by griefers.
---
So adding player vending to CAMPs are bad IMO in its current form.  Worthless.
---
If you have the herbivore mutation you do need a lot of crops. Meat ain't much of an option here outside of the non-nutrious benefits it provides.
---
I rarely get anything worth a crap for killing them except experience. Even the crowned one in the glasses cavern drops nothing.
---
Would be awesome!   Block CAMPS being place anywhere inside the fence boundry.

* **New Feature: Legendary Players** **– An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.**
---
That's all we know right now.
---
Try to maintain chaos-I’m a preschool teacher 
---
LOL
---
That's West-Tek and happens all the time. The same for the chunk of meat that just goes off, flies into the sky and lands right outside the barricaded entrance when you explode the car. 
---
(You know you're farming this place way too much when you can tell the location from a glitch)
---
That sucks. Here. Here's 20 pounds of crap you didn't want and can't refuse. See ya!  
---
Invisibility does nothing for PVE though.  Sneak Rank 3 and Escape Artist (for movement speed) are your friend.
---
I want it in game, and I want to tame it.
---
I know there is a dead radatag on the big bridge in the forest area that's labled as a brahmin. Sadly not as fucked as this one.
---
BOS Mod fo the combat armor does not work for +25 rad.  I think they tried it fix it once.   But the BOS Chest is pretty nice for phsyical and energy.
---
Okay, didn't know that, so if you place something on top of a tree it will disapear then you can remove the object and the area will be clear, is that correct?
---
Quick question only level 17, which monsters / level drops Legendary?
---
I’m a land surveyor. I spend my days in the woods, or on vacant properties with abandoned houses, or on commercial properties, and pretend I’m in the wasteland. 
---
Just go to the Whitespring and go stealth. If there are high levels nearby, tag as much ghouls as you can and let them finish them off. Just don't tag too many at once, no one likes being swarmed.
---
You might even run into a high level who'll take you under their wing and have you follow them around for exactly that reason.
---
PVP is broken in this game, its geared toward griefers actually.  Its very evident when taking over workshops.
---
Also be advised that if you take a workshop and go away doing quests... Someone can start claiming the workshop and flag you as PVP even though you are no where near the workshop.  Then 1 shot kill once you are flagged.  If you really want to avoid stuff like this, dont claim workshops.
---
Also if you just want to risk doing them for the plans or ATOMS, just finish the quest or whatnot, and relog into the server to give up the claim.   You wont be owner anymore and no one can put you into PVP mode.
---
Fusion cores used to be everywhere.  Now they reduced the chance of them spawning.   But you will find fusion reactors everywhere.
---
There is a perk that significantly increases the duration of the fusion cores though.   Get that.
---
Oh damn!!!!!
---
It's not perfect, but PC users can use the Perk Loadout Manager found on the Nexus.
---
There are good youtubers????
---
Based on my experience with Bethesda, yes I do. I don't exactly dump on the new content, but I think the game has more important things that need fixing before content arrives that could cause more issues. We all know Bethesda and we just recently had bugs patched in again. They have a serious problem with their priorites.
---
Hmm, that is actually awesome gift for a new player.
---
&gt;You do know that "Workshop Budget" means items placed inside a "Workshop".
---
No I don't know that. You claim you do know. But I'm quite doubtful of your ability to disseminate information, particular if some of it is obsolete, like the Fallout 76 introduction video.
---
Did you know you can't have a camp inside workshop? If you didn't, now you know, or you can go and test it.
---
Can you even see that camp device right there?
---
&gt;This image provided offers no "proof" of vender created in CAMP. 
---
So I guess you can't see it. I'm sorry, you are not arguing like a retard, but I still don't see much point to continue. The info is right there in the screenshot alone. You can't see it, you can't derive from it.
---
Entertain me, how did the game deside which resources and budget limit it used, when camp overlapped with this infamous "workshop" you speak of?
---
Just play normal and you’ll be fine. Aka don’t cheat. 
---
Ah geez. Good old lady science. Sh-she's a real...you gotta hang on tight.
---
Heh, I did not think it was possible really.  I fugured just the xp gains from the quests would put you closer to 25.
---
What does duping have to do with buying the best stuff? Seems like everyone that doesn’t have good gear just complains about everyone else being op. Play the game and grind for good shit like the rest of us
---
Back then they saved it but now they ruined it
---
PvP is intended to be rock/paper/scissors, but rock wins every time.
---
If it does Derpy you better follow me arround blasted out of your mind with "Fireball" by Pitbull playing at all times.
---
Playing a better game
---
Honestly?  Paranoia.  Ain’t no torlet-sleepin’ ghoul gonna sneak up on me.
---
What does your Behemoth neighbor think of this?
---
This is actually pretty genius. 
---
Those never worked in Bethesda games before, so I doubt they'll work now.
---
Just only get the very first rank of Rifleman perks.  Save yourself 6 points.
---
The first rank is 10%.  Then each perk after that is 5%.
---
I’ll try that out. Thanks for the info!
---
What is your armor set up exactly? And what is your dr and er?
---
I use vanguard marine limbs with a metal chest piece. I have mutations and the barbarian perk and my Dr is like 550 at full health. I can take a pretty good beating.
---
Sneak Rank 3 and Escape Artists are awesome.   I will never drop those.  
---
If you do it right, you can kill a SB without ever being on "Danger" mode.
---
I tend to carry 10 soups and 5 waters.   I oddly seem to go through water twice as fast as food.  Prob due to some mutations.
---
Yeah but if you remove the thing, the rock will come back after a while.
---
Okay understand, will take a look this evening when I play. Thanks for the tip
---
It's amazing 
---
Nah, just change so we can only build on the greens.
---
This might sound stupid but did you check the volume sliders in the audio setting of FO76?
---
Super abyss shadow dark assassin paint for your every edgy mood! 
---
May I ask why theyre not worth it? Where would you put those 6 points instead?
---
May I see your perk card loadout please? Im interested to see what you have set up where.
---
My armor - 
---
3	left arm	heavy combat	vanguard	reduce 20% ammo weight	1+ Luck
---
2	right arm	Light combat	vanguard	increase luck spot	1+ Luck
---
2	left leg	heavy combat	vanguard	reduce 20% weapon weight	1+ charisma
---
1	right leg	heavy  combat	vanguard	increase action point	
---
3	chest	heavy combat	bolstering	increase action point	50% more durability
---
Try out lucky hole mine. I find that mole miners are a really good way to level up faster cause they’re a bit stronger than low level scorched and mole rats. 
---
Try taking grenades with you and lots of ammo 
---
I raise a quantum to your glorious John Wickery! 
---
Scorch beast drop ultracite plans. Not just the queen. 
---
Yeah. I've tried with Buffout, Psycho and alcohol.
---
But guys, there is something wrong with addictions.
---
I was shooting supermutants when I noticed that the little red icon that indicates that you have an addiction was gone.
---
Checked in the pip-boy and poof! Good bye to my alcohol addiction from yesterday.
---
Minutes before I was at Whitespring and before fast travelling I checked if I was still an alcoholic. I was.
---
An observation: in Fallout 4 when you used a chem you was addicted to, it would suppress the Junkie bonus damage, but that doesn't seem the case in 76.
---
I'm on PC, btw.
---
I wish I could say the same :( out in the open, even before it flies overhead instantly switches to danger, and caution starts from when I sniper shoot it at max range :/ that was with 3 Sneak and Escape Artist on.. so I gave up on using them.. they just seem to be broken.
---
Slavs unite! 
---
Game has a bug with headphone vs. Speakers setting. If you use speakers then switch to headphone then pull the headphone out, the game never reverts back to speakers until you restart it.
---
That's what happens to me. 
---
Thing is you never know.. unless you open the door
---
EVE online. 'Nuff said. 
---
I can't wait and really hope they don't screw the pooch on energy weapons. For me lasers are the fucking coolest weapons in Fallout
---
No.
---
Question 1 bases have a lot of usage from a place to do all your crafting to setting a free fast travel point on your map to making a farm for that sweet sweet vegetable starch. 
---
Question 2 it's a Fallout game do quests and explore and get sweet loot thats pretty much it. more PVP options will appear in the future updates I hear. 
---
The perk should just be changed to allowing crafting medic syringer mods and make healing more effective while equipping.
---
Flamers healing friends make no sense. 
---
Why?
---
Hey! Thank's really apreciated. When i get home i'll place my C.A.M.P !
---
The C.A.M.P. is so you have all the crafting and a bed at one central location for you to use that is free to fast travel to.
---
Bulk. Sell. Retire to the Bahamas....
---
You can't. But the game spawns you into the same location you logged out last time so if that happens to be a nuked WS, there you go. 
---
This is also the reason why I have the Hazmat Suit on my favourites wheel.
---
I have tried a ton of builds so I'm no expert, but heres what I do
---
All of my limbs are vanguard marine with +1 END (that was just lucky) and various 3rd perks. I would prefer heavy combat but this is the best ive got.
---
I use a metal chest (put a dense mod on whatever you use here) for the extra dr instead of the other options. 
---
Get level 2 starched genese and level 3 class freak if you dont already. For 5 perks you get a lot of traits and dr and er. Grounded, scaly skin, and healing factor are good defensive mutations.
---
I'm in the middle of a respec right now so my perk chart is messy. I have 15 strength and almost always have barbarian on.
---
And that's all I do for non pa defense. I can takr a beating at high health, but radiation takes away my vanguard stacking and I get a little squishy acter that.
---
Thank you! Really apreciate the answer .
---
I have a buddy from my friends list sit in a world. Join them and check out how stable the server is and if there is a nuke going. If you feel confident dump the stuff you want transferred into a container. Log out to main. Join your friend with your alt. Pick up your stuff. 
---
You must use another players account as a “mule” to hold stuff while you change characters.  The only other RISKY way of doing it is to note another player on the server, then drop your stuff into a bag, log off and HOPE you can rejoin  the same server using that players name.  If they log off you might not get back to the same server, if this does work then you have an excellent 10% chance the bag has not disappeared, so not really a good option, and the first way of transferring stuff does have some risk (which is why I only do this with my son’s character).  There are reports that if you use a container, like a remote bear-proof trash can, and get another players name to rejoin the same server that this has a elevated 20% chance of working.
---
Xmas 1 is in the Atomic Shop. The others you get from either from 1 of the first few story missions or from claiming workshops. I'm not sure
---
Early retired, learning the piano. 
---
Ahh. I got Speed Demon and bought Starched Genes ASAP. Sorry man. 
---
Either enemies with Legendary in their name, or enemies with up to 3 Stars to right right of their name/hp bar.
---
"because you suck at PvP" - I wouldn't go as far as saying there is any skill required for PvP in this game..
---
 Please add working faucets. I have always needed to open them in every game that it is possible and leave water flow and walk away :D
---
I definitely have starched genes, class freak etc - I dont have Grounded though- I will get that :D  
---
Ahh gotcha, I cant do the whole 15 strength thing without losing rifle/sneak stuff.. 
---
Dense is an interesting choice.. I usually use deep pocketed - what does dense add?
---
I’m in the army, usually grind at the weekend or when I’m on leave
---
You really need to at least get Marsupial and Bird Bones as well. Jumping to all the high places and landing safely, most of the time, is a serious game changer. :)
---
Exactly what I’m saying. Bethesda should at least move player spawn points further away from enemy spawn points. For me it happens the most at Whitesprings since I farm the ghouls there for legendaries.
---
if you are not farming adhesive (which I do), then build a 2x1 platform with you workstations &amp; stash box on them. Keep it small and easy to place and once you overencumberd, and are too far to walk to a vendor/red rocket you can just pop it down and fix weapons and make ammo and store your junk.
---
Watch for Events, just being within the event area will give nice loot/plans.  If I am near, I will attend every Defend event at a workshop. I do not have to fire a single shot and risk getting wanted if the workshop owner defends it, or if they have set up some good defences to ge the same reward.
---
All of this.  I had a nice spot on a cliff overlooking WS (nowhere near WS itself, just overlookinng it so I could hop off the cliff in PA and stroll over to WS for farming runs), but some numbnuts kited not one, not two, but three of the flying cancer fucks to my camp, which they immediately oriented on and started spamming with their shitty screaming and pissing.  They not only wrecked most of my base in minutes, but also infected my mirelurk king pet, presumably with one of their piss attacks, and caused it to aggro on me and my team.  My friend had to leave the team and unfriend me to kill the fucking mirelurk.
---
Twice.  He had to kill it twice.
---
When we finally killed the pieces of shit, what did we get?  Bones and meat, a dead pet I worked hard to get, a net loss of ammo, weapon/armor durability, and a trashed base.  They're utter bullshit.
---
Dense helps with explosive damage. Deep pocketed is nice but dense is really good. 
---
I forget what the defensive perk is for the other skills. Can you fit rank 3 in to your highest skill?
---
My strength perks are 9 of the shotgun damage perks, 3 of scattershot, and 3 barbarian. 
---
Stop the nukes become a country of drunks 😊
---
On the other side of the spectrum to this is the people who are in parties with other players, who have to have everyone tag the enemy in order for everyone to be able to loot it.  There isn’t really much that can be done about leechers, sadly.
---
The extra resources however, I would love to see.
---
What’s it last 2 minutes?
---
Then they'll just go and spread more shit sbout the game being being broken and unplayable with the help of wonderful papa Yongyea and Juicehead.
---
Why???
---
I have the game installed on an SSHD on PS4. I don’t claim to be an expert, but I don’t think it matters as much where you have it installed, since it’s an online game. I have a buddy who plays on PC with an SSD and has this issue as well. I think it has to do more with server delay.
---
Yea but Im more of a close to the ground sneaky guy
---
Q1. Placing Camp means you can fix your gear, get bonuses for music and sleep, get food and water, and scrap junk from anywhere on the map. Some people, like myself, build perma Camps that don't get moved and this is a disadvantage. Having a 4x4 shitbox you can slam down whenever and wherever is highly useful when you are low level. 
---
Q2. Do all the quest. There aren't that many anyway. When you are finished with certain ones it unlocks new ones. Uncover all of the map. Find the recipes and plans. Help people out you see struggling and build a character that thrives in the wasteland. 
---
Gotta think like prey, never do it in Posiden, its too centrally located. The other one is much more remote,  and is less likely to have players wandering around. Booby trap the hell out of it while you're extracting, assume someone else wants what you have.  Carefully plot your time. Get up at 3am and mine 15-20 cores a run while the griefiers sleep late.  Watch the map carefully, be prepared to die. Load the cores right from the extractor to your stash box.
---
Not saying griefers aren't assholes just that the best defense is paranoia. They're looking for an easy target. Not one who sees them coming and leaves before they can get their jollies in. 
---
ooh ok, gotcha, thank you for that :) 
---
Ash heap buddy! Ash heap!
---
No problem at all. Hope you enjoy the game
---
&gt; They're really already pushing out DLC when the game is still fundamentally broken?
---
How is it "fundamentally broken"?
---
I farm Whitesprings for legendaries all the time. So this happens to me all the time. 😂😭
---
I'm just wondering how much they'd complain if they could only play with other banned players. With most likely the most unstable servers, with basically a closed door to the dev team for any issues they have. Nobody would be buying stock and the economy would tank. Not really a game I'd be happy to play.
---
Favourite the Hazmat Suit or put it on when you log out. Problem solved.
---
The Wastelanders content coming in Autumn certainly sounds like we might get human companions and/or animal companions.  Might even get a few interesting companions like Super Mutants, Ghouls, etc.  After all, it is not a Fallout game if we can't have Dogmeat and/or other companions.
---
I watched the whole video. I'm not going to comment on every single thing that he said, that'd take too long.
---
You can't judge the game for not featuring human NPC's, that's like getting mad at Burger King because they won't make you a Big Mac. I was very apprehensive when it was announced that "every person you meet will be a real player", but I came to realise that this wasn't going to be the Fallout game that I originally would have liked. They're not a feature of the game, just like crowbars aren't a weapon in it.
---
He talks about player camps not permanently existing in the world; if they did, how exactly would that work? Would players only be allowed to place their camp once and then they're tied to that server until the end of time? This is a mute point.
---
He talks about engaging in PvP. To the player shooting back, "Your attacks will be the first to do full damage.". Not anymore. Both players have to attack each other, and then full damage can be dealt.
---
He talks about us "growing up in the vault together", and how when players engage in PvP, that it's antithetical to this. So, should players stick absolutely rigidly to the story told in the opening (only) cinematic? I don't think so. This is dustin' crops where there ain't no crops.
---
One thing I learned from the video is that when you shoot while scoped, you can only leave the scope after the animation has completed. Yes, it'd definitely would be better if you could leave it after you shoot. Maybe this isn't the case anymore, I'll have to check for myself.
---
He thinks it's a bad FPS. It's certainly not incredible, but I enjoy it for what it is. I think the shotguns sound great, and I really feel like I'm blowing super mutant heads off, even though I don't have controller vibration turned on.
---
Yes, most of the enemies derp now and again, their AI could be better. Not being able to step over small obstacles? I agree that that's dumb.
---
He mentioned spawning into enemies, that's happened to me a few times at the Whitespring Golf Club, but I think they've fixed that now, for that location anyway. It certainly was annoying when it happened.
---
At one point he's shooting at a legendary enemy and complains that its health respawned; it's supposed to. It's the same mechanic as in F4, to make the enemies a bit tougher to beat, a 2nd wind for them.
---
He talks about finding weapons that you can't use that, but fails (just like probably everyone else who complained about this) to mention that the weapon stats increase with their level increases, and you can craft weapons and armor at lower levels, if you find/buy the plans for them.
---
He also mentions that power armor frames are everywhere; so what? Is he implying that only a select few should be able to avail of PA to make it more rare? This is nonsensical to me. The BoS steel were an army, not a handful of soldiers. And yes, this brings up the retcon in the game. Personally, it's not something that bothers me. They've come up with reasons for adding to the lore, why super mutants and the BoS are in the game world of Appalachia, and I find that easy to accept. I can understand why players who played the original games and are very much into their lore would be upset by this.
---
I wasn't offended at all by his review, he certainly makes some valid points. I agree that most of the items in the Atomic Shop are ludicrously priced. I watched Oxhorn's review of the game, I thought it was total ass.
---
I waited until a month after the official launch to get the game at half-price (€35), and after the first 3 patches had been released. From the announcement at E3, I was very apprehensive about the concept of an online Fallout game. And then the shitstorm started, and it kept getting bigger and bigger, and I was totally dumbfounded as to how a company could sink their reputation in such a relatively short amount of time. Not just the state of the game at launch, but all the other things that happened outside of the game; the duffel kerfuffle, just to name one of many things that happened. The game was released too early. If they had just waited, then they could have squashed a lot of bugs before a delayed release.
---
I will no longer believe at face value any words that come out of Hodd Toward's mouth. "16x the detail", that's hilarious. Tell me lies tell me sweet little lies......
---
I'm not going to shit on the devs in the trenches for the poor/greedy/cynical decisions made by the decision makers at Bethesda; no dev in their right mind would have wanted to release the game in the state that it was. And yet, that decision was made, and now the devs have to bear the bludgeoning from angry fans shitting on them, when it's the decision makers who are to blame. What ever happened to nuance? Look at all the shit that happened outside the game itself that reeks of 'higher up the company chain' arrogance.
---
I'm not a Bethesda fanboy, I wouldn't lie down on a bed of nails for Hete Pines. I really enjoyed F3, New Vegas &amp; F4, so maybe I'm a basic bitch for enjoying vanilla (apparently) RPG's. I'm also really enjoying 76. Once I was able to accept that it isn't F5, I was able to enjoy it a lot more. The story of the world being told through holotapes? I wasn't sure about that at the start, but I now find it interesting. The world being uninspired? I totally disagree; I think it's the best (by far) Fallout map that Bethesda have made, there's so many different parts to it.
---
I like exploring, I like shooting things, I like looting, I really enjoy inventory management (a very unusual thing to enjoy I know). I didn't ignore the problems the game had when it launched, I recognise what's been fixed and that there's more to be done, but the game is in a much better state than it was at launch, even a month after launch. Patch 7 and more content is on its way. I hope that the decision makers at Bethesda have learned their lesson. I must reiterate that I'm not going to shit on developers for decisions made that weren't theirs; game devs get shit on a lot already in the AAA (Triple Aye!!!) game industry space; I'm not going to add to it.
---
"The game is better with friends."
---
"Leaving a flaming bag of shit on someone's doorstep is better with friends hur dur dur!"
---
The game was a flaming bag of shit at launch, but isn't anymore. And yes, the game is more fun with friends; I'd argue that it's necessary to play with other people (even if it's just passersby for a nuke zone session) to get the most out of the game. I've found a consistent group of people to play the game with and we've had a lot of fun together and been in stitches at some of our antics.
---
I've put 250+hrs into it so far in the 3 months (13th Dec) since I've bought it, and it's the only game that I've been playing since then, and I'm showing no signs of slowing down. I kept a close eye on the shitstorm at the start of the game's lifecycle, and I can't stress how much it has improved.
---
Tl;dr - Hodd Toward is full of shit, the game has improved a lot since launch, I really enjoy inventory management, honestly.
---
Isn't adventure mode just our current base mode? Contraring to the survival mode which is still gonna be the same mode but without pvp penalties.
---
As if downvotes mean anything other than your opinion isnt the popular one. Dont forget the majority of humans thought the Earth was the center of the universe. Thought witches were real, and still worship deities and punished/punish those who disagree in various ways to this day. 
---
You dont believe in what they believe? Might as well burn in whatever colorful version of hell the dumbasses can think up.
---
I should, but I don’t like that it unequips your armour. That’s another issue I have. Lol
---
Bethesda should change it so the Hazmat counts as an outfit instead of armour.
---
I'll respond in a few days and have a proper read of your comment. Atm, I'm tired af. Till then, have a good one
---
This is why I don’t ever log out at Whitesprings.  
---
I give one of my teammates the stuff I want to transfer, and then go and switch characters to grab it. Super easy and quick
---
Just keep killing and hope a good one drops eventually. Can’t force better drops. 
---
I wouldnt worry too much. I reported the infinite criticals bug months ago. Still in the game.
---
It doesn’t change when you are higher level either. 
---
I was at WSGC minding my own business farming ghouls (by myself) when I level 240+ comes in from nowhere and ganks me for no good reason.  I’m a lvl 134 with some pretty good weapons and gear but before I knew what happened he or she took me down and took my junk.   When I respawned back to see what’s up and confront that player they bolted and were nowhere to be found.  That is a total chickenshit move if you ask me.  I’m down for a fight but obviously they weren’t.  Oh well! 
---
I got you bro I'll give you the exact same axe this guy has for free
---
Ive easily crafted 5k worth of shotgun shells in the past couple days. Plastic pumpkins bby
---
It's a BOS quest. If you don't know you can't do it yet.
---
It’s definitely a big. They become all folded up and as they limp it’s a mixture of limbs stretching out (similar to what Mongrels used to do) and a lump of Gulper moving towards you.
---
If you're built anywhere close to Whitesprings, lots of people have a problem with that. Personally, if your camp is built directly behind the golf club with turrets, I'm destroying it, cause then you're just making it harder for anyone to farm that spot. If your camp is built in the area of Whitesprings, but not close enough to the golf club that the ghouls will run to it and die, then I don't care. Had a teammate last night destroy a guy's camp that was "built directly behind the golf club" I get there, and it was over near the bridge...with a bunch of crops, and one turret to protect the crops, along with a nice looking house. Not close enough, and definitely not a problem. Felt bad, so I killed my teammate when he went AFK (was still wanted) and repaired the dude's walls and turret.
---
TLDR: people are assholes if you're built in the area of Whitesprings, some times. people are WORSE (and justified) assholes when your camp is built directly behind the golf club. teammate was an asshole last night, I was not. someone give me a medal (joking)
---
Ah the vendors cap limit and pool.
---
Still the dumbest fucking thing about this game. Including my shotgun making female grunt noises a few days back when firing.
---
Yeah you'd be surprised how many people were banned also they can't play offline games on that account 
---
&gt;Melee is the only viable option in higher level pve
---
I strongly disagree. I never died in PVE and i'm level 110. 
---
I can one-shot pretty much any regular mob from quite some distance. While the damage thing might be true; (i never really used melee weapons) i'm already dealing enough damage so anything above would be pointless. 
---
If you can kill a let's say 10 hp mob with a 15 damage gun it doesn't matter if you get a gun that does 20 damage. The mob still only requires 1 hit.
---
The only case in which some extra damage could be nice is while fighting bosses. This being said the range aspect of ranged builds should also be mentioned. A melee user can't hit a SBQ while flying.  Ranged builds can easily do that. You're also not exposing yourself to damage and you can take cover if needed.
---
I'm not saying "don't buff guns", i'm just disagreeing with the quoted bit. But you do have to go all in and spec all of your points and perks in a single weapon class if you want to go ranged.
---
Nah, make diluted instead, you get 4 out of 1 stim and with some perk they are quite potent, and you waste less.
---
&gt;Yeah, that's a bit much but remember you're paying 40 caps for 2.3 stimpacks versus ~80 caps for a single stimpack.
---
I usually sell them for far less but any given time there should be players selling stims 5-10 caps a piece. 10 caps is quite common price so paying 40 for just blood pack is not sensible.
---
Don't think I've ever had him just stand there.  Any idea if his dmg is worthwhile?
---
Been playing since BETA on PS4 and I'll say that it's definitely improved, however it isn't perfect.  Bugs and griefers do exist and servers aren't always stable, but if you can get some friends together it can be one of the funnest games you've ever played in my opinion.  I don't play much solo anymore but my character is pretty much meant for group play, you can totally play the game solo and still have fun, and the story and lore are there if you're okay with listening to holotapes and reading notes.  However, if you're looking for a purely solo player experience with meaningful, human NPCs, I'd say the game isn't for you, and there's nothing wrong with that.  It's different from the other Fallout games, but it's still a good game, just not perfect.  I play the game almost every day because I enjoy it so much so I suggest picking up a copy if you're interested and can afford it in case you aren't thrilled.  But in the end, I'm just some woman on Reddit who enjoys the game, so my opinion is biased.
---
You're closed minded scum who duped and covered your tracks and all you want is upvotes I don't care what you think my friends are good people the game was in a horrible state .
---
I’m cool with fighting and PVP as a feature of the game.   The problem is you still have folks running gear and weapons that were duped and pulling the stealthy snipe move when you aren’t looking for a fight.  I get it when going after enemies but 1 shotting someone a mile away unprovoked isn’t PVP it’s lame and a punk move. 
---
Go to night classes and do homework for medical billing and coding...and think about what I'm gonna do when I get back on 76
---
Im sure most people have seen it, if they bothered to often check their junk component view.
---
Levels don't mean anything. I witnessed a lv16 take revenge on a lv242 yesterday. 
---
My camp looks similar.
---
When you fast travel there without PA, you spawn in the air and fall to your death.
---
Thanks for the comments. That said I think I want GTA like statistics, miles walked lol. How many stims,  chess consumed etc. 
---
I'm a bit analysis really I guess. 
---
No such thing as T51b Ultracite power armor. You're wanting to trade someone your Ultracite power armor for T51b power armor
---
Since they're just about giving it away, go for it. It's pretty fun, but it's definitely a work in progress, and you'll get something that feels reminiscent of other Fallout games, but is definitely a departure from the usual format. 
---
I just open one.  I feel like if I don't, I will miss something magical.  I can't open all because I will feel dumb expecting something different.  I also like to think there was something magical happening and I just picked the wrong door.
---
X01 you buy from MODUS in the armory at the Enclave bunker. You get Ultracite mods by fighting the SBQ, she drops plans for the mods, so you'll have to make the mods yourself after learning them
---
I run PA most of the time but to your point I’ll be capped before I ever hit the guy.  The only way to counter an assassins/sentinel build is a similar build.  
---
Seems a bit mutated too?!
---
Vindictive moves like this would still require effort from bethesda. I'd rather have Bethesda focusing on one, good version of the game. No point in wasting more time and resources on banned players.
---
I never thought it was a bad game, to be honest - just one that was very, very rough around the edges.  
---
For the price you can get a second hand copy off eBay now (really - like the price of a fancy coffee) I'd say it's well worth giving it a go :)
---
You know that really grinds my gears.
---
I got bashed to hell when I made a post about this a few weeks ago, suuuuuper fun. But it got Bethesda's attention, and a community manager replied stating that they were going to look into the various opinions. Now they're going to start adding in no build zones, hopefully behind the golf club and Charleston train station are the first two!!
---
Side note: I have lost many caps by leveling camps behind the golf club. Good to see other people do the same.
---
I'm sorry, 595 carry weight? Hows he managed that? 
---
I was, and I suppose still am, in the same position. Lvl 38 and camped in Morgantown.
---
I'm actually just using it as a 'refresh and resupply' stage. Moving around the town and surrounding area, capturing a few workshops, gathering materials and ammo.
---
I find I'm just stressing less about making progression and enjoying being a fallout slacker :)
---
Yeah, i reacted about the same when i learned we can pickup the camp device and move it without affecting camp border.
---
Days actually do progress while you play. It's just that every server starts on October 23 when the server starts up.
---
I had an item I didn't want to scrap too. Put it in my stash and sometime when building it was used and destroyed.. I want that option too! 
---
ok thank you very much!
---
At my local Kmart,Target etc it goes for an averge of $35-$45 AUS. Is it worth that price?
---
Not a problem, if you decide to get it I hope you enjoy, new content will start releasing this week as well and the current road map shows that they plan to continue updating the game with new content.
---
Then want one to say i don't speak english.
---
Yeah, that's right. I don't. The voice in my head (my own voice) seem able to, but when i try to do it out loud, only words comming out are in my first language. I could also have trouble with prononciation of a few things like verb ending in "ed".
---
False
---
Are you on console platform? I rarely see people just standing still during SBQ fight (on PC platform), everyone is actively chasing the SBQ or killing adds. But lately I noticed that I keep getting 2x 3 star legendaries weapon / armor from killing SBQ.  Haven't got a drill / syringer from her (yet lol)
---
Happy cake day!
---
I found a Radstag that gave me and my teammates Brahmin meat ;) and he was just a few feet away from the dead, traveling salesman ( deathclaw)  I wonder what that deathclaw sells when he’s alive 😀
---
I have been claiming workshops since the start of my alts. It is a great way to farm plans. I will pvp with anyone that comes along and wants to pvp. 
---
Rarely does anyone counter-claim a workshop
---
Most players are not pvp spec. 
---
It surprises players when a level 25 can kill a level 60. Workshops are one of the best parts of the game and don’t need changing. If someone blows up my crappy meth lab...oh well
---
Following for further information
---
This could easily be incorporated within fallouts art style as well with an old fashioned theatre microphone with a yellow “?” In the corner that wobbles, additionally they could add it but with a red “X” to show you do not have a microphone.
---
Bethesda hasn’t really added new  emotes since Christmas tho (although they updated those ones with a snowflake effect) , so hopefully that suggests they are looking into emotes more as of late, but I honestly do not have much hope for it
---
Wut?
---
Lol, no.
---
To be honest, all these communication issues would be solved IF Bethesda would just add text chat since the day 1. I turned off my voice chat within a week after the release date. Cus I don't wanna hear people's mouse / keyboard clicks, or the background TV / movies, the worst is when I can hear people breathing or munching their food lol.
---
One night I heard this kid got yelled by his dad to get off his computer and start doing his homework, and then this kid started to yell each other with his dad.
---
This is the part that kinda worries me, I've never crafted that much in 30 days but if I spent more time farming, with Ammosmith and Super Duper it wouldn't be too hard I'd imagine, and I'm not going to track every bullet I make, ultimately I don't see why having so much of an ammo should alarm the devs, considering how quickly some guns can chew through ammo.  Maybe I'm just being too cautious but it seems like a terrible idea to track ammo like that.
---
Well I bought it at some stupid price, like £45 or something! I hate recommending things to folks in case they don't like them.
---
All I can say is that I'm still enjoying the game. I like exploring, building my C.A.M.P. over and over and over again, capturing the occasional workshop and doing the occasional event.
---
If you can find it second hand for less than $20 I'd say buy it in a heartbeat. More than that would be up to yourself :)
---
Legendary Adolf Hitler will rule the wasteland!!!!
---
After 50 levels are completely irrelevant other than the time they spent acquiring gear. If you're trading a lot, then that makes that moot. 
---
My alt is level 45 now and has taken several 100+ guys with one shot kills. Gear and build make all the difference. Against power armor, he uses a lvl 20 AA rifle. 
---
Pretty much! I hoard ammo but I immediately scrapped the rifle. The damage to weight ratio is way off on those things. I'll keep my combat rifle. 
---
You might be interested by this litttle story i posted elsewhere :
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/azldpk/although_ive_been_enjoying_the_game_a_lot_other/ei9glld/?context=3
---
That happened some hours ago.
---
It's in a house just south of the nuka cola factory right next to the river. 
---
I’m hoping this includes the larger C.A.M.P budget, what day is this update coming?
---
Doesn't the built in trading system save you from getting scammed?
---
The key word is tasteful.
---
Same here, Canada 
---
Have you got a link where you heard this from? 
---
For me he shows up, shoots a little, does minimal damage and despawns quickly, leaving me alone with the same mobs. 
---
I think it was in an inside the vault. I’m at work currently and can’t check the Bethesda site because it’s horrible/unusable on mobile 
---
Can this be done by placing the *camp machine* on the second floor that you build?
---
I like to leave a beer and some blamco mac n cheese.  Sometimes it just toilet paper.  Usually its on the bed.  Especially if the host is nice and inviting.  Otherwise it's chalk or an empty bottle of wine.
---
So the next time you level up but a point I tot he perk you want. But THEN before choosing the perk CARD you can switch the category with bumpers and choose a card in another section
---
Hi, have you alerted the Market admins yet to try to apply to have him blacklisted and removed from future posting? If not I suggest you do so, provide viable proof of an attempted scam, scam or suspicious activity and let the admins do the rest, thank you for the lookout and consideration of others within the community.
---
It can also be one of the funnest games if you don't get friends together. That sounds like you need to know some people who play it, too. 
---
You don't! I've played it mostly alone so far. The fact that there are no human NPCs doesn't mean you can't have a solo player experience. To be honest, I can't quite understand this line of reasoning. It's not single player, there will always be other players in your world, but you can play it solo and you can chose if you wanna engage with those other players or not.
---
I have now close to 300 hours in, and I consider the 60 EUR I paied for it a good investement. The game is much cheaper now, and I would say it's worth it, pretty sure you'll get an approbirate amount of entertainment out of it.
---
I see I’m not the only one, lol 😂
---
I paid full price on the release date and I do not regret my purchase. With the upcoming roadmap updates the game will only get better.
---
Congratulations, you've made a Lookout Tower. Haha
---
It’s not dlc, it’s a couple new drink recipes. It’s not exactly new content 
---
I was level 42 right. And this level 5 comes up and starts lighting me up. I just ignore it but he follows back to my base. I have a level 3 lock so I just shut the door but then he tries breaking it down so I went out and one shot him. He has the audacity to seek revenge. But I have middle turrets so they destroyed him.
---
Good to know, but the character I was on had just turned level 12. They were probably a bit much for me to take with my level 10 pipe revolver.
---
What platform 
---
It does yes, but people can be gullible and naive, and it’s those people who are hurt the most by scammers.
---
This is the basis of how most scams operate in the world as well, scammers target the inexperienced and ill-informed and feed off their misfortune.
---
So I am leveling up different stats without realizing it?
---
Mick Fucken Taylor. That guy is a top notch creeper man. 
---
Do you think when we can prestige/ turn legendary, do you think when we die from PvP we will drop legendary weapons?
---
Yeah.
---
That's amazing, I hope I never find myself in within those locked doors with Sickleman
---
PC :) 
---
I wanted pink kitty armor for my melee monster. Kind of hoped for it for Valentines, but alas, it was not to be.
---
Ignore the party *poopers*.
---
I didn't want to have to resort to that but why the hell not I'll try that out thanks
---
Pre ordered, played since beta, paid full price.
---
Still playing, and still enjoying it's become much more stable then day one and while some bugs do still exist it's constantly getting better. The release of the roadmap is very promising, so even at a discounted price the game is worth it, imho.
---
I can't believe this. I've been frustrated for some long that I had to build around this object, making me unable to utilise the middle of the build area.
---
FML
---
Oh ya! I forgot about all the level 14 mole miners down there that would be perfect 
---
There's a sort of respect system starting at lvl 50. Might help.
---
It does. Flashes 12:00 with power near it.
---
I feel that! I like to play slower and enjoy it too but there's a huge portion of the map that I want to explore but can't and it's making me kinda mad
---
This is so batshit insane that it might just work....
---
PC; in europe; All i get to hear is people speaking in russian.... That last SBQ raid was from last night. Used all those .50 cal shells on adds. 308 was just for the Scorched beasts. 
---
People were just sitting on top of that shed near the bunker...
---
I think the fact you have to seriously invest in perks for ranged weapons is what bugs me. I have no perks for melee weapons, but my sledgehammer still wipes out enemies in two~ hits, even when they're ten levels higher than me.
---
Another thing to mention is that I'm only level 46, I consider that to be high, but that's in comparison to the other games, where I usually never got to be higher than level 60, so 46 is 'nearing the end' in my experience. I have no idea what _actual_ high level combat is like, as my biggest threats are level 69 bloated glowing ones spamming their lunge attacks.
---
I just feel like a submachine gun spewing 100 bullets in the span of five seconds should be at least equal to a sledgehammer with some spiky bits chained on. I let emotions cloud my opinion, with my initial comment.
---
It doesn't neee power even, I think. What I meant was that I hoped it would show the actual ingame time instead of flashing 12.00.
---
I mean it's an interesting idea for punishing cheaters. Don't just make them play with other cheaters, make them play on a shitty build of the game too. 
---
You either get them from the overseers cache in Morgantown airport during the main quest, or by doing the quest "tentative plans" for the responders, also at Morgantown airport.
---
I am not sure which one, but it is from one of those
---
Your always going to have people doing that. They're the same type of players who turret camp at whitespring. You'll also find them hanging outside the windows at whitespring tagging glowing ones while everyone else kills the mob.
---
They don't deserve shit but because of the way enemy tagging works there isn't anything we can do about it. If they try and change the tagging system someone who actually puts work in may not get loot. 
---
There will always be garbage players getting loot in cheap ass ways. 
---
You're mistaken. They have never said there is any change to the current respec options coming with the next update
---
I have a mule for my brother on my account and he has a mule for me. It's easy when you have someone you can trust. If I need to dump some stuff or get something from my mule I just call him and have him log on with my mule.
---
Now you too can help others by telling them. :-D
---
I can feel the damage output dropping if i forget to re-equip my perks after crafting stuff, so the necessity to fully dedicate yourself to a ranged build could be what puts people away.
---
I'm only using single-shot rifles, no autos, but with all perks equiped my quad lvl 35 lever action rifle can easily kill whitesprings ghouls in 1 shot. It's quite satisfying too. 
---
Vats does all the work, i just sit there clicking and waiting for vats to switch to another target. 
---
Bloated glowing ones from nuke zones may take 2 shots, they're pretty beefy in terms of HP. The regular one in Whitesprings golf club is a weakling.
---
To reply to your last bit, the system has been out for a decent amount of time now and I guarantee changes has been made to it since it first became a thing, hence it is perfectly possible he got banned for droptrading but you wouldn’t if you tried it today.
---
This is also bethesda we’re talking about. We can look at a number of ‘fixes’ to almost anything and see that thier methods are some of the worst I could ever imagine. For example, after duping became an issue and everyone started running around with TSE weapons, they make an outrageously massive nerf to ALL explosives in the game, affecting even heavy weapons which were already laughably unbalanced by their low damage. Another example would be the auto greande launcher recieving a buff from the heavy gunner perk. Their fix was to make it no longer class as heavy, hence no longer gain effect by other perks such as weight reduction. I could go on about several others, but the point is, they aren’t fixing problems. They look for ways to get around them which in turn causes major issues elsewhere.
---
Keeping it in mind that their method of problem ‘solving’ is awful, it is perfectly possible that in the beginning they did not account for potential drop trading as it’s not “officially intended” to trade that way, and most dupe methods involved picking up large amounts of items from containers/bags. Possibly, they simply followed their usual problem solving path and triggered it exactly the same way. Picking stuff up.
---
I’m only speculating, but it seems perfectly possible to me.
---
And why?
---
Who was giving it away? I went to gamestop yesterday they said they had it for $40 online I get there they wouldnt sell it for that. So I just bought it from official site for $60. 
---
https://youtu.be/FshkO8HqQ10
---
Get some bloodied weapons this sounds like a good thing to me.
---
Were you on a team and someone in it wasn't in pacifist mode?
---
Yeah. I agree. And bring the dual system with that.
---
There were copies being given away with purchase of a PS4 memory stick, and dirt cheap with bundles. Just keep an eye out for a good deal. 
---
Not really. It's just brewing.
---
It's like an hour of content for consumables that nobody even uses anyway because people already one shot everything with their two shot explosives.
---
I was with one other person and I don’t know if they were or not. Good question.
---
Why does it say 12am when the rest of the clocks show 9:45?? Weird right?
---
Not sure if you are being sarcastic or not :) I had the same problem from my mid thirties and upwards. The quests were too hard and involving a lot of high level super mutants. I ran around ash heap for a while and starting visiting whitespring when I hit lvl40ish. 
---
So do I. I'm on 799 outta 800. I don't want to just chuck it away...
---
Let's talk Chems, my good man. What do you say about some Psychobuff for ten caps? Maybe some Day-Tripper? "Happiness in a bottle", as they say. Rad-X, maybe? I have plenty of that.
---
T-shirts? Want a top hat? I'll sell you the clothes off my back, if you want, just please end my suffering--
---
Er... The customer is always right. If you don't want to peruse my wares, then that's fine and dandy, fella
---
Thank you guns, i think i misunderstood this here
---
An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Oh damn I am on pc. Forgot to mention. Owell 60 wasnt too bad I like it. 
---
You don't play this game I assume. In a trade you offer both items up for zero caps. Super risky
---
While that is true, given that spanish keyboard also use QWERTY, thats not reason to disregard gaming communities in other countries by not giving us a choice. Germany is the fith biggest gaming market worldwide, not counting other German speaking countries.
---
Why can't I change keyboard bindings for that? You can do it for actions not connected with settlement building. That's ridiculous. Why can't you change your Pip-boy color or other things that make the game more accessible for visually impaired players?
---
Those are little things, and you might say those are not that important (at least if your vision is good and you have an english keyboard). But I say, those little things can't be that complicated to put in, unless you don't care about certain customer groups.
---
No matter how much I enjoy playing the game, things like that make me a little mad.
---
My last camp was pretty great, i was kinda proud. But then i wanted to change things a bit so that my generator don't get destroyed so often. I ended having to tear it down entirely and there a bug with several parts that i can't remove because "the structure will be inacessible", even so after removing everything else thoses part now float above ground.
---
I only have one screenshot of what it looked like over there : https://xboxdvr.com/gamer/lechattricote/screenshot/11699089
---
It sit on each side of the river, north of Morgantown, south of dam. It's in free access except for a private room where i have a bed and the camp device wich i can use to access stash.
---
It's been a habit all the way since fallout 3. If you've been with the series for that long then I'd be surprised if you haven't developed some kind of mental conditioning by now
---
Well, if you're taking the workshop in your 3 man group with full x-01 jetpacks and fully automatic explosive weapons so that the defending player literally can't fight back in any way whatsoever then you ARE a piece of shit.
---
How do you make walls at 45 degrees?
---
Finding spawned armor pieces to complete a set will require many hours of effort. Buy the base assembly plan from the BOS vendor in Watoga or ask someone who already has the plans to build a set for you.
---
👍
---
Sounds like it will basically function as a respec, but you gotta do some work again afterwards.
---
If you take the right perks guns do a lot of damage. Research perks you need for your build and you can do a lot of damage. I may not speak for everyone but I'm sick of nerfs. They're just a knee jerk reation to people whining on reddit and hurt the game. I've never had a TSE and I think they went too far with the nerfs.
---
PvP is just a small part of this game most players don't waste time with it. There is no actual reward for killing another player. Just junk if you choose to take it.
---
That guy won’t PVP only wants to kill people who don’t fight back doesn’t want to play against people who will fight back
---
Watoga is the best and the bases in the Cranberry Bog are the best. They will spawn randomly on any suit of armor. It does take a while.
---
Purified water is too clean
---
Boiled water still has some grit in it
---
Adds crunch and an earthy tone to the soup.
---
Psh, a _real_ wasteland culinary artist knows this.
---
I've never been one-shotted while on a team, but maybe that's the problem. It must be a PvP team mechanic?
---
I definitely need pacifist mode on when spraying a hail of 50 cal bullets into a crowd of bloated glowing ones lol, easiest way to tag enemies.
---
Nice, that's where my camp is. Also I think you mean the brahmin that walk on water until you get close enough. 
---
Hell, I’d be happy with each complete set giving some bonus, similar to the excavator armor mining buff.
---
I already have a place to put the new crafting station! So excited!!!
---
Wait. There are two new stations?!
---
Change your layout. I play on PS4 so IDK if this will help 
---
https://youtu.be/7RUoOhwjhcU 
---
That just means you have to always be drinking!
---
Sadly, the generator noise is what attrack monsters. 
---
Preach it bro
---
  I think that's a friend of mine, they're at least in the same spot anyway, lemme check and get back to you.
---
Uggggh the updates always happen on my only day off 😭🤣
---
I work in IT (NOT tech support), when not fixing (messing up) servers/routers. I think of fallout. Course now I get 2 weeks paid vacation (conference) with no laptop. SML
---
i will ask him for some shrimp on the barbie if i found him 
---
So excited!
---
Why are you here then? Flying the flag for the cheaters? Don't understand, if you're not playing the game, why do you give a hoot?
---
I’ve been seriously debating returning to the game lately. I haven’t played since week 3 or 4, so I feel like I won’t even know what’s going on anymore. Also I’m worried about bugs. 
---
I do get the feeling I should be 'getting out there' more often, but I think I'm going to just keep on working away at getting materials, scrapping, unlocking all the mods for all the weapons I want and then heading out into the slightly scarier areas of the world :)
---
It's all for the flavor 
---
I'm almost level 90 ... and not done with the main quest line. There's still ~20% of the map I haven't seen. And that's because I always have to see EVERYTHING. Is that a tent over there? did I check EVERY room in this basement? did I get on the roof? Gotta' see it all.  
---
I've taken a picture of every dead vault dweller I've found. There's a lot!
---
OK.
---
Not atom store per se, as I bough the tricentennial edition of the game - paint was "included" but .... ok.  
---
Would have been nice if the dialog specified the problem was the paint.
---
Now I know.
---
Thx :)
---
Laser weapons seem to do the trick for me early on, then armour piercing mods on any ballistic guns help
---
TiL and that really sucks. 
---
There are a lot of fusion cores to be found in the game. 
---
I understand the risks involved wirh this venture and willinf take take them thank you first lettinf me know 
---
While I rarely engage in PvP at workshops when I do it’s more annoying and geared for whoever has the most time. Every time you succeed in defending your workshop it’s still a waste for the players who just keep selecting revenge. There needs to be like a cooldown if you attack and lose then you shouldn’t be able to attack the same workshop over and over till the defender quits.
---
I think additional tiered rewards for the 3 players that dealt the most damage would be brilliant. It would reward those that focus on the SB/SBQ and provide an incentive to those that don’t. 
---
It's hard to tell, because someone in the server may have picked up what you're looking for before you joined.
---
Yeah I smile and think what a clever idea when I see those giant spikes
---
It runs around in pacifist mode and doesn't get a wanted rating or else it gets the hose again.
---
Ok. I had just picked up the core and was wondering when to grab the next one if I were to keep coming back. 
---
For real! I need more cloth for hats! Easiest way to make money from vendors in the game.
---
Watoga has four sets of power armor that spawn:
---
- One near the crashed Vertibird
---
- One on top of the high school
---
- One on top of the civic center
---
- One at the transportation center behind a level 3 door.
---
Check to see if they have the pieces, reload, repeat.
---
I got my 51 and 60 doing that.
---
Did you get banned? ahaha
---
There are several spots in and around Watoga and the BoS bases/stations nearby. Server hop and check each spot and you’ll have a set in no time. 
---
I have collected 2 complete sets of T51 just revisiting the various PA spawn points   
---
around the Forest.
---
My group likes to leave surprises around each other’s bases. It’s pretty funny all the places you can stash a toilet, poster, or a party standee. My personal favorite was coming home to the toilet surrounded by a ring of campfires on my roof. 
---
IT's been months since I've logged in so I assume quite a bit will be new to me. 
---
I don't advise this method I've had players steal from my bag when I did this. Same guy twice stole junk from me during a transfer first time I thought it was the game bugging second time I caught him.
---
Considering the advert for the alarm clock even said "never be late again" I was hoping I'd be able to get a real time clock or in game clock.
---
What I got was flashing 12:00...
---
There is fusion cores everywhere, no need to farm one location, and it might get taken by someone else before you get there. Items outside  boxes, chests , lock boxes etc is shared by everyone 
---
All I know is I've seen no nukes in the last 3 days, been alone on a server on Friday, and ended up helping a level 4 last night for some fun....
---
Tahiti!
---
Ya, that would be nice.  Not just the scrap all, but during any scap operation.
---
I accidentally scrapped my favorite outfit over the weekend.
---
Been playing for a couple months, the one I had was the only one I'd ever seen.... argh.
---
  
---
If they can flag legendaries to not show in the list during scrapping, should not be terribly difficult to add that field to other items.
---
Because Zombieland. 
---
Do they spawn as level 45-50 pieces ? I was looking for raider armor and when I checked lower level places they where low level pieces. 
---
But eventually got the set from cranberry bog
---
I play it, I just don't trade with others. 
---
Just make them start again from level 1 and delete their 'Duping' characters
---
Bull-fucking-shit
---
Yeah man I feel the same. Every time I sneak up to a stroller  I'm always disappointed it's not loaded with explosives. That trap in fo3 was one thing that has always stuck with me when thinking of fallout. 
---
Same. It's tiny and pointless.
---
Sure any time you shoot anything, it will go caution;  its automatic.  
---
But you can actually kill it before it it turns to Danger.   It will stay in caution for a long time on Sneak 3.  There is lower chance of the thing actually hitting you too.  I think its spammed attacks hit me maybe every 30 seconds.   Which is a long time considering what it normally does.
---
why are you still concerned about the players that are banned?
---
I'm looking forward to this week's DLC very much. It's called The Division 2. Can hardly wait.
---
I wonder how much you’ve missed in the game in your rush for shiny things.
---
Tomorrow 
---
There is a specific variable that one can use in conditions aptly named 'IsSprinting'.
---
In the case in hand the value has to be '1' (True) for the damage mitigation to apply.
---
Walking/Running/Being staggered does not trigger the damage mitigation, only sprinting does.
---
So it’s worthless
---
People have been poisoning other people's minds about how building a CAMP at WS makes you a griefer, and that it's everyone's sacred duty to demolish these CAMPs.
---
Of course plenty take this far to literal and believe that they are the good and Noble heroes, and you were the slimey scum as they tore down your base.
---
Sry to pop this bubble for you but quantities don't exactly affect the game if they're not actually animated... like, at all. From a coding standpoint it's just a few digits more or less.
---
95% of the playerbase just left after the first few weeks... less server trafic, better performance. Pretty logical no?
---
&gt; If you’re anything like me there is a documentary called ‘into eternity’ which talks about the problem posed by the disposal of nuclear waste
---
For those interested the documentary [Into Eternity](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1194612/) is based on the [ONKALO](http://www.posiva.fi/loppusijoitus/onkalo) ("onkalo" is a Finnish word, meaning a pit or a cavity of some kind) -project by Posiva in Finland (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Onkalo_spent_nuclear_fuel_repository), which is planned as a final repository for nuclear waste, and the time frame of 100 thousand years *has* been thrown around concerning the place, although, as with everything, there have been some critics of the project who have questioned those kinds of time frames.
---
In any case, I just noticed the thread title and immediately thought about this project, so I thought I'd give some links for anyone interested.
---
Many weeks ago, with the help of a few friends, we crafted an enormous amount of Diluted Stimpaks, This was done using both gathered &amp; crafted Stimpaks and Water collected from each of us having 6 Industrial water purifiers.
---
I ended up with over 32k Diluted Stimpaks on one character, and although the character is over the weight limit &amp; unable to trade, the account has not been banned, and nothing was removed.
---
I know players who were banned, and deserved it, as they were directly involved in duping activities, I also know a player who was banned after picking up a large quantity of duped items, and then reporting it to Bethesda.
---
So, based on what I know to be factual, I would say 99% of those who have been banned, deserved it, but I also believe a few have been banned inappropriately, and many others escaped being banned only by limiting their duping or disposing of the loot before they got caught.
---
No, not worthless at all.
---
It just encourages a different playstyle to maximize its benefits.
---
And every time I think “maybe I’ll jump in again” I read these things.
---
In my opinion, I get Gun Fu (At least rank 1, not sure any more ranks).
---
This is a QOL thing really, but it auto switches targets after 1 dies.  You still need to pause for a second after switch.... but it has actually turned me a completely different direction that I was unaware a mob was there.  So you have to learn a bit to use it, like don't fire right away after change.  
---
Also perks like Grim Repear, goes well with Gun Fu...
---
the Luck perk that gives chances of refilling AP,
---
Luck perk that increases crit
---
Luck perk that uses less AP per crit
---
The perks that increase damage when stealthed/silenced
---
This is such a tiny and pointless request. You want them to spend dozens of hours trying to figure out how to do this for what reason exactly?
---
I could possibly have done it lower, but instead of waiting for 4 Leader of the pack I did 6 kills from scorchebeasts (I tagged and teammate killed) the highest XP I saw was going from the start of the Senators Bunker to entering Whitesprings for the first time jumped me from 3 to 7 just from the initial quest finishing.
---
Mouth organs?
---
Thank you for doing the leg work. I should have included this in the post.
---
I ran into one yesterday when in was in the hills next to white powder winter sports. It kept disappearing and reappearing closer to me.
---
Every time his health reached halfway he would just regen back to full health, I just ran away.
---
It's right 2x a day - just like my wife says I am....
---
So PvP still a broken mess then?....shame as I was thinking of redownloading the game
---
Its based off your initial drop of the camp so there would be no second floor to put it on so no.
---
You can farm FC's at power plant workshops.
---
Not sure what a tmod is sorry not very game savi.  I have not saved my perk points that I know of.  I pick every time and did my best to fill with what I thought I needed before 50, hope I did it right.  
---
Clearly I didn't 😁. Thanks for clearing it up. Apologies to the OP.
---
Have someone you can trust. Go somewhere with low traffic. Place your stuff in something, log back in with your other character, join your friend, grab your stuff. Done.
---
Finding people to play with is easy, finding someone you can trust a little harder. The more you play with someone the better you'll get to know them. They may need to do it for their character too.
---
RC
---
Text chat really only helps pic though.  Typing on a console pad is slow compared To pc.   Not that it matters to me either way.      I hope they do it soon , so that I stop hearing these request actually LOL. :) 
---
Retired Army but couldn't stay away so went back to Army as a civilian contractor.  
---
*checks username* wow I guess I didn’t say it afterall
---
I mean, if you read the inside the vault 2 weeks ago, they won't
---
I give them a week till pirates take over that ship.
---
So in order to use this to the fullest I should do a full ap build. So I can sprint as much as needed. During a fight I sprint when under attack and turn back to shoot... nah
---
Head over to whitesprings and start outfitting yourself with some legendaries. Look for mole miners and super mutants, they're both good sources of xp. Do events. Check out uranium fever. It'll be tough at your level but not impossible, especially if there's other players doing it to.
---
The thing I’m confused about is that some games say something then it could work for something else either. For example “reduce damage while sprinting” they mean jogging. Just an example that some games do cos they’re kinda dumb. 
---
Drops a hallucinagen gas canister when killed
---
I would think you would melee with a swing speed weapon and just run around hacking like crazy
---
Go up north, get high up and look directly south over the golf course, you'll see the crater.  
---
This!  I'm stockpiling toilet paper.  I know it's not uncommon but they aren't making any more and when it becomes scarce, I will be the richest man in the wasteland!
---
As a beta player for Xbox one....its meh...exploring with friends is fun though, missions are abit lacking in excitement but lots of lore building....PVP is a broken pile of shit though
---
Thank you
---
How I would play it is just shoot and move around normally. The second they shoot I sprint behind something, reload, then get back in, the second I take damage I sprint behind something. Maneuver build. But nah, cos I don’t wanna invest points into ap regen, cost etc. I play shooter games so I move around when I shoot, crouch, jump, walk, all 3 at once. Need a build for that...
---
All armor outside of PA is squishy, PA has an inherit ability to adsorb damage, esp ballistic rounds, I've been screaming this for months with no reply from Bethesda.    
---
 Following the quests will give you a relatively safe/appropriately scaled difficulty route to build your levels, and give you the background and items for some of the other stuff towards the end game.
---
  I got distracted early and haven't been following the main quest points in anything that resembles an order.  That's made the story line incomplee and out of order.
---
  Random exploration has taken me places lower levels should probably not go (thus making some things more difficult than they should have been)
---
Even though there are weapons/tinker/armor/chem/weapons benches scattered around the map, there are few places where all are in one place.  Ditto the resources (water, etc)
---
Your camp will give you a relatively safe place/home base whee you can have all those things in one place....where you can rest and recoup, grow food, make things you'll need (like adhesive), etc.
---
Raid and rob: tends to irritate some people, and may put a bounty on your head ... and someone will collect that bounty ... (at which point, you die) 
---
Oh my lawd, how in the world are we this far past release and a ton of people in these comments don't know about challenges? Like, it's right at the begining of the game and explains how you can earn ATOMS in game... Also, Leaderboards are coming with the PVP update already as explained per Bethesda when they announced it. 
---
I have that problem as well but you really know what sux?  when your level 257 and you didn't get the Lvl 50 achievement.  
---
Yeah, that would be a square peg/round hole scenario.
---
Cavalier is more of a slap n' dash playstyle.
---
I like to drop the i o u beer notes on people's camps 
---
I have started dropping "A token of my appreciation". In every bag of goodies.
---
Found a use for those tokens at the Whitesprings maintenance facility, that I was obsessively collecting ;)
---
Or dropped... Or sold...
---
I  was there yesterday and the Monorail Elevator to me looks inspired by the Falkirk Wheel in Scotland.  I have not seen it in person, but planning a trip this Summer.  Here is a time lapse of how it works: [https://youtu.be/ucg1O-5jsnM](https://youtu.be/ucg1O-5jsnM)  I had searched to see if anyone else had noticed the similarity.
---
It was what the Ultracite spawned that did the damage.
---
Haha Holocaust jokes, amirite?
---
Alright, thx for explaining.
---
I ran into this person before. Said he was a traveling merchant and wanted to trade items 1:1. I was suspicious so I turned him down. Followed him around for a bit and then watched him and some of his buddies destroy CAMPs. Go figure. He has been banned on some discord trading servers as well. 
---
Auto mechanic. Constantly trying to figure out how to make my own pipe rifle
---
Because a lvl 102 should be an even match for a lvl 35
---
Why do I feel like if everyone focused on the SBQ he would complain about people not clearing the mobs? 
---
Around 16:00 UTC ok?
---
I think you're likely right, but I'd rather see Bethesda (or any other developer) make frequent small changes to get to the right fix, rather than changing too many things at once. 
---
If durability is fixed, and players still don't use energy weapons for more than a week, that should be a strong signal. 
---
I hope that is the case. I also wonder if they'll just eventually release another legendary modifier for energy defense... Im already wondering what they plan to do with the legacy explosive energy weapons.
---
Go to the crashed Vertibird in Watoga and serverhop a few times. I got mine in like 5 minutes ...
---
"thumb down"
---
Nah, it's more for melee users to ensure they make it over to their target
---
Read my other comment. Had to use.50 cal on mobs because they really weren't clearing shit. 
---
Because boiled water is hot. Who likes cold soup?
---
(You are looking for Bumble's pee.)[http://imgur.com/a/gyM0fUZ]

Go into pip boy and manually turn them on.
---
Given how many updates I ended up doing, I’m not surprised people didn’t see it all, no worries! 
---
Yes i have done that, thanks anyways

Here you go.

https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/1vtgqSxLlbipZyHOA19tT5/inside-the-vault-wild-appalachia-preview-brewing-and-distilling
---
ok, will try that, thanks for the help!
---
So if they don't have ultricite or TSE weapons they not aloud to go to SBQ area is what your saying
---
[Or maybe you are looking for something more. A more hardcore Fallout experience.](http://i.imgur.com/a/gyM0fUZ.jpg)
---
Doesn't give me the option
---
Ahh, so you prepare it like ramen! It all makes sense now!
---
Umm...why?  You need an alarm to get up for work or to watch the big game?  
---
You're so dense...
---
All I'm asking is for them to actually shoot or hit the damn boss. I don't care what kind of ammo they're using. I just want people to actually help with the fight.
---
If they're under leveled they can just kill adds but these guys weren't even doing that 
---
I am very much looking forward to it. 
---
I read it somewhere they're gonna decrease of the sizes of turrets and some other things in C.A.M.P., so that we'll have more free space in current budget in coming patch. So we can hope for it;)
---
Why jump around if people can vats you?
---
Cos call of duty
---
cheers lol
---
Because for newies find purified water is harder than boiled water

It'll be just like real life Appalachia!

If the countries responsible for producing these dangerous waste materials were to work together in order to find a common solution to a common problem - instead of retaining this totally archaic, unsustainable and inefficient notion of nationalism - we would already be launching barrel after barrel of green glowing goo straight into the sun, thus getting rid of it once and for all instead of leaving a 100,000 year legacy of pollution to countless future generations.
---
On a side note: If this massive scale of global cooperation was a thing, by now we would also have achieved a 100% coverage of basically free renewable energy, we would have conquered famine, we could make sure that no longer 13,000 children would have to die every day due to preventable diseases and our society could be on the verge of total automation in manufacture and transportation. Hell, we'd be exploring Space by now.
---
But, alas, the way things are going, I'm afraid without a global disaster not even two single countries on this planet could ever be enticed to work together as one. 
---
But let's keep the dream alive.
---
Sincerly,

But you craft it on a Cooking Station!

Shld lure the queen to them then hahaha sometimes karma needs a little nudge
---
Stealth boy mostly PS4 btw
---
Griefer?
---
I do dislike camps at whitesprings with turrents. Especially ones that are right outside the clubhouse with guns. They dont get the builder exp a just steal kills and legendaries from other players. 
---
Ones without guns are an asset for quick break down and repairs.
---
Dont use your camp as an extension of your arsenal.
---
When is this patch supposed to be?
---
I've only seen things for the 19th?
---
Ether way, I'm exited for new things 🙂
---
Give this thread a once over and try the settings suggested here. For some reason Bethesda cranked everything way up from FO4 to the point where high/ultra settings are completely unreasonable for even the highest end machines.
---

What system? Somebody nuked the area near the water park yesterday. It was kind of a let-down, though. The only things worth noting were the glowing mirelurk queen and a diseased glowing yao guai.
---
I was thinking about this the other day. The way I'd implement a pet system is I'd make the pet functionally useless initially (bare with me, they get useful eventually). When you first get them they deal no damage and enemies never target them, they are just there for cosmetic purposes. You can role-play with them but you won't feel gimped if you don't want a pet.
---
However I'd also implement perk cards (charisma for animals, intelligence for robots) that buff your pet so that they could have more of a functional usage both during combat and out of combat (stuff like getting you dog to fetch scrap or getting your robot to hack a terminal).
---
This way you satisfy the people who don't want pets, the people who just want a cute dog with them but don't want to change their build, and the people who want to battle all types of enemies with their favourite fluffy companion.
---
I'd also implement a kennel system to leave your pets back at your camp. 
---
Sounds jolly. I must visit real Appalachia while I'm alive, as a big fan of the FO franchise.
---
Tons of snallys in the Toxic region on the N-NE edges.

There is a hunters cabin in the Myre which activates a side quest where you have to follow clues and investigate all these. This being active should give you locations and guarantee a few spawns.

Funny thing was on r\gaming they were complaining about this same thing in Skyrim last night.
---
PC.
---
I've still not launched a nuke (don't have the time to commit now), but was hoping to have a full server this weekend - argh....
---
Cheers I'll keep this in mind, ty for the info
---
I'm looking forward to the bug fixes we won't be getting.
---
People That have stuck with it the whole time are not going to notice the improvement quite so much. I totally agree though. It's miles better than launch. Kinda like evolution, we don't recognize much change at all with each iteration of updates but if you were to go back and play the original, opinions from players would be much different. 
---
Gen 2 is not very different from gen 1. Gen 3 isn't very different from gen 2. But Gen 7/8 is VASTLY different from gen 1. The people that have stuck with the game since launch without break won't appreciate it as much as the person that hasn't played for quite a while. That's where I assume the majority of complaints are coming from now. People that are just unassuming in how much the game actually has improved. 
---
I think the biggest thing about slap damage is that we need to be able to bully people off of servers for community events. It's not an ideal system but there aren't private servers. There's no way to make a server and purposely populate it with only friends so if you want to host an event you gotta clear those server spaces somehow. I'm not saying I want slap damage to stick around, I'm not saying I even like it, I'm saying it's literally the last resort we have to forming large groups and it would be just dandy if it could remain in the game until we have so method of getting 24 people on one server. 
---
Also, this isn't hypothetical. This is real life. Large scale events are planned and do take place in this game if you're not aware. I'm sorry you didn't get the invite, I didn't know you until today, but people forming communities around this game need a way to congregate on the same server. When an event is hosted other players are asked politely to leave, bribed even, bargained with, then as a last resort slapped off the server. It's a shit system but it's practically all we have.
---
Sometimes I hit the jackpot and a rad roach pops....or is it poops out!
---
Had this happen trying to teach people how to farm the queen, first round went off without a hitch but round two this girl accidentally shot another player initiating combat between two teams of four. Before I knew what happened I got sneak attacked in the back of the head tried to get back to my bag and bluescreened. Ended up losing 30+ of each stable Flux from previous queen farming, the moral of the story is make sure you AND your team have pacifist mode on when doing events or queen fights. All it takes is one person and they are all hostile with no repurcussions or bounty. 
---
I disagree. There is plenty to do.
---
It’s a ultracite power armor with the look of a t51b to be exact 
---
Dang. This was on Xbox.
---
They should allow you to hook up a water purifier with a stove for on demand boiled water so I can make fucking soup without hand drawing it.
---
Oh that’s alright! I got the plans now haha. I just wish they had perk load outs, it’d make it easier to switch between my crafting set and my fighting set. 
---
Made L38 this weekend - and have some of the same problem. 
---
If you haven't already done it, clear the toxic valley.
---
You should be able to move along the savage divide, and parts of the ash heap.  
---
Encountered my first deathclaw on the western side of the toxic valley, and my 2nd one in Savage divide.  One kicked my butt, the other I took out.
---
Top of the world can get interesting when a higher level player has been through, and theres a mine camp near top of the world with mole miners - they can be tough.
---
Finding the "right" weapon helps.  
---
  I'm mainly melee, and have some items that'll do 100+ damage per hit - even so, I still cannot get excavator armor b/c I havent been able to ovecome the swarm of mutants inside the buildings lobby.
---
Lewistown took me multiple tries b/c of the number of mutants, and the first time I was there, a L14 Wendigo.....
---
And I got my butt kicked multiple times by 5x L50 supermutants with assault rifles in an unmarked camp near westek.  
---
Or a nearby camp with a glowing wendigo and a couple L68 ghouls.
---
Got saved by nearby players at both of those sites.
---
The mine near whitesprings station has 6 or so glowing mole miners outside that will gang up on you.  That was fun.
---
OTOH, with a vampire machete, T51 PA, and lots of radaway, I survived the post nuke golf course this weekend.
---
After that, it was almost a relief to get back to the forest :)
---
Wendigo Cave has a guaranteed Wendigo spawn but only one I’m pretty sure. 
---
So you're telling me, you want to strap one of the most dangerous waste products known to humankind to the top of tower full of literal explosives and send it hurdling through the atmosphere?
---
Absolutely nothing could go wrong here!
---
Sure I can help. Add me on PSN: R-C-MAN
---
Same icon as here
---
I'm level 90.. I did silo alpha solo yesterday for the first time. Never done a silo before that as thought it would be too hard. Breezed through it but got through a lot of ammo. Nuked fissure prime but could only take a 10th of the SBQ even with explosive bloodied weapons. Again used a ton of ammo... think there was only 4 others there helping but still. Majorly disappointed that she doesn't scale better. I can take a regular SB out if it lands in less than a minute so only getting one down by a 10th after 30 mins is just ridiculously hard.

The official reply to this was start a new character as that's all that can be done, alot of the achievements didn't unlock if you played the beta to official release.
---
I myself have to roll a new character to unlock all beginning achievements.

Bro, you can attach a PC keyboard to both PS4 &amp; X-box. It's as simple as plugging in a USB.

I can not help but laugh my ass off at this post. 
---
Around the crashed vertibird near Holstin Holes (not sure if that’s right. The golf course up north) there’s usually a Grafton monster or a couple snallygasters messing with the super mutants. 
---
I can usually find a sloth in the area of Treehouse village
---
Wendigo cave for obvious reasons, but I’ve only ever found one or two in there, with multitudes of mirelurks and kings along the way
---
Hope this little bit is helpful. Happy hunting!
---
I suggest following the official Bethesda accounts here, and on their own website. You can then have correct information all the time for these kinds of questions. 
---
I don't remember where but in one bathroom stall there was a skeleton with a bunch of empty nuka cola bottles in the stall next to it a nuka cola vending machine. 
---
No one ever said that Scorch Beasts would give amazing loot. 
---
I'm an IT recruiter and have spoken with others who (with a better understanding of databses than I do) who felt that the duping actually *did* have a significant impact. Perhaps because of the way items are tracked. 
---
Quantities of players, on the other hand, would have very little impact, because there's a maximum number of players on each server.  So no your theory, while logical if the game took place entirely one one server, doesn't hold water with respect to this specific game. 
---
There's clearly much more stability now, even when a sever is full, and a queen battle is taking place. 
---
Also, i'd like to see thos statistic regarding the decline of players. I think we have had less players over the past few weeks, but I can't remember not being consistently on full servers every time I logged on before then. 
---
I'm not asking for them to be just as effective as long barrels, but just for them to be effective enough to use at all. Ramp the range down proportionately when a suppressor is used, that's all.
---
Couldn't you just use your mic to ask if they're on mic, or did I just get wooshed.
---
I was thinking about buying a second copy so my partner and I could play at the same time (there is a second PS4 in the house) and I had been looking at discs which seem highly discounted these days.  But I have been kicking myself for not getting a digital copy to start with.  If this goes smoothly for you I will probably buy the digital copy for my machine and put the disc in the other. 
---
You really only need armour for initial protection, useful mods and legendary effects. It really isn't always dictated by just combat. Your build should also be considered. Example would be a mod for robot arms that stabilizes your aim while scoped. Not much use for a melee character, but if you're a sniper deffo consider crafting it.
---
I would, but my camp budget is already maxed out. 
---
True, but why not allow both?
---
Community building?  You are asking people to vacate public servers for your private gangs? 
---
No that’s not community building as I or the dictionary understand it.
---
Finally! someone else knows! I'm from Glasgow and trying to explain this to my US friends was getting old.
---
They've just sorta always been around :) find the angry gnome 
---
So give them a server thats going to be full of meta characters. Sounds more like a blessing than a curse.
---
It's usually two of them, one outside the cave and one in the cave.
---
I will literally grenade any base at the golf club off the face of the wasteland.... 
---
The damage gets calculated correctly and even the enemy HP bar goes down but immediately gets filled back minus the base damage. Sneak sniper build here, with max sneak attack perks, @ night with Mr. Sandman you can really notice it happening.
---
Ty for the info 
---
Well, be glad it's g'not a g'nelf
---
Questions 1,2, and 4 seem to have been answered pretty thoroughly, so I'm just adding my 2 caps to question 2.  If you don't have a lot of turrets then, while in workshop mode, toggled over to the Stored tab and see if you have any items listed there.  Anything stored also takes up camp budget.  I haven't moved my camp in a looooooong time so I'm not sure if this has been patched yet, but there used to be a glitch that would duplicate items in Stored when moving camps.  If you moved enough times, it could destroy your budget rather quickly.  For example, you have 1 turret, then move your camp.  Suddenly there are 2 turrets under stored.  Move again and 2 becomes 4.  Another move and 4 becomes 8, etc.
---
The other day I was trying to see something in the distance and realized I was twitching my left finger to try and activate V.A.T.S.

I feel your pain.

I haven't played in a while so idk. Got sick of trying to manage my inventory 
---
Actually you can tell when someone has a mic and is in game-chat. If you're in a Xbox party you'll see a headset icon with an x beside it indicating that you can't hear/communicate with them when not in game-chat.
---
Although honestly: I couldn't agree more. It's been hell trying to recuirt people for the Brotherhood of Steel Discord group I'm in in-game. Most people are either in party chat or refuse to acknowledge their existence to people who offer help/supplies.
---
Not a statistic but the news are over the place really.

I’ve been on both sides. 
---
As long as I’m not losing progress I don’t mind swapping servers for others to play together and I’ve had friends stuck in the server queue while others were mostly through a solo. The current system doesn’t work for anyone. 
---
The OP is asking for a system to make it so they don’t have to be a jerk to make room for friends. That sounds right to me. 
---
I think one thing people are completely missing, either on purpose or just because.
---
RARE materials. Ammo like Shells aren't rare. Heck, you can get thousands of any give ammo in a few days of playing. And if you have ammosmith and super duper of course it would be possible to craft 100,000 shells in just a couple days. Specially if you just buy materials like plastic. Which isn't that hard to get in game. 
---
So this video doesn't make me think that people like th 900 hour guy were innocently crafting all the rare materials they had. 
---
In fact, this video just makes me think it's more attempts to confuse the conversation.
---
Also, why do you all care about people getting banned? You either are a cheater or you aren't. It's not your job to defend other random people that you have no proof about.
---
Just as it's not your job to lead a crusade against cheaters, or people you suspect of being cheaters. 
---
Play you game. 
---
Well of course there’s no reason t disregard certain players just because they have a different keyboard. 
---
I didn’t play the beta and I didn’t have the “Leave Vault 76” trophy pop... I feel as if this is a smoke screen (I know the other guy was just reporting what BGS have said for your benefit and maybe it is true on top of many other issues), the game is glitchy as hell, period.  
---
I had to start an alt to get the trophy, but seeing as that only entailed doing the tutorial that wasn’t too bad. I agree with you that for the Lvl 50 and 100 ones it’s a bit unreasonable for BGS to say just do it again... ☹️
---
I agree 100% that top damage dealers should get boosted loot. My main is only level 44, but I do enjoy going after the SBQ. I know I’m not doing a lot of damage with my Gatling/.50/LMG, but I’m down on the ground trying. And I’ll drop as many mobs as I can. But I know I don’t deserve the same amount of loot that the melee characters do. Give me a one star legendary for the effort, and give those characters a three star for the work!
---
Why are we still calling it DLC?  It's not really DLC so much as a permanent update. I always Considered DLC to be almost episodic or extra content or chapters to Ben played after the main game. Or adding a new play mode or an online component. 
---
These are just new game features. Anybody starting the game next month or beyond won't know of a version of the game without those features. They are just part of the game going forward. 
---
It just seems weird to call it DLC when it's just a big ol' patch update which adds new features to the game. 
---
Plans can be found in Watcha. I think vendors should have it. It's either the metal security doors (pretty sure it's that one) or metal powered doors. Hope this helped
---
Yes should work perfectly fine, I did the same with have the battlefield games
---
Worked fine for me on Xbox at least.
---
"Don't be greedy!"
---
Right, I was wondering why the didn’t actually change the radiation resistance
---
Thanks! Do I have to delete the disc file from my PS4?
---
any recipe allow use two types of the same ingredient?
---
Am I able to wear 2 piece Vanguard’s 2 piece bolstering  and 1 piece chamaleon? Do they all proc? When needed?
---
Can’t speak for PS4 but I would don’t think it would make a difference.
---
I know some who thought they'd lost their disc and downloaded the digital version (which was on offer at the time). The digital copy has to be fully installed in order to not need a disc (so it's a big install).
---
They didn't lose their character, though, as the save file worked fine.
---
No it will not. What system are you on I'd mod it for free if on ps4 and got the mats 
---
You're not wrong, but we're only talking about a couple of rads though, really. 
---
It's literally a plot point in Superman IV, minus Superman. That's how you know it's a legit idea.
---
10,000 years in the future they'll think it's modern art gone mad. lol
---
Exploding gnome traps when?
---
Welcome to the Wasteoftimeland, this has been my biggest complaint, SBs are some of the most difficult and unrewarding enemies in the game.
---
They should have better loot tables, including guaranteed Legendary items, and facing multiples should provide Bonus Loot for each additional one killed in a 10 minute time frame.
---
And at the very least make them give me different organs so I can finally make the damn SB Stew, I once killed 6 in less than 15 minutes, but still didn't have all the parts needed to make the Stew.
---
That stat doesn't say what you think it said. 
---
It was comparing the numbers of FO76 to FO4. 
---
That's not surprising at all, really. Bethesda's base of Fallout fans weren't interested in an online game. The issues they hate, like the PvP system, would still be things they'd hate, even if it were perfect.  The things most Fallout fans like about the game are the things they liked about the series. 
---
Yes, the stability issues were horrible for PR. I'm not discounting that. No dount they didn't have as many people buy the game as they hoped for.  That's different than saying that 95% of the players left after 2 weeks.  If you want to just back up and admit you were grossly exaggerating, that's fine. 
---
😂😂😂
---
WHO TOOK A SHIT IN THE TOILET? DISGUSTIN'
---
I *think* that they spawn at the level of the person who initially spawns in first, so if there's a level 50+ person in there when you go in, it will spawn at max level (45-50).
---
What I can't speculate on is whether that spawn level remains after the person has been away for a while.  As in, if a low level 'spawns' the armor, and then is gone for 30 minutes, does it spawn a new level when the next person comes along, or does it remain as a low level drop?  No idea.
---
I've collected most of the PS pieces at max level, though I Have a few bits to fill in.  It's a bit of a grind to get the ones you can't craft (which I think is 3 types?).
---
No worries, yeah on PS4 just wanted to check didn't want to be wasting stuff without realising cheers for info
---
Still trying to justify your behaviour I see. Stop being a pathetic little bully and accept that everyone has an equal right to be on the same server as you. Your behaviour is completely unacceptable amongst most of the community and no matter how you chose to voice your want for a server of your own, it’s not happening anytime soon. Until then I respectfully request you stop tormenting and bullying people you do t want on the same server as you.  
---
They tagged 5.56 and shells in the email. They wouldn't have mentioned those otherwise. Also plenty of posts after the initial ban wave stated they were simply "crafting reg ammo in mass amounts"
---
And it does hurt me. back when the trade-stealing bug rumor was around, I didn't trade at all, the lies and rumors had decidedly had their effect of scaring people into cutting out a main feature of the game for them. I'm a huge trader now, my favorite feature in the game.
---
We're simply letting people know that they don't have to worry about mass crafting causing a ban. Go ahead and search, people were claiming all sorts of things to confuse the conversation. Why are *you* worried about us making these vids enough to write out a paragraph long reply?
---
I personally really enjoy the PvP so I would make the switch
---
I have my CAMP at Whitesprings and it has a missile tower, but it's far to the south and well out of sight from any of the main Whitesprings houses. You can only see some maintenance sheds and the wall. I'm guessing the griefers I've had is just loosers taking out their frustration on others.
---
No problem there was a bug not sure if fixed, but if you wanted mods you would have to scrap things at your camp
---
Found the Fortnite Player...
---
Yeah, I finally started doing that. I felt, though, at level 40 I should be able to take down a lvl 50 enemy. I had no problem with the lvl 60's glowing ones at Whitespring at that time. Really made me consider giving up on the game since I kept running into them randomly so often. Saw that I wasn't alone in this and decided to keep pushing forward. Glad I did, but man, lvls 25-50 were tough.
---
Yeah, I noticed that similarity. 
---
What catches my attention is the bike-chain style design of the lever-arm. It's really odd. The "links" might have allowed for constructing the elevator in modular pieces, but that approach would add lots of unnecessary weight to the final structure. If those bike-chain links are dynamic, then I'm baffled as to how they would work. 
---
I wonder what the designer had in mind, if it was something other than, "this will look cool". 
---
This is the thing that boggles my mind about the documentary. If language doesn’t exist in the format we use it today, how can you possibly convey the fact that humans should not be in that area? No matter what you do people will want to find out what it means. 
---
I have had 3 of my four Flatwood Monster encounters and 3 of five with the  Mothman just wandering about in the Mire.  They can spawn anywhere, but I have the best luck in the Mire.  Happy Hunting!
---
I only play fortnite on pc
---
Nope. Nobody on the Fo76 sub is excited for new content. 
---
The back buildings in Helvetia have quite a few as well
---
Even adding something to the effect of "being in pacifist mode will not prevent this" would go a long way to clearing up the confusion.
---
You'll eat/ drink anything won't you?  
---
Purified water has chlorine in it, it tastes like shit. I'm fucked if I'm eating soup made with chlorinated water.  
---
You do you, but don't go inviting me to dinner again 
---
 Great question and I think it has already been answered, to an extent. Every single time someone suggests completely removing PVP from adventure mode, griefers fly into a rage here saying  "hey PVP is part of it bro, get over it." 
---
Basically, bullies love being the big fish in a small pond.   They don't want to be in a server where they are evenly matched and where everyone is exactly like them
---
Yeah noticed too but my mobile connection kinda killed itself halfway trough and i had to restart my whole phone and all... that aside, what this said is that the player numbers measured by anyone but beth don't alline so in case noone but beth is able to look at them statistics (seems to be the case right now) it's unlikely they're gonna be accurate.
---
You can thus base that statement on the fact that only hardcore fans remained in the first case, what can hardly be anymore then 5% of the games totall players. Or did all the "hate"pass by you?
---
First, please change the background music. I almost had to stomp on my phone to make the music stop. 
---
Second, there are plenty of places you can kill as many critters as you want to. 
---
That tea pot event is a better one, IMO. 
---
Or there are quite a few places where you can jump daily to grab a lot of crops. 
---
This isn't bad for brand new players though. 
---
PVP. 
---
I probably will switch. But they need to balance PvP properly.
---
As for the rest... you have plenty of tools protecting you from others if you don't care about PvP. 
---
But what if youre an herbivore?  Honestly, if youtubers are struggling with this, its because they are entirely ignoring the mechanic.  Imo, if you want to farm food, you should go after something that benefits your build.
---
Oh really? Great to know thank you! 
---
Yeah incremental changes are preferable over massive changes, see TSE weapon nerf. Maybe tweak it a little first, only one aspect of it, see how it does, instead of changing something so hard it just breaks the other way and you have no idea how far you missed the mark on either aspect off what you changed. 
---
You talk like when they switch they are gone... Ofc they are going to switch, but they are also going to switch back as soon as they are going to want to do PVE or wanna earn money or trade or do events. Survival mode is going to be like Cyrodill in ESO- You go there to do PVP but as soon as you wanna do something else, like trading or gathering, you come out there to regular world.
---
THIS.
---
Rather than uselessly commenting "this", you should try adding something to the thread.  If you agree with someone's comment, simply upvote them.
---
I particularly like it when I open the door and it slams in my face before I can look in! Fun!
---
But but but I role play as a raider. I can't role play as a raider if the whole server is actually participating in pvp. Lol. I'm sure it'll be 50/50. Most of your real try hards will go, the people that just wanna be assholes won't. 
---
&gt;Buy the base assembly plan from the BOS vendor in Watoga
---
BOS vendor only sells Mod Plans.  Plans for base pieces are rare drops from Treasure Maps.  
---
99% of the time there's nothing in there.
---
That *1%* tho.
---
So basically, everyone looking for a fair fight will probably switch, but the asshole who decided to shoot my hohse with a mini nuke right after i log in is gonna stay?
---
It sounds like i'd be better off joining the pvp servers then. At least those guys have an iota of respect for other players.
---
Two questions, since you seem to know what's going on with this stuff...
---
1. Does simply walking into a workshop area even if you are not claiming it open you to more than slap damage and does it make a difference if the workshop is owned or not?
---
2. Does clearing enemies from an unowned workshop for the caps open you to full map pvp with anyone else who enters that workshop then to claim it after you left (and does it matter if you reject the mission)?
---
I've never been killed by doing either one but I was always curious if I could be. The only pvp death I've had was when I claimed a workshop and then got killed for it in the workshop area... which is fine, I lost because I got sloppy and scavved for materials in the workshop area for a little while instead of server hopping right away. I only claim workshops to roll for plans.
---
It sounds like I have a similar problem. In my pip boy, I can see grayed out but not select: 
---
* Event: Patrol Duty
---
* Event: The Path to Enlightenment
---
* Event: Tea Time
---
* Event: Powering Up
---
* Event: Fertile Soil
---
Sometimes I can see Fertile Soil on the map despite it being grayed out. I have not seen Patrol Duty in a month. 
---
I tried opening a ticket, but the response was basically thanks for reporting; we assume this is solved. 
---
Have you tried this?
---
https://support.playstation.com/s/article/PS4-Manually-Eject-a-Stuck-Disc?language=en_US
---
Been a while since I played ESO, but is pvp available in the regular world? Or is it just in Cyrodill?
---
Magical place, I've heard.
---
it's because other fallout games had DLC and people are trying to equate this minor crafting thing to that. Like a few new crafting recipes are the same as far harbor or lonesome road or something. 
---
Some great ideas here. Made a similar post the other day with the suggestion that a clear on screen notification be given to a player whenever they've been flagged for PvP. There will always be the "carebears" who just hate PvP, but I think if people at least knew they were in danger there'd be a little less salt. 
---
Don't question the gnomes.
---
Or they'll come for you next.
---
This would be so much better with text chat. Too bad it's 1998 and text chat in videogames hasn't been invented.
---
buy a new keyboard
---
No. I have the right to be on any given server at any given time. If someone attacks me with slap damage, and i'm not interested in PvP, I should be able to report them, and if they persist, they should be banned. No bounties. Ban them, or give them an incurable disease for increasing lebgths of time for each offense. 
---
Bullying people to get them off of a server is unacceptable. 
---
Thanks for this. With my luck I’d probably break the entire system lol.
---
But the real question is why your squirrel look like a deer?...
---
Someone who shows up to the fight and primarily handles trash mobs and/or stimpacking downed combatants deserves the same rewards as someone who focuses on the SBQ and expects weaker damage-dealers to keep mobs off of them while they fight. I say this as a player who one-shots the trash mobs while the queen is in the air and is still one of the top three damage dealers in almost every fight because of how much damage I deal when she lands.
---
The only people whom I would prefer to see excluded from rewards are those who are actively counter-productive (I'm looking at you, orbital strike maniac), including hiding non-participants. Currently, those who don't do enough damage to the SBQ don't get to loot her--they only get event rewards, even if they played an extremely helpful support role during the fight. 
---
I don't like this, but there's really no practical way that I can think of for the game to know who deserves credit for being a medic or for keeping trash mobs off of others who melee the queen to great effect, even if they're protecting bloody builds or characters prone to being staggered. These characters allow the damage-dealers to deal their damage, but whining about freeloaders convinced the developers to exclude them from the SBQ drops. Do you really think they should lose the pitiful event rewards, too?
---
I agree and hope they work on armor balancing next. I'd love to see a situation where you either put all your eggs in one basket (ballistic or energy perks) and sometimes come across something that you either have to grind down because it's resistant to you or run to conserve weapons and ammo, or you diversify and use both with some success but are never really godly against anything.
---
It's choices like those that really make an RPG stand out. If every enemy has more or less the same resistances, or if resistances aren't balanced correctly to the point they don't seem to make a difference, why are they even in the game? 
---
Happy cake day. Take my humble updoot. 
---
I have a picture of one burying jangles the space monkey, they truly are the hidden terror of the wasteland.
---
Bad day?
---
Haha, I worried a guy a few nights ago, a couple of my young'uns crept downstairs and started talking while trying to watch me play.  
---
Bloke was spun out as he'd just put *his* kids to bed and he was trying to work out where these little voices were coming from.  
---
Dad gamers, there are dozens of us, dozens!
---
This week? where is the link to the article? that is great!
---
Right.  I haven't seen the documentary, but I read an article once.  For instance, they ruled out putting a 'skull' or other symbols of death because people might equate it with something different (like a tomb) and want to go inside to see what is there.
---
Ideally you want a symbol that isn't subject to reinterpretation, but that is a tall order.
---
Struggle with food? really???
---
um plant Corn, mutfruit and carrots?  Thats pretty unlimited at that point. No video required.
---
Boiled Water + Corn = Soup
---
Boiled Water + Carrots = Soup
---
Boiled Water + Mutfruit, salt, carrots = Soup. 
---
Done
---
I don't really see it as being close to death all the time.  More at you have the option.  Do you push yourself to land a few more hits, or treat it as a safety net to Stimpack yourself?  If you spend a fair bit of time irradiated already, it really doesn't make a difference, does it?  You're not seeing the full benefits of Vanguard, so it's a moot point.
---
Now, if Vanguard was tied to your total health - rads, that would be an interesting argument.
---
True, I love being 150 levels above ppl as they charge at me, but they have such a great chance at killing me, in what seems like a broken system. where in any reality I should be able to swat them away like I would a gnat.
---
Public space is just that, all who have PAID for the game can do as they please within the rules/ToC.  
---
You can ask (politely and not harrassing), but as the other posts say, not moving if it’s going to impact negatively on what I’m doing.
---
If it’s not then I’d server hop no problem at all, but you can’t expect it.
---
Defo agree with OP in terms of IF (big if) BGS wanted a community element to this game then yes they need to put better systems in place.  Private servers were mentioned though I don’t know about when that’ll ever materialise... As OP says if there was better systems to choose server etc. in place then it’d not impact anyone, or at least not as much.
---
Think cynically though this game was, at least in part, a poorly executed cash grab and unfortunately they didn’t get the numbers in terms of player base (don’t get me wrong I love the game and it’s what I’m playing 99% of the time).
---
As regards who’ll be playing in the long term... I will probably play it, but as regards community, there are some that need that aspect and some that don’t.
---
I love how the Finns just named it "the Pit" :-D 
---
Check my comment down below. 
---
And "this" is just fine. You can find people supporting opinions in this manner on a wide range of social media. 
---
Sorry, bot. You are wrong. 
---
Even longer shot, but are you still looking?
---
holy carp I've been looking at that spiky thing and I'm lvl 70 something and I reeeeaaaaally want to explore it now. Thanks 4 the lore tip! My camp is East of there, closer to Wa-toGA (robot vendor speak)
---
I don't think the person who causes the spawn affects the level. Stations that can spawn level 50 armor pieces also frequently spawn level 40. It seems more likely to be RNG. 
---
You a pacifist player?

---
its the difference between tap water and chicken base... gotta get that earthy tasty of mother nature in there.
---
Time to consider a drunkin explosive build!  Alcohol and explosives, what could go wrong?
---
Is the Water Filter a permanent thing in the Chemistry Station or is it one per purified water???
---
Yes, this is an often overlooked thing. If you're always in power armor, don't pocket your regular armor. That adds weight while in PA. I have several weightless and ultra-light pieces of combat/robot armor I wear for when I'm in PA.
---
From what I remember reading, \[sorry I cannot find the source\]......Bethesda are going to change the PVE server, updating that if you select 'Pacifist' then you can't cause or receive damage.
---
Rush? hardly.  I am the most anti-rush player you could meet.  I did every quest, explored every single location on map, and tried to explore everything in between.  I spent over 240 hours into the game.  
---
Whats left to do when you explored everything?  Explore it again?
---
&gt; They tagged 5.56 and shells in the email. They wouldn't have mentioned those otherwise. Also plenty of posts after the initial ban wave stated they were simply "crafting reg ammo in mass amounts" 
---
I don't believe them. I don't believe what they say was in the emails. People have posted fake screenshots of emails from Bethesda. It's pretty easy to alter or fake one. 
---
&gt; And it does hurt me. back when the trade-stealing bug rumor was around, I didn't trade at all, the lies and rumors had decidedly had their effect of scaring people into cutting out a main feature of the game for them. I'm a huge trader now, my favorite feature in the game. 
---
You've kind of taken my statement about it's not effecting you if people get banned, and applied it to a different subject. That of the one time rumor of trade-stealing. People getting banned doesn't stop you from trading. So again, it's not your job to defend someone you don't know when they get banned. Just as it's not your job to attack them. In fact, everyone of that does attack or defend them, you are breaking the rules of this reddit. 
---
&gt; We're simply letting people know that they don't have to worry about mass crafting causing a ban 
---
Bethesda has already stated this several times. This is the point where you all break the reddit rules and start calling me names, because I didn't slam Bethesda, or said something you think it way to positive about Bethesda.   
---
I'd say people that were claiming to have been just crafting ammo in the extreme and got banned, are probably not being honest. You've stated how people have been lying and spreading rumors about the game. Why would they suddenly be honest about just crafting lots of ammo when they got banned?
---
Pathetic.
---
This.  The people who were the most toxic are most likely to stay.  That said, I've bumped into very few.
---
Raiders roles in fallout is to be cannon fodder, all raiders do is die and die easily. So you go around dying all the time? So terrible excuse, you can roleplay in that server
---
Damage dealt to adds its still damage. It could all of this damage be added up. For example the game tracks down how much damage you deal during the event in the event area and you get rewarded based on that.
---
This any good? [https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/38](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/38)
---
Sentinel set is one of most stupid sets designs I have seen inside the game. When you take cavalry set for example, it introduces you new meta, where you have to run to gain something from it. Means you have to actively do something and that makes game harder. Meanwhile sentinel does exactly opposite, it makes you stronger for playing game dumber. 
---
Sole IT person for a branch office, for a logistics company. Everything from Sys Admin, project management, user support, and paperwork for hardware repairs. It can get pretty grueling. 
---
Meh. 
---
I'll take that as an admission that you pulled a number out of your butt. 
---
Yes, I agree that some people really hated the game and left, often with a lot of drama. 
---
And that numbers are down lately. 
---
Where do I find them?
---
THIS. 
---
;-)
---
I enjoyed PvP a few days ago when I was trying to trade at the Whitespring station.
---
Two griefers started pumping bullets into me for no reason, even after I left the vendor after a minute. They followed me onto the roof and wouldn't leave me alone.
---
So I let them waste more bullets, then I killed them both twice and took their loot.
---
Had a party of four way over my level hitting me with canes and power fists while I was on my way to do the final Firebreather quest. Just wouldn't give in until I eventually retaliated. Twenty minutes slapping some level 15 until they have to leave the server because they won't let you even start the quest. Fallout 76 PvP is atrocious. 
---
Haha yeah exactly. 
---
The people who administrate them been eather lying or silent about them 🤷🏻‍♂️ not much choice on that matter but feel free to actually proove me wrong.
---
Is this documentary something in-game or something on YouTube I should watch?
---
&gt;  - we would already be launching barrel after barrel of green glowing goo straight into the sun
---
Stupidest idea ever.
---
1. That would be incredibly dangerous, what will hapen when (not *if*) a launch fails.
---
2. There is no such thing as nuclear "waste".  High level nuclear waste is just fuel for other kinds of reactors.
---
That's fine but how many are going to go there realise they aren't the God kings of pvp they believe they are and come back to the ppl who have no interest in it.
---
Dueling is only kind of PVP enabled in regular world.
---
Definitely Whitesprings. Equip Green Thumb for double the gains. 
---
I got one you can have but I won’t be on till 6pm EST. Let me know if your interested or find one before then. 
---
Thank you. I was wondering where to get this. 
---
Is it a lot of them or very few?
---
Wanted to make purified water at chemistry station. 
---
But was wondering which is faster to get purified water: 
---
Waiting for water pump or crafting it
---
Apparently I needed a /s on that statement? I hate pvp in this game and refuse to participate in the non sense. Lol. 
---
No, not at all. I go to my CAMP and fetch it from the purifier. Way faster than boiling.
---
I agree but how are they buffing the queen? If you mean by adding hp I get that any other way?
---
Yea, as reliable as modern rockets are things can and do still go wrong. Thus strapping nuclear waste to one and sending it to the sun while not being the worst idea is at least adjacent to the worst idea.
---
&gt;I'd say people that were claiming to have been just crafting ammo in the extreme and got banned, are probably not being honest. You've stated how people have been lying and spreading rumors about the game. Why would they suddenly be honest about just crafting lots of ammo when they got banned?
---
You're misunderstanding me, I'm saying they're lying when they mass crafted ammo and got banned, This video disproves them. And I meant that I don't want another player to have to be worried about crafting like I was about trading
---
huh.... actually attacking the farm is more damaging than their main, isn't it? When a plant gets fucked up you need like 3 times the resources and plants to fix just 1 than just walking out and fixing it by hand.
---
Exactly! it’s like the pyramids, people had no idea what they were but broke into them anyway and even with talk of curses people continued to explore them because that is human nature. It doesn’t help that there were jewels and riches inside them because in that case the exploration could be seen as worth it.
---
 The danger in the case of nuclear waste is also basically invisible so the illnesses people will contract may not be contributed to the area until it’s too late 
---
Agreed.  Raider Role\_play is another term for Griefer.
---
I haven't gotten the nuka cola quest, but I have been hitting the PA spawn points in the Forest and Toxic Valley for fusion cores.
---
In the process, I've found everything from Raider to T60 (but not excavator).
---
Best I can figure, its random, as are the levels for each piece.  
---
again, you are viewing it from an advanced player perspective
---
I switched to pc from Xbox, and so far I've only had 1 bad experience with other anther player. However, on Xbox, it was about once a play session I would run across some asshole that just insisted on following me around slapping me. 
---
You can see "hours played" as a fraction of the "play fallout 76 for 7600 hours" challenge.
---
You clearly haven't tried my chicken pooldle soup. 
---
Any other spots? Nuking Whitesprings is sooo boring and repetitive... 
---
It would seem that is in the dev's crosshairs to make pacifist negate even slap damage and extend that to CAMPs.
---
If that is the case and PvP is limited to workshops in Adventure Mode - this is an educated guess; based on the information available is fair to assume that they are happy to have workshops work as PvP arenas or sorts and unlikely that they will do away with this feature - it won't matter that much what the people who engage on PvP for one reason or another do or don't do.
---
Glowing fungus??
---
I’m on Xbox one and it says Coal. 
---
The good old leave worlds is a tried and true method, however it's the lack of those protections in the new mode that makes me think no one will switch
---
I suppose this was removed under the guise of "witchhunting" mods are so 2 faced.
---
There’s a Glowing Snallygaster hanging out there so just be prepared.
---
Why are you opposing a system to avoid bullying if you feel that bullying is bad? 
---
How was dueling done in the regular world? Sorry for being extra inquisitive I'm just trying to see how other games implemented the system. 
---

---
...and add to that the fact that sending anything into even low Earth orbit is really expensive, and apparently actually hitting the sun involves some pretty complicated orbital mechanics (or so I am informed, it's a bit above my pay grade)... In the end, we have little option but to handle the stuff ourselves. Maybe producing less of it to begin with is a way to go? 
---
Wait you can tame stuff in 76?
---
Not sure... WS has a lot of harvestable vegetation that are relatively close to each other, which is the sole reason I recommended it for nuked flora. I completely understand why you think it’s boring though.

---
  If you are careful and are not afraid of performing surgery with a screwdriver, you should be able to get the disk out.
---
The resistances get buffed too
---
The jollyness depends on where you are in Appalachia. Where I'm at we got bars, churches, and heroin. Needless to say, shit gets messy. Oh and pizza, we got mad pizza places.
---
Say that that could be implemented. What about medics?
---
The bravest character I ever saw at the SBQ fight was a level 24 empath in a hazmat suit with an infinite supply of stimpacks. No way did she do any significant amount of damage, but she definitely made a difference by picking people up. No way would she have deserved to have been excluded from rewards, even SBQ drops.
---
Support roles are incredibly important in other RPGs and, afaik, those characters don't end up losing out on loot--if they did, no one would undertake the relatively boring but incredibly helpful task of healing fighters. Why should 76 be the exception?
---
Once it’s out, would you suggest I never put another disc inside?
---
They can keep it at the workshops that's fine they are borderline useless except as a free fast travel spot
---
The idea certainly isn’t viable with the risk factor of current launch technology.  In the future however as we see more reliable methods of getting out of the atmosphere, this becomes more of a reality.  Although I’d hope by then we would have just stopped making nuclear waste...
---
One server I was on had a nuke dropped at Vault-Tec University.
---
There weren't many enemies spawned, but there was a ***TON*** of nuked flora.
---
Whitespring. Even though it's mostly fluorescent, there's still a decent amount of yellow cake.
---
They are heavy, but aren't they also scappable for concrete?
---
And that's what I've been saying. Legit crafting won't get you banned. People claiming they were legit crafting and got banned are most likely lying. Bethesda has spoken on this several times, crafting won't get you banned.
---
That seems the jist of it.
---
I would like to try this new mode. But can't really say if I'd make a permanent switch to. Ideally I would like to choose the mode I wanna play with any character at will, not bring permanently stuck in one mode forever.
---
In my experience the game has improved quite a bit. Far fewer DC's than before. And like mentioned above, Bethesda keeps improving the game based on user feedback. As for the building of CAMP's, we'll just have to wait and see what the change is going to mean for building a CAMP. I'd say give it another try  and have fun !
---
The Whitesprings planter boxes on the porches of the cabins are yellow cake. There's also several more yellow cake spread around the golf course. 
---
servers go down at 6am Cali time on tuesdays
---
I personally stay away from Workshops because they trigger PVP... But many do not and are often surprised when someone 1 shots them.  I think the game really needs a flag that pops up on your screen that shows your current PVP status.   so it really drills into their mind that, hey you take a workshop and someone is taking it from you, you will be PVP.
---
LMAO YOU JUST MADE ME SNORT. Literally snort. I never snort when I laugh. Its more of a silent airy huff.
---
Similar way to F76- you make a request (F76 you make that by shooting at someone) and then opposite side has to accept (in F76 you accept by shooting back)
---
Or you need to be a former professional baseball player.
---
I don't know. We'll see.
---
They're pooping, obviously.
---
I'll switch, and cycle game modes. I have to be in a mood for PvP, just like I have to be in a mood to adventure around and do my thing.
---
It'll be fun :)
---
Wouldn't enemies with guns pose a similar problem?
---
It's probably so you don't accidently use all your purified water in soup when mass crafting.  I just spam the button when crafting food and drinks.  I would easily do this and use all my purified water by mistake.  Not really an issue for me because I can just wait in CAMP for more water, but being fresh out of the vault would affect a person a lot more.
---
I do agree however.  I wouldn't mind being able to use purified water in soup.  You'd still get rads from the vegetables though. 
---
Well first, I would recommend, not dropping it.
---
We can't really answer that till the new update goes live tomorrow. 
---
It does,  in a way,  and tomorrow.
---
They’re adjusting the “cost” of certain things in the camp.
---
Haha same between dupers, bobblehead stacking perk cards not working or working for wrong things, and countless other inconsistencies what's the point. Not to mention it makes no sense in a world that we are supposed to be rebuilding, however if you chose a faction that was in the area pvp would make sense and workshop events could be server wide faction events
---
Thank you for your reply. If I understand correctly, the tool allows to create cunstom .ini files. Not sure if that's a solution to my problem or I misunderstood its purpose.
---
I'm trying to launch to instances of F076 on the same machine. (Main and mule account.) To put less stress on the computer, I'd like to have one launch with all bells and whistles and the other with the bare minimum needed.
---
I hope weapon balancing issue will be addressed before survival mode launches.
---
Confirmed that turrets will target hostile targets without player engagement.   
---
Some ghouls wondered by and the turrets shot at them. I dont think the ghouls attacked the camp because they were fighting a near by patrol of Mr Handys and an assaultron. Southern edge of golf course at a break in the wall. 
---
They're just clogging up all the fun.
---
Hard No. I really don't see the incentive to play Survival.
---
There is a quest from the Hunter cabin in the mire that will show you where 3 of these usually spawn.
---
I agree. As advanced. There would be nothing wrong with recipes using both water types. The difference should be the radiation. Purified water give no radiation. Boiled some. That would give both newbies and advanced some reality feeling.
---
I'll be around. Just reply on here and I'll get on if I'm not already. How much you want for it, so I can make sure I have the caps.
---
Straightforward and honest, right? But, to be fair to us Finns, "onkalo" is, I would think, a bit of a more exotic word in our language, and it to me at least has almost like a mythical or magical connotation to it. Then again, I suppose that depends a lot on where in Finland one is from, so take that as just my 2c.
---
Haha, hell energy weapons are just now being "fixed", so ya we'll see
---
I have found the pods blooming at night.  Not all will blooming but I think you can harvest 5 plants.  
---
Just server hop until they are up.  I use them for radshield and cures.  I  hop until I get 20 - 30 and craft away!
---
The radiation really gives it that extra spice
---
Free fifty free sound good? 😁
---
I'd be just an another sight-seer but I guess every place has its dark and bright sides, huh? Of course, the pizzas belong to the bright side;)
---
You should be able to craft the helmet separately.
---
Even if we put some corpses on the spikes, they might think it was our burial custom.
---
Honestly I havent read the terminal but in the real world I have always believed the only real viable option for disposing of nuclear waste and material is to eject it into the vaccuum of space. Deteriorating  in the earth wreaking havoc for future generations and life as a whole shouldnt even be an option
---
Mostly, I find there’s far more joy helping other members of the community. I will say that I do agree that there needs to be a better system implemented for those wishing to play in large groups, my issue is with the bullying and harassment of players. 
---
can't say.  
---
I had to do this on my original PS3 - which also had a motorized disk
---
(I've also done it on a couple regular computers)
---
Nect time I put in a disk, yes, it was a cheap thrill, but the drive resumed operating normally. 
---
Never had the problem again.

Why not go somewhere nice like Jacksonville, Florida? 
---
What sort of large events are held?
---
Thank you for this :) I’ll let you know how it goes. Fingers crossed!
---
Why *not?*
---
I mean, if you're absolutely sure, but I'll feel guilty if I dont toss you some stims or something. Lol
---
I value 76 for the PvE experience and look forward to what they've got in the pipeline for later this year. 
---
For PvP, my hard drive is full of games that do PvP better than 76 ever will. I'm not going to mess with "survival" mode unless they do something drastic like drop the legendary BS, which of course will never happen because 76 is a loot grinder. 
---
Aren't all of those triggered by player activity, within certain buildings? Because I have triggered all of them last night. Except patrol duty, but I joined it after someone wandered in the prison.
---
There's actually several counters to PvP, this is a RPG and not Call of Duty so you can't just shoot and pray. 
---
For example: 
---
To counter VATs Crit builds you could use Cryo Grenades or Cryolator to stop them from using VATs and recharging AP. For anyone wearing sentinel assassins armor, you could use a Radium Rifle, Gamma Gun, or any grenades that stagger as well as VATs Critical Shots or even melee. To counter melee, use high rate of fire Automatic Rifle or Machine Gun with tons of ammo or shoot them with a Crit Shot. 
---
There are many ways to take out people in this game, you just have to assess the situation, come up with a solution, and not rely on just Weapon Damage.
---
You gotta scrap multiples of that weapon and mods are unlocked randomly regardless of weather they even have mods on them.
---
Owning a workshop is asking for pvp. Just a heads up
---
Immersion.  Plus, I can build a freaking fusion reactor, but I can't build a working clock?
---
Not related to the topic but you seem to understand all this math stuff in game. I have two gatling guns. One 2 star lvl 40 furious with 25% faster fire rate and a one star lvl 50 furious gatling. The lvl 40 does 90 dmg a shot but has 25% faster fire. Does that do more dps than the lvl 50 that fires slower but does 109 dmg per shot.
---
Same,I do dirty cheaps power armor mods and will mod anything else for free if you got the mats all I try to do is make the game better for another fallout lovers. Hell if someone else is near I'll switch to my weakest weapon and draw legendaries in making sure other get a hit before killing 
---
Pretty dumb response considering the cost to take care of nuclear waste is *literally infinite*, so even just launching it into the moon would cut costs for handling it by 99% until we colonize the moon.  The sun would just be a better concept since it'd incinerate anything approaching it and we'd most likely never launch into the same spot twice.
---
What's more is we already have nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean even before Fukushima, you don't mind that but think a shuttle full of nuclear waste crashing is a problem?
---
Kinda scary to me how some people are incapable of fully comprehending the asinine way we handle nuclear energy and its waste product so shoot down any concept at all. What would you have us do, bury it?
---
As I pointed out, not high on the priority, but something I'd like to see.  So take your floppiness elsewhere.
---
Can confirm. Lol
---
I’m aware of the initiative, and I’m afraid it’s futile. There’s absolutely no signage they could add to it that wouldn’t have the opposite effect. Their best bet would be to try and blend it with its surroundings so it isn’t found. 
---
Seriously.  I'm glad it was free or I'd be a little pissed.
---
No.. Scrapping it will give you a completely random mod depending on percent chances.  There are common mods, uncommon, rare. 
---
When it rolls percentage, it rolls all 3.  If common roll succeeded, it stops there and gives you that one.  If uncommon succeeded and you have not gotten one yet, it gives you that one.  Finally the rare ones. 
---
So in essence, the mods are competing with each other.     Now couple that the chances of learning mods is really low.  Its common for all those to miss.   Armor is equal chances on all mods, so those are tougher.
---
then we just need a new recipe... like Pure Vegie Soup with better effects
---
9:45 was when The Great War occurred, all the bombs going off stopped the clocks.
---
Why obsess about tiny amounts of nuclear "waste" (i.e. unprocessed fuel) when we're pouring gigatonnes of much more dangerous waste into the atmosphere every year?
---
(Ok, in the fallout universe they don't have the latter problem as they were apparently on a planet with much lower fossil fuel reserves than ours).
---
Yeah I’m sure, I’ll catch you tonight.
---
They do have their uses, and if PvP engagement occurred only on workshop grounds the risk/reward would work for me.
---
Alas currently someone can initiate claim, drop you in PvP and a team mate (or more) can take you down wherever you are on the map.
---
Given that PvE and PvP setups differ greatly and that they are always going to have the initiative if not the upper hand it can get fairly irritating.
---
If PvP is restricted to the workshop well... if the current holder chooses not to reciprocate you get to claim the workshop. Woohoo I guess? :P
---
Ha! Also happy cake day!
---
Alright, thanks in advance!
---
If we had the technical means to throw tons of stuff into the sun, we wouldn’t need to anyway; we’d probably be just building orbital solar platforms instead. 
---
No problem, glad it went to a good home instead of the 20 caps I would get from a vendor bot, lol. Right after you left we were hit by 2 waves of super mutants with lvl 68 3 star legendary leaders, it was fun. Your mic was breaking up really bad there at the end so I missed most of what you were saying. Had I been thinking I would have dropped you some 40mm grenades because I have the plans for those too.
---
You know you meant poodle XD
---
Did not know that thanks 
---
What disease causes *that*?!
---
I've only ever seen 1 person being downed during a SBQ fight. 
---
I do understand that healers are really precious in online games, I actually prefer playing as a healer in mmo games but fallout 76 is a lot easier than your average mmorpg and the value of a healer is diminished. 
---
Your case is a rarity, not the norm. 
---
Should we keep this system just so the 1 in 1000 can get rewarded? 
---
But anyway if damage dealt can be tracked hp healed can also be tracked and rewarded. Pretty sure there is a challenge to heal a bunch of people so the system is already on place. Just make it so heals during the SBQ event are extra-rewarded 
---
Gee, you again? When are you gonna accept the fact that you have no greater right to a server than anyone else? I agree that private servers are needed, but stop trying to justify your entitlement. I paid for the game, I'll play how I see fit, your excuses are just that.
---
My defence out of power armor is approaching 500 if not higher depending on health and rads... they still 1 shot me. So frustrating 
---
I'm fine with either. Game time we'd see a sped up clock, still better than flashing 12.  Local time would be local to everyone's own PC or console, which is okay with me too.  Better than flashing 12.
---
Yes!
---
Same numbers as people who play BF, think they are God Kings of the game, then go into PVP and realize they aren't so good. They don't go back to SP of battlefield, because they suck. They keep playing the MP to improve. And nowadays no one really expect him to be good in PVP for playing against noobs. Same is with F76, people who PVP, don't think they are God Kings of PVP, for killing low level players. They understand what they are up against in current game.
---
Yep in certain cimcumstances and with certain perks.
---
You're missing the part where the second email is from support, not the automated one sent with the ban wave. The initial ban email clearly states "rare" items. 5.56 and 5mm aren't rare and could easily be farmed up. The only one that would be at all difficult to farm would be the ultracite ammo. So why would their ban wave target ammo that anyone coukd farm up? When it has always been about the ultracite ammo.
---
It just seems really silly to claim you are testing peoples claims but not actually repeating what the claim they were banned for was. Not even mentioning that Bethesda only bans around maitnence not some always on ban program that bans as soon as you're caught doing something they don't like. So until another ban wave is done we won't know if this account has been flagged or not.
---
I go to the train cars in the Flooded Trainyard just East of Watoga. I usually find around 4 or 5 of them there.
---
I suppose I haven't bothered with those perks yet.
---
Again, low priority request, but still something that'd be nice.  Only the ones we build at our camps need function, the rest can stay frozen at the time of the Great War.
---
Or just finding a way to make money out of it. Gasoline used to be a waste product of kerosene, and burned off.

The stim resipe is 100 caps at the enclave vendor tho
---
To be fair since there is no penalty upon death aside from waiting to respawn I think that you should go with the Shadowed combat armor especially if you're a stealth rifleman. Unless you're trying to tank enemies up front and Melee you don't need to worry too much about DR/ER.
---
Future smart dudes that figure out a way to harness it for energy are gonna be pissed at you. 
---
Not to mention everybody in Florida when one of those rockets blows up at launch. 
---
There's a boatload of crimson around the main entrance to the hotel, and you can find cobalt at the entryways and along the paths further away toward the shops and on top of the hill by the bunker (not the service) entrance.
---
I could get behind this argument if it weren't for the fact that I'm using wood (another piece of wood, apart from the one I used to make the Boiling Water) to make the soup, which implies that I'm heating something.
---
Yeah. I used to trigger Patrol Duty by going to the front step of Eastern Regional Penitentiary. For the last month I've been to the steps many times but neither triggered it, nor seen it appear on the map for others. Sometimes I trigger Jailbreak, but never Patrol Duty. 
---
not for me, is 1200
---
&gt; You tag the SBQ once? you get a drill. You deal \~25% of the total damage? You get a legendary drill. 
---
I really admire how you kept your expectations in check there. 😂
---
Weird but you can get it off free it's just a random drop that's how I got mine
---
It's the same thing. They all use the same object model, so animating the ones only in our camp isn't any easier. They could add completely new camp only clocks that work though, but idk if they would bother. Maybe as a future ATOM shop item.
---
There's some cobalt in the forest area along the road opposite the station, going north from the cobalt sap on the tree.
---
We're looking into changes to pacifist mode, definitely. Stated from the BGS account [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ax6ll8/bethesda_should_fix_pvp_its_not_fair_to_those_of/ehsgjgt).
---
&gt; We are looking to make changes to Pacifist mode that, when enabled you will not be able to take damage from other players. The plan is for this to also carry over to your C.A.M.P. as well. 
---
Happy Cake Day Ladydevann! Stop searching the world for treasure, the real treasure is in yourself.
---
Just have to hope its a one way ticket then. Cause Im sick of the home wrecking bullies.
---
That defeats the point though. What good would come out of selling nuclear material? Would only ever cause damage, no good would come of that
---
The only thing I dislike about Harpers is the silly turrets ... make me work for my farm ... ;-)
---
Yes, it’s not a ‘switch’. You can play on either mode, and always go back. OP is being dramatic I think. 
---
Yeah I try to share legendaries as much as possible when farming places like Whitesprings too because it's a win-win situation. I mean, why bother going to whitespring (or launching nukes) on hardcore servers where, BEST CASE, SOMEONE could accidently hit and kill you? 
---
I think this game needs more Co-Op incentive and less PvP. They've already driven away a lot of their fan base with controversy and griefing. I just don't see how this is a welcomed addition
---

---
Take rank 3 of Can Do and make the rounds through Wavy Willard's Water Park, Watoga, and Whitesprings.
---
Watoga has Canned Dog Food spawns and trash/fridges to search while Willard's and Whitesprings have a lot of trash cans. 
---
If you're taking notes how about making a notice if I'm joing a friend in a new world that lets me know if they are in survival mode

Ill be switching my raider character over. He's dealing in pipe weapons and has a full raider armor suit. Shoot on sight!

Owning a workshop can indeed lead to pvp, I’ve been playing long enough to be aware of this lol. However, it’s not “asking” for pvp, pvp is a risk you accept when you claim a workshop, not a certainty. I’m more likely to help defend a workshop against mobs for someone than try to contest it. 
---
Where’s it at?

Why should you be able to swat them like a gnat? Did you turn those extra 150 perk cards into a fly swatter or something? Because level doesn’t mean shit if you’ve built your character right, with planning.
---
Would be nice if it tagged who it belonged to.
---
One last question: how are the requests for dueling in ESO done? Do I walk up and slap damage till you accept or leave? Or is it a text prompt or invite or something? 
---
I guess what I'm getting at is fallout really needs a better system for the people that don't want to participate in pvp. Following me around slap damaging till I accept or leave the server is kinda dumb. IMO. 
---
Can Do will get you what you need fairly quickly.  Trash cans and almost every food container (little blue ice chests) will have them
---
who say is unacceptable lol... is for simplicity.  Or they need to make a recipe variation with purified water, or keep it simple.  
---
One recipe with 2 boiled water, or a new variant with one purified and better effects.   
---
Also, if the recipe can use both options how will chose one over other? What if i don't want use my purified water to make Veggie Soup?
---
Also along the cliff face if the nuke drops far enough east. 
---
Boiled isn't boiling 
---
you need to be slapped
---
I dont farm whitesprings, everytime i tried with friends it's like look at all the one star stuff i got when in 20 mins i could find at least 2 2star items in four events
---
Can you confirm if this update will only be for the PVE servers and the upcoming PVP survival server will not have a pacifist mode?
---
I am! Im gonna try to update it before work...get to work early, then leave early so I can do the new things! Hopefully new atom shop items as well.
---
Could be true, I haven't done any kind of research into it.  I know I've gotten most (if not all) raider armor to spawn at max level, though I don't recall that I was in a higher level area when I did it.  But it also spawns at levels as low as 15, so I'm curious what makes it spawn at 15 vs. 45.  
---
If it's not somehow based on the level of the person that activates the spawn, I have no ideas.
---
Yeah, that's a fair request not to see the quest pop up when someone else triggers the drop. Bethesda take note of this.
---
IIRC adventure mode is the same as the current version of the game just with PVP always on and higher stakes.
---
They can still complete in game objectives.

My question is if you can craft an item that needs another craft able item. Why can’t the game auto craft said needed item to craft the main item.

---
Long answer on Q1 ...
---
First, in the game there are very few places with all the stations, etc. built so you can do all your repair and crafting in one spot. The only one I know of is at Whitespring. One thing the CAMP lets you do is have some sort of safe-ish space to do your crafting out in the world.
---
Second, you can fast travel to your camp for free. While you are lower level you may move it around a bit ... and in fact I find I like to do this as I’m doing quest chains. At least one has you going to lots of different places, one has you going extreme NE ... I like to put my camp up that way and lessen my walk and/or fast travel cost.
---
Third, esp. at low levels sometimes I used my camp as a convenient way to drop things out of my stash ... or dragging really hard to kill enemies into some turrets. You’ll find some places that a higher level player has been in and the game has spawned seriously higher level enemies. One trick is if you have a camp near there you can build up some turrets and drag the enemies into them.
---
Fourth, and we’re back to high level here, you might just enjoy the look of a place or building a camp or trying things out. Some people groove on that itself.
---
You're thinking about this way too hard.
---
It's because the crafting system doesn't support "Ingredient A or Ingredient B", and doubling all the recipes for a purified water version would create an enormous and awkward list.
---
Yeah seriously now I need to do this.

Will never join.  I only raid monsters, not my fellow human beings.
---
I know I have received it several times from event rewards. The outdoor events in the mire and cranberry bog I think.
---
Turrets and a mass amount of lights are what kills the budget anyway
---
With Green Thumb I can get around 220 fluorescent flux, which leaves a lot of spare flux to sell to vendors.
---
I was in a nuked Morgantown for the first time yesterday and the amount of flux was disappointing. But, I levelled up twice; at one point a horde of about 30 bloated glowing ones came at me, on the street heading out east.
---
I may have a few - likely 1 or 2 star only. I won’t be on until later tonight though. 
---
I found one in a random medkit/mirror doing the whitesprings run. If you want and you are on PC I can get you one.
---
I usually run a melee/rifle build...my furious death claw gauntlet had no effect...so I head shot him 3 straight times with aa sniper....no damage. Nothing I do causes damage to majority of these griefers. 
---
Out is power armor depending on health n rads I'm hitting close to 500 defence and they just 1 shot me everytime.  Flustered 
---
I'll post my stats n build when in off work later tonight

Interesting PVP trap:
---
Request a drop....then go camp near it and wait for someone to open the crate and then BOOOOOM
---
Its usually 9am est 
---
PS4. What is witesping run?
---
It’s just a few things, the big bulk is later on. 
---
I have been harvesting Deathclaw eggs since BETA. 
---
&gt;^(looks at 100+ Deathclaw eggs)
---
I HAVE A MIGHTY NEED TO UNLEASH MY ARMY OF DEATHCLAWS!!!
---
If that's all the ammo you used on the SBQ fight then that's a good day. I can easily run through 10-20 ultracite plasma cores or 5,000-6,000 ultracite .50 cal rounds in a single fight. That's with adrenaline 5 and nerd rage 5. My group did that fight 5 times this weekend. Beat her the first time with only 3 of us the first time and between 4 and 6 the other times.
---
Or a house pet cat, that is tied to the cat bowl and will emote when you pet it, and sit on furniture 
---
A bit north from the station there's a hut where about 4 high level super mutants spawn, have you ever encountered them in a nuke zone?
---
Worked for me the other day. Xbox One in case that's the issue.
---
For real, stalk it out and wait for the player who dropped it to loot it.  At that point the prompt should switch over from 'steal' to 'take', literally your only indication is the prompt saying 'steal', no real warning exists.
---
3k ammo is not even on their duping radar.  I had 7k ultracite 5mm that I created honestly for my minigun before the anti-dupe purge and they didn't touch it.  Just some good sam.  cleaning out his stash because he found a better weapon with different caliber ammo! Enjoy!
---
I’d go Gun Fu 1 / Adrenaline 1 and keep both Bloody Mess and Grim Reaper’s Sprint, but that’s me.
---
I have launched two nukes, and got it both times for completing
---
Dang that’s a lot. 
---
How come??
---
Is it worth it?
---
What benefits do I get?
---
I almost thought of making another character but wasn’t sure if it was good idea or if it’s for when I want to start over because I messed up badly. 
---
Hearing this in Sheldon Coopers voice...
---
116.
---
This was intentional and was posted in the last patch notes
---
Because it would double the size of the already unwieldy cooking menu.
---
Yeah, at the disposal site, I got an exploding harpoon gun off one of them once. 
---
Wow, just....wow 
---
Although I have strong feelings about "raiders," I appreciate this post.  As someone who avoids PvP like the plague, this will help me continue to enjoy the game.
---
IDK.  
---
I have a Marksman Hardened Perforating Sniper Rifle 
---
and 
---
Marksman Hardened Sniper Rifle.
---
they are identical spec except the magazine type.
---
and that the Perf rifle weighs a couple pounds more.
---
The Perf rifle does 78, the non perf does 83.
---
A heat map of where the community frequents would be cool. Like what places are underused?
---
Grats! My main is 91, so not far to go until I hit the big 100 too. 
---
General's Steakhouse/RobCo area yields a good amount with Green Thumb.
---
Your bigger problem will be the gnarly scar on your bare back.
---
I got it from a legedary drop in whitespings nuke zone
---
Is it possible that you just aren't paying attention to non-teammates to know whether they're going down? Personally, I'm down at least two or three times a fight (bloody build), and I pick people up at least a handful of times--and that doesn't include the players who go down and get picked up by someone else before I can get there.
---
What it really comes down to this: you're advocating punishing what you see as a small fraction of helpful players in order to keep players whom you don't see as making a real person contribution from getting loot.  But what does even do for you, or me, or any of us? 
---
It doesn't bother me if someone who maybe doesn't really "deserve" a reward still gets one, but it definitely irritates me when a teammate with a medic weapon who spends her time running stims to the rest of us can't loot the SBQ because she didn't deal enough damage. Your suggestion to reward certain players might be a good one--I have reservations when I consider what behavior it would motivate--but there's no reason to punish other players who aren't actively detrimental to your game, especially when you know that helpful players will also get swept up in your spite.
---
Enjoy the rewards you get and don't worry about what anyone else gets. No one is "stealing" your three-star equip or rare recipe drop (probability doesn't work that way), so it might be better to make a case for improving the loot drops, period, and not worrying about what other people get.
---
It doesn't state what those rare items are. Initial email doesn't mention Ultracite at all. They have a list of 400 commonly duped items, not sure why 5.56 and 5mm couldn't end up on there. They're commonly used ammo types
---
87
---
Well that's the difference between a minigun and slow reloading hunting rifles. 200-300 ammo is a lot for me; I only keep ~1000 ammo of each type in my inventory.
---
SBQ can be easier in a small good group than in a large random one
---
I'd like to see some numbers when the pvp servers go live. Like the amount of people that care about it compared to the ones that don't. I honestly believe the larger portion of the player base doesn't care about pvp at all and just want a solid pve experience their friends. 
---
I will def dabble in the survival mode, but my main game will be the Wild Appalachia current mode. I enjoy playing the Fallout world without griefers. 
---
As others have said, it's time for the Ash Heap if you haven't been there yet.  It's true that exploring east is challenging, but I found it pretty thrilling.  I think I was around Lv. 38 when I first went to the Mire.  There's a lot of stuff that can kill you outright, and Scorchbeasts send you running, but it was some of the most fun I had with the game.  It wasn't so much about killing things as much as it was trying to find all the locations on the map, so when I needed to go to the Mire in the future, I had a fast travel point to start from.
---
152
---
I really liked that place.
---
I agree with this post and up vote it now.
---
&gt;You should be able to pick your own keypad number.
---
I believe you can if you connect a terminal to the same power grid.
---
That's why I said fallout players wanted coop not multi player
---
And it is still cheaper than buying a two shot explosive or bloodied explosive on the market!
---
I'm not the one who made a statement he said he could substantiate, then couldn't. And I agree that the number of players has declined over time. 
---
Let it go. 
---
Look at that red arrow pointing at nothing important...
---
Nobody is stealing from me, they're just making a frustrating event even more annoying. (talking about those afkers) 
---
The system he described *was* bullying. 
---
I think the "links" are rigid so it would rotate like the Falkirk wheel. That is what is suggested here: https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Monorail_elevator
---
I hate the PVP in 76. I suspect most of the annoying people will stay to annoy us further.
---
Some folks just need to take the plunge.
---
LOL, I turned my buddy's place into a cat temple...just wall papered the inside with cat paintings
---
Reading this post created a vision of a 12 year old, self centered, spoiled child, that's frustrated their Mommy can't buy them their own private server.
---
You have no right to ask someone to vacate a server (Politely or otherwise), much less an expectation that they will.
---
I often Team with friends, and sometimes it's difficult to find a server that we can all get together on, and even harder to find one that will allow all 4 of our CAMPs to place on, but I have never even remotely considered asking someone else to leave, or worse, as you suggest, harassing them to do so.
---
Occasionally when I log in, I find myself on a nearly empty server, you should use this method to get your group together;
---
Each player logs in, Checks server for number of players, and the one with a sparsely populated server notifies the rest of the party to join them.
---
Your harassment of some players may work, but trust me when I say, you won't get what you want from harassing me, as I'm much more likely to invite a friend to join me than I am to server hop.
---
XD
---
*whispers* It's in the game files. 
---
No. Use ur bloodpacks to make stimpaks 
---
they bloom at night and i've seen them near dyer chemical. 
---
So this is yet another excuse for griefing, gotcha.
---
Healing salve recipe is free 
---
I have a headset mic thats normally several feet away from me - (I only use the headset playing at night so I don't disturb other people in the house)
---
Sometimes other players comment they have a hard time hearing me - when I move the mic closer, that problem goes away.
---
Omg. That would've been mint. I think the pvp guy I hate the most right now is the one that calls you lazy for not grinding out god roll gear but their main reason for being a shithead is to "easily acquire junk and caps". Seems slightly hypocritical. Lol. 
---
Why should they complete game objectives in Survival mode when they can do it in Adventure mode. Take SBQ, in survival mode it can be hard as hell, because not only have to you now deal with PVE element, but also PVP element. Doing game objectives in Survival Mode is just going to be waste of time, if you want to actually do them. 
---
You'll hear this from players again and again until you remove PvP completely in at least one full game mode.  Changes to Pacifist might help but it will not put an end to the complains from the players who want nothing to do with PvP, and be able to enjoy the game to its full potential including workshops.  As I've suggested previously, there can be alternatives to PvP to contest workshop ownership, such that PvP is totally not needed for adventure mode.
---
Stop enabling bullies and we'll stop complaining about it.
---
Not I.  I hope all the PVPers go there and leave me alone.
---
This.
---
And in the vein of their comment, fuck them lol
---
I did not know this. Thanks, now I'm going stealth.
---
What I do to farm legendary/xp/junk. Start at Whitesprings service entrance, follow houses until you hit country club, then follow houses until you hit laundry building, then repeat. Works well with Nuked/Not Nuked.
---
Inflatable?
---
Like the statues of Vault Boy?
---
If I remember right you get those out of the Overseer stash in the airport. There's one with a Santa hat in the Atom Store. 
---
You probably have it already. 
---
It's under floor decorations. Like 3/4 of the way down the list on the left. 
---
93 I think 🤔🤔
---
But...eating it causes a hypertension resulting in an endurance debuff.
---
I will use the one I have now for quests and events  (the main one) and in the survival one I will maimly replay the quests, without hurrying.
---
Ya but then they give there buddy all your caps so you can't get it back off of them. Kind of a nazi- Switzerland gold exchange dynamic 
---
can craft and sell for caps?
---
Lol everyone of those only “pop” when approached 
---
I would spend hours fishing for mutated bass, make me some fried rad fish.  Maybe a baked blinky fish...
---
My observations suggest that each rack/spawn has a level range. Most every rack/spawn east of Blackwater Mine seem to range from level 40-50. 
---
From many visits to Solomon's Pond, Emmett Mountain Disposal, and the four Watoga racks/spawns, they seems to be nearly equal-probability RNG between type (T-45, T-51b, T-60) and which three of the six body parts spawn. If it was T-51b or T-60 the level of all parts that appear would be randomly selected as level 40 or 50. I believe T-45 would always be level 45 on those racks. 
---
There might be a few spawns that are a fixed level; for example the trailer at the Gorge Junkyard seems to always be level 15. 
---
Glowing blood pack gives you radiation resistance without affecting your mutations like rad-x does
---
How Come: I run a fallout 76 community and got a second account to house community weapon/armors/junk.  
---
Is it worth it: I would say yes, I get to try/make all sorts of builds.  
---
Benefits: If you like doing builds then yes.  
---
My original character is a modge-podge of skills and crafts alot, all the other builds are specific.
---
and reduce the time before they explode
---
I may ~~have an addiction~~ like this game!
---
Thy gnome god hath taken note, blasphemous fooooll!!
---
The slower lvl 50 gun gives you 29.91% better effective damage against armored targets and 3.91% higher effective DPS. So even though the lvl 40 has a DPS factor of 90 x 1.25 = `112.5` vs `109` , DPS doesn't matter against armored enemies but higher damage does. Yet in other worlds, the better speed of 40 still takes longer to kill the same target because the lower damage it produces is eaten up by the armor more.
---
If you are using a hunting rifle I can assure you can not be doing that much damage. My furious prime gatling plasma starts at 72 damage without 5 adrenaline and nerd rage active. I usually get up to 120 damage not counting the furious effect. The minigun doesn't use .50 cal rounds it uses 5mm. I use a furious prime. 50 cal machine gun. You might want to rethink how much damage you are doing before you start complaining about other people joining the fight.
---
Furious explosive! Prime that bad boy up and you'll see a noticeable difference.
---
It might mean R&amp;G station, get there by fallowing the railroad far enough south from whitespring station
---
Sent you a PM!
---
The trophies for the first part of the game (exit the vault, reach lvl 10, so on..) never triggered in my main game after beta so i will be restarting just to hit those trophies. Plus i think it will be amazing to actually negotiate with people on the server and constantly question if the human player is going to kill you or not. At the very least it will be interesting to see how it plays out.
---
Bethesda should wipe their account of any stats in the game. Make them start new. If they dupe again, they should receive a permanent ban. Duping only hurts the game and other players. I have no remorse for those who do exploit the game to duplicate items. 
---
My question is how do you get back to the free/extra/unused cards?  
---
The only time I can see all of them is at Level up time.
---
Wasn't it a reward for quest line in mire?
---
At this point I'd pretty rarely run into any bugs other than the occasional Frozen enemy which is always great for a picture.  
---
U learn by scrapping u don't automatically learn a mod on a gun..if u scrap u might learn a mod but it's random 
---
At 95 currently and still haven’t launched my own nuke. Just busy building camps and collecting junk and caps 
---
There are army fatigues and dirty army fatigues. They are pretty commonly found at cam McClintock.
---
I'm a bit curious.  Is there going to be patch 7 before march 12th or is everything already in the files?  I have not seen anything on the servers going down tomorrow and I'm curious!
---
Left hand didn't know what the right hand was doing.  Whoever changed the loot drops to be something you "Steal" (a wrong-headed move, imo) forgot to remove or change the quest surrounding them.
---
Same...  One day I will when I feel like trudging through beginners hell again.
---
Favorite Finn joke:
---
Two Finns walk into a bar, order a bottle of vodka each. They drink the bottles. First asks the other "Another?" "Sure". They down the second set of bottles. 
---
First asks the other "Another?" Second replies "Did you come here to drink or did you come here to chit-chat?"
---
Lv. 134.
---
I know. I'm just curious if you would be able to craft them instead or find plans of it.
---
I dont need to buy any gear but I'd just like to applaud you guys for done awesome names 
---
I just started playing again last Saturday. I honestly don’t even remember how long I played the game, but it was enough for me to start liking the game again. I haven’t been disconnecting, but have faced a few bugs. There is some instability on the Xbox, which is causing lag when people spam their weapons. I also have this bug that keeps decreasing my weapon damage stats for absolutely no reason. Other than that, I’ve been enjoying since logging back online. 
---
Haha, they are going to kill you. Adventure mode is where you can question someone's intentions. I had the same problem with the trophies luckily I knocked those I missed in 15mins.
---
My damage gets up to 245-250 per shot. I'm using a build focused on rifles and vats crits. Every second or third shot is a critical - &gt; double damage. I don't know how much damage ultracite ammo adds up over the regular amount but even without crits/ultracite 250*200=50000.
---
I'm pleased with that amount 
---
I'm hoping for MORE SHIT, designed to push more "roleplaying" characters. More career outfits, more emotes (give me some "begging" emotes for everything in the game, not just food and drink).
---
GIVE US A COSTUME STATION for dying costumes. Make us hunt for the mats to make dye, if need be, but let us do it!
---
Basically, there isn’t one. The Hardened .308 outdamages every .50 receiver.
---
Probably going to play both. I made my PvP characters in PvE servers. 
---
I really dislike PVP and limit my participation to three potential scenarios:
---
1. A friend needs help and I don't they have it coming;
---
2. I see someone bullying a low-level character or wrecking a base;
---
3. Some asshole fucks up the SBQ so that none of us get any rewards.
---
Toxic Larry's Meat N' Go spawns 3 snallygasters every time.
---
I have another question.
---
How do I remove rads without removing my mutation?
---
I have the marsupial mutation and I want to keep it. Scared to use radaway because i did that last time I was mutated and it removed it.
---
If Pacifist mode means you can't be hurt and your base can't be hurt, what difference would it make if it's a PvE server or not? I think making pacifist mode essential be your own PvE experience is better than forcing people to choose. I typically play solo, and for the most part don't engage in PvP, but like the option that any potential player I run into could be a raider or neer-do-well.  Also, I seriously doubt you will ever have a strictly PvE server, despite people's wanting one. It just doesn't make any sense. IT's not a PvE experience, it was never promised to be one, and so the epxectaiton to make it one is arrogant and a little off base.
---
Oh and there are also those ~300 50cal rounds :) 
---
we're not talking about the completely different damage regen bug that is well known and has been addressed by Beth already, we're talking about getting noticed when we are clearly still hidden, in OPs case it's when his non sneak teammates engage the enemy he is automatically not hidden even when he should be...
---
I really do hope the pvp servers alleviate some of the horse shit people are forced to put up with. But I fear it won't. The assholes will stay and the try hards (that prolly weren't griefing and being assholes to begin with) will go. I just wish there was a better system for the pvp. If I'm in pacifist, I don't wanna waste stimpacks healing slap damage from some 13 yr old that's mad he can't get his way. I want an invite, like a team invite. "&lt;insert ign&gt; has invited you to pvp" would be amazing. This would only apply to outside of workshop situations. Otherwise, if I'm in pacifist mode, you may as well be slapping a tree. 
---
You can just wait for the owner to look first, then it is free for everyone.
---
DR is just a part of the equation - you should absolutely build around damage mitigation perks/effects for a proper tank (blocker, lone wanderer, sentinel, cavalier, creature type resists).  And for bloodied add Serendipity/Nerd Rage/Dodgy although it seems those guys still go down if they're not careful at times.
---
My unarmed build is a tank except for rads - rads will kill me in next to no time.  Ghouls only hurt because of rads.  DR is only useful until you get to a certain point - around 400-500 DR is plenty, what you need is other damage reduction/mitigation effects.  Fireproof or dense chest for explosive damage and scorchbeasts.
---
I would love it if 3 x01 chubs with wannabe good weapons barged into my workshop. The sight of their x01 in PvP means I’m about to make a lot of caps, woohoo!
---
Is that someone who needs me to kick their ASS?!
---
A graft on monster almost always spawns near the positron energy plant, the destroyed golf course in the northern part of the map, or in the town of Grafton (during the Grafton Day event). 
---
Yeah I know the .308 is better, and I will be using that later on when I bank some 308, I just wondered out of the .50 cal which one was better.
---
I believe Toxic Larry's Meat n' Go has a guaranteed snallygaster spawn (three of them). If it's not guaranteed it's very high likelihood to be them. I've had all of my Mothman encounters in the Savage Divide. Several of them on the southern cliffs near the vault.
---
It's not so much to get into someones house or anything.  Apparently, from what I remember, people would place camps with a build area that included a locked door in the wild.  For example, say you want to get through an armory door, you fiddle around with your camp placement to find a spot that it'll let you place it that includes the door in the build area, then find a way to put the mat on the far side of the door.  After that you just fast travel to the other side of the door and get whatever is inside, the fast travel back out.  It's was something to that extent.  Ideally they would just make it where all doors int he wild were outside of an area you can place your camp in, but it was easier to just remove the mat.
---
But if you keep killing them you keep getting their caps haha.
---
That one cranberry sandwich place in the ash heap literally explained this logic oddly enough.  Some guy had a shop with a specialty cranberry sandwich, well he basically had a monopoly in the town until a competitor setup shop right across the street AND had a better tasting cranberry sandwich.  So the guy got crazy about it and stalked a supply truck all the way to a nuclear waste disposal site where his competitor was getting irradiated cranberries (diseased cranberries I guess?).  Guy could not believe it and decided to inform his competition's customers.
---
His sales numbers hinted that it worked and he began getting customers back.  Then the bombs fell.
---
It's even better when everytime I join a server their aren't enough ppl in hunter/hunted but yet so many ppl love pvp
---
They’re just achievements,  I’d rather have Bethesda keep working on content. 
---
You request for them to duel via a notification you can pull up on their character wheel. Same thing as requesting someone to trade in f76.
---
This game should have always been coop PvE from the start - that's a multiplayer experience for the Fallout universe that's desired by a lot of the core Fallout base.
---
Its really unfortunate that misguided aspirations to copy Fortnite has led us down this path of badly conceived PvP.  Devs are out of touch unfortunately.
---
Big hands small buttons.   I know
---
Same here.  Fast Travel to the AMS headquarters and it's directly in front of you.  Server hop a few times.  Gotta give it time to spawn in though.
---
Haha nice
---
i think it's intentional. i'm pretty sure the quest is going to continue with future DLC
---
Sometimes my Mysterious Stranger spawns in just his underwear, and I feel awful, because it seems I caught him at a bad time.
---
 It's like 'my bad guy, you could've finished what you were doing, this firefight isn't that important.'
---
275
---
Hmm really, then what do you call killing a full team of players over and over without them ever spotting you?
---
Craftable pressure canners: Vastly extended shelf life, but with a low chance of serious disease due to post-apoc hygiene conditions and the chance of error.
---
Craftable food dehydrators: Lowered ration weight, increased need for water.
---
That would be awesome. Maybe if the radio would say once in a while if the vendord are back in business or not
---
On one hand, having to double up on the number of recipes (or add another tab for "Purified" food) seems excessive.
---
On the other, I doubt there's any other way you could have rad and non-rad outputs without having two separate entries.
---
101
---
Yeah until earth is in danger of being impacted by a giant nuclear trash ball and then we’ll have to fire a second nuclear trash ball at it to save earth!
---
Yep. Bullies shouldn't be accommodated. It makes them bully more. 
---
I hope they fix it.
---
Do you use beserker’s weapons on your build? Been thinking of trying this at some point to actually make use of them. Seems like they’d be good for your play style 
---
Always happens to me with ghouls, even in fallout 4!
---
Lol, okay... I don’t think so. Let’s leave it st that. 
---
I do. You can have it.
---
Maybe you had a workshop and they initiated PvP by taking it.
---
I wish, but even so, due to mouse acceleration present in Bethesda games, aiming is a pain. Also, the blur will make long range sniping impossible. Also, bullet damage fall is way to steep.
---
You can craft 150 .50 rounds for the same lead as 24 (or was it 36) .308 for not a significant damage loss for a low lvl char.
---
It's not the pvp they love. They just love doing what they can't in real life. Lmao. 
---
No, it wrecks, it’s for melee users though.
---
But if they have it set to only hear their friends or people they're grouped with, they wont hear you.
---
nope they killed me in my base...
---
XD that is great! I feel bad when I see super-mutants without clothes, I mean they need to die but I can at least let him dress his best before...
---
Did it yesterday, same issue for me. Nothing in containers
---
What do you want for it?
---
That damned Nuka Cola machine in the Fort Defiance upstairs bathroom is my 1 that makes me open the 99 others. Damn you!
---
129 currently 
---
Private servers would require people to pay out of pocket for the privilege. Let’s start the conversation there. 
---
Oxhorn is Sellout76.
---
I understand rifles do good damage I'm not knocking that. When it comes to the queen you need a ton of damage and fast. By time you put 3 clips in her a good big gun will exceed that damage easily. My build is setup for shotguns and big guns. I use to use the prime two shot shotgun. Vats the entire time. Better crits 3, crit savy 3, four leaf clover 3. I got crits every other hit. I thought it was the best until I switched to big guns. I just dont see how you can complain about other people showing up and getting a reward if that's all the ammo you spend on the queen fight. My group holds onto glowing mass, high rad fluids, and hardened mass just to craft stable flux and create ultracite ammo. That doesn't even count for the amount of steel, lead, and acid needed to create the bullets and cores.
---
Depends on what type of hunting rifle you plan on using with that 50 cap receiver. I'm using a haste one on a two shot rifle and it's pretty decent. (but ofc there's the lack of accuracy on two shot weapons).
---
My main damage rifle will remain a 308, 50 cal and 45 lever action rifle will be my secondary ones. 
---
It doesn't work because the Plasma Gun with a flamer mod is coded to work with rifle perks because it's considered a plasma rifle.  Tank Killer perk works with the plasma flamer, Friendly Fire perk does not.  I'll take losing the stagger for healing teammates.
---
Yeah only real problem with melee is how pvp is started most of the time. If you are ranged they will already be in range to hit you if you start pvp. Only time I pvp is at workshops and iv never been killed by a melee player.  I run a stealth vats sniper build. 
---
It's a trap!
---
Oh man. I feel that would be amazing for people that don't wanna pvp at all. I rarely claim a workshop. I'd rather just give you what you're looking for over dealing with someone following me around using slap damage to irritate me. 
---
Starched Genes perk. It's not available until after level 30 though. 
---
Yes, but the developers of this game are stupid. If they begin to take your workshop, PvP begins and they can attack you anywhere on the map
---
But there are 5 different recipes for Disease Cure, Detoxing Salve, and Healing Salve. 
---
And almost every piece of armor and weapon has multiple crafting plans with different required components depending on the level you want to craft.
---
I'll take this change totally, the syringer needs some better mods.  Anything to shoot my friends back to health lol
---
Fort Defiance - Upstairs bathroom. Can't remember if it's 2nd or 3rd floor though. But I think it's the 3rd. That stall singlehandedly has me opening all of the others in the game. Damn Nuka Cola grenades! Why must you be soooo good?!?!?
---
Reporting back after more experimentation, I went to the Dyer Chemical area at night, stuck around until after midnight but nothing showed. I then server hoped and it was slightly ealier 11pm there, and I waited a bit longer, but still nothing. Another server hop and it was mid afternoon around 2-3pm, I fast traveled back to Dyer Chemical because I ended up at the Treehouse Village, on arrival at Dyer in the area you fast travel to, I found several Strangler Blooms right there in the stream to the north of Dyer. The Heart of the Swamp event was not active, though it may have been just prior to me server hopping.
---
So I still don't feel like I understand how the pods bloom, but it seems like as for many things in this game, server hopping is the most reliable way for you to get this. 
---
Also to note, the "Swamp Plant" that is part of the "Harvest Fungi, Plants, and Nuked Flora" challenge, only some times comes allong with the bloom as a seperate item, that was why I didn't get this when I did the original quest. I picked 5 blooms and only got Swamp Plant 4/5 of those times. You will definitely want Green Thumbs and Chemist perks to make the most of this, the 5 blooms became 10, and chemist made 20 radshield from the 10 blooms.
---
My armor isn’t giving the bonus HP currently. So my guess is no.
---
jesus that might be....
---
Its so stupid.....thx for clearing this up.
---
And whats the thing with those tesla rifles? When i do PvP they often kill me in 1 second too even though i have about 500 energy resistance.
---
I understand that logic do what I cant in real life when it comes to jetpacks and sticking the superhero landing after jumping off a mountain. But they were just randomly running up and suckerpunching ppl in real life. Unfortunately they found that came with consequences like being locked up with a chance at prison rape.
---
PC, do it regularly.
---
Did it yesterday four times with three different toons in three different server instances.
---
Every time containers had loot and once it finally yielded the Meteorithic Sword.
---
I play this event every time it is on the map (I always need lead and Steel) and never have an issue with it... albeit I am generally always solo when doing the event. ( I on PC).
---
You don't have to be at the workshop. Someone can flag you for pvp no matter where you are on the map. It sounds like you had a workshop. Theres 20 posts about this a week. Always the same shit. Either they had teamamtes that flagged or they had a workshop.
---
Or fighting global warming with giant ice cubes in the ocean?
---
Thank you very much for taking the time to calculate this and actually explain why it is better.
---
This site is probably also a bit of a parody of the Yucca Mountain project in Nevada.  The US government has been trying to get it off the ground as the repository for long term nuclear waste for a long while, and it's been on and off many times over the last 20 years or so.  
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca\_Mountain\_nuclear\_waste\_repository](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository)
---
One of the reasons that makes me think that Yucca is being parodied is the initiatives around signage and the like that was supposed to communicate "scary stuff in here" to any survivors of societal collapse.  Some of it was kind of ridiculous

---
No doubt! It’s not the quickest farming location.
---
Nuclear material is only dangerous because it contains energy (besides plutonium, which is also toxic). It’s only “waste” until someone finds a way to use that energy, at which point disposal sites become mines. 
---
Once I whip out my big gun it'll run away terrified 😂
---
Agreed. Because of this I'm already getting a little tired of the daily/weekly challenges that have you claim a workshop. Like, we get it. You keep trying to foist PvP on players. Instead, start listening to your player base and eliminate PvP entirely from Adventure mode. Let the PvPers all play in Survival mode all they want. 
---
Glowing blood is worth as much as a glowing blood pack, so not worth it financially
---
Could be an anti armor, explosive (explosive perks) with a critical shot. Or even using a bloodied build.
---
Crouching = sneaking (w/o agililty perk)
---
Normal joystick movement = walking + running
---
L3 + Joystick with AP available, and not overencumbered = Sprinting
---
Nah but you've jumped onto it like you had any better source, even while admitting that they number declined significantly.
---
Wait...there’s a traveling salesmen deathclaw?
---
Any story that ends with unhappy griefers is a good one. 
---
A stimpack rifle... Hmm I can dig it.
---
I'm with you Ikar . I'm lvl 138. Have all 3* Bolstering armor, 9 mutations, countless OP weapons etc etc. And lo and behold some asshat decides to sneeze on me while I'm scavenging, and boom! Dead. Or I finally decide to engage the nuisance who has been slapping me for 5 minutes. Open fire on him/her. 1 shot, dead. Really?  This happened to me Friday while I was looting around ToW. Some guy just randomly comes up and tries to make me shoot him by stepping in front of enemies. I didn't bite. This goes on for 5 minutes, so I stash my junk and shoot him to engage. 3 Explosive shotgun shells take him down to literally dead. I mean there was no red to be seen in his bar. I hit him with 2 MORE that were confirmed hits according to the cross hairs. 1 melee swipe and I'm dead. Really? Something is amiss here. I can accept the fact that I suck at PvP, but something literally does not add up to me.
---
Instigating Pump. 1 star.
---
I have a 3 star berserker pump with 10% more dmg while aiming a plus 1 per but even tho it has far more base dmg it doesnt have the sneak attack one shot potential. It underperforms. 
---
If you dont mind me asking what level is the character you use?
---
&gt;This game should have always been coop PvE only from the start - that's a multiplayer experience for the Fallout universe that's desired by a lot of the core Fallout base.
---
.... you know what the fallout universe is right...
---
My 50k minimum damage is still more than what those people on top of the shed did. And I do understand that I'm not #1 on damage dealt all the time but I'm damn sure I'm not at the bottom of the list. I can literally see the hp bar shrinking with each shot I take.
---
I know I'm reloading really slowly and I only have 5 shells in a magazine, all of this is making it even more annoying when people are just sitting not doing shit.
---
I have to both kill adds AND contribute substantially on the main fight with my slow ass guns while others are just sitting there.
---
I would spend more ammo but my guns can't fire fast enough. 
---
And yeah your dps may be higher at the expense of ammo but rifles are more efficient in using that ammo.
---
If I only deal 50k in damage I want my reward to reflect that. If you can deal 100k your reward should reflect that. If average Joe does 5k his reward should reflect that. You get the idea. 
---
I believe no matter where you set your camp, enemies spawn and attack your camp. It just depends on the location that spawns different types of enemies. I would imagine placing it at the edge of the map will still spawn something.
---

The radioactivity they produce highly irradiates the surrounding area, and all living cells structure are destroyed by such energy making life in that specified area impossible for many thousands of years. A way to harness that energy would be very interesting to see the concept of, but no process through which humanity produces energy produces zero biproduct. It is simply impossible to do so let alone with material that is inherently damaging to life as a whole
---
Hey do you guys have a civil war top hat plan?
---
Or Gun Runners Arsenal, or Wasteland Workshop? I agree it's a bit weird calling free updates DLC, but not every DLC is a big story expansion...
---
Found mine at Brimm Quarry.  There's a wooden crate on the south side of the office where the work benches are.  There's a sack to the right of it.  There's something there 4/10 times or so.  
---
Previous iterations of FO taught us to hoard everything; not a good thing in FO 76.
---
Weight reduction perks help.  I'm still bumping the weight limits as well, but am getting somewhat better about it :)
---
If you have loose PA parts, put them in a frame.  separately, the frame weighs 10, the parts are aonther 50 or so.  When stored as a unit, the entire unit (parts+frame) weight is 10
---
If the parts are above your level, you cannot select the triangle (it'll tell you to unequip the higher level stuff), but it you wait for it, it will autorecall to your inventory as a 10# item.
---
Scrap duplicate weapons for mods, etc.   Figure out which weapoNs are not worth the weight.  ex:  I found a light machine gun (.308), its damage is not worth the 20# weight.  Takes 8-11 rounds to take out a L10 mutant, but my 308 sniper can do it in 2, or 1 if I'm in sneak.
---
I'm L38
---
  Steel, lead, aluminum, screws, gears, wood, adhesive, gunpowder, acid (for smelting ore), cloth, ballistic fiber, and plastic are the things I use most.
---
Glass, ceramic, cork, circuits, gold, and most chems I use the least.
---
109 and also haven’t launched a nuke yet, just taking my time enjoying the game 
---
I just received a two star Medic's combat rifle with explosive ammo. I'm only level 33, so it is a much more powerful combat rifle than my last non-legendary one.
---
All I see is the helicopter move now...
---
I believe that completely avoiding attacks is impossible. It appears from my experience that a random encounter is attached to the camp and can trigger at any point a Player is within the camps sphere of influence.
---
So ideally you want to build in a low level area (the forest) and some where with low traffic.  I have friends who swear by the North End of the Forest where there is almost no map markers.
---
Agreed. I'm pretty tired of Bethesda's nonstop, ongoing attempts at foisting PvP onto players who, judging from online comments, mostly don't want it. 
---
The very top of Senchea Rock, i have had a Camp there and it was never attacked
---
165
---
173 as of last night
---
Fair point.
---
Im a Welder. Mainly light structural.
---
True. But I still want some dang loot. lol
---
i got duped, when a box happen to drop near me, by someone claiming to have no pins. as soon as i opened it...one shot and i was down. "oh no" he cried, and proceeded to take my bag along with the box loot. 
---
ignorance is not bliss.
---
No. Simple.
---
I have no confirmation but between my two characters one camp gets attacked alot more than the other. Location is almost the same. Only difference is one has turrets and the other has no defense whatsoever. The camp with the turrets is the one that gets attacked but nothing big like scorched beasts. Kinda thing the more defense it has the higher the likelihood that it gets attacked. But I'm just guessing. If anyone has more info I'd like to hear it too.
---
I'm down for people being to turn it off but in all reality... people that dont want ANY pvp in a multiplayer fallout game know what the fallout universe is right?
---
I figure there are more psychotic people than I first thought playing this. 
---
 This one I could get behind. Jerky... same food value... negative water value. Low weight. Craft jerky using any raw meat. Counts as meat for mutation purposes.  Bonus... Jerky had 0 rads. 
---
I can see how pvp orientated players may perceive it as in invite, however that’s far from always being the intention of the player holding the workshop.  
---
It is however a perfectly acceptable risk and an enjoyable aspect of the game. 
---
If someone is talking on mic, they already have a mic icon over their head. 
---
180 as of yesterday. I love The Mire but the events seem not to pop as much as the do at other locations. 
---
Babysitter of grown ass adults.
---
I was thinking more along the lines of the bullied doing the bullying. My day sucked really bad, lemme hop on fallout and go ruin other people's day. And consequences bring up a fair point. There are currently no consequences for a guy following me around slapping me with his 6k damage deathclaw gauntlet. He gets to do it till I leave or engage him with zero consequence what so ever. 
---
We know. 
---
Looking forward to grinding the shit out of it
---
Making drops specific to just the player who enabled the drop was a huge mistake on Bethesda's part. I used to love seeing players show up for one and now I don't bother doing them. 
---
Now have him trade that ammo back and fourth with an alt 20 times over the course or the month.
---
I'm not saying that guy was innocent, but the terms of wee completely different. Also it was  ulteacite ammo. Rarer shit.
---
I'll be switching. But I just find it humorous how a small majority of people want no pvp servers in a fallout universe game. Now I'm not talking shit if you dont want pvp pacifist mode should be for you but just know that your gonna have somethings at a disadvantage or right out unavailable to you.
---
&gt;This game should have always been coop PvE only from the start
---
What dictates that? If anything, this game should have come out without slap damage, especially with such a unchallenging PVE. Atleast then players would been the challenge, game would been interesting to play and lasted longer. 
---
This is pretty awesome. I work on an ambulance and spend time looking through this sub. Pretty cool hearing what everyone does. 
---
We call those “teaching moments” hehe.
---
This doesn’t happen with my unstable isotope.
---
Paid for studies are reading up again
---
Ive never had the mysterious stranger actually kill ANYTHING!
---
he does show up every now and then, but  when he does, and attacks an enemy, he does little or no damage!
---
HE SHOULD 1 SHOT MOST ENEMIES!
---
I mean, you use a whole perk card for him, he hardly ever shows up, and when he does, he doesnt even kill enemies
---
In FO3/4, mysterious stranger was awesome, because when he showed up, you KNEW he was going to kill that enemy...
---
Ah so you've also got an unbalanced weapon 
---
Yeah I've done it solo and with a few friends. Had it go wrong in both instances 
---
I’m gonna play both when I want to. I’m trilled about Adventure mode because I love more hardcore elements as it makes things even more interesting and suspenseful! I think it will definitely make the game more IMPACTFUL! Love and can’t wait to see the hardcore elements Bethesda has planed in that mode!
---
I'm posted up by Site Alpha and I mostly get small stuff like mole rats and mongrel dogs. Occasionally wolves, maybe two or three super mutants (and rarely high level, usually under level 20 or 30), and one time Mothman stopped by during the event. There's a couple nice spots on small lakes up there, if you follow the river from Site Alpha you'll see a couple more spots.
---
It probably has something to do with turrets too but I only have one heavy laser turret and that's been my experience.
---
88 here too!
---
I just recently explored that area for the first time, it is cool. Way out there, didn't see a terminal, gonna have to check that out 
---
Thanks for replies folks. I'll stick a ticket in for this one I think and let them know its only a few folk effected 
---
The helmet is now a separate item you need to craft.
---
Please read patch notes and the inside the vault's, it really clears up a lot.
---
98 - Rifleman build
---
58 - Stealth Assassin Melee
---
08 - Heavy Weapons Hoss.
---
Also a level 16 alt
---
&gt;Especially when a player can obtain a full set with duping proceeds. What are the odds of finding a full set of these legendaries since game launch?
---
A full set of assassin's sentinel? Sounds tough, but doable with trading. Same if you want a full set of matching (same style) heavy sentinel or whatever. But just a full set of one effect? Not hard at all. My main (level 1305ish) has multiple sets--a full untyielding set, a full weightless set, etc., without ever trading for any or really hardcore farming or anything.
---
Exactly - PvP has basically been shoved on those who don't want it.  I've yet to see the Devs address to us in their grand plans why they still need to have PvP and keep this bad system of slap damage in the game, other than their misguided attempts to push PvP on players that don't want it.
---
I wont play survial mode for sure though lol. This pvp is totally inbalanced.
---
I'm waiting for the update to passive mode. I have gotten quite tired of impatient kids running into the train station at Whitesprings and stabbing me because they don't want to wait for the trader bot.
---
If they aren't legendary, you don't get legendary stuff.  So yeah, working as normal.  You got XP for it though, so quit your whining.
---
A single player, RPG game, that was ported into multiplayer.  Meaning its mechanics and foundations makes for terrible PvP balance and all PvP in this game is pure cheese.  A builds based, equipment dependent system makes for terrible PvP experience and balancing PvP will suck all the fun out of the PvE side of the game.
---
You say small majority and I start laugh, since that's an oxymoron. So, a small "greater number" of ppl want no pvp?  Of my list of 20 friends, 1 actively plays pvp while I've had 3 stop playing due to trolls and the game bugs
---
That will be the last drop I think. Since the release they have been watering down PVP and giving players so many options to protect themselves from PVP, at this point I can't even imagine how incapable one has to be to not be able deal with it. And now they think about giving people full protection mode, wtf?!?!?!!?! If you want us to play singleplayer game, where people doesn't matter, then build a singleplayer game and not online game.   
---
135 on my main 91, 40, 16 on my others.... I play too much 😖
---
A suggestion if you are not happy with the amount of ammo you are using. If you or someone else nukes whitesprings or prime stick around and collect materials for stable flux. Use ammosmith and super duper and craft the ammo. If I was able to craft 2000 plus rounds of shotgun shells then you can craft at least 1000 rounds of .308. You can craft 180 ultracite .50 cal in one craft. Not sure if you can get the prime receiver though. Also might want to look into a bloodied sniper. Emergency protocols on power armor chest piece will keep you alive longer too. Good luck.
---
Did you even read the roadmap?
---
This Fallout version is my first melee build and like you, I love it.  Was always stealthy, sniper rifle guy in all the others.  I love my tanky, 2 handed, melee build.  It fits my lone wanderer play style just perfectly. I carry 2 Grog axes and an All Rise.  I have a SSE shotty for when I need to reach out a little for pesky rooftop enemies and multiple yogi's ( those damn bears can kill you if two or three gang up on you), so its nice to cripple them or bring their hp down a bit before engaging a troika of them. Not having to fab or scrounge ammo all the time is nice too!  I don't PVP by choice, but when I've had to, I've have had quite acceptable results with my melee build in defending myself.  
---
Yeah, that’s definitely not right and it ruins other people’s experience. There’s no way a character should be able to do that. Hopefully they’ll get caught and banned soon enough. 
---
I'd say expect a more detailed "summer" roadmap sometime late April/ Early may.
---
It would have died way sooner then.  Cause about 80% of the players would have left within their first week of playing such a game.
---
Out of the threaded path - so to speak - always works best for me.
---
Places where other players are highly unlikely to pass by and trigger an event and also lacking on 'naturally occurring' spawns in the vicinity.
---
I tend to use the outer edges of the map, away from marked locations/fast travel 'landing' destinations.
---
Needless to say far away from fissures too; SBs while airborne can be aggro'd by mobs not in the 'scorched' faction from miles away and once they have 'tasted blood' they tend to linger and circle around looking for more trouble. 
---
Son of a bitch, that's the exact spot where my camp is! Acid extractor for the win!
---
If the team is so small they have to pick and choose then we're fucked. 
---
Lol 371
---
Yep. If you don’t have mutations make stimpacks. If you do, make glowing blood for the rad resist. 
---
This is absolutely true, but i just assumed it was because the turrets either picked a fight or drew attention of something that otherwise would have walked by.
---
Yeah. I probably won't either. Unless I decide to make a solely PvP Character from scratch. Not really my cup of tea though. I'm generally not out looking for a fight. 
---
He described the lack of a system leading to bullying. 
---
I thought the same thing back when I was level 15: "oh I can take it out with my sniper rifle before it gets to me." 
---
I was wrong.
---
You'll definitely have a better experience at lvl 70.
---
Hahaha I totally get that. I get shit rewards all the time. Honestly they need to get rid of the ultracite power armor pieces and give us 2 plans for the mods. I get shitty 2 star armor or weapons from her everytime. I got one serum and it was empath so that was useless. I would say 95% of the fights we all just junk what she gives us.
---
Ok thanks
---
I find most places on steep cliffs to be reasonable safe.  Just visit it a few times to make sure its not a regular enemy spawn or scoechbeaat fly over.  Avoid high traffic locations and/or resource nodes 
---
Why would reg ammo be flagged in the email then?
---
I run a stealth one handed build.  I am currently decked in a full set of trapper gear.  I am still able to walk right up and attack without being noticed...
---
Except if I turn on my Pipboy light.  Then I am noticed as I get close.
---
I am not running Sturdy Frame at all.
---
I submitted a ticket, I prob lost over 2k caps to it, friend who is over level 250 lost a lot, son lost some.   Overall buncha BS.
---
I also found this terminal interesting.  
---
This game has so much great environmental storytelling and is perfect for solo 'exploration' type gameplay.  The problem is, I think far too many people overlook this aspect of the game...especially if the game is played with a group of other players.
---
Randomly found or scraping combat rifles 
---
Local time would be excellent with the clock! Ability to set an in game timer with screen popup would be great as well.  Modders have to be attempting this already.
---
Instigating Lever Action
---
A good trade-off giving me the required firepower and rapid fire rate. Plus shares the bullets with radium-rifle for ease of ammo crafting and PVP fun
---
In that case of my list of about 60 friends that played the game on release about 30-40 of them still play on a weekly basis atleast and easy 20 of them love pvp. And no we arnt melee players I'm personally a shotgun/assault player. I'm going off the posts that I actively see on reddit yes people a bitching about pvp but most posts aren't saying they dont want pvp they are saying fix your game.
---
The forest has the lowest level enemies, and i’m sure you could find a decent place on a cliff that would be tough for enemies to get at you
---
I think that long term signage, if it even survives long term, would only bring on more curiosity to those down the road.
---
Not sure if there’s a way to do it, but you could try reporting them. If they’re taking advantage of a glitch in the game, maybe Bethesda can fix it. If they rewrote code, Bethesda definitely needs to know. 
---
&gt; Pretty dumb response considering the cost to take care of nuclear waste is literally infinite
---
"Literally".  That word, it does not mean what you think it means.
---
No, the cost of "taking care" of nuclear waste is obviously not "infinite".  It's not even very large.
---
&gt; What's more is we already have nuclear waste in the Pacific Ocean even before Fukushima, 
---
You seem to have some problems with scale.  The Pacific is rather large you know.  Now, if you were talking about something we emit a lot of, like plastic for example, you might have a point, but the total amount of nuclear "waste" is ridiculously tiny.
---
&gt; What would you have us do, bury it?
---
Fuck no.   Burn it in a [PRISM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(reactor)) or something similar.
---
Yeah i thought it was
---
I still have no idea why they made this change. I quite enjoyed having the occasional supply drop lead me away from my objective, and I enjoyed saving up my requisitions with the idea that I'd be helping others. 
---
Now I pay zero attention to any supply drop and never use my requisitions. I don't know what the reasoning was behind this change, but no sir, I don't like it! xD 
---
160ish main rifle build, 60ish on my alt melee. Looks like similar numbers on here for a lot of others. 150 range must be when people get bored and make a new character :-)
---
please tell me this is on PC...
---
Nuclear waste is also vendor friendly.  Sells for 2 caps a unit, but weighs twice as much as silver, gold, fiberglass, fiber optics and other 2 cap scrap.  If I haven't vended yet, I'll save it.
---
Don't worry too much about Fusion Cores, you start to learn of good places to check after a while. 
---
While trying to manage my stash I took all my &gt;60 fusion cores and decided to burn them off with some power armor since i needed to clear up space in my stash. i started with 13 and now i'm at 23, going up over 20 Levels in the process. I have my set areas i check out every day, not just for cores, but for other junk and vendors
---
RNG only. I don't know that you you can get them from scrapping.
---
I had a friend who tried to get a supply drop, but the cargobob never dropped it.  So he rejoined and tried again, the next one dropped in the same exact spot, but the first crate he had called finally spawned in.  He took both, but he got wanted for taking the contents of his original crate that didn't spawn in.  I had to kill him so nobody else would do it later.
---
Of all the things Bethesda decided to change, I'd say making supply drops count as wanted theft is the silliest thing they've ever done.  I don't think anybody does supply drops anymore, and it used to be calling one in at least attracted one or two people to share it, which was fun.  
---
As an added benefit this would allow an inbound and outbound train to pass each other without a branched track. 
---
I have had the same experience. I have one camp with no powered objects, and one with a water pump, resource generator, and turrets. The one with no power never gets attacked, and the one with is constantly attacked. I have to assume this is written into the game somewhere. 
---
No I just know how to pvp, and power armor is how you lose pvp.
---
I think the issue is that juicehead only reports on the game but doesn’t actually make content on it, like he’ll report controversies or stuff other people did, but doesn’t make content himself. I think people here are looking for guides, tutorials, and cool spots. Juice just doesn’t have that on his channel 
---
Thor....bring forth the ban hammer!!
---
I take it haste is perhaps faster load speed/rate of fire? 
---
138
---
That’s very true!  I just mean that I cared more about changes to gameplay than I do about achievements.  They should be working correctly but their status doesn’t bother me in the slightest.
---
I think the way the formulas work it is ALWAYS a percentage. Instead of stacking your perks ADDITIONALLY  it runs them SEQUENTIALLY.  For example, if you have 50% armor bypass from tankbuster, and 50% armor bypass from an AA weapon, it doesn't simply add them together to get 100%. 
---
First it reduces the damage reduction from their armor rating from tankbuster, taking a 200 DR rating to 100, then applying the AA gun you get another 50% off reducing the remaining DR from 100 to 50. If you have an AA clip on your gun that rewards another 40%, so the DR would drop again to roughly 30 points. 
---
So it's sort of an asymptotic curve function, you can approach zero, but even with many armor bypass perks you can never really reduce their armor completely to zero. 
---
Is that a recent addition? I've been away for a bit but I never received a wanted level in those situations. (Maybe a dozen times doing it). I also didn't think about it legitimately *taking* another player's loot, but it being a per-player loot source.
---
They should *at the very least* make the UI red with "steal" as the visual option like the previous games.
---
Balancing will be a hurdle definitely but ummm...  a builds based, equipment dependent system makes for terrible pvp experience... what mmo's have you played befor? Cause that's damn near EVERY mmo. And 
---
&gt;A single player, RPG game, that was ported into multiplayer. Meaning its mechanics and foundations makes for terrible PvP
---
How would that instantly make it bad? you would need to do the same thing you would need to do in a singleplayer game which is balancing things. But balancing problems comes with any online game. Everyone will complain about something in any game with pvp in it. That's not at you directly I mean everyone will have a gripe with something in a pvp game.
---
Around 12 after i've deleted my first char (was dissatisfied with 1h melee at around level 4isch, daggers especially, what was quite the issue since it was the only thing i invested in)
---
well that dude is hacking his balls off.
---
I'm using a bolt action pipe because I found an awesome Western revolver and the pipe is the only rifle that allows for a rifle/sidearm build.
---
So your pvp majority is at 50% of ppl you know who still play the game but on a weekly basis, whereas mine are daily players. But based off your total listed friends your pvp friends percentage drops to 30
---
I don’t think they are ever going to make power armor legendary, the only thing that makes base armor sets USABLE over PA is their legendary effects. If PA could drop legendary there would never be a reason to equip regular armor ever 
---
My understanding is that you can play both modes so I don't see it being a "switch" necessarily. I am interested because having open PVP bring a lot of new possibilities including what you could do with your camp but not if player kills still award caps based on level. There's no point in me giving up 200 caps a kill against someone level 50 and only getting 50 every time I kill them. Hope they've seriously changed that in the update.
---
Same lol
---
I feel personally attacked
---
I found [a mask](https://i.imgur.com/FkIRUzR.png) last week when looting a random building. I didn't think any of them were available yet.
---
Definitely going to try it, that's for sure.
---
AA The Dragon for 1 shot Vats crits
---
Silenced Furious Lever Action for everything else. 
---
If I come across a hunting rifle with the legen perks I want, I may switch back, just for the .50 refined receiver. 2 point damage reduction is worth it over the .308 hardened, just for the ammo crafting capacity.
---
Heck yeah brother. Let’s hope they heard our suggestions. Seems like a fair amount of Wastelanders would like Atomic Shop items that are Post Apocolyptic in design or just plain less goofy. Would be a real neat surprise if this upcoming DLC let us build miniature forts that actually had a chance of defending us from the Wastes and it’s inhabitants. 
---
Always workshops, that's why I just never mess with them.   Scrap is so easy to find without them that they're useless.
---
If you only care about 1 effect (1 star, or 2/3 star with random extra effects) getting a full set isn't hard. Especially if you don't care about armor style or only taking max level. I have a full set of unyielding armor, a 35ish 3 star bloodied mole miner gauntlet, a 50 1 star bloodied deathclaw gauntlet, and a bloodied .44. didn't dupe my ass off for caps, because I didn't buy any of it. Didn't even start as a melee build. Just decided to see how far I could take it after I had picked up talons, and gotten the mole miner claw and a couple unyielding pieces as drops. Now that character runs around at level 135ish with all mutations (because that's easier than trying to get specific ones, and again, costs no caps), kills most things in one hit, but it's a pain in the ass to play, because just about anything or anyone can kill me.

I have a camp in the Raider tower just west (mid-level 15, 20, 25+) - southwest of Top of the World (put C.A.M.P right under tower). Get spawns of weapons and meds and a lunchbox, with a random plan here and there. Enemies are fairly low and easy to clear out. 
---
Also have one by the hotdog stand in Flatwoods (intro level). Use the substation for power and get an office fan, empty oil can, random plans and stuff from it as well. Low level Scorched to scrap their weapons and get ammo.
---
Higher level (50's and 60's) - I have a camp just south of Silo A spanning the creek. No scorchbeasts, but stronger mutants and ghouls along with the crittters.
---
Those are my three favorites.
---
SHMEBULOCK!
---
Oh I was being sarcastic. One of the reasons I HATED and stopped playing ESO was because my lvl 15 tank could easily defeat my cousin's lvl 168 assassin.
---
I mean... that's what it is: downloadable content, DLC.
---
I can’t get anymore mods from scraping any idea were I can find some mods?
---
New achievements?
---
So at White Springs Ski resort, In one of the towers was a Mole Miner , I take aim and fire one shot. As soon as I hit him another mole miner comes flying out of the sky, hits the ground and gets up and begins running at me. From the height this fool fell from he shoulda been dead .. maybe Mole Miners have power armor under them suits hahaha. I wish I had video of it , cause him getting up and coming at me was the funniest thing I've seen in this game this week=. 
---
I have seen Super Mutants in Underwear .. hahahaha it is some funny stuff. I need to start recording things. 
---
If you’re goin for a crit build then the critical .50 receiver.  I wish we had hard stat numbers because I don’t k ow if the critical multiplication on it exceeds damage output compared to the hardened .308
---
It was part of last month's patch. The loot is no longer instanced and anyone picking the lock will get a wanted status.
---
I've never been wanted from someone else's drop or any drop. How is this happening?
---
By that logic every patch for every game ever is to be considered DLC...?
---
Right but the nixi clock says 12:00. I mean, at least be consistent.
---
Q1. Not to repeat what anyone has said, but Camps are simply your little piece of the wasteland. A place to safely cook food, fix weapons, and travel across the wasteland for free.
---
Q2. Quest are whatever. Some are good and some are bad, so do them whenever you feel like it. HOWEVER, (Sorry for caps but this is important) some quest will give you a unique weapon/armor as a reward and the stats on these items reflect your level, so I would recommend (If you care) looking up the quest with unique rewards and finish them when you're at least a level 50.
---
Hopefully all this helps. Good luck in the Wasteland!
---
2 months later.... it has been nerfed lol
---
I'm trying to find how you figure the cost to take care of nuclear waste is "literally infinite".   Most waste disposal for concentrated nuclear waste is via encapsulation and burial.  Most of what is being disposed of CAME from the earth.  We just concentrated it.  While the oceans are about 3ppb (3 parts per billion) Uranium, there's a lot of ocean.  The other isotopes we enrich and the byproducts, while certainly hazardous, do have decay rates.  They don't last forever (unlike things like arsenic) and they will eventually become inert.  The majority of the decays run through various other radioactive isotopes, but even they become eventually inert.
---
While they would certainly be there a LONG time (some of the isotopes involved have half-lives in the tens of thousands of years), most do not.  Put simply, by sealing it up, we are protecting the environment from its effects, while keeping it available should a way of using it safely should be discovered.  But the decay paths are NOT infinite, so neither would be the cost.  So given that the cost is effectively constant once it is contained and isolated, and that the time of containment is ALSO constant and finite, "literally infinite" is blatantly false.
---
Siege is the perfect example of game introducing quality cosmetics that I am happy to spend money on. They just need to up their game.  
---
Also a functional fridge to store your food at camp 
---
I've done this event 4 times on XB and have only had it be bugged once. My consolation  on the bugged run was a legendary mole miner nearby.  Sorry it's not working for you at all. I have no insight how to fix it . Were they all at the same location?
---
Wait, that's illegal
---
Also, just to increase awareness, energy weapons compare their *base damage* against the target's resistance when calculating the damage coefficient. This compounds the issue of anti-armor perks not working and generally higher energy resistance compared to ballistic resistance.
---
I shouldn’t find that as entertaining as I do. How offensive would people find it if I built a chem happy stabby Manson character??
---
When was the last time you had to pick the lock on one? Patch 5 or 6 changed them to player-specific drops, not free for all (and not instanced!) but if you are nearby when one drops, it might still give you the misc quest to go retrieve it... and become wanted if you pick the lock
---
I agree, I also usually attribute DLC to having a price tag.
---
This is a free patch update.  Yes, its also technically content which we are downloading.
---
I had assumed that radiation from the bombing of Washington D.C. had blown westward over Appalachia, explaining why everything east of the Savage Divide is more wild and irradiated.
---
They got me once, now if the crate is locked i just leave it.
---
You can look at it that way if want to since a patch is downloadable content.
---
I search every ashed corpse that i see in my path. Haven't ever received more than a cap or two but still doesn't stop me.
---
No, they literally said "rare" items. Not "commonly duped items". Where are you getting this "commonly duped items" at?
---
I think in some design document pure water was going to be very rare and boiled water would be common, but in the design of the game purified water became the common one and boiled water became the rare one. Like look how complex the recipe for a water filter is compared to what it gets you, it seems like pure water was going to be some rare "ultra fill your water bar" super item, but they made the game bad and so they are super common compared to boiled water.
---
Swtor iirc
---
What do u play on?
---
I'd rather not :)
---
lol i just got the game i'm level 5 
---
I play a stealthy sniper and my go to is a .50 cal hunting rifle, recon scope, stabilized barrel and grip, suppressor.  The cheaper ammo is worth the one less damage imo.
---
I have two legendary hunting rifles...a 2\* executioner's explosive and a 1\* instigating.  I've modded both out to my .50 cal config, and I personally like the instigating better.  The double damage on first shot fits well with my snipe from a distance strategy, and the other about the explosive one is that it felt like the accuracy was considerably worse.
---
I also have speed demon, marsupial, and eagle eyes mutation.  Being able to jump up on various places has made sniping so much easier as well.
---
I have plans for crafting lever action which I feel like the collective opinion here is that lever &gt; hunting, but I haven't unlocked the full set of mods to really compare.  I've scrapped a few gauss rifles but don't have a full mod list for that either.   I never really liked the way the gauss rifle worked since fallout 4.  
---
It clearly states "rare" items. Do you really think 5.56 or 5mm is rare? out of that list, there is only 1 rare ammo listed, ultracite.
---
this is what i am asking. because many people say yes, and i try to find the reddit post with email response on the helmet which said it was ok to have (couple of weeks ago i saw that). and i know they deleted the hunters hood but not the marine and i do not know now if it is legal or not. i want to get a official statement if possible!
---
You caught me 
---
Sirens on the roof.
---
Never said I struggled with food 
---
The other questions have been answered so let me give you some advise instead...
---
When placing a camp, make sure the location has easy access to:
---
Some sort of event (near the airport is a good place to start)
---
Some super mutants (caps are gonna become a issue later in the game and they have them for free)
---
A store (for the same reason, getting caps and room with unused legendarys - both super mutants and a store are a jackpot)
---
Water and wood (or in other words basic needs. Super mutants cover a bit of your food, all of it of you're playing cannibal but theyr dogs are a safe bet regardsless)
---
And don't waste caps on moving the camp too much (traveling to your camp is free, getting back costs caps which are covered by events, the store or mutants so you won't need to relocate it regulary. If you want to, go ahead though. I usually wait till someone occupies my spot while leveling since it's free then but you can essencially look for cool locations to make them permanent)
---
I really hope they release the 4 horseman power armor set
---
i usually call a drop in and loot it so others can after. i agree that it should be removed or at least change the HUD color to red while looting. 
---
I would like the wall turrets as an option that your see on the buildings around towers and power plants. Maybe they could take up less budget space too :)
---
It doesn't matter either way, you won't get banned for owning it
---
So the point is some of the people who say they never had a 100000+ of any item didnt.  The account is banned but there was only 5040 rounds the whole time. No dupping no cheating.  So all the people running around saying you got banned so your a cheater. I would suggest you get proof bc otherwise your just defaming them.  Secondly and most important anyone can b banned and not break the rules.  Also on a side note show me anywhere in the terms it says you cant get more than a 100000 of a item.  
---
76 was sold to me as a co-op game I could play with friends, which is what I love about this game. As for prior Fallout games, it was just me against the AI in addition to teaming up with other AI, so I'm not sure what your point is. 
---
Let the people who want PvP play in Survival mode and let Adventure have zero PvP. Co-op players aren't demanding anyone who wants PvP not get it, we just want it removed from Adventure mode. 
---
I guess you get your game patches on disc, eh? Fair enough.
---
Ever since I started my character during the BETA, I've had 1 goal: Help other low level players.
---
My 'Motel Denver' has evolved since then, but  I have set up with plenty of water generators without locks and stations. Rooms that can be used, each with a bed and a stash.
---
Finding a way like the fourth generation nuclear power plants? You have a short wait if politicians only listen to science.
---
Where do they list Ultracite as rare? Also they initially posted about the list of 400 items when they took all of the duplicates out of people's inventories. If it was on the list it was gone to one. Then people began claiming they were being banned for crafting ammo and food
---
If you switch to windmill or fusion generators to power your base, you get attacked **much** less frequently.
---
Ecstacy
---
Buffs not nerfs ffs.
---
Buddy what are you trying to do?
---
What list?
---
I have the same issue, it happens most when fighting the queen, but i have had it happen during other events. It doesn’t happen to me much when i am just wandering around tbh.
---
What do u play on good sir?
---
200 sniper
---
118 heavy gunner
---
3 mule
---
It depends, Hardened .308 is the best if you are doing Scoped/ADS kills. If you use VATS, you want to use Calibrated. The 200% additional crit damage while VATS spamming will make you really start popping off.  
---
If you are so inclined to stick to the .50 cal, Critical .50. It will list sheet damage as lower, but then you hit that VATS crit you will one shot most mobs. 
---
If you ever need help with some rifleman stuff, feel free to shoot me a message, Ive been playing Min/Max rifleman since beta
---
pc. and i do know people went to dev rooms and all. dont know but i want to know if it is considered to have legal or not. and i cannot delete my ability to craft them. so i wonder what the official statement of bethesda is on the issue!
---
I found the marine tactical helmet plan in game so...
---
Tell that to the wildlife already encroaching on the Priypat area surrounding Chernobyl.
---
Nuclear power was just a wild fantasy up until a few decades ago.  Internal combustion engines?  Only about a century and a half since they became workable.  Steam engines?  Only since the late 16th to 17th century, mostly a curiosity prior to that.
---
Steam boilers can explode, gasoline is highly flammable and explosive.  NO mechanism of releasing energy from a highly dense stored form is completely safe.  That's the nature of energy density.  And the radioactive isotopes used in nuclear power have a very high energy density.
---
Current cellular chemistry is susceptible to disruption by certain forms of radiation.  But evolution is constantly proving that it can be surprisingly resilient and adaptive.
---
It makes zero sense to me. Just let me play with other co-op players, buy camp shit and clean outfits from the Atoms store, and let the people who want PvP have Survival mode. I'm not sure why Bethesda refuses to separate the two the way their players have been asking since November. 
---
Workshops are already pretty useless and now I avoid taking them altogether. 
---
I think you'll be fine and I do that think it's supposed to be in game I've been playing since beta and never saw this helmet
---
50 cal receiver for a combat rifle???  Does that exist 
---
Dont
---
I wish the F76 modding community wasn’t so dead.  Might be time to learn how to mod myself.
---
Main Heavy Gunner is 93, Rifleman 110 and Methhead Shotgunner is like 11
---
Your buddy flagged you. :(
---
If one member on a team intiates pvp it flags the whole team, even if all the other members have pacifist on.
---
Or you had a workshop, and they force flagged you that way by contesting it.
---
About the only two ways to get flagged in Pacifist.
---
That's a hell of a change... Some GTAO business sales shit right there. 
---
"Oh, you earned this? Well how about we give everyone and their uncle every chance to steal it from you with threat of a couple caps and a lockpick?"
---
I'm level172 with about 450hrs and have just discovered the bloodied combat knife using sneak. I can get right up close and can kill most things with one or two quick stabs. Changed my game totally.
---
2 different B+C event locations
---
I quit taking workshops because of the bad game code. I mean, that the game is unstable, and frequently freeze&gt;crashes and or disconnects. Most of the time, it just freeze, and freeze long enough that it will not recover, the longest I've waited for it to come back before killing it in task manager was &gt;5 minutes. 
---
Its frozen  for me during any random activity. Walking through the Bog, picking up nuked flora. or 30 seconds after I get my defenses lined up at a workshop. 
---
I got tired of that 75% chance that it'll just freeze after dropping caps, time and materials, all for nothing if it freezes up.
---
i hope so. but i would really be happy about the official statement on whether it is really from dev room or not and if it is ok to have or not
---
&gt;So basically, everyone looking for a fair fight will probably switch, but the asshole who decided to shoot my house with a mini nuke right after i log in is gonna stay?
---
That's just my hunch based on the reaction here when someone suggests removing PVP from adventure mode. 
---
I’ve played the game completely solo so far with the exception of one failed power plant event and I think I’m finally starting to get to the point where I would like to play in a group in order to experience other aspects of the game eg. SBQ, events, nuke launches (I know you can do these solo but I feel like it’ll be more fun in a team) . I love spending time working through the quests and then just exploring the map and I can’t wait for more of this with the new quest lines but I like that there is a more social part of the game I can get involved with when I’m not in the mood to read terminals and listen to holotapes. 
---

---
Just replying to you. I just find it kinda funny that you're bothered by patches being called DLC.
---
I just want to add to this that all you need to do is clip her wings with rifles and tormentor or other guns and that other similar perk and she stays on the ground for most of the event. The melee folk will then crush her 
---
You should put him in your pool

This alone makes me wish every player shared the same world. Imagine if this game was populated like World of Warcraft..

Just gonna leave this here. I'm not 'bothered' by it. I'm just pointing out my observation.

It's a name bug, it's just a deathclaw.

The Lever Action Rifle is pretty good, especially if you've got something like Instigating or Two Shot on it.

In your linked email. The only rare ammo type in that email is ultracite, and in the original email is specifies RARE items. 
---
Rimmer?  Is that you?

Every recipe should have an option for purified vs boiled water.  I constructed a water pump just to have boiled water when I need it for those recipes, but would rather stick with my water purifiers.
---
Yeah, it's the Man Mask is only one available until the event, there's two spots to find it.
---
They list it as rare as it is the only ammo that isn't dropped by creatures. The only way to get ultracite ammo is to craft it, thus making it rare.
---
Where did you find it at? I've been looking just as long, with no luck also.
---
yep, I went to the airport with a fresh caracter and it was in the overseer's stash box. Thanks.
---
They should at least drop some screws and ballistic fibres!
---
If you find out... let me know.
---
Why would they list the other ammo?
---
Bethesda considers the Marine Armor Helmet a legal item in the game. Here's Bethesda's official response on it:
---
https://i.imgur.com/Ln20atE.jpg
---
Damn. I just got destryoed by facts and google definitions. Thanks for the downvotes aswell, really shows how not bothered you are.
---
I would very much like legendary PA parts, but as others have mentioned that would run the risk of making PA OP/meta and turning regular armor obsolete.
---
Proposed solution: Have PA parts only able to have 1 or 2 legendary effects.  Regular armor can still have more, allowing for specialized builds that can keep competitive.
---
Alternative solution: Have PA legendary effects be less potent than regular armor versions.
---
Tertiary solution: A combo of the first 2 suggestions.  Fewer effects with reduced potency.
---
I rarely get attacked at Twin Lakes
---
Obviously duping is an issue but it's very possible to get a full set of unyielding armor just by playing. I've probably gotten enough for 2-3 full unyielding sets and I don't play nearly as much as some folks. Seemed like all I got for like a month was unyielding armor.
---
I bet he likes big nuts. 
---
I agree 100% on disabling things like workshops for people in pacifist.  There needs to be drawbacks to it.  GTA online had one where all damage was disabled but you couldn't draw your weapons.
---
People keep asking for pve only, but interactions with people are part of the game.  Raiders are lore friendly.  The wasteland needs bad guys.
---
Happens to me when I am inside the west tek building. Anywhere else it works like it should.
---
I’m in the same boat as you, can craft. Found mine at a vendor a while back and scrapped it. It’s a guaranteed plan learn on first scrap. Haven’t worn it after learning it may be “illegal”. Would also like to know. 
---
I bought one from watoga couple months back. Got nervous thinking Id get the ban and scrapped it. Watching this thread as Id like to have another one at some point. 
---
thank you very much for the picture, that is what i was looking for. i saw it some time ago. but still i cannot be sure it is not a photoshop. so i try and get a official statement here on reddit from the bethesda team. i would be very happy for the answer!
---
Lol...yeah, lets ignore all the advantage mid-long range battles have over melee once that restriction is lifted.
---
Burst damage is all melee has, and that's somewhat of an exclusive to 2handet and unarmed (only due to an exploit, only 2 handet once that's fixed) too... onehandet and unarmed aside from the meat hook is plain horrible imo and in dire need of a buff so you may wanna be carefull with your wording.
---
I’ve had it happen to me as well at random times while exploring and fighting. Xbox
---
I used to have a camp in the cliffs above Whitespring and it got attacked all the time from Scorthbeasts, super mutants, ghouls, you name it...  I moved it closer to Top of the World  just off the road and now its almost never attacked but when it is it's low level Super Mutants, Liberators, or mutant hounds.  CAMP attacks are a lot rarer now even though my location is pretty close to where it was before after all I can still see Whitespring from the new location.  
---
Yeah instigating weapons jive super nicely with sneak criticals. Hard to top the initial 4x damage you get from the first shot. 
---
As long as you one shot most mobs you’re solid. So I don’t blame you for sticking with that one 
---
I'm just south of west tek on the cliff overlooking watoga and I only get attacked by super low level stuff on occasion. Which I think is a random encounter tied to your camp as someone above suggested. 
---
Usually a single player game. Yes we do
---
I am guessing that will be released as part of Nuclear Winter.  
---
&gt; Just look at how terribly unskilled the average player is 
---
Current playebase is garbage to begin with. As you can see, they are basically minority in online gaming and last I checked F76 is online game.
---
&gt; would have died way sooner then.
---
Die like Dayz, Rust and Sea of Thieves. Two of these games have been very simple by design and not much of PVE, yet they have been among top Twitch games for years even when them being bad, they are still entertaining. While F76 is where...
---
&gt;Cause about 80% of the players would have left within their first week of playing  
---
Well they pretty much did that anyway, just now it is boring game for both players and content creators. Only ones who love this game are fresh players and delusional f#cks, who don't even know what "Endgame" concept means in online gaming.
---
I always do those last and log off as soon as the atoms register.
---
Edit your post and do a Reddit username mention of Bethesda employees and that way they will notice and post.
---
have you seen the piles of trash? cats probably got bored after the 5th year....
---
That's the Joke, just like The Messenger bots, they are stuck to what they were doing before the bombs fell. 
---
Without PVP, the game would feel wrong.  Pacifist is a great deterrent on paper.  Just needs a lot of work.
---
Question if I made a post linking to a straw poll would that be allowed. I'm getting into arguements about if pvp should be entirely seperate or not. As in do people want no pvp or some pvp or just pvp and I would just like to get something like that seen for people to vote on or could a mod post one?
---
Its a perk, "good with salt."
---
17, almost 18. 
---
Strangely, i picked a random loot drop yesterday and i did not become wanted. But earlier last week i did.
---
I'm bothered by you. Picking a fight for no reason at all. God man. Go away
---
Super mutants and mole miners drop better stuff than SB
---
I suppose you can use it as a healing item, but as /u/ZonkerBrainless says, many people use glowing blood packs for rad resistance: 
---
* Rad-X gives +100 rad resistance, but suppress mutations (the good and bad effects). 
---
* Diluted Rad-X gives +50 rad resistance while leaving mutations active. 
---
* Glowing Blood packs give +75 rad resistance while leaving mutations active. 
---
And while we’re at it I want to see a super mutant following a mutant hound around with a pooper scooper.
---
What do we want?
---
Super mutant pooper scooper.
---
When do we want it?
---
Whenever it’s convenient,  lol

how do i do that, put their name so that they see? what do i have to type?

No, they are not craftable. You can't learn them by scrapping and there is no plan. See my spreadsheet here and look at the Underarmor tab.

on a tangent of that, you can have numerous pieces of cooked meat that is at low condition and make it 'fresh' again by storing it in your Stash, cook a fresh piece of the same type, then retrieve the stored pieces...voila! the stored pieces become fresh again.
---
The random ones will not get you wanted, just the bot's someone else calls in with a holotape.
---
Buy a set of miracle unkillable armor from a duper and rule the pvp mode of the game, just stand still and attack those who hasn’t bought the said armor, skill or strategy unnecessary, that sums it up. It’s the dumbest pvp game on the market today. While the artists did a good job to produce a seemingly realistic virtual world, the pvp mode is nothing but kindergarten garbage. 
---
Nothin'
---
Or, how about a promise to play in character in the world, and make a continued effort to make it feel alive, and interesting to other players? That's it.
---
Okay, thanks.
---
Is it coming first thing tomorrow?
---
So does it mean when we see events showing on the map, someone had triggered them recently by approaching the area? Or is it possible for events to trigger/appear on their own too?
---
question#2 answer: yes. raid players and rob them. 
---
Fantastic points. I was aware of the information surrounding chernobyl and its new inhabitants and that life there is thriving. But it doesnt get away from the fact that these unstable isotopes are hugely damaging and are a cause for certain cancers amongst many other ailments, especially to humans. And the fact of the matter is, to most, wildlife doesnt even come into the equation as people only care about people. 
---
160
---
Nah. Add root cellars to CAMP craftables. Ability to dig down, just a 1X1 basement, only one floor deep
---
I would contemplate running from that if I saw it, like "naw I'm good!"
---
Or a really big fan
---
On the "canner" side of it... it would add value to all those mason jars you find. 
---
You just might like it!
---
hi, could you please post a list of what plans you have so people will know if they need them or not?
---
Lmao. This is not the post i was expecting. Kudos
---
I'm just scratching my head wondering why I'd ever use traps over missile turrets when every trap breaks after use and needs to be powered in order to be triggered. 
---
I'm on PS4 and it has gotten a lot better. There is a lot to be done, but it is much more playable. I don't get server disconnects anymore which was the biggest problem to me. There are several issues that need to be fixed like damage bugs, weapon bugs, and event bugs that need to be fixed, but hopefully some if not all will get fixed in the next patch. 
---
Congrats on the 100!  I'm at 188.75.  Should hit 200 sometime next week I hope. 
---
I've tried with friends and in almost all cases I was seeing myself doing damage, they weren't.  They were fine, to them all my attempts missed, and they were full health.  To me, their bar was gone and they just weren't dying for some magic reason.
---
A simpler, transitional idea would be a camp related event with the suicider.  Event pops up and you have 2 minutes to find and kill the suicider heading straight to your camp to detonate. 
---
You win,  Internet Jerk 
---
Now you're just bragging.  ( I would too Mr. uber gamer!!)  Awesome numbers there
---
Appearantly you can not tell the difference...
---
I'm not picking a fight at all. I'm just stating that patches are DLC. You're downloading a patch, wether or not it adds 'new content' is irrelevant. Patches and DLC are the same thing. 
---
Oh well, your opinion is the right opinion though.
---
I would love a bloodied one.  I have a Vampiric Combat Knife, and I will say that in most fights, I come out with about the same health that I go into the fight w/o using stims.  
---
Almost every bobblehead I've found has come from a portapottie! 
---
I think they should make it so all recipes have the option of dirty and purified water, with the purified water recipes giving you a little more health and less rads
---
I really like your place!
---
Its way more stable now but theres been a very noticeable drop in players. I havent seen a queen die in about 2-3 weeks. Even finding a nuke zone is rare now. Legendary Loot drops are still broken. Its several small annoyances, Hopefully these updates bring people back. Its worth buying now most players are still friendly and theres alot to do. It seems like alot of people have restarted so more low levels. The games been playable for awhile. There was a period of nonstop crashes or disconnects which still happen but its rare.
---
It's good. Not phenomenal. Still bugs rarely. But works well and its lots of fun.
---
I liked it when everyone got their own loot. Had a few times where it was like 5 people around one box trading back and forth.
---
Decrease the space they take up in the budget but put a hard cap on how many you can have in your camp, which I'm really excited about.
---
It's a lot more stable. You should check out the upcoming content updates, they have the next 100 days planned. First content patch drops tomorrow, but it's a small update. First holiday event is Friday. Too much new stuff coming out to type out rn, Google FO76 road map
---
I don't get it. I'm a jerk because I disagree with you? That's a fun way to think...
---
I'd like to thank all of you who pay so I can play.
---
&gt;In the process, I've found everything from Raider to T60 (but not excavator).
---
Excavator doesn’t spawn in the wild.  
---
I love it. I find myself playing it over all my other choices. 
---
It's NOT perfect. Every now and then I spawn, only to be destroyed by enemies before they're even visible to me (not often)
---
I find 3rd person hit detection a bit wonky in close combat.
---
I've had some "WTF" damage happen to me, stuff I can't figure out at all. Where it's coming from, how it's happening, etc.
---
But, I'm finding the community super fun, griefers/meta gamers are the minority (I'm on Xbone, full disclosure), and honestly, I'm enjoying just exploring the game, reading, discovering, gathering... and relish the opportunity to play "in character" when I encounter other players. 
---
I've reached 56 hours as of yesterday, and I've barely scratched the surface. I am NOT rushing to endgame, and I've barely even started the main story. 
---
Generally with max \[I\]power user perk i try to keep 3 fusion cores on me and then 2 in my stash to keep the weight down. I get a steady flow of fusion cores from events. If I need a fusion core I kill a sentry bot from whitespring and hop worlds.
---
Ive been close to flatwoods church for a lot, just a few low level lonely scorchers and dogs used to attack once in a while. Now I moved a little bit north of camden to get my daily fuzzy tokens, and it's about the same thing except for very low level supermutants. It's the very south-western border of the green area (forest). Maybe that why they're still low level, even if im very close to ash heap
---
Just started a new character after dropping for a couple of months...I can honestly say I have enjoyed it much better than when I started it around launch. Runs significantly smoother and responsive than before, I am playing at a much slower pace to make sure I get to all terminals and holotapes. Exploring the map with that in mind makes the game so much better and meaningful. 
---
Thanks, I knew I had seen that design before, but couldn't place it.
---
Yeah its great until the broken as fuck game says "nah" and the mob heals about 87% of that damage back
---
Welcome to reddit
---
If it adds content, yes.
---
I regularly hand things out to lower level players and build things for their camps, does that count? Lol
---
I've been in a couple of Queen fights over the weekend, and Whitesprings was getting nuked regularly. Someone even followed Rifle's recommendation and nuked the DMV. Somebody also nuked Harper's Fairy for some reason.
---
YES! its been happening to me as well, very annoying and can get you killed
---
Wow, thank you for the wonderful response.
---
I hadn't considered some of this and in hindsight, I had structured my build around quality of life and not so much attack power. Now that I know my way around the game better and have better equipment, I can make some of those adjustments. Bloody mess, for example, seems way better than carrying all the stuff I simply don't use, and changing up my vendor route could eliminate the need to carry so much anyway.
---
One thing that jumped out to me though - you only have 3 INT. Do you find that you are repairing your guns very often? I have 5 INT and use maxed Gunsmith, and even that's somewhat painful (though the materials are never hard to find).
---
Thanks again for the thoughtful reply!
---
I always find someplace easily defendable.. Like right by a cliff or a wall. that way you have an easier time placing turrets
---
Completely agree with you, the potential is truly exciting. And as for all of the abuse levelled at Bethesda since launch, they seem to be addressing the issues and improving the player experience constantly,  glad I’ve stuck with it so far.
---
Its a perfectly legal in game item, although it was introduced by people hacking into the dev room. Its suppose to spawn in the world but it was never added to the loot list. Only PC players have them, i wish Bethesda would introduce them into the console worlds, seems kinda lame we cant get them to complete our armor set. Especially since its the only helmet in game that provides protection. 
---
They aren't the same thing at all man. What if a patch just fixes some interface bug? Or balance a game mechanic? Are you gonna call that DLC. 
---
You are right. It is technically content that we download. But then by that logic the game itself is dlc. And my Netflix app is dlc.
---
Yay.  Personally, this is exactly what I'm looking for.
---
They know how to play the cosmetic game already, they've got it *nailed* in ESO, it wouldn't take much to bring the same philosophy over to FO76.
---
Now I feel like a real jerk for that murder I committed earlier, I’m really not up to date on etiquette, I just play.  Sorry, fella.
---
AA Gauss Rifle, med night vision scope, and a suppressor 
---
Never knew that, lol thanks. 
---
Exactly.  If you don't spec your character for PvP, your level means fuck all against anyone lvl 50+ that has. Quit bitching about losing PvP if you don't prepare for it.  Go eat leaves somewhere. 
---
The Fallout universe **IS** "goofy" though. and it should remain that way. It has changed so much from what it once was, at Bethesda's hands, if they changed the *goofiness*, they might as well change the franchise name entirely.
---
Just something people are compelled to do I think, I've done it in every game I've ever played.  Ever played " 7 DAYS TO DIE".  You get the real McCoy there sometimes. 
---
I can tell you meta gamers are not the minority 
---
Where is that? Been exploring the Ash heap lately and I haven't noticed it. 
---
That first climb up is a real bitch.  It's a huge deterrent for folks that randomly want to mess with you.
---
I'll do both. I just love killin'! :D
---
Wait... really?  What kind of sense does that make?
---
I don't want to add another 'perk' that should just be a passive perk. We've got a limited amount of perk points I don't want to be wasting them on misc perks 
---
The phantom damage is usually just lag.. A hit you took before didn't register properly and the game is playing catch-up. There's also the occasional invisible enemy, there's a phantom ghoul at Whitesprings that gets me every time.
---
Besides the point, but I have a couple of questions if you can spare the time. 
---
Why have these civil war plans surfaced all of a sudden, and why are they so popular since the apparel is so easily found ‘wild’?
---
Where do they appear? I’ve seen a lot of people talking about ‘looking for them’ with very few details as to where. Mostly curious as to how they’ve been unknown until now. 
---
What makes them so desirable?
---
Thanks in advance. Sorry to somewhat detract from the point. 
---
I found it in the flat woods church overseer box. 
---
\&gt;Fallout
---
\&gt;Realism
---
Pick one.
---
My loot bag location is also iffy on the map. 
---
However, 80% of the time it's floating 6 feet in the air which has been helpful. 
---
Except those few times where I'm racing another player to it who spotted it floating.
---
Yes. I'm aware that they are supposed to pop when approached, and patrol duty has not popped in a month despite repeated approaches. I used to trigger it regularly. Something is different. 
---
Would love to see a post on your rifleman build.
---
If it wasn't for the jackass griefers out there then maybe people would have a different opinion.
---
Even though griefers are an extremely small percentage of players, 'bad apples often ruin the bunch'..as they say.  
---
There's typically a Grafton Monster in Charleston. I think it's somewhere near the fire station...?
---
I got mine from taking a workshop. I believe it was Billings Homestead, but I don’t exactly recall.
---
We thank you for your... controbution to our little Enclave... ... member. 
---
Hunter will not apply to scorched
---
I wouldn’t attack whitespring employees because I would die too quick.
---
I had gotten lots from robobrains. But sadly Bethesda stole it from them. 
---
I set up my camp nearby so I often just look in awe at it.
---
Say what ye want about the leaders blowing everyone to bits but the engineers and scientists who lived at the time created some amazing stuff
---
Some events need to be approached to trigger. For example, Line in the Sand triggers about half-the-time that I walk in-front of Fort Defiance. Other events don't seem to require a local trigger. For example, Distant Thunder seems to appear on its own. 
---
They sort of do. If you have to pick the lock, it ain't you.
---
Happens on Xbox as well. I notice that fast traveling and sometimes even entering/exiting power armor causes this to happen.
---
I had about 3k .308 rounds at level 30 just by looting Super Mutants. 
---
Is anybody else having the issue recently in which power armor provides absolutely no extra carrying capacity?
---
Right? It's not fallout community. It's humanity in general. Lol. 
---
Got one at red rocket a few days ago
---
I took a video with my Instagram 
---
I’ve been capturing every glitch I see since Day One
---
https://www.instagram.com/p/BumB5FQnoIx/?utm_source=ig_share_sheet&amp;igshid=18zmgm3fgtu9e
---
I'd rather not have to constantly go back and defend my camp while adventuring, no thanks. If anything this could be neat for workshops.
---
Is the explosion that big?
---
I run around with a non-legendary lever action right now. With Speed Demon it reloads incredibly quick and with all the true mods it shoots damn accurate.
---
So nothing applies to scorchbeasts?
---
Not advocating for the other person that commented because I agree that the two modes should be separate but I see what he's getting at. That from an immersive role-playing point of view you're gonna have other wastelanders that want to kill you and take your shit.  
---
WS is interesting because there are a bunch of fern behind the bunker entrance but they never turn into Flashfern. Also in the central lawn (where deathclaws or grafton monsters spawn) there should be several rows of fluorescent but many times they simply stayed purple and never mutate, even when those near the club house mutated. 
---
Also when I farmed the flora in one nuke event, then  hopped server and run into another nuke at WS, even though the flora is there, the system won’t let me pick them up. It’s as if there’s an anti-farming setting to prevent users from collecting same flora on different servers too frequently. This is just absurd. How about just make the ghouls killable once per 24 hours so we only play the game once per day. 
---
Totally random anywhere you find a power armor frame.  Higher level areas likely to have higher level versions.  T-51 can be as high as level 50 I think.
---
211 and 78 :)
---
Maybe zealots?
---
Calm down bit..would ya?  
---
If you want PvP then go to the PvP servers when they are introduced.  Once that happens we will see what mode is more 'popular'.  I'd bet heavily that it is NOT PvP as most players are coming from a single player game background.
---
Same issue. Also tired of my guns being empty when i switch to them. Even though i put it away loaded. Nothing like reloading or not equipping a weapon as you get beat to death.
---
&gt; It's a shit system 
---
Got that right.
---
My thoughts exactly. What's the fun when you can't ambush unsuspecting people and take their loot? You know I killed a dude the other day for breaking into my house and he was Wanted but did I take all his loot? NO. I also killed another guy that ambushed me AND took all my loot and I took my loot BACK. Generally I'm a pretty nice person. \*shrug\*
---
126 and 70!!
---
I can tell you that they have been in my experience thus far. Most of the players I have met are 100% embracing a role.
---
I learned from another player on a team in a nuke zone awhile back to go to pacifist mode. I guess I was clueless on the ramifications if not everyone was in Pacifist mode. 
---
It happened to someone yesterday.
---
I requested a drop, for the time I made it there was this fella there with a bounty.
---
I really did not have the heart to shoot... he was like lvl19 and for the behaviour not someone's alt or someone's bait.
---
If you're on PC, I have a spare. 
---
A player put that there. 
---
Weird, I picked the lock to a cargo drop, and it wasn't mine, and I didn't get wanted. 
---
Like in *The Terror*!
---
Also you would enable some great player vending. Like a provisions guy in adroitness to munitions / weapons / armor / clothing. 
---
Why does everyone go with the our world option? Go with the Fallout world option. Radiation can kill all the nasties that will cause food to rot.
---
Camp bench that uses an input of nuclear waste and a food item. Outputs a food item that has 10-20 more rads and no CND bar. So you get stuff like "Irradiated Carrot Soup" or "Irradiated Yao Gui Roast".
---
Lore friendly and gives trade off for having food that doesn't perish
---
This pisses me off though. Often in nuke zones you'll join up with other random players for fun. If you're in pacifist mode you should get exempt from that stuff. 
---
I had my first terrain issue yesterday... defending a workshop, and three molerats were under a hill. They'd register on screen with VATS at a 0% "to hit", and nothing I could do would get them anywhere I could damage them. 
---
If your done and on Xbox could I have some of your stuff because I’m enjoying the game and could use some help
---
Most of ESO can be played solo.  Tons of content too.  Well worth your time.
---
As someone who has a character over 100 and another one getting close who has never once engaged in any kind of PvP in Fallout I just want to say that this game most definitely CAN be a 100% PVE experience just how it is if you choose it to be. Even more so with the planned pacifist changes.
---
101 - Automatic weapon specialist
---
 97 - Heavy weapon specialist
---
 95 - Sniper
---
 92 - Melee
---
 87 - Shotgun specialist
---
I rotate through all five characters fairly consistently.  The melee character is the most powerful and least enjoyable/easiest to play.  The automatic weapon specialist really should be retitled to an "endless search for ammo and ammo crafting components" character.  The one I'm currently enjoying the most is the vats sniper.
---
The radiation is complimentary, provided to you free of charge.
---
No refunds.
---
Good story.  I never get the "Cool Camp Ghosts", only the dirty little destructive ones.
---
You can find Recipes for the stempack in safes, medical containers, mirrors, and sometimes chem lockers (yellow med kits) at a low drop rate. I have gotten three  and some others like radaway, mentats and so on.
---
Not really
---
I'll jump on that
---
Yeah, I'd love to run a provisions vendor. Been saving my chef's hat for exactly that.
---
Wait there are cats?? Where are they?
---
We have something like that in real life called a distillery.  The soup they make is much better.
---
What are your complaints with it? Rather than just saying “bad, stupid, horrible” maybe constructive criticism could be helpful?
---
Living there now. Its awsome
---
if you claim workshops, just crouch. it will hide you from the map and all the teams who are trying to kill workshop owners.
---
50 is a smaller number than 308, brought to you by the same country that thought 1/3 pounder was smaller than 1/4 pounder.... 
---
Yeah. was just saying its possible to get it for free. 
---
Survival mode. Just this time you can't hide behind stupid systems.
---
I think most of those aren't "players"... they're just salt vendors.
---
No. He's saying that he wantds to be allowed to bully people off of a server if he and his friends want a server for themselves. 
---
My bugged enemies are way more boring. 
---
The only interesting one was a super mutant using the crafting bench at a train station.
---
Yep, sometimes I read these posts from the complainers and think "why the heck are you playing a game you hate so much".  I love the game and think its probably one of the best games I've ever played.  I also own games I was totally disappointed in (\*cough Destiny, GTA, FarCry Primal, Assassins Creed).  My reasons for disliking those games is mostly due to the game play not the story or content.  The Fallout series has great game play, and for the most part a good story line, so for me its very entertaining.   Its not just a FPS, it's a world where you can be both creative and expressive.  If you don't like it that's fine but that doesn't mean its a bad game. 
---
You found a legendary 3-star mime! I've only heard rumors of their existence.
---
Totally agree.  PC has a much more 'mature' audience.  Probably because, on average, kids can't afford a gaming PC.
---
If they pose around my C.A.M.P and just move around a little i won't mind
---
Level is irrelevant. Got a clip of me taking out a Level 325 at level 42. So depends on build and weapons!
---
They must also have a good spay and neutering program in the wasteland because the population seems under control. Perhaps the shelter still runs clinics on weekends.
---
Agree except for VATS. Can't understand why VATS shots miss so reliably. Switch to a combat or handmade and everyone lands but the lever and hunting are consistent missed shots. The second or third sometimes works but it is a weird bug.
---
Yes but that one time you use a trap to fling someone into your mine field makes it all worth it
---
I keep seeing people talk about griefing. I've been playing for close to 200 hours (first on PC, now also on PS4) and I've yet to have an issue with griefing. 
---
In my experience, there's always several in each server
---
Hmm. Might give it a go
---
That's what I do and it's cool proof :)
---
Same comment but for PS4.
---
It seems like Bethesda is going out of there way to make this game into Fortnite
---
Ok. Bye.
---
Certain civil war recipes turn cloth into caps
---
The whole thing is interesting to me because a lot of people I know don't turn on pacifist mode and people DO hit each other but most ignore it figuring a mob of people in an event means some people are gonna get accidentally hit. Up until now it hasn't been a big deal.
---
Since you hated FO4 and bought FO76 and played it, you should look into playing the stock market.  There are plenty of people out there that will take your money since you're so eager to give it away and don't care if you get anything in return.
---
I have a bloodied melee PvP build, and I can one-shot anyone, even in power armor. I do significant damage even just with slap damage. If I had full sentinel/assassins gear I'd take barely any damage from other players, but I run unyielding instead. I'm *not* a griefer though, I always walk away if they don't engage. 
---
On the subject of cats. Are you able to have one as a pet in game?
---
Sure a couple, but honestly (and this simple my experience thus far), they don't give a rat's ass about me, or any other roleplayers. They seem content to drop nukes and power game amongst themselves.
---
Ahhhhhhhhhhhhh
---
Also don't forget that 100% of renewable power sources can trace their energy back to nuclear power. I mean we have a giant unshielded nuclear reactor about 8 minutes away. 
---
Most likely, the development cost would be relatively low compared to other BGS games. We won't know for sure though because Bethesda isn't releasing sales figures and it didn't make it on the top games sold in 2018.
---
Not everyone who enjoys the PvP options currently are griefers. Personally I enjoy PvP but I don't harass people who clearly don't want to PvP and I'll only contest a workshop if the owner is level 50+. Even then, if they get upset and let me know (via emotes, messages) they don't want to PvP I'll move on.
---
I'd love to start a new character in Survival mode but the fact that the current plan is to let people move characters between Adventure and Survival modes at any time they please is a dealbreaker for me.
---
FYI ... if you own the digital version, you can use it with both PS4s simultaneously.  
---
Oh yeah, I hate mole rats so much ... Why can't super mutants ever attack my workshops. At least they drop useful things and don't glitch out.
---
Whereabouts is this area on the map? 
---
it would be actually cool if those things actually worked, but they dont :(   at least not when we tested it a bit back.  Was a short delay then dead :( but they did protect from normal explosion blasts (Frags, missile...)  
---
They changed that? WHY?!
---
Honestly I gotta wonder who the hell is running things. Do they even play games? Or do they just hate fun? This reminds me of the Feed the People patch.
---
Personally, I thought the game was advertised as more of a coop experience more than anything else. 
---
I kind of like the way Guild Wars 2...and ESO did it.   Basically, there are coop PvE events that people congregate to and then go their separate ways.  For PvP there are dedicated areas. 
---
I think it is clear that the intent of the FO76 was to have these coop events.  However, many players are too frightened to join them for fear of getting griefed, etc... 
---
I found one near the mines! 
---
Wait, if you request an air drop and open the box you get wanted as well? Or just if someone elses opens the box?
---
It's better and I'm leveling up much faster as I'm not afraid of the map with my fresh character. There are a couple of CTDs and hangs occasionally and I encountered a couple full server crashes last week too. The endgame, namely legendary drops and the SBQ got worse in my experience.
---
If you take a workshop during a session, you are open to PvP for the entire session. Everywhere on the map, not just at your workshop. As for how they're two-shotting you, my melee build can one-shot pretty much everyone even in power armor. It's rediculous. 
---
Knowing pre-war Fallout, it's probably made of cats and some kind of addictive radioactive element. 
---
Well if all the recipes are double edged like the ones they showed, i 'm probably not even gonna bother building the station.
---
If purified water was supposed to be rare they shouldn't have ported over water purifiers, or made purified water an excessively common drop from events.  If my carry weight starts getting too crazy it's generally because I've accumulated a couple hundred purified waters without trying to.
---
If you jump in a fissure site your loot bag will alway double what you drop. Just hop back in and grab it.
---
Players still commenting in this sub-reddit months after they've left the game don't make sense to me... it sucks so bad and they're so glad they quit but they're still reading and commenting on threads like someone who can't get over their ex.
---
they never existed. 
---
I just put this type of damage down to the fact my character stubbed their toe, or stood on some debris or something lol.
---
This is part of my issue - it works 80% of the time...
---
Does this affect the cargobots carrying nuclear cards?
---
Because I was always dropping whatever I was doing at the time and chased after those for a free card. 
---
You're telling me it's no longer an option?
---
Software Developer and Deployment Manager.
---
FO76 has been doubly frustrating for me :D
---
Glow sights for everyone?
---
That's so crazy! Are they regular cats? Mutated? Cute? Vicious? I've apparently been wandering around and not paying enough attention to my surroundings. 
---
Yes.
---
yet he's right :P there's many dragons. and you get the prefix such as ''two shot the dragon''. it's no more unique or named than the ''cryolater'' or something.  
---
it is an odd weapon, though, the dragon. a friend into reinactment was pointing out how it has two ''percussion nipples'' (for percussion caps) below the hammers, yet on the Bottom half, the two lower barrels, the percussion nipples actually have Electric Wires running out of them and into the barrel. Check it out in the ''examine'' item mode next time! interesting, kinda.  
---
I absolutely adore the game, so if you fancy donating your goods before logging off for good I'll happily take the burden off you. Ps4.
---
Not just on Xbox it happens on ps4 too, at least my power armor is behaving at the moment and not de-selecting pieces of it when I hop in and out anymore
---
I get that every now and then.  I usually run rifleman with a double barrel shotgun if anything gets too close.  There have been many times when I get surrounded by super mutants or ghouls and my guy just decides “fine! Put up your dukes!” and starts punching instead.  I’ve decided that he has some sort of complex and wants to prove himself
---
Nice idea, but it also means that you can avoid the radiation by Lead Belly. The only issue would be having to use a somewhat rare resource.
---
Man 250 hours that bad huh you must really feel ripped off
---
Stealth commando is a powerful build, so you might want to look at getting Sneak, Covert Operative and Escape Artist. 
---
I hear you.  For some off reason quite a few of the complaints come form the XBOX side.  
---
Personally, I play on PC and have run into it twice.  Yeah...it doesn't happen frequently but having it happen once was enough to turn me off to the whole thing. 
---
Wait,there’s a new mode coming out?!
---
I am really for more complex machines in fo76.  Like this, connecting a stove to a water purifier for soup where you don't need to collect water.   Or farming/hydroponic setups that let you grow indoors.  
---
My only problem with the gnomes is that I can’t place them in my Camp. 
---
That’s less than 25 pence an hour to play assuming you paid around £60 for the game. 
---
Bargain! 
---
I'm just hoping the patch is a net gain for playability and fun. I lost faith in the game and stopped playing due to the string of terrible patches earlier this year.
---
Add another 88 here. 
---
Try a stealth commando mate. If possible, try a bloodied  unyielding vats critical spamming stealth commando. With the right perks and adrenal reaction and a bloodied auto rifle, you can 5 hit scorchbeasts
---
112 at the moment which isn't bad considering I would say I'm a filthy casual lol
---
Scrolled too quick and thought this was a r/destinythegame post spoiling new lore.. shit.
---
Regular cats.  I want to try and send one to my camp
---
I could do that later tonight
---
As I said in a thread asking the exact same question, yes, this a legit item. It can be found fully drawn "in world".
---
A normal dark orange cat that ignores me and does not stay still while I’m trying to take some photos 😔😔😔😔
---
I agree. The one kid I came across literally called me sir. Lol. I was at heart of the swamp and he was trying to shoot down a keycard. He walked up and said "excuse me sir, when the event is over can you please help me shoot down this keycard". I shot it down and gave him stims, ammo, and some chems. All I could think is your parents should write a book. Lol. 
---
Yes, it's legit, I've found it too.
---
So you don't really like Fallout games and even thought the beta was bad. Now you say it's horrible even after playing 250 hrs. I call this bollocks, any sane person would just not play a horrible game just for the sake of playing it. You're therefore an idiot, a liar or both
---
Out of curiosity, how does stealth work with auto weapons? Wouldn't the sneak only be built off the first shot?
---
Id say no unless a bunch of people are buying atoms. Its not just development costs but whats server upkeep cost a day? The new content will get more people to buy so i have to assume they have a 1 year plan for this game to be profitable instead of breaking even from early sales. The real profit is for their future games will need an online component and this is the start of that. So while they may lose money now its to make it up with future games.
---
This was my favorite part.  The "raiders" always talk about their build/skill yet everytime I see threads talking about PvP builds it seems that very specific pieces of legendary gear are what everything is built around.  Like there is a ton of "skill" associated with acquiring OP gear when duping made it cheaply available for the majority of the time this game had been out.
---
This aggression will not stand, man. I am The Dude, man. And you are wearing my robe!
---
My helmet has zero stats beyond being paintable.
---
Level doesn't really matter honestly, my level 60 PvP build kills everyone she fights. 
---
If it followed the same rule as other boxed loot, it *was* instances to each player. And it was pretty shit loot anyway unless you were fresh out of the vault. 
---
Because bethesda thinks they need to aim for the PVP audience
---
Yes...
---
https://bethesda.net/en/status
---
I try to avoid events with other ppl just so I don't end up stealing their legendary kills, however thankful if you're on a team everyone shares in everyone's kill (that a good job Bethesda did that's not highlighted). But if someone joins me then out come my weakest weapon and an act awareness to allow everyone involved to get a hit
---
I giggled more than I should have at this.  But not ashamed.
---
I can't wait for separate servers 
---
You should have a cat sanctuary at your camp
---
There will be adventure mode and survival mode
---
They had us in the first half, not gonna lie.
---
Murgle!
---
You spent 250 hours... on a "shit game"?
---
That's... $0.25 per hour played? How many other games have you spent 250 hours on, just curious?
---
I dunno… if I bite into a hamburger and it tastes like shit... I stop eating.
---
pre-patch shitposting? *nice*
---
What’s adventure mode,Pve?
---
Yup, he gets the 1D10T pen.
---
Bye, Felicia. 
---
Yess!
---
Following 
---
Silencers :) 
---
Plus you kill things too fast for them to see you. 
---
I tried it out recently and there were still tons of bugs. :/ Mostly enemies glitching out, and graphical issues.
---
The main thing that got me was reading all the boneheaded decisions they patched in. Many patches seem to be anti-fun and pro-grind, which is weird because there aren't even microtransactions that a grind would promote. It's still fun and playable, but expect everything to be 20% more of a grind for no apparent reason.
---
We already have a version of that. Ionized meat from nuke zones...shelf life apparently of infinity. I have carnivore mutation and carry like 30 pieces as a backup supply of food. I prefer the freshly cooked type because the mutation gives me the positive effects of the meat x2.
---
Fair enough 
---
wot?  this makes no sense, we drink boiled water, it's not hot because it isn't currently boiling, boiled, as in past tense, meaning it was once boiled and is now safe to consume, but either way you have to boil water to make soup, whether the water starts out dirty, boiled (but not currently boiling) or purified, it's not like you can't boil purified water...
---
Adventure is just the standard game as is, while survival is geared more toward pvp
---
The spay and neuter program is "all those rad animals that just eat right through a whole litter of cats."
---
Real easy to keep feral cat populations in check with 4 ft long scorpions, mole rats the size of dogs, and large mutated geckos.  Bob Barker would be proud. 
---
Yes of course, but there is goofy in the theme of Fallout and then there is that toy soldier Power Armor skin they released for a limited time. It was ugly. It wasn’t in the same vein as Fallout 2’s goofyness.
---
Of course this is all just my opinion so you could feel any way you want about it. I love the Wild Wacky Wasteland, but I want some damn Raider/BOS/Enclave/Free Stater themed Atomic Shop items man. 
---
The good idea fairy strikes again! ;)
---
Yeah, it almost feels like the CAMP people didn't talk to the rest of the team. In normal crafting you need to combine 
---
Adhesive x 1
---
Bleach Dogwood x 3
---
Glowing Fungus x 1
---
to make a water filter then combine that with boiled water to get even one purified water. It's a huge hassle and would have made it a really rare item. But then you can just plop down water purifiers and get hundreds of them in a way that seems not intended. With the way purified water is some special item that can't be used in most recipes. 
---
I did the same thing recently. Put down my level 198 character and made a new one. I used some caps from my main character and went on the trading subreddits and picked up a good low level legendary weapon. I am currently using a bloodied guitar sword. I can go to whitesprings now and kill high level ghouls and have been leveling up pretty quick from doing that. If you have high level friends, you can run around with them and tag all the enemies while they kill them. You still get the XP from that.
---
yeah alot of players build up huge stockpiles of unused ammo, obtained though simple gameplay-
---
i just last night dropped 2000 .38 ammo to a level 11 at faltwoods
---
add people nearby to the locations u want to travel to. a lot of ppl are cool about teaming up for 2-5 minutes. it’s becoming common knowledge that that is generally the motivation to a team request from someone that isn’t nearby.
---
Personally I miss nondefault paints for Excavator.
---
Its design which screams of old useles cars https://info.sibnet.ru/ni/528/528800x630x0_1511333387.jpg is just horrid.
---
Not making excuses.. but TWICE now, immediately after finishing a trade, I've been booted off server. I haven't taken anyone's stuff, and I didn't log out... just literally, finished the trade and bang. Done.
---
Could it be a game issue, maybe? Just a thought, everyone gets a second chance, right?
---
That's what I thought. I remember them being something that brought players together, especially at low levels.
---
It's nice to see that the Homeowners Association survived.
---
If this is true, you're a hero we deserve 
---
Are you sure they're roleplaying ??
---
population control comes in the form of an irradiated wasteland where everything is 100x more dangerous than before
---
That's fair. Thanks for clarifying.
---
Bars, churches and heroin...you must be talking about Huntington!

---
Well, to be fair, I only tested it with electrically charged. I didn’t have Unstable to test it with. 
---
haha!
---
Mutant’s Sooper Pooper Scooper you mean.
---
I would pay real money for a Board skin that is a Pooper Scooper (Sooper Dooper for Rootin Tootin Mutant Poopin n’ Scoopin)
---
Spawn in at Watoga station, check the roof of the school, sell the bits you don't want to the vendor, run down the train track, clear the NAR yard, run down to big bend tunnel, clear it, check the armour stand.  
---
Gives you armour, ammo and guns/scrap to seek to the vendor.
---
You spelled "douchebag" wrong....
---
I just don't trade with anyone I don't know IRL anymore because of shit like this
---
I'll make a raider character focused in shotguns and machetes, but i'm not going to abandon my other characters.
---
My primary gun for SBQ fights is a .50 cal MG. It does 234 dmg per shot with Furious ramped and Psychobuff on. I use about 5K to 8K rounds and expect to deliver around 1.5M damage.
---
SBQ loot tables scaled to damage output will not benefit your VATS hunting rifle build. Players with a Furious Heavy Guns build are doing 30x-50x your damage output. Players using Bloodied Melee are doing 20x-100x your damage. A group of those can kill her faster than she heals after mutating.
---
Weapons aren't remotely balanced in this game. If you want to max your sustained DPS, you've got the wrong build. If you start assigning people to "contributor" and "non-contributor" buckets, your hunting rifle going to get lumped in with the shed crowd. Ten bullets per minute is indistinguishable from zero.
---
But come to the fight anyway. The more the merrier. If we lose, we lose. I don't care who is "pulling their weight" or not.
---
Dont forget about all the.. em... lazer pointers.
---
Sorry furball.
---
Profit?
---
Ehh. Character was 100% designed to be "Creepy fat neckbeard", so if it wasn't designed that way... well, it sure came across that way.
---
I have thousands of atoms I don’t even know what to buy. Different camos for PA and skins for weapons are way more important than emotes and bathtubs in a survival game, yet the number of options is next to zero. 
---
Should the world comes to a screeching halt and you spot someone dressed in hot pink rummaging through junk piles, you know what game they played before. 
---
There are two grafton monsters in Charleston, one submerged in water between the bridge and capital building, and on in the ditch south of the Charleston train station.
---
I used to just drop supply drops to get rid of the tapes, let anyone nearby grab it, but now that the wanted thing happens, I just have like 30+ tapes. It's so dumb. Getting a wanted level for getting a supply drop is entirely asinine.
---
Not for nothing, but it does clearly tell you you are stealing when you go to open a supply drop you didn't request.
---
My main character, Grug once punched an entire ghoul horde to death
---
You should never give an item away for free.
---
If you are trading an item for item, sell it for lets say 5K caps, then have them sell their item for 5K back. 
---
This way at least if they take off you are insured.
---
Could be wrong but, I always thought the 1st bag disappeared into the nether upon 2nd death, and spawned a new bag containing?. . . . You guessed it. None of the original loot that you were trying to recover, lol. Found my bag up in a tree this weekend at WS, lol. I guess I was marsupialing around when I died. I honestly got luck to have looked up in the tree though. But I know now, lol.
---
He is perm banned on the Market76 discord for scamming people.

I carry 4 sniper rifles: Pipe, Hunter, Lever and Gauss (all legendary in their own way) but my go to sniper rifle is my instigating Hunting Sniper Rifle. Appropriately perked it will take out almost any standard mob with with a single headshot provided I'm in cover. However, once my cover is blown or if I'm up against a mob it's not nearly so impressive. So depending on the situation I'll either switch out to my lever rifle (best for up close non-hominid creatures who like to faff about) or my gauss rifle (best for muties/scorched/bots in the middle distance when you have time to aim and charge your shot). My pipe rifle... eh... I'm probably gonna put that in storage. It's a two shot so maybe one day it'll be impressive again but for now the only thing I like about it is the sound it makes.
---
So for to sum up:
---
1. Hunting Sniper for my work-a-day all purpose sniper
---
2. Lever rifle for critters and anyone in my face
---
3. Gauss for heavyweight humanoids in the middle distance
---
4. Pipe Rifle because why not
---
53 is.... random. 
---
Thank you.
---
I remember whitesprings being a thing but I'm not a fan of leeching personally, how does a level 15 GS do that much damage btw
---
Any word on player vending? I've always wanted to build a store in an online game
---
It's consistent for me on PS4. I've gotten to the point where I'll stop every couple of minutes just to check and re- equip. Nothing worse than going from a gun fight into a melee weapon fight and you pull out fist instead of a supersledge.
---
I like this idea, I guess it would be fair for salted items to deplete the water meter
---
You just proved OP's point regarding actually being familiar with PvP and the different builds. If you knew you can stagger players using sentinel assassin's gear and once staggered you can take them out, then you'd know they're not unkillable at all.
---
I used the nukes and dragons build planner and it said 53 is when I get all the stuff I need for my build
---
Agreed. Happened to me unknowingly. I was like wtf??!
---
Quickly teleport back to camp to offload my junk and ran far away in case I was being hunted.
---
Thankfully some dude obliged to kill me... Not a good experience though
---
Really? Level 40, I just got there. Thanks for the warning!
---
&gt; Because bethesda thinks they need to aim for ~~the PVP audience~~ everyone *but* the traditional Fallout audience.
---
FTFY
---
I live in America and although I had never seen or heard of one before I could see mechanically what it was used for. 
---
Yeah I hate that. PvP is the worst part of the game in my opinion. Wish they would make separate servers or something for that. 
---
I used to have my camp in an unmarked location northwest of grafton. It was a windmill with an armor work bench, and enemies never spawned at my camp. Additionally, the armor workbench and windmill could not be destroyed, as they are part of the environment, making it a great location to camp at.
---
News flash, raiders are pieces of shit.  They don't care about skill, fairness,  or even your workshop.  They just want your blood, caps, and junk.  Source: I am a raider pos.  It's been that way in every fallout game.  Also power armor is terrible in pvp, no legit raiders would storm a workshop in full x-01.
---
It is bloodied + swing speed so I run around with my health halfway down. It does around 100 damage with the bloodied factor.
---
For myself personally, no lol. But I do have a few friends who would be glad to have it - how much caps were you generally looking to get for them?
---
I'm not even opposed to that being the case- however the game is horribly balanced for PVP
---
I guess I'll give credit to the players (even though I shouldn't) who RP raiders by going around the map and claiming all contested workshops. It's a good way to do it without massacring someone's camp, but at the same time when 3 level 120+ players show up with explosive combat shotguns and marsupial mutations and just wipe you, it's really not fun.
---
There are some random ones, but you may also run into a robot called Mr. Veterinarian who is leading a bunch of them around.  He seems to be pretty rare, though. I've put in over 500 hours and have only encountered him twice. 
---
That's just because there are not enough cats yet... I never saw one 
---
Sure! I will add you when I am able to a access my ps4
---
It'd be nice knowing if I request a supply drop that it is marked some way so I know it's mine.
---
I am on pc ad well.  Do you stll have the recipe?  I would really like to acquire it.  Ill even be happy to pay some caps for it if need be.   Im d4klutz on the pc and usually play between 7pm and 10pm after work.
---
 Even on PC with 1 - 0 mapped, 10 choices ,the game will deselect my main knife and move it to another key.
---
Regular whitesprings is still decent
---
I didn't know that was even possible, the only real drag is that for a lot of my old characters early life I went and got every mutation other then herbivore and spent levels 5-32 with super low health, wish I had that weapon back then
---
So how does bloodied actually work
---
This is one of the most dangerous bugs. I run into it daily. I'm a rifleman with an axe secondary. 
---
I like this. Something very basic that would make a big difference in how people approach each others bases.   
---
I would love to see the robot workbench make its way into the base building system so we could make assaultrons, sentrys and so on, but i know that would be a pipe dream.   Mines however wouldnt/shouldnt take much work at all.  To repair/replace once blown just require another mine in the same way when food crops are wrecked... easy peasy\~
---
orrrr they could just give us turrets that are pretty much NOT useless, you know ones that can handle lvl 5 mole rats... GET OFF MY LAWN you ugly little boogers\~!  Just leave my melons alone!
---
Yeah, making your way in the world today takes everything ya got...
---
Which is why they need to just split servers. Let griefers go to theirs and carebears go to theirs, everybody wins. Heck write it into the story, you could do a slightly different intro where everybody in The PVP servers comes from vault 77 or something which was an experiment in releasing convicted felons into the wild after 25 years of incarceration by Mr. gutsy jailers, initiate the hunger games/Battle royale with every screwball raider for themself. 
---
There is player vending coming. It'll be a vending machine you can place at your camp and sell off things from.
---
It’s a valuable resource
---
I still have it, how about 250 caps for it? Sound fair? I'm not sure what time zone you're in, but I'm available for the next four hours or so and then off for 10 hours. My IGN is PsykerGirl. 
---
It's not a guaranteed fix, but the AoE damage from molotovs and grenades will often penetrate under ground and kill mobs that spawn in unkillable spots.
---
 Wonderful, but I have thought that from the beginning.
---
Good
---
How does he have x-01 PA at level 23?
---
The bloodied effect is just the lower your health is, the higher damage the bloodied weapon puts out.
---
Lol, you know I actually paused because I wasn't sure. Thank you, I'll correct it now. 
---
I distinctly remember the toilet closest to the bathroom door in USAF Satellite Station Olivia in Fallout 4. 200+ years later there are still stains from a literal shit explosion that go up the toilet, onto the wall, etc. And a plunger still in there.
---
Well back then out of 200+ health I was down to about 30 so I'm guessing that's high damage output
---
I got a recipe for super stimpacks at an event in the mire.
---
Thank you very much, extremely accurate 
---
IMO, the game is a horrible experience until you get to about lvl 30 were you finally start getting some decent weapons and gear and stop getting your ass handed to you at every turn.
---
The percent damage mitigation in this game needs to be toned down. People can use lone wanderer(20%), dodgey(30%), fireproof (45% against explosive) blocker(45% against melee) full assassins (40% against all player damage) and sentinels (75%). Even if you stagger them, they still have 90%damage resistance, 70% if not in a team.
---
I’ve played since Beta, I’m level 40
---
Thanks so much for this info. I'll definitely be looking out for the cats from now on. 
---
That's fair enough, I'm not familiar enough/dont have the electrically charged
---
I claim them and log out immediately. I mostly want the plans, but it's a pity I can't explore the workshop mechanics more because someone will just one shot me given I stay for long enough after claiming one, anywhere in the map. Meh. 
---
Lol, I wasn't sure if I was falling for a trap or proving the point or both lol, but I had to say it 
---
Thank you!  The amount of times I've had people call me a griefer/hacker and threaten to report me is unbelievable.  Another thing people dont seem to understand is that a level 50 is capable of the same damage and resistences as a level 500.  I also get a lot of people claiming I grief them when they continue seeking revenge. 
---
Gotta turn all that raw ore into bullets.
---
This is a golden idea right here. Those wall turrets can be mounted in far more locations and at better angles than ones we have now due to there design. 
---
Imagine having a turret mounted in your C.A.M.P. home ceiling for all those times enemies magically spawn inside of it (Even though my doors are locked!). Can’t tell you how many Fusion Generators I’ve lost. 
---
Adding to what you said. Maybe we could even get higher Levels/Tiers of turrets like the game world spawns. Those level 48 Heavy Machine Gun turrets with the explosive rounds would do wonders mounted to my Forts walls. 
---
I..... I wasn't expecting this.
---
Could probably generalize this to "welcome to the internet".
---
Here I was just starting to convince myself that was some kind of Mandella effect...
---
Yay organs!
---
They are representing Fallout fanboys who don't understand that they don't need to defend the devs. Pointless, ineffective and often bearing a disease.
---
I’m on Xbox and it happens to me pretty consistently. Usually seems to happen when I fast travel. Now I’m in the habit of checking my weapons to make sure I don’t raise my hands instead of my super sledge. 
---
Most of the updates have been released at 9AM EST which is 2PM GMT.
---
I make that 3PM CET. 
---
I got about 40 raw yellowcake with green thumb, it’s collected from irradiated glowing fungus and irradiroot, it’s also good for crimson and violet flux, and the garden behind the steak house has about 30 raw cobalt and fluorescent flux.
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half.
---
Aww somebody sounds like a 6 year old who didn't get their nap for the day. 
---
Well as the infamous Doc once said, " Well why don't you make like a tree then, and get the fuck out."
---
Well, I have some good news for you lol.
---
We're getting player vendors soon, however, I haven't heard any news on whether or not we will able to publicize our camps to everyone else. 
---
Personally, I feel publicizing our camps should be option when vendors come out since coming across as other player's came can be a rare occurrence at times. 
---
Pacifist doesn't stop you from getting hurt it just stops you from hitting other players accidentally
---
gona play on both of the servers so meh
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half
---
Dammit, you beat me to it xD
---
Technically they aren’t unkillable if you know how to deal with them, but majority of the newer players don’t. I’ve killed one before even though I only did pvp a handful of times, he’s a melee build so I got him chasing me and shot him with my bloodied explosive shotgun. But most newer players simply attempt to fight them on the spot which does little damage and lose their caps. 
---
Sir..eh?  Wow...you don't see that very much these days.  Usually it is some kid screaming obscenities..and worse. 
---
I found a veterinarian mr handy bot escorting two across the wasteland. 
---
Its gone lol 
---
They did a lot of hype advertising though. That would make it rough on the bottom line turning a profit.
---
Where did the idea that they were copying Fortnite come from, anyway? Did they mention it anywhere or are people just assuming based on something with gameplay? I'd never even heard of Fortnite until I came to /r/FO76.
---
So... Has anyone encountered the one shot kill while in passive mode at a train station trying to vend? I have encountered several people on PS4 who hang out at Watoga waiting to kill people. My group usually has to switch servers, lose caps based on their level, and then deal with the food they've crafted spoiling because of the server hop. Not to mention the junk they were trying to sell getting picked up my these people would are melee or hand to hand builds.
---
Oh yes, the community in this forum has a lot of people that don't like the game, and clearly aren't playing the game. 
---
The moderation of this forum is highly suspect too. They will do things like remove multiple posts about the same subject. But they are totally fine with leaving up bogus attack threads. And then the moderators get in a real snit if you question the moderation of this forum. The best is, some of the moderators of this forum, are also moderators in the /fallout subreddit. A subreddit where it's perfectly fine and acceptable, even encouraged, to attack and crap on fallout 76. 
---
So yeah, the moderation here isn't happening, which is why this forum has so many terrible posters, who are allowed to get away with what they post. 
---
It wouldn't matter so much, if Bethesda didn't do a lot of posting and replying here, making it necessary to check this forum.  
---
What I suggest, start reporting the threads. Sure, the moderators
---
Great way to force pacifists into PVP mode! Fantastic change I say! /s
---
Your thoughts on prime gauss capacitors location queen only?
---
Nobody expects the....cats?  Hmm, something like that anyway.

(Happy cake day!)

I would like to be able to pet the cats too! I had one come by my CAMP a while back and I was trying to let him for about 5 mins!

I thought you get wanted if you lockpick into locked drop requested by somebody else.. last few days - most of the drops were unocked - no issues at all...
---
I found it in the Cranberry bog for free. 1200 doesn't sound so bad. Or did you mean 12,000?
---
Thanks! Another user pointed that out already, however now that I know, I'll be on the lookout for him!

.50 Cal Machine Gun chews through ammo. To keep it balanced (realism be damned), it doesn't do crazy damage per shot. So with perks, you can craft 180 .50 cal ammo per craft using 40 steel / 10 lead and I think 12 gunpowder. And if you couldn't you'd have another basically unusable weapon like the Light Machine gun, which is just too costly to fire due to it using .308 ammo.
---
So since the .50 cal receiver on the hunting rifle uses the same ammo, it wouldn't really make sense in terms of balance for it to do more damage than the .308 receivers, since .308 is more costly to craft.
---
Although... the Light Machine gun uses .308 and it does far less damage per shot with a higher rate of fire than the .50 Cal. So that doesn't really hold up as a theory. 
---
And then you have the 5mm Gatling Gun, which is a much smaller / less powerful round, and it does more damage per shot in the Gatling gun, but like 1/8th as much or less per shot in the minigun.
---
Basically, none of the calibers / damage / fire rates make sense in Fallout 76.
---
Lmfao!
---
The game was so bad in Beta, you decided to drop another 200+ hrs into it just to make sure?? You've basically averaged about 2 hrs of play a day since launch. You sure are a sucker for punishment.
---
You dropped 250 hrs into the game, didnt even fully finish all the quests... and the game is a shell? And we are getting new content TOMMOROW and have a roadmap with lots to come. I could see if you wrapped the game in 50 hrs, it might be considered a shell, but come one...
---
Give us some actual reasons for hating the game, other than the youtube drool or do you not understand how to feel and play for yourself?
---
Im not sure if your trolling or just a sheep...?
---
Me. Though I may have both. I kind of feel like a purpose driven raider char armed with chems a mad max assortment of weapons from chainsaws to black powder rifles, endurance and luck perks out the wazoo to avoid depending on likely kill zones and massive paranoia would just be more fun. 
---
I hit 150 last night.
---
This happened to me the other day. I was like, quest to get random supply drop? Sure, ok.  Then I'm freakin wanted. Not cool.
---
What system are you on? I'm not noticing a lack of players on xbox, in fact I've had several instances lately where I've had to wait several minutes to join friends because their server was full.
---
As for nukes, prime seems less common, but I'm still seeing them on a daily basis elsewhere. My buddy and I played for 4-5 hours on on Saturday; WS was nuked when we logged in, a few minutes later someone dropped one in the middle of Watoga, and a couple hours later someone nuked Morgantown.
---
We wanted to drop one of our own and the silos hadn't reset, so we server hopped and the server we landed in had a nuke zone on Harper's Ferry. Ran through there for a bit, and then we dropped one on the area surrounding Lewisburg.
---
PSA: Lewisberg sucks for mobs/loot if mutants spawn, but if you get lucky and it's ghouls/wendigos it might be OK. Also, there isn't shit for flora in the area, so it was pretty much a bust, but at least now we know not to drop there again.
---
You’ll get some people here.  But also don’t be afraid to just say hi in-game to some friendly travellers.
---
Or if you're in pacifist, it will say "you must turn off pacifist".  When i see someone owns a workshop i assume it's for PvP reasons and I engage.
---
I got downvoted when i said there was griefing potential in this, imagine some jerk using drop requests to force people into pvp
---
Ohhhhh ok. Well that’s definitely good to know.. lol thanks!
---
My understanding is that the vendor caps reset 20 hours after you visited them first.
---
They take 24 hours after you last sold to reset their caps. 
---
I have about 30 supply drop tapes sitting in my stash, i don't even bother using them. ironically i do loot the ones i find and im not getting flagged wanted so go figure...
---
"nodding head slowly, smiling."
---
The cap resets 20 hours after you trade with them. Your vendor pools do not reset on a server hop they are tied to you.
---
I don't think this a good idea. There's no real reason for this. We already know that the vendors cap stash for each player resets every 20 hours. 
---
Stuff like this really reduces the immersion of the game, and that's more important than something like this. 
---
Right?  100 caps each if I'm not in a team. 
---
I started this event three times, and every time I shot the damn cargobot down, the crate had "steal" with a level 0 lock.  The first two times I thought maybe I had happened across someone else's event, and not wanting to get into PvP, I went back to Whitesprings and restarted it.  The third time I finally just cracked open the crate and got the nuclear keycard, and it didn't flag me as Wanted.
---
Lvl 14 baby woo!
---
What if the players were the ones being let out of solitary ;)
---
Maica-ta cand arunca cu papucu
---
You on PC? I can craft you a set if you want.
---
&gt; your hunting rifle will get lumped in with the shed crowd. Ten bullets per minute is indistinguishable from zero.
---
Nah, i won't get lumped in with the shed crowd. My 10 bullets/minute is better than 1 bullet / encounter. 
---
(and really, it's way more than 10/minute..., also there's no way SBQ has 1,5m HP&lt;especially since a regular SB only has ~3700-4000HP, perhaps most of your bullets fail to do full damage? considering that you can't take advantage of stuff like tank killer. Or maybe you just miss a lot? )
---
Who needs soup?  Just get the Carnivore mutation, and eat whatever meat you come across, you'll never go hungry again.  Just drink all that excess Purified Water you probably have for thirst.  Problem solved(not really).
---
Each vendor respawns their caps after 20 hours, related to you specifically. But their inventory is server specific. If you server hop the vendor won't suddenly have more caps, but they may have different items. Server hopping at the WS bunker is how I got all my x-01 mods. 
---
I am.   
---
Solas67 is the handle and I'm on right now.
---
You get to listen to the inner monologue of a black cat when you do the Vox syringer quest, my favourite quest lol
---
True story bruh
---
i am just level 35 with 1200 caps
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/bethesdaplz)
---
Hunters will apply to wolves, dogs, mongrels, beavers, opossum, cats, Yao guai, frogs (non rad toads)
---
Generally anything that has four legs that isn’t a shell or scale based creature. 
---
Haven’t tested on gulpers, and fog crawlers. 
---
Hey that works just as long as they're quirky and ill tempered. Bonus points if they were supposed to be cargo botted to North Carolina and crash in southern WV in the intro. 
---
That's a pretty uncool thing to say for a game that's broken so much I clip through an object on *death.* 
---
That's something worth server hopping for
---
nice. thanks for the info!
---
I mean, if you didn't requisition a supply drop, it's likely not yours... But at the same time, yes, I agree that it should tell you at some point that it's someone else's. 
---
Yes.. that! They should have seperated that from the beginning. It never works out if you mix things up.
---
Cause then you start nerfing things cause it doesn't work in PvP, and then all the PvE players get screwed over, as their weapons suddenly turn useless.
---
I hate that in every game that does mix PvE with PvP - it just never works.
---
What I’ve gotten used to doing, as a result of this bug, is mainly switching between the two weapons I want to use 2-3 times before a battle just to insure the “Hot Swap” function doesn’t bug out and unequip my previously used weapon. 
---
So far that ritual before battle has not failed me.
---
This is my personal experience, YMMV:
---
&gt; What do bans mean? Does that mean it bans your Xbox account or your gamertag? Is that something to worry about if I don’t dupe? Is that the only way you can get banned?
---
Bans (usually suspensions) are on the account, the license on the software that allows you to play. Not being an xboner, I'm not sure what the gamertag actually means. During the big round of suspensions a couple of weeks ago, some non-dupers got suspended because duped items showed up in their inventories - be careful if you find a bag with 10,000 Nuka Grape; it's probably not worth picking up.
---
&gt;Is there anything I can do about someone attacking my base, or do I just have to log out?
---
I just log out and find another server.
---
&gt;How are people still able to kill me while I’m using pacifist?
---
If you take over a workshop, you're leaving pacifist mode voluntarily while you hold it. Otherwise...if they're persistent or have a seriously powerful weapon and you've got little DR they can whittle away at you.
---
&gt;What’s the best way to accumulate caps fast?
---
Selling stuff to vendors will reliably get you 1400 caps per day (1600 if you find Grahm). Trading with players can be profitable, but my go-to for quick caps (since I don't want duped goods - see above - is to go mutant hunting.
---
&gt;Best player vs queen weapon?
---
Way beyond my level. From what I've been able to gather, tse handmade on the wings to force her to land then hammer at her with an All Rise. I'm probably wrong on this though, never having faced the queen.
---
&gt;Best pve weapon?
---
Depends on your build. I love my handmade rifle with long recon scope and Blade of Bastet.
---
&gt;Best armor?
---
Power armor, Excavator gives you +100 carry weight if you're a scavenger. X01 gives best rad and energy resistance while Ultracite gives best ballistic. Non-power armor, you can have my heavy leather when you pry it from my dead corpse.
---
&gt;Did they take away the ability to server hop for materials?
---
Kind of. Some items are instanced; if you empty all the medkits in an area then relog, they'll be empty on the new server. If you're collecting black titanium from miner suits in Blackwood Mine, the miners will spawn on every server you hit.
---
So from most, its adventure world or raider world
---
This is a good post. I wish @bethesda would acknowledge it. 
---
Oh I got it. You have 1200, you don't want to spend it all on one thing. Well, the recipe can be found out in the world. 
---
Not w/ the stranger, but if you head east down the highway between the train station and The Whitesprings entrance, you'll come upon a couple of vehicle pile ups.  The one furthest east spawns 5-7 ghouls ( many people forget about this during a nuke event ).  Twice now I have gone there and was attacked by a scorched beast and it's minions with no ghouls in sight. After killing the Scorched beast, it began to rain ghouls.  Not sure if they were ever alive, but I'm sure the impact killed them,  as I saw they started as specks in the sky the second time this happened
---
Neat, thanks
---
I just want to know if I have any cap sales left on responders vs other stations. My character would know if they had sold that much during that time period why can't I? 
---
A standard trade restock time would make more sense lore-wise, a robotic area having a set schedule of deliveries /fabrication/ restock  makes more sense then "oh you last saw me at 3am  so you have to wait until  11pm tomorrow for me to get more supplies"
---
Yeah, tried it. Didn't work this time. I had to leave the area, then come back to "reclaim it".
---
Actually, I have the opposite occur. I hit on VATS nearly every time. At least with percentages higher than 35%, that I have noticed. It could be my perk cards and legendary armors, but I love it. Hopefully I find a decent legendary lever gun soon.
---
Was it Sal's Grinder shop?
---
Ah, I see. I tried to do this for 2 instances of fallout 4 on the same machine (one modded, one not). Unfortunately I don't think there's any way to do this, as the ini (and save data) file location is hard coded, so is shared across both.
---
Ya, I agree - I run solo most of the time; when I die multiple times at the same location, locating the bag again is almost pure luck, especailly if I was in a grassy area at the time....no locator diamond, bag blends in....and sometimes its not in the same place.... or...got killed standing in the middle of a road, on respawn, found the bag inside the closest house...
---
Chiming in for PC, mainly just caps though
---
unrealistic ? you r the one who enter virtual world
---
I know, it sucks. You're in for more pain lol there's a lot of broken/glitched/problems but the game is  getting better slowly.
---
Nope. All you have to do is scrap the plant and you get a whole plant back. No need to repair plants.
---
Between Garrahan mining company and R&amp;G station. There is a nice clearing just off one of the roads. Fox, radstag, squirrels, frogs, mongrels. Jut had a few low level scorched show up this weekend. Been there for a while. Easily accessible to southern points on the map.
---
Also did a spot in the Mire under some trees and away from the road and between Abbie's Bunker and Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Ended up being next to 4 beehives, so it was a constant farming opportunity.
---
Why do people always feel like adding how many hours they played makes other people give a shit more?
---
This is part of my point -there's NO reason for that.  It's a malicious waste of time, when you consider how much time it takes to amass that shit.
---
Agreed.  If there is no scaled benefit I will just say “unprestigious.”
---
It’s 2019 and that image is in a worse state then the dead sea scrolls... Seems fishy 😉
---
I think they are talking about the ones you launch via govt requisition vs the random world drops.
---
That one is very specific, and I agree thats an annoying bug. It may be related to who shot it first vs the killing blow. If someone shot that drone before you arrived but you took it down, it may be why its flagged for someone else.  
---
I did not know that was an issue in the past, and I would randomly shoot a drone to draw the escort over and watch them decimate supermutant outposts just for fun.
---
Thanks a lot for all that info! Helps a lot! 
---
**SPANISH INQUISITION!!!**
---
I've noticed a marked increase in attacks lately.  I thought it was due to adding a brahmin pen because that's when the attacks stepped up, but I got rid of it and the attacks are continuing.
---
I don't think there's any guaranteed safe camping spots, but you can at least mitigate it by choosing your location wisely. 
---
The Forest: You'll still get attacked, but worst case scenario it'll be level 9 ghouls or scorched, which low level turrets can actually kill.
---
Train Stations: There's a fairly large safe zone around most of the trains stations that extends beyond the "no build zone." For example, I was camped on the hillside just east of WS station (down hill from Blackwater) for months and can count on one hand the number of times I had to deal with mobs attacking. If something did attack it was usually a pack of wolves drawn in from the power station nearby, and there was one SB that was easy enough to take out with some assistance of the robots near the front gate of the resort.
---
My current spot is on a junk pile just north of Watoga. There's a guaranteed death claw that spawns in the nearby substation, but the camp is just outside his aggro range. Anything that does spawn to attack my camp gets distracted by him, he kills them all, and then goes back to wandering around.
---
I can't wait to try it haha. I'm still fairly new to the game so I'll be looking out for the quest haha
---
I'd just be happy if the bag were easier to find. But then again, that's a double edged sword. That would screen "free junk! Take me!!" 
---
May I suggest avoiding incomplete games at release and instead wait for its launch? Usually completed AAA games require a “GOTY” label or other industry jargon. It’s meant to inform consumers that the product is not only available for purchase but ALSO is a complete game! How can you lose?!
---
Chameleon mission would be amazing *if* wood armor could go above 1 star and/or worked with it without needing weightless effect.
---
The moment they announced that F76 was going to be an online only game with PvP.  Bethesda has been walking back on that ever since.  Even the comparisons to DayZ and Rust according to Bethesda is inaccurate, but yet for some reason or other they still insist on keeping some PvP.  If you go by what Todd Howard said last year before the game launched, then its a social experiment that has failed, because all they've accomplished with PvP is enabling the griefers.
---
https://www.inverse.com/article/47124-fallout-76-won-t-really-be-a-survival-game
---
The players know better - and even before the game was launched, made parodies about griefers.  Cause, that's what PvP does to a game unfortunately.  Its time for Todd and Bethesda to call it quits - cause those emergent moments basically amounts to griefers, under the pretense of raiders.  Like bullies wanting an excuse to justify their pathetic existence, which is what comes to mind anytime I hear someone saying they're just role-playing a raider.
---
Ill be on around 330 EST what level set do you want?
---
This is why I want so badly for the servers to be separate, and to require new characters. If you want a full pvp mode, then you should have to do EVERYTHING in that pvp mode. I want organic, natural pvp where I run into a random while out scrounging / questing and end up fighting. As it is now, people will go to pvp servers only to pvp, and then go back to the pve servers to do everything else. My suggestion got a lot of downvotes though, mostly from high level pvpers who have done a lot of ~~duping~~  trading and grinding to get their full assassin / sentinel pvp sets and 10-12 top tier weapons (of which I've only found one in 300 levels of grinding by the way).
---
You are your character. If you don't remember, then your character doesn't remember. Because they are one in the same. 
---
There is a standard refresh time. It's every 20 hours from when you sell to a vendor. So if you go to a vendor at say 2 pm, sell him 200 caps worth of stuff, then he won't have caps for you until 20 hours later. 
---
This really isn't a quality of life. The vendors are all connected based on the Faction they belong too. 
---
So if you sell to Bob in Flatwoods, the ones In Welch, Lewisburg, Charleston Fire House, Camden Park, Charleston Station, the two in Grafton and the two in Morgantown will all have the same amounts available. 
---
You can google to find out where all the vendor bots are, what factions they are on, and then figure out the best route to take to get to each. 
---
I second this. A 1* instigating lever is tops.  Any other *s is just gravy on top. Having quick hands or legendary effects that mess with the ammo pool are a blast. Not to mention.45 becomes near weightless with bandolier. 
---
There certainly would be the opportunity for some great super mutant dialogue though!
---
Also had cows do this when I went to a small lake up in the hills, made me think the Zetans were at it again!
---
Empathy or Herd Mentality. Saturday I forgot to equip Starched Genes while entering a nuke zone and ended up with both. By the time I'd cleaned those two out of my system, I'd lost marsupial and speed demon as well. Ended up wiping all my mutations and starting from scratch. 8 hours of server hopping left, I finally had Speed Demon, Marsupial, Electrified, and Egghead. Didn't want to chance the shitty "fuck the solo player" mutations to get my Healing Factor and Bird Bones back; I'll just have to save my caps until I can get the serum recipes for those.
---

---
It would be funny to loot some Acrobat armor off him.
---
Watch out for the high level snallygaster in the nuclear mire!
---
I read that someone found the mod in Watoga. But minutes later they scrapped and got both. So no factual ideas but. Check the end game vendors. 
---
Thanks. I kept seeing it compared to Fortnite in various places but couldn't figure out why and it was bugging me.
---
All in good fun. Yeah my mind is usually in the gutter.  The "Legendary wood" cracked me up.
---
Why do you think so many carry a board on them?
---
There is a pond not far west along the road from the Overseer's camp. I used to have my C.A.M.P. set up there and saw a cat usually every other time I logged in. They drop string but no meat...
---
Toss a molotov at the landing site before they hit. gets damage in before they die, so you get exp and loot.
---
Let's wait until closer to the summer time when more info will be released, shall we?
---
I'm level 34 currently. I'm not sure what levels there are.....
---
Uh, how long is that time from when you sent that post? I'm in Australia and it's already pretty late....
---
Meka Leka Hi Meka Hiney Ho
---
Oh, I see--yes, I'm talking about a different event.  A bug nonetheless apparently, but thanks for clarifying.
---
Joy. I'm someone at Bethesda sees this or something or it'll get responded to. I can't even leave feedback on their forums because the connection failed to get the forum working.
---
2 pts of damage for the hardened .308 over the refined .50.
---
2 point dmg, vs 70+ more .50 ammo crafted than the .308 each time.
---
Your fault for naming him that. You name a girl "Candy", she's gonna work the pole. Name a boy Grug, he's going to end up in a situation where he has to beat a horde of ghouls to death with his bare fists.
---
I think a better option would be to allow players to sell/trade blueprints. Just buying someone's camp would make it too easy. 
---
Are you on PC?  I can sell you all the serums you need.
---
I also miss setting up a drop and watching people congregate and trade around it.
---
Yes I am aware of this... I'm saying have a think that having Responders: XXX/200 etc (as a map tooltip on the legend, or even in my pipboy would help)
---
And if I sell stuff to the vendors at 10PM and next login at 4PM the next day I will more likely not remember what I have sold to which vendor as real life takes up more of my memory then vendors I have sold to, but my character has had 0 time elapse and should know. 
---
I understand the current mechanics, what I am saying is that an automated area should have a set restock schedule not a random cool down
---
That's so true. I don't understand how the resource balancing works at BGS. 
---
* A lead extractor generates 20 lead scrap per hour.  
---
* An acid extractor generates 20 waste acid per hour.  
---
* 1 waste acid and 2 lead ore can be smelted to create 5 lead scrap.  
---
* Therefore, an acid extractor can generate 100 lead scrap per hour.
---
Since lead ore is trivial to come by, you'd have to be mentally deficient to build a lead extractor rather than an acid extractor if you want lead scrap. That, to me, makes no god damn sense.
---
u/ladydevann, any comment from the dev team why resource extraction rate balancing doesn't make sense?
---
Yup. Ogre314 there as well? What price are you asking?
---
Two shot explosive lever action with reduced vats cost and an anti armor explosive handmade for when my lever breaks.  The lever is definitely not weak.  If I'm gonna take on the sbq i pull out my instigating dragon w plus 50% crit dmg,  it if I'm entering pvp and a stash is nearby.  When my adrenaline is going the listed dmg on my dragon is 630, w plus 50% leg affect and instigating and better crit crits i hv one shot hi level scorch beasts.  The leveraction is my overall favorite though
---
Yep the rot is in deep here.
---
  I'm finding the opposite - I'm on a cliff between toxic valley and savage divide.
---
When I had no turrents, ghouls came down the mountain occasionally - so I added fences to steer them to the cliff - no damage to me or the camp.....
---
After I added 6 turrets, no attacks at all.
---
After I started the small adhesive farm, camp budget was full.  I had read here turrets took lots of budget, so I dropped it down to 4 turrets - now if I am in camp, it is attacked at least once per session. Mainly dogs and molerats, and once, mutants.
---
RuneScape did PvP and PvE well back 14 years ago. PvP was only enabled in either a specific zone that risked your loot or was limited to special events you had to enter that protected your inventory. Literally look back to 2006 and you have it there. 
---
Fallout 76 with a Wild zone that risked what you're carrying would be great as could use it to settle arguments and for challenge. Add some loot there to encourage some exploration. Have it behind a blast zone so you see a rad spike plus warning signs so people don't just stumble.
---
Then add what Fallout 4 failed to do properly but hinted at and have a Raider Fight Club camp where you can go to challenge people to fight and bet Caps or items. Obviously likely need a margin of equal set for both sides unless both agree to waive it so it keeps the risks fair. 
---
Further expand it inspired again by RuneScape like the previous 2 and have a siege event where you fight for one faction to defend and the other attacks. This allows for traps and environmental challenge.
---
The world is PvE focused with people free to try PvP. No more griefers yet still healthy for PvP. 
---
This is possibly more of a "forced" reset so all late game players will be on the same footing. I wouldn't be surprised if no matter what level over 50 you changed to prestige 1. Might not be right but it's best for balance
---
It's 2 hours from now if you will be on.
---
I have no problem at all spending my ATOMS at the shop. In fact, I have spent a few bucks so far and just about every Atom I have earned.
---
Na, humanity is just shitty in general. Though, the anonymity of the internet does make it much worse at times it seems
---
I also melee, and I've been using my flux to craft situational mods for my PA. For bloodied in a nuke zone, I make a full set with emergency protocols. I have another set with motion assist servos. So on and so forth.
---
There's also crafting underarmor mods that call for it too, and I like to make good underarmors for friends.
---
 I'm not hurting for any sort of flux at the moment, but as I get different ideas for playstyles, I use it up and craft what's necessary. 
---
Sell it on the open market for caps and buy better melee weapon/armors. Wish they had ultracite melee varients that would be pretty awesome.
---
Fuck PvP... I want to roam the wasteland and eavesdrop on raiders talking about the jet making you jittery. Radio stations with DJs that update their sayings based on what's going on in the world.
---
No "NPCs" was a mistake.
---
The refined .50 reciever does 2 points less than the hardened .308. Ammo/cost ratio on the .50 is worlda better than the .308, especially at lower levels.
---
For a miniscule damage reduction, you literally get more "bang for your buck" with the .50.
---
I'm OGREGEV and will be on this evening after 8pm eastern.  I charge a sliding scale starting at 400 caps for the first one going down depending on how many you want.  
---
I have the plans and make the serums, but gathering the materials to make them has a real cost to it (plus the ROI on the cost of the plans).
---
Come over to r/fo76FilthyCasuals. Much less negative. It's about having fun in the game and even reveling in its quirks.
---
//Cue the "circlejerk" comments and downboat armada.
---
Q1. Being banned means what it means. Your Bethesda account is connected to your Xbox/Playstation, so if you do get banned you just need to make another Bethesda account and most likely a second Xbox/Playstation. I'm unsure how PC works. Also, while duping is one the most common ways of getting banned I would imagine anything Bethesda considers an exploit could lead to a ban. As long as you keep your nose clean I can't imagine you getting into any trouble. 
---
Q2. Well, I recommend killing anyone that would dare attempt to destroy your base, but if them seem too powerful then I would just sever hop. If it's a player you could try talking to them, but that may or may not result in anything. 
---
Q3. As of right now, you still take damage from other players even if you're using pacifist. Pacifist just means you won't do any damage to any other plays (Unless you're in an area that triggers PvP). Also, they are some flaws in Fallout 76 in which people can engage PvP with you without your knowledge. Examples of this are Workshops and players on your team engaging in PvP 
---
Q4. I would say doing daily runs around the map and selling random goods to the vendors. They're a variety of ways to do this. All together you can earn about 1.4K - 1.6K if you have the goods to sell. Also, if you're interested they're a couple trading subreddits in which you can make a profit if you got the right stuff. 
---
Q5. Unsure what the question is asking. 
---
Q6. Similar to question 5, if you're curious what are the best weapons I would instead recommend looking into the best builds. Some weapons can go from mediocre to fantastic if you have the right perks and effects active.
---
Q6. Best armor? Hard to say, but I would imagine it would one of the Power Armors like Ultracite or X-01. I don't use that stuff, so I'm unsure. However, as I mentioned about weapons, you can get a nice build with normal armor if you have the right effects and perks.
---
Q7. As of my knowledge certain if not all junk won't respawn if you simply server hop, but that's a wild guess. I'm pretty unsure on how server hoping works now.
---
Hopefully some of this helped. Good luck in the Wasteland!
---
I remember during the BETA when me and a group of people scrounged the wasteland to find a piece of copper for it. Most fun I had the whole time
---
I don't.I just want you morons to see I actually played the game , and not think i'm some stupid cuck who saw a bad review on youtube and decided to beat an already dead horse
---
i think my next purchase is the orange spacesuit (with atoms earned in-game only)...these work in nuke zones right?
---
Literally unplayable.
---
yes and it sucks!
---
This sub would never downvote fair criticism ^^^/s
---
As far as I know, its not. A few updates ago they said they would remove unobtainable apparel items, and the recipes to craft those items. I lost the ability to craft the Hunters Hood, but I can still craft the Marine Helmet. But thats all I know.
---
I'm on PS4, but don't get to play too often.  Darn kids and life...  People are much more friendly in game then in real life...
---
I don't think they care unless you get a lot of upvotes or views tbh lol
---
Completely agree!
---
I am really curious to how player vending is going to work. If the system allows you to show your location on the map with a fast travel option, I can put my house where I want it.
---
If not, the real estate near Whitesprings and Watoga (for example) could be all spoken for, no matter which server you hop on.
---
Well, I didn't expect the Appalachian Inquisition.....
---
Uh.I play a LOT.And I mean a lot.250 is like my average number for games , and like after that I consider I've had enough to talk about the game.
---
Bargain my ass.250 h is average for me.I play a lot.
---
Seen this at Generals steakhouse and West Tek 
---
Supply drops are useless after level 10 anyway.
---
I'll be there. I'll make a special effort.
---
Yeah I already did that.Gave it all away on r/Market76.Also who dafuq plays on console lol?
---
Lot's of lead ore and someone who's name should not be uttered.
---
Damnation. It just feels so unfair, y'know?
---
Good source of cursed concrete
---
Once you craft a decon shower, there's no point. I did use 4 cobalt for my shielded V76 jumpsuit for the INT bonus?
---
I'll never waste the time, resources, or carry weight for Ultricite ammo, so I just trade it now.
---
Prices are still way too high for a lot of stuff, though.
---
Again, stuff like this ruins the immersion. And immersion is a big factor for many people for playing games. 
---
Immersion needs to be balanced with game play. You not remembering which vendors you sold too isn't about balanced game play. 
---
Saying that what you know vs what your character knows, isn't a fact or data that supports what you want. They are one in the same. And yes, there is a time spent for when you aren't logged onto your character. The game time moves faster than our time, so it passes in the game world when you are logged off. 
---
What level set do you want?
---
I get this issue often !
---
Any fix ?
---
iOS app designer
---
Yeah, I've only been to a nuke zone once so I get that there's difficulty in accumulating stable flux. Also found out that raw flux dumped into a stash is a bad idea because it gains a ton of weight once it becomes inert.
---
Up their game and lower their prices. 
---
Wow do you hate homeless people? How appalling.
---
Cool! I'll head over there next time I play then, and check it out. That's pretty hilarious they drop string haha
---
Very North West past the woodyard on the water is safe. In the last week I've had 1 squad of supermutants turn up and I play 8-10 hours a day or so
---
How does that make any sense,theyre two completely different games
---
&gt; the current plan is to let people move characters between Adventure and Survival modes at any time they please is a dealbreaker for me.
---
Why? I hear people making this same argument but it really doesn't make any sense to me.  What difference does it make?
---
It's on the way. I've already turned my camp into a shop, right smack in an area that will probably see alot of traffic after this new update tommorow. 
---
PSA, raw flux sells to the vendors for a lot more than inert flux
---
Lots of superlatives, no details, shitty attitude to boot.  You could be President someday.
---
Because it's brokenthesda.
---
So your cap pool resets after 20 hours (My initial understanding is that it was 24 but that was incorrect) but it's not server specific. So if the idea is to server hop for extra caps, I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed.
---
But what server hopping _can_ do for you with vendors is switch their loot pool. So they will generate certain mods and whatever from a certain list they they have to generate from, and that will vary server-to-server. So vendor hopping can help you if you know which vendor should have that thing you're looking for but they don't have it right now.
---
But the other, more important thing server hopping does for you imho is that sometimes you will get a 'fresh' young server and sometimes you will get a 'vintage' server that's been lived in a while. Now if you're looting, you want a 'fresh' server so you can go to all your favorite haunts and pick up all the coolant jugs and clipboards and desk fans and ammo bags or whatever.
---
But for vendors, if you're in a buying mood, you want a 'vintage' server. On a vintage server the vendor bots (especially popular ones like Whitespring, Watoga and Harper's Ferry) will be chock full of all the legendaries and mods and crap that all the other players have already sold. And yeah a lot of the time it's crap like one star junkies lead pipes. But sometimes you'll find something neat like a two star combat shotgun or a three star hunting rifle that just doesn't fit that players style. And yeah they're not cheap but for me it's worth ~600 caps not to spend a day trolling for crap and to just have something I know I like.
---
That's the point I enjoy building C.A.M.Ps but some players just place everything on the ground
---
But I bet they would buy a C.A.M.P already built and blueprints can be finicky.
---
I disagree, I think now, when they're still in the design phase, is exactly the right time to ask these questions and get input from players. They'll be far less likely to make changes if they only have a few weeks to make / test them.
---
I get the Flatwoods Monster pretty consistently in the Toxic Valley areas.
---
I would guess that about 55% of people who “love hardcore pvp” really just “love to grief low level players”
---
Like the kid on Xbox that killed the clothing vendor bot while screeching "die die die". Lmao. I have never wanted to spank a child more than what I did in that moment. 
---
I've been playing a long time and I feel you my dude. It's quite annoying but I love fallout lol I'm still giving them hope.
---
So you're asking the same question about 2 different groups of people I think.  I really believe Bethesada  has been listening to the No PVP crowd and with the launch of Survivor mode and looking into implementing no damage to player or camp if opted out of PVP, then maybe, just maybe, the "ruin the world for everyone" crowd will be out of business with the PVE people.
---
The real PVP people, of whom I think most are not in the griefing business, will switch back and forth as they want.  Most of them know how to act around non PVP players and go on about their business. 
---
Having stated my opinion, then I think the answer to both questions is: It all will depend how far Bethesda goes in implementing the no damage to PVE option I think.
---
Ps4. Almost every lobby i get put into is dead or everyones hiding from me. Ill hop a few times but not much better. Saw 2 nuke zones all weekend. Someone nuked prime site and only one person showed up. Wasnt even the person that launched the nuke. 
---
Some spawn in the forest randomly. The small pond will spawn in a random creature. A cat can be one.

SBQ -&gt; HP: 32,767
---
I have no idea how much she gets buffed in terms of hp for each additional player but i find it really hard to believe it could ever get as high as 1mil. 
---
I guess that you grossly overestimated your potential damage; picking the maximum possible in theory; meanwhile all my calculations were made based on the minimum damage i can deal. 
---
In other words, your math is bs, not applicable in real scenarios. 
---
I had the exact same thought, but unfortunately we will have to wait until more information comes out.
---
Hopefully, the vendors themselves are quite good and are able to hold a variety of things for us to sell. Also, I really hope Bethesda considers the possibility of chopsing to publicizing our Camps. This would greatly help me since I have my camp in the eastern part of the Mire.
---
Well, if you keep your balance and work your way around to the left and up, you can fall into the presidential suite.  That glitch has been there for months.
---
Bump 
---
I went through a frantic search like you describe and couldn't find it even though the indicator kept showing me zeroing in on it. I tried the 'drop-another-bag-and-retrieve-it method that sometimes gets the loot that falls through the surface to join the new bag...no joy. Pissed off as hell because my loot had about 600 caps worth of bulk silver and nuclear material and asbestos that I was carrying from vendor to vendor.
---
  As I walked away, completely dejected I turned and looked over my shoulder and discovered a speck out of place. As I returned to the area I saw the original death loot bag was exactly at the indicated spot approximately ten feet in the air! Right where the Deathclaw had tossed me into my death.
---
So check the air above the spot people!
---
Monangah is your best bet for Yellowcake. Drop the nuke so that the power plant icon is just outside the zone at roughly 7 o'clock. The town is full of plants, and the hills to the north and east of town have literally hundreds of rad berry plants and iradiaroot. With green thumb you can easily get 300+ in a single run. 
---
Not to mention what they would do to those poor houseplants.
---
Check on the fireplaces at Middle Mountain Cabins- one can spawn there.
---
Thats how its still should be!
---
I come on here to bitch at all of you instead of my wife.
---
We can agree to disagree with the immersion thing, as having a shared cap pool makes little sense to me in an immersive sense and each persons sense of immersion is different. 
---
I feel that even if they had something I could build that showed vendor restock timers (something a person who can craft power armor most definitely should be able to do) it would make sense to me and help my character know when would be the best time to travel into the wasteland to seek out vendors. 
---
I appreciate the debate, and double appreciate that you remained civil in your disagreement! 
---
Huh.Fuck off.You fo76 fan mofos are dense af.Deleting this account and this post.I'm tired of yall
---
I'll give it a shot. Thanks.
---
Is it best for balance though? Being high level (over 50) doesn't inherently make a player stronger. Gear and perk selection does that. You can min/max a level 60 to be far stronger than a level 500. After level 80 or so there's really no benefit.
---
I honestly probably won't even reset my 300 unless there's a huge benefit to it, because why bother? He's the one with all the recipes / crafting perk cards.
---
Most of us have lost so much, kind of desensitized. You will lose junk (and previously even mods). You could put it in storage. Other players can loot your bag too, or you could fall into a fissure, the list goes on.
---
I can craft on the high end now days but the game is more rewarding when you build your first set.
---
Oh he is not the least bit mad about it either. In fact he got a good meal out of it
---
Purified water has no health cost nor does it require extra actions and materials—eg dirty water needs to be collected, rads soaked up, wood collected, and the product assembled. It’s an economy thing.
---
Then, that's a *you* problem. 
---
You kept coming back for 250 hours... 
---
Gotta say i respect you even clicking on this post without knowing the details when it looked like it was going to be a negative post. Glad to see Bethesda is looking at all feedback, in my opinion the game is much better now than i came back last week cant wait for the new content to start coming :)
---
 No. They wrecked a thriving economy and there are many things they sell I used to. I can't compete with ZOS in their game.
---
 So I quit.
---
I always have a handful so they're handy in a nuke zone, but no more than that. Make stimpacks with the rest.
---
Talkin' to a wall. I don't think the artists listen to requests like the programmers do.
---
Whoever said that r/fo76FilthyCasuals doesn't actively recruit people is full of crap.
---
Pervert.
---
I was seriously wondering the same thing. It was all lvl 50 so I have no clue how he got it, plus I dont get why he would give it away like that. I though x-01 was the most desired set.
---
Despite this post being 116 days old, still no. I contacted Bethesda and they are blaming it on my ISP. There is nothing wrong with my internet or anything they’ve said, I’ve checked. They won’t give me a refund for my $60 I gave them. Literally never been able to get past the main menu. 
---
wasn't that Biff?
---
Good story. How long did it take you write all that? So essentially you're saying that workshops should only be for dick heads?
---
Damn close to Huntington
---
I dont play single player games. I am a online only person that is the apeal to me. I went ahead and fot 76.
---
You don't. People that build them are uneducated. 
---
I'm currently level 15 and I'm still learning the game. My PSN is beetlejuice\_27 if you want to play together.
---
If the blast radius covers the little supermutant area to the north and the train tracks and station to the east, you can pull 50-60 cobalt from Whitesprings. If the nuke-dropper pulls the blast radius south and west it sucks tho'
---
&gt; Workshops are already pretty useless and now I avoid taking them altogether.
---
For a low level player, they are great for resources and experience. The problem is the level bajillion guy that wanders in to backhand you out of existence just because he can. Does not want the workshop or resources, just wants to kill some lvl20 that has no chance of defending themselves.
---
Enclave underarmor gives you +3 strength and takes stable flux to craft. 
---
&gt; This game will be epic, it will take some time but it will inevitably get there and when it does
---
What the hell are you talking about? It'll never be Epic. It'll always be Bethesda. If Bethesda isn't going to make the game available on Steam, it sure as hell won't on Epic either.
---
Me either. Glad you even clicked on it because that should be shared. I have a devil cat and D-bo knocks everything off of surfaces, no matter what it is. True to life 😸
---
I posted a good fix to this awhile back but someone thought it was dumb. So I’m gonna post it again. 
---
Scorched Earth:  upon starting the event all nearby players will receive the quest event and the sidebar of what to do. 
---
The sidebar has a gauge that slowly fills up when That player hits the queen. When not hitting her the bar drops. Killing her adds which now spawn at at 10% of her (90-10%) health will maintain the level the bar is at. The players bar is unique to them. So no letting your friend do it for you. 
---
The event will now have an always active event bubble that warns players if they walk out or aren’t in the zone.  
---
If your bar is at 80% or higher you will receive more loot from queenie and anything 50% or lower will be her normal pool of stuff 
---
All adds regardless of kill will drop loot to all event players that have the quest.  If you helped kill an add there will be a chance that more loot will on said body. 
---
If your out the bubble and hit say a legendary Mirelurk queen and she dies you still get exp but not loot as your aren’t in the event zone. 
---
There are some things that need to be worked out. But it’s sounded that it should help reduce the activity of leeches. You want it. Work for it. Plain and simple. 
---
This idea/fix could also work for the normal fissure sites as well. As those don’t get any love at all. 
---
Thoughts?
---
spends 250 hours playing and then decides it's "horrible"....logic
---
Happened to me in pvp. I fast travelled to Hemlock holes, which I owned, to defend it form an attacking player. Loaded in, heard automatic weapon fire, and see the screen fade in from black and i'm taking repeated headshots and my hp is going down fast. I mashed the stimpack button as hard / fast as I could, but by the time I had control of my character, i was at 20% hp and it was too late.
---
You need the location to be clean and unlooted on that server- i forget which cabin (the middle one maybe?) but you'll know if the crossbow and ranger outfit are still there on the floor.
---
You can't pick up power armour until your the appropriate level though 
---
Nope it was the Bartender, Doc.
---
&gt; people that dont want ANY pvp in a multiplayer fallout game know what the fallout universe is right?
---
Do not confuse the universe with the player experience. Many (most?) of us have been playing since the release of Fallout. We love the universe and the games. And they have always been PvE. 
---
A lot of us wanted to be able to play multiplayer co-op games in this world, and being able to do so now is great. Except for those PvP assholes who won't take 'fuck off' for an answer.
---
At 200 caps per vendor per day, it's going to be long while before that stock of bulked 4.2 billion steel scrap could be sold in order to start that retirement...
---
As for the queen he is not really wrong but more out of date the TSE was by far the best but since the nerf there are better weapons with the right build bloodied weapons with adrenal reaction mutation are good if you have a low health build that gets you some of the highest damage but right now the best damage comes from melee builds but it is all personal preference nobody can really tell you what is the "best" weapon because take shotguns for instance a lot of people swear by them but me personally have a rifle build so shotguns just won't work for me and I'm sure rifles won't work for the people that swear by shotguns. 
---
It seems to me they initially flooded the shop with crap to get us to spend our free atoms and holding back the goodies so we spend real cash on them. I think most of us have been savvy to that and held out on spending our atoms. I think it's probably time they start dropping the good stuff take a small return while we grab the first batch of good stuff and part us with our cash further down the line once we've spent up all our freebies.
---
About a dozen different click bait-driven companies are scrambling to find your resume right now and scoop you up. xD
---
Regular does more damage, Ultracite has higher fire rate.
---
Ultracite MAY also do more damage to Scorched enemies inherently, but I've never been clear on that.
---
 **6.USE DESCRIPTIVE TITLES AND DO NOT CLICKBAIT**
---
Use descriptive titles when submitting a post. If the average user has to click on your post to understand the context, then it is not descriptive enough. If you're posting a question, put it in the title and give further information inside. Avoid the use of ellipses.
---
Why turrets? Because I hate returning to destroyed walls.
---
Now, that said... I'm low level enough that it's only standard turrets for me... but they keep the protectrons and ghouls and shit at bay.
---
I thought of the Zetans when it first happened, more logically, the SB proximity prevented the ghouls from normally spawning on the ground.  Who knows, it was funny for whatever reason.
---
Yes it did, thanks!
---
&gt; eject it into the vaccuum of space
---
That's a great idea until the first rocket with 10 tons of nuclear waste blows up within the atmosphere.
---
&gt; Deteriorating in the earth
---
Nuclear fuel was dug out of the ground initially, it's only a problem because we concentrated it. The best option is to store it in a secure and stable underground facility like [Yucca Mountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yucca_Mountain_nuclear_waste_repository#The_facility).
---
You don't survive to be a level 80 scorchbeast by hauling around a lot of extra crap. 
---
I believe they said they will be adding more "no build zones" to the game and Whitesprings was a point of focus.
---
Not always.
---
Automatics get the most out of Vats. Their AP costs are reduced and critical hits carry over to every bullet provided you keep the trigger held. You can sneak attack on multiple bullets too.
---
If you want to get the most out of your auto rifle, I would invest more into agility and luck. Grab perks for sneak attack and critical hit damage. Grab escape artist like the dude above said and you can guarantee every shot is a sneak attack. Most importantly, grab Concentrated Fire. A headshot is +100% damage. That is 80% more damage than 3 levels of one commando perk. Concentrated Fire also increases damage an unknown amount per shot on top of that. I did a damage calculation for my auto pistol and was getting over 2000 DPS off a 53 damage gun while stacking sneak attacks, headshots, and critical hits.
---
I'm glad that Bethesda actually reads the negative posts as well as the positives
---
Your points are valid, but you can ease your pain by not carrying junk you care about. Stash your holy-grail loot as soon as you can. There's no valid reason for carrying any of it into a nuke zone. My stash is nothing but junk and I'll carry all my chems, weapons, and armor since I can't lose any of that if I die. I also carry some of my junk junk. Like steel and wood. I can always find more of that than I could ever use so I don't care if I lose it. But ballistic fiber, ultracite, and stable flux go into my stash asap. 
---
To add to your list, they also need to tell us when a bag we are getting ready to loot is a player's death bag and who's it is. I wouldn't loot it if they are nearby. But I can't tell if they dropped it because they were encumbered or they died. Or if it's obvious they are on the other side of the map and aren't coming back for it, then it's mine now.
---
I see, so I just need to figure out a good build that I like playing with then..  thanks! 
---
My wife and I are trying to nuke different areas to see what we enjoy the most (we are tired of the normal two) and we nuked Morgantown this weekend. It was pretty good. A fair amount of glowing ones, and a lot of cobolt flux. Thanks for the headsup about the park.
---
Good advise!  I don't carry Molotov's, but I did get a shot on one w/ my SSE shotty I had used to ground the SB with the second time it happened.  I do seem to remember the pieces left were lootable. (Bloody Mess).
---
I feel you. On the tagging. I feel at the end of the day. It’s a dog eat dog world. If you didn’t or weren’t around for the kill tough. If you hit it and killed it. Your loot your kill. 
---
To make it more simple change the explosive effect to fall in line with the other bullet effects: fire burns, poison dot, explosive no aoe but can knockback. 
---
All they have to do is set the build zone at golf club farther back. No more on the door step. 
---
Grahm shares the vendor cap with Watoga station. 
---
Happy Cake Day!!! 
---
Yeah the build comes 1st then pick a weapon that reflects your build and don't forget you can move your s.p.e.c.i.a.l points with each level up after level 50.
---
would work no different then current Camp attacks. Aka only happens when you or another player is there. 
---
Really nice to read about such a positive experience 💖 👍
---
I see it every so often. Watch the map, look for a wanted. Go and see what they are doing. Usually destroying lowby camps to draw players out in to the wild for a gankfest. A low level being slapped by 4 cranked up high levels will go down fast.
---
I don't know about FO, but I've seen this a few times in other games when you pick in 'offensive' user name.  It gets through the initial filter (if there is one), but at some point something/someone flags your name as inappropriate and you get renamed.
---
Sometimes it's hard to tell *why* your name got flagged, but that's a possibility.
---
it is coming later in the spring.
---
This. Make my Anti-Armor / 25% Fire Rate Gatling Laser worth using please.
---
Oh I can pick up this giant 2'x3' metal bin... But this interesting looking piece of circuitry and vacuum tubes is just part of the landscape and can't be picked up to be scrapped.
---
And screws... Can't make screws out of scrap metal... wtf...
---
And shouldn't those same cats be bigger than mole rats by now?
---
I’m on the fence here. Why not raise the level cap on items? There’s really no explanation as to why. 
---
Ok cool thanks good to know.

Inflicts disease on target.

\+50 points. I'll never loot a board again. Bravo. xD

I think that is the plan yes 👍😊 Can't wait!!
---
Right.  Like I said, that thread was going south anyway, so I just couldn't resist it.
---
I’m not saying it’s a good idea to play the game this way but if you want a challenge,  well,  there it is.
---
Any idea is better than the current system, sadly it seems that people on here are more on the side of leechers. 
---
Too much whataboutism, and not enough coming up with an idea.
---
I like your idea, i like any idea that makes people work for their loot. 
---
Wait, really? I assumed they nerfed it because it was too good or something. I've done it 3 times in the last week and no ore at all from it.
---
There's been several posts on this problem.  Yes it's a problem, the game should not be giving quests like this, its makes a person distrust the game.

mole rats... the hunted has now become the hunter...

Of course! Community management isn't just reading the positives, we look at everything to see the entire picture.

Ooh, I too am interested in this 👋
---
Cause you have all your items right now and then you Would have to start at Zero again, same bullshit with every WoW Update. It's just no fun for me 
---
A real Zen balance to things
---
Ultracite weapons are meant to do more damage to the Scorched and Scorchbeast. I never use them, though, as getting ultracite receiver plans and making ultracite ammo is too much of a hassle. 
---
I wish they would add more decent post apocalyptic outfits. There isnt really many in game.
---
You have to drive reeeaallly fast to get there in eight minutes.
---
In other words... its your cat!
---
I've had 3 Scorchbeasts attack my camp - unfortunately they're 0 stars.
---
I belong to both, unfortunately, adding the "filthy" moniker to *everything* irriatates me, and posting nothing but camp pics isn't all that I want from a FO76 community.
---
Absolutely We read it all, only looking at positive posts and comments doesn't help us. We look at the entire picture to see players thoughts and feelings. 
---
Outstanding move!
---
I had a server to myself last night/this morning for about 3 hours. it was spooky. I was at Watoga, and there was a drop. of course all the robots aggroed, and I couldn't shop the bos vender bot. So I killed everything, shot down the drop and got a wanted lvl for stealing. WTH! BTW, having a server to yourself isn't all that great. 
---
Give it a few more months. They'll be the same 
---
If you scrap them there are other mods you can unlock! I have an enandrol one that reduces targets damage resistance for 2 minutes after hitting them. Would be really great but it bugs and doesn’t work I don’t think :/ I’ll look into other mods you can get
---
This. And I’ve seen this guy’s name come up before for various nefarious deeds, and nothing gets done about him. 
---
He had 4 when I ran into him (far northwest corner of the map)
---
I only bought two things from the shop, the country doors and the plants
---
Nothing ever good came out of one for me , and the only one I ever go for is the one with the Nuke Cards .. but I have not been flagged for Picking the lock ? I wonder if it still flags you if the player leaves the server ? 
---
If you can get to lvl 50 by the end of the beta you should have no problem making an alt to that
---
I think FO76 should add a building where you can see a camera peering into Bethesda Development on FO76. Its be all empty desks, but still...
---
It’s not about the damage, it’s more of a support weapon and great for big enemies . Very situational and strategic weapon
---
They had us in the first half not gonna lie
---
On your last we had a similar situation, while fighting the queen there was an invisible player blasting us with a gamma gun, weird thing if he blasted you direct from full health it would drop so fast you done even have time for a stim, happy you had fun with the queen, i love fighting the sbq 
---
I hope we wont have a stash of 50 in the vending machine...
---
I never got to lvl 50 by the end of the bata, lvl 27 actually.  
---
It's a constant problem. 
---
Idk it was in fo4
---
I've only spent 100 atoms on the "heart" pose for photos haha
---
Can't bulk silver.
---
It was a long day for me. Did the vendor run, did the first nuke run, then hit the nuke zone. Vendors had no caps for me when I had raw flux; when I logged back on to inert flux I just dumped it in a suitcase.
---
Thanks for the tip! It that 50-60 with Green Thumb?
---
If it’s an event the loot should be available to all that are active in the event. With moderation of course. 
---
If you're using Lead Belly, Cannibal would be better. Free food that doesn't take up any weight or cost any resources.
---
Except for acid. Damn acid. Unless you know of a spot?
---
The only way I'm interested in Survival Mode is if it's an actual Survival Mode ala FO4, with more food and drink required, slower healing, etc.
---
That’s a pretty good point. As the fan base slowly dies down as the game ages, there will be less people to buy things in the atom store. So to maximize profit, they would want to release as many things as possible early on and slow down as the game ages.
---
Idk maybe you could speculate that a massive atom store that’s updated constantly would suggest the game didn’t earn as much as it would have liked. Or it could just mean the atom store workers are over staffed with lots of good ideas
---
Ah, that explains why he was zeroed out when I found him yesterday, given that I hadn't seen him in three days. No big; he had plans I wanted so I was able to get his stash back to 200 for selling in no time.
---
lol the only reason I ask or thought of them being useful is because I have lost a fusion gen or 5 :/
---
Yep. Fast travel and power armor 
---
I loot my crates of absolutely everything and drop anything I don't need in a bag beside it. They need to at least make Flatwoods drops no-lockpick. Those low levels often don't even realize what they're about to do.
---
There was no frame just the peices. You can pick up higher level peices you just cant equip them. Well there is a loophole with the power armor station but you still cant use the PA until the appropriate level.

Mutant: It’s fun to kill at da YMCA! 🎶 
---
It makes sense to me that they'd reset us from &gt;100 to 1 with only 1 prestige level.  That will help balance out the early players who were able to take advantage of unplanned fast gains in the game and put us on more balanced footing with newer players.  I'd hope that we'd be able to keep our learned plans/recipes, and of course our equipment so we should be able to still level back up to 50 and beyond much more easily than new players.  That seems like a reasonable balance...  and hey, if you don't want to add prestige levels, stick with your high level!  
---
I'm thinking I'll focus on leveling some new characters to 50 instead of adding more levels to my existing high level characters until the prestige patch drops or we learn more...
---
I'm guessing you'll catch some flack for that joke...
---
&gt;Regular does more damage, Ultracite has higher fire rate.
---
I see this repeated a lot but it's not true. 
---
I have an Ultracite Gatling laser and base damage is quite a bit more than regular Gatling laser. 
---
Did... did Feed the People used to /not/ suck?
---
Not saying the irradiated stuff can't give the extra food bonuses. It would still count as a cooked meat or veggies, or at least I figured it would in my head when I came up with the idea.
---
Idk. I was watching my buddy play, his has an armor rating. Did someone make yours?
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Thank you for reading all the posts. I for one, think feral cats make sense. There were towns and cities populated with people so it makes sense that some pets would survive. That said, bring back Dogmeat! 😜
---
Love what you guys are doing, keep it up.
---
Take a break from all your worries, sure would help a lot...
---
Glad you're listening! I'll expect a fix for this grievous error in the coming months. ;)
---
Level 30 if there is one. 
---
I agree. Tried to start a thread on random encounter locations this morning...it's not gaining much traction. 
---
That should be game 101 though. This has really dented my enjoyment of the game.
---
this isnt something a customer support rep would know, please stop bugging them with a gameplay question like this. theyre primarily there for tech issues, and i can almost guarantee the majority of the reps dont even play the game let alone have an answer for this very specific inquiry. as someone who worked in the industry, please dont submit multiple tickets for an "issue" like this, all it does is waste the agent's time as well as yours.
---
i hope someone on here will have an answer for you, because people on this sub actually play the game and could have that info on hand! good luck
---
You gotta read the supply drops and know the difference between user submitted and random.
---
Just picked up a random one last night and got free plans for radium rifle.
---
You forgot the cat tax, shame on you
---
I figured that was the one. There were welding goggles on the fireplace. I'll try again later on a new server.
---
Myself and gf just randomly get wanted sometimes. Spawn into the game. Do the usual plant and water collection at our own bases. Then bam... wanted. 
---
I could imagine. I was looking forward to it but to have it taken from me by something so stupidly random that's not even my fault is incredibly frustrating.
---
As an Ex-Griefer(from years ago), there really isn't anyway to escape griefers.  If someone wants to grief you in 76 despite pacifist mode, there are ways to do it.
---
There's also an argument to be made against that "enabling bullies" remark.  While some griefers are indeed bullies, most are people who want to RP a villain.  Regardless of there motive, you and others view them as griefers because they impede your ability to have fun.  However, by forcing the people who want to RP as villains to either play on a PVP server where their RP loses it's point, or to not RP in such a way, is impeding their fun.  At that point, those such as yourself will have become the bullies, and the Devs giving into your constant and loud complaints is enabling you.  There is a difference of course, since you could always block and hop, but those that RP as villains will be forced to quit due to a lack of fun.
---
Your morally and hypocritically PC views will in the end ruin the fun of others who just want to RP, while not actually effecting the actual bullies, who will always find ways to ruin your fun.  I'm sure many people who have been bullied IRL hate this saying, however, "growing thicker skin" really does make all the difference.  If you don't react to being bullied, they eventually lose interest, usually sooner than later.  The only other way to avoid bullying is to be personally feared or respected by said bullies, something which is very hard to do in a game(or online).
---
Also, to clarify on the "thicker skin" bit, I'm not saying people should not be bothered by bullying, but rather do your best to not show that you are bothered.  A psycological bluff.  Since actual bullies find gradification in the suffering of their victims, if you do not show visual or verbal signs of suffering, to any degree, the bullies will get bored and move on.  However, if you go off and complain about it, they'll just target you more, because you've just shown that they can always find gratification in bullying you and they know that nobody(well almost nobody) will ever actually crack down on them directly.
---
There is one radioactive one north of the monorail elevator and a 2nd crater (not sure if it's radioactive) just west of the first one.
---
Absolutely. You have cap farmers that only PvP at workshops to get caps and junk. They fast travel in, decked out for combat, and one-shot someone decked out for PvE. Then they don't even do anything with the workshop. 
---
I don't have much of a caps need and I'm usually trying to find ways to spend caps to stay below the 25K max.  I've just taken to dropping off excess stable fluxes in suitcases, or gifting to friends. I would love to see melee mods that require flux, but I think that may be only a short term solution as once you craft it, you are back in the same boat with any new flux. 
---
I figure high end consumables for melee tend to be chems and alcohol, so that was the only thing I could think of that would have me actively looking for stable flux and using up what I had acquired. 
---
I am kinda confused what you want.  Can ypu explain how this will be different the the custom marker?
---
It used to give everyone on the server the food. It literally Fed the People. It was a fun easter-egg that helped create a sense of community on the server in the early days. Then Bethesda patched it out.
---
They already said there will be more powerful abilities available for prestiging. And I doubt you’ll lose your crafting recipes. 
---
Okay, tiger. By 'Cool' I mean: "You're a dullard and we're done here." Well, I am. You... You, I suspect we'll keep barking at random clouds, or whatever it is you get up when you're not extolling the virtues (\*modern!\* \*complex!\* \*fun!\*) of PvP for us woe-begotten Amish types. ;-)
---
I just bought the game (at about 20) and I can certaintly say its not worth 80+ bucks (im canadian)
---
that being said I am having some fun with the game and cant wait to make  my diner cafe camp
---
&gt; We can agree to disagree with the immersion thing, as having a shared cap pool makes little sense to me in an immersive sense and each persons sense of immersion is different.
---
Well, other than the fact that the robot vendors are left over from the different factions that controlled those areas, and were probably programmed to limits on amount of stuff they can buy from a person per day? So it does make sense to me that they have limits.
---
The different factions were looking for ways to make sure their vendor bots didn't run out of caps, so they programed them to always withhold a percentage of them. 
---
I honestly don't think it's that hard to keep track of when you sold to vendors. If you are playing the game, collecting materials to craft, doing events and quests, it's going to take you around the area, and stopping to check a vendor. 
---
Needing a timer to know if it's worth going to a vendor, seems to indicate a kind of play where you are logging on, selling to vendors, and then that's it. I mean, I can't think of another reason to need a clock on vendor reset. It doesn't take that long to hit up all different seven factions. 
---
Flatwood, Sutton, Whitesprings, Enclave, Watoga Train Station, Phoenix in Watogo, and then up to Harpers. That's all seven factions. You could even fast travel from Enclave to Watogo, and then fast travel to Harpers, with the fast travel cost not being that much. 
---
See here's the thing. If they put this timer in, would you just then fast travel from vendor to vendor selling? Because if the goal is to cap farm, that seems like a detriment to getting caps. 
---
If you set your own time to sell, say, 10pm every day, then when you are on, playing the game, at 10pm, you know that vendors will have all their caps refreshed for you.
---
Against tanky enemies like supermutants, the AA is better.  Against frail ones like scorched, the TS is better.
---
Best armor? It depends.  
---
The best non-power armors (non-PAs) with the right legendary affixes will get you better damage mitigation than even the best PA, but they're rare. The best legendary effects depends on whether you want to sneak, run, stand still, or survive at low health.  
---
Power armor is better for rad-zones, and is relatively easy to acquire. 
---
In comparing PA: 
---
* X-01: Best all around, partly due to having the best rad resistance. Hard to find the mods. It's a good late-game goal. 
---
* Ultracite: Second best all around, but hard to mod and expensive to repair
---
* T-51b: Third overall rating. Best ballistic and energy defense. Worst PA for Rads.  
---
* T-60: Fourth overall, but well balanced protection and cheap to mod and repair
---
* Excavator: Best carry weight. Surprisingly good rad defense. 
---
* T-45: No role that I'm aware of
---
I rate the best PA as T-51b outside nuke zones and X-01 inside nuke zones, but I use T-60 in nuke zones because it's easier to mod than the X-01.
---
Except the new pacifist mode will eliminate damage from players. To you or your camp.  
---
Griefers will find a way, but any way they find will be reportable, so they lose their accounts. Win-win. The PvP crowd have an outlet, the grief crowd are gone.
---
protip: freeze boiled water so you have some ready to go the next time you want to cook pasta!
---
Same.
---
Okay, sure.
---
But we were talking about the Rifle/Pistol, not the Gatling.
---
Jesus, that's fucktarded
---
Every time I think they're stepping forward to fixing the game, they pull stupid shit out of their ass
---
Everytime you can a drink of boiled water:
---
+1 Fire Damage.
---
I'm the same, with different power armor parts ready to be swapped in as I do different events. Now if we could PLEASE name our PA sets I'd actually have different full sets ready to go. Shades of FO4, with several sets of PA available.
---
P.S. You \*do\* realize there are other paths to be social on this game apart from PvP, yes? No?
---
Maybe don't build right behind the clubhouse then?!?
---
news flash, raiders don't wear high tech power armor with a jetpack painted with military camo on it and spawn kill you with a weapon that they bought off ebay.
---
Stop trying to justify being a fucking moron
---
Whatever their motivations, they'll be able to role play and PvP to their heart's content in survival mode.  There is absolutely no reason not to remove PvP entirely for adventure mode, so those of us that do not want to have PvP can enjoy the game.
---
The only reason I can see to leaving PvP in adventure mode is as stated - enabling the true griefers!
---
Wow. I wish I had been around for that; it's a cool idea.
---
Maybe they want you to steal it, maybe they want a bunch of people scrambling to steal it from each other like in a real survival situation 
---
Seems a trivial thing to complain about bud.
---
Thanks for the information.
---
I’m still not following. Your issue is that playing the game and find items is too much work? And start at zero how?
---
Same here, but luckily I didn't progress story wise in the beta to much so it wasnt that hard to cover the missing trophies.
---
I currently have 4 characters dedicated to Selling game items; Weapons, Armor, Plans, &amp; Aid, all of them deal in materials as well.
---
My Vendor Characters are on a separate account from my main, and I have all of their Shops in the same area, I discuss trades with people here on Reddit, as well as XBL Party Chat and then load the character they wish to trade with, it seems to work well enough, so even though I'm looking forward to player Vending in whatever form that is, I still plan to keep trading as I do now.
---
I should also qualify that I run 2 consoles, which makes everything considerably easier to manage, also all of my vendor characters are kept below level 5 to prevent PvP issues.
---
I originally created a separate vendor character simply to avoid trading with my main character, as I found many would be griefers prefer to initiate trading to see what weapons, armor, and Junk you have before picking a fight, this continues to happen on a regular basis, I had 3 players following me around for 15 minutes last night, one level 50+ trying to trade, and 2 other 100+ following and trying to maintain cover, I even led them to one of my vendor shops, but they would not trade with that character, and eventually gave up.
---
Maybe they want everyone rushing to get it and fighting over each other for it. Like in a real Survival situation where supplies are scarce 
---
At this point you must be trolling 
---
You can't put the custom marker precisely on the location - it has to be outside of it (beyond, in front of, or off to the side) Only choice with the location itself is to fast travel. Same with areas to search - you can't put a custom marker in the center, your only choices are "stop tracking" or put the marker outside.
---
Except that this isn't a reality based survival game, otherwise you'd die the minute you went into combat barefoot and dressed in a bathing suit; the bots would all be disabled and stripped for parts; and some of us would be clustered in shantytowns. 
---
I'm almost gonna miss tearing turret bases to the ground, it's one of my favorite end game activities at this point!
---
I NEVER grief anyone in any game, but these bases are lame and stupid and the only reason anyone does them is because they saw a YouTube video and can't think for themselves.
---
Everyone still gets their own loot, you just have to wait for the owner to open it.
---
I don't think they ever looked at "game 101 handbook" lol 
---
Lolz
---
Still angry they got your money and can’t have your way?
---
Might I suggest alcoholism or meth? As a way to substitute your outward facing hatred for inward facing?
---
&gt;I'm not going to mess with "survival" mode unless they do something drastic like drop the legendary BS,
---
Yeah having legendary effects that randomly drop was  a ridiculous idea for a multiplayer game for PVP.  Getting a powerful legendary weapon is like hitting the jackpot on  a slot machine or winning the lotto.   
---
So it's a PVP game where hitting the jackpot or winning the lotto gives you a built in advantage. 
---
The two shot and explosive effects were introduced in Fallout 4- which is fine because it's a single player game and no PVP. 
---
It was a terrible idea for online multiplayer. 
---
Wait looting those makes you wanted? Fuck, now I know why I’ve died so fast sometimes.
---
Agreed an endangerol dart can really help In large mob fight: SB SBQ, Mirelurk queen. ( mainly for the squishy people)
---
Could’ve had a friend help build the base. Mats come pretty easily if you play consistently. 
---
I will have to check
---
I would sit at the radio tower above Flatwoods and call them in for new players.
---
Then they changed them and I have never again picked up a supply request.
---
I’m really not. Just trying to find logic in your post. But if you think I am. Then you have a good day sir/ma’am. 
---
Oh, so maybe it's location based? 
---
This mime was behind the General's steakhouse.  I figured he was trying to collect a few caps from the grocery shoppers picking flux up in the garden out back. I had no way to leave him any change, and after leaving him alone for 10 minutes or so, somebody turned him into a meat pile.
---
It used to be that when you completed the quest, everyone on the sever got food dropped into their inventory wether you participated in it or not. Made sense since it’s called feed the people. But later they changed that so only you get food, apparently it was a glitch to give everyone food
---
I don't. Never even been to Whitesprings, with any of my three characters. 
---
With the one character I have an actual "Building based CAMP" (the only one that I bother with turrets), I generally stick near the river between Morgantown and Flatwoods.
---
Rifleman, less bullet waste, and I like sniper. If you're going up against the scorched queen I would say commando then.
---
PVE and PVP should be divided in fo76. Im glad to hear that pacifist mode will be fully inplemented whithout slap damage. 
---
Will I go on survivalist serv? Honestly dunno. All depends how they designed and implemented, balanced pvp gameplay mechanics. Will there be any rewards etc.
---
But for some fucking reason I still get random additions of those useless corpse flowers every now and then when I never do that mission.
---
He probably picked up a bunch of plans either from a friend, or he transferred them from one of his own high-level characters. You get a ton of plans from doing workshop events, so it's common to drop excess plans for new players.
---
Had this happen two days ago also.  I use a dragon critical shot with better criticals equipped and i shoot this guy in the head and it does no damage.  He has half health and usually a shot like that will kill any player one shot at full Heath.  This proceeded about 5 times and all my critical vats shots were doing no damage.  I had to leave the server.  I can only assume it's some kind of hack.
---
I have over 100 requisition holos on 2 characters, and since they "patched" it, I haven't used a single one. Every time I call one in, someone else gets there first, picks the lock, and takes all the loot. It's pointless.
---
So grinding hundert of hours for one good legendary roll is your Definition of fun? 
---
How do  you transfer between characters?
---
Don't you worry. The Wasteland Estates HOA has never had a problem keeping it up.
---
Despite what Sheila may have told you. 
---
Happens regularly on XB for me, also if you pick up another similar weapon, it will replace the favorited one on the wheel.
---
Alt character shared plans and resources?
---
Was just dealing with this with my character.  The automatic guns don't feel overly satisfying to me (tho they feel better than previous Fallout games).  Because I tend to hang back and pick off enemies before going into an area I ended up going with a Semi-Automatic Build, using a Combat Rifle or Silenced Hunting Rifle.  
---
Can you expand upon this?
---
That’s rng.  If you rather play for an hour and essentially be given a god rolled gun/ armour. Then maybe this game isn’t for you. 
---
Never said it was based on reality. Just that from a role-playing view it makes sense that other players would kill you whether you want them to or not. 
---
I hope to get a spot for the next event
---
I'm wondering the same thing. I'm level 40 and approaching the question with two sub-questions: what is better, and what do I want? Now in terms of actually beating the danger of multiple enemies closing in, the math seems to favor the auto-rifles. However, you also have shotguns and pistols and heavy guns for close range, and I personally love sniping, so I think I'm gonna head towards the sniping route. But it's definitely an individual preference, even if the math comes out better on one. 
---
Well, then they should put something valuable in there.
---
Nobody is risking a Wanted over .38 rounds (4), Pre-war Money (2) and a fucking fancy hairbrush.
---
You are entirely correct. Don't forgot to garnish the catnip as punishment. 
---
All bookings are done through Twitter, @HOAWasteland. Send us a DM and I'll make sure you're on the list.

Sometimes websites go down 
---
What really gets me is that they already figured out pvp in elder scrolls online. It's such a peaceful, beautiful game, and if you want pvp, you go to the pvp area, which is large and also has dlc. (In the pve area you can also challenge players to duels. Also the maps are WAY more populated with other players, similarly to how fo76 was intended to be with lack of npcs. Also they have player guilds that can buy and sell farmed resources and gear with other players through Guild stores) How did they get it so wrong in fallout 76???
---
If you walk up and shoot me once or twice to indicate you want to, and move on when I don't- I really have no problem with you. No hard feelings, I'd stim you back to life if I saw you go down nearby.
---
The guy that follows you around machine-gunning you nonstop for an hour- that guy can go take a long walk off a short pier. 
---
I didn't realize you can share resource and plans between characters?
---
A bit pedantic are we?
---
You can carry it. I don't recall exactly 'what' it all was but it was 100's of pieces of 3 0r 4 junk types..valuable stuff most of it bulked..
---
I find events in the mire drop them. Specifically awol armaments. I've gotten them from there several times. Oh. And census violence. 
---
The price changed twice, used to be 100, then 250, and now 1200.
---
Thanks! Could you recommend some sort of resource I could look at for help with builds? 
---
With another player you trust, or a mule account. Give them the goods and they'll give them to your other character. 
---
Bird bones, Marsupial and shared strange in numbers while on a team.
---
It is supposed to be sold by vendors in the toxic valley. 
---
Looking in the game files its under LVLI - Leveled Item [003EC626] &lt;LLS_Recipes_Mods_Armor_RegionToxicValley_Vendor&gt;

---
Automatics get more out of vats than single shot stuff. Every consectutive bullet gets the accuracy and damage bonus from a critical hit provided you keep the trigger held. Combine than with concentrated fire for headshots and stealth for sneak attacks, you get crazy DPS.
---
Single shot rifles seem to be a better choice for the anti-vats players. Sneak attacks will deal more damage making it easier to one shot enemies. 
---
I love all the damage bonuses you get out of vats, so I mainly stick with automatic weapons.
---
Yeah something about that Semi-Automatic Combat Rifle that feels pleasing with 45 ammo lol
---
If it's been announced, it's likely already been pretty well fleshed out internally. Doubtful that a reddit thread will made them scrap a year of planning and go an entirely different direction. No harm in speculation, though.
---
Wow I didnt know that good to know
---
I have never seen a 2-star item from any event. All mine come from whitesprings nukes.
---
Raiders don't wear power armor.  I never said I was smart, and it doesn't take ebay or OP weapons to git gud or figure out that spawning in the same location is gonna get you killed.  People need to realize that weapons, armor, and level do not matter as much as skill does, seriously everyone can die with the right strategy, and a lot of it is rock vs paper vs scissors.  
---
Carry both auto and semi auto then just swap out cards as needed.
---
How can you get 1.6k caps per day? I know you can get 1.4k,  where are you getting the extra 200 caps?
---
If my main has a plan or mats that I want my alt to have I sign into my main. Hand the goods to a friend. Sign in on alt and get them back. I have not used an alt on this game but have on other games like this. Pretty sure it works that way here too. Could be wrong though
---
Great info, thanks! 
---
i dont kno why.. but i guess ppl fees superior on hating on a game like fallout..like they are some elite gamers ..no one cares what games you like or dont..i could see maybe ppl who love RDR can come over here and spread hate..but..i have no time to read other boards on games that i dont play..and i always said..if u dont like fallout 76..that sucks for you because i have hundreds of hours clocked in and and it will continue
---
15! Just started a few days ago. 
---
I have every achievement in F3, NV, and F4. This is my favorite game franchise and I’m so glad I finally found time to get going on 76. My buddy and I are going to play the game start to finish with each other and so far it’s been awesome. At every major location we discover or after a big quest, we take a photo with each other to add to our album. Great times!
---
Ah. Gotcha. Seems a lot of work.. considering you already have the mats with one character.
---

Friends. And having friends give you extra plans that they have. 
---
When I fast travel or server hop on XB1 this happens.  Server hopping I can understand, but fast traveling?  I also hate fighting invisible enemies after fast traveling with my bare fists.  Lag and bugs kill me more than enemies.
---
Not that I can see, if you scroll down a little the FO76 section is still there.  
---
is it confirmed that there ill by PVP and PVE servers?
---
Thats not even true
---
So, what did you place the CAMP device on that gave you more than 5 floors?
---
Me without a doudt I just really enjoy more difficult games in general.
---
I have no idea.. wish they would fix that mess.. Even with all the issues, I still love the game. Just wish they wouldn’t force the pvp on everyone. I had a great explosive build I used before the nerf that made me LOVE the game because I could literally go anywhere by myself and didn’t have to have a team.. I really miss it. (I never pvp)
---
Hmm, yeah, that's a possibility, but my name is the same I've used in several other games and I've never had this issue, and I'm 200% it's not a swear or offensive, besides we're talking a matter of 5 min before I got renamed, so it definitely isn't player flagged. No idea why it's happening :/
---
I figured the savage divide was where I needed to drop this bomb. I was gonna center it west of west tech research center and get huntersville in the blast zone, but I will try here instead.
---
Thanks for the advice!
---
Damn good idea actually lol Perception 15 here I come
---
honestly i really dislike turning your camp into a quick travel marker, in my opinion it should be a "safer" space in the wastes where you can can kick up your heels and knock a little dust off and tweak your gear, grab your favorite frosty beverage maybe view a few trophies....
---
currently if you spend any time in your camp its a a flashing sign for dickheads to "wreck your shit" anything to further encourage this behavior only means people will avoid their camp more, which is disappointing because the camp is one of the cooler things in this game where as combat is not.
---
This is a good place to play around until you have one you are happy with and then you can go from there

---
35 I’m too chicken to leave the forest area so yeah I level up extremely slow lol.
---
just found out about this. i heard that currently the new pacifist mode only applies to players, not camps, but they're working on adding it. even if that is the case, and camps will still be vulnerable for a while, it's a step in the right direction. there will be a bit of overlap where "watch me kill this newb" turns into "watch me blow up this house" but knowing they're gonna be forced to think of new ways to piss people off kinda makes me laugh.
---
I will have to look in to that. Maybe a bug with instigating on gama/beam weapons?
---
I wonder if it'll share the same stash space or have it's own (you commit the item for a certain amount of time or something like that). And traps will be on another level.
---
Awesome! Thank you! Gonna check it out now!
---
Yes. People even side with cheats and exploiters, just to oppose Bethesda. The general consensus has been "*Yeah but it's Bethesda's fault they cheat because canvas bag or something*".
---
My concern is more with what will we loose as a result of the prestige, so we know we reset back to level one, but will we loose our ranked cards as well, also I wonder if we will get a shot at more perk card packs as a result
---
Personally I like the new change but feel like it's a copy and paste from skyrims system and should have been in the game from the start for it to really work out
---
What platform? Said that it might be a glitch... A papyrus script not firing up due to lag - not server lag, papyrus lag which is unfortunately "a thing". 
---
That’s what I wanted because so many areas had stuff in the center 
---
Let's see. All the vendors I know of are:
---
•Raiders
---
•Responders
---
•Brotherhood 
---
•Enclave 
---
•Whitesprings 
---
•Harpers Ferry
---
•Wartoga 
---
•Graham
---
8 vendors, 1.6K caps.
---
Probably this
---
I don't know enough about it to say one way or the other.

That said, imo the best PvP games are those designed from the ground up with PvP in mind.  The original Guild Wars is a good example, in that game PvP was essentially a separate game mode that granted every player the same gear/levels and utilized abilities that were designed for PvP from the word go.  
---
So I'm sure I'll probably dabble with it but I don't see myself becoming super involved as I feel PvP was sort of slapped into this game as an afterthought.
---
Really?? I missed the turret news. That alone is going to be huge for the budget
---
Graham shares with Watoga. 1.4k caps per roughly 20 hours.  Maximum. 
---
Well that's kinda the point. That's the casual element. People chime in randomly when they have time.
---
131, 132, 82, 55, 25.
---
Melee, sniper, heavy, pistol, shotgun
---
As an FYI, there are only 5 character spots!
---
Scorched champions can spawn with gamma guns, and their fire rate is insanely high. They'll red line you in a matter of seconds if you can't break the fireline. 
---
Just a non-stop wave of green circles.
---
Betting caps will be only option. But you insert product and set price. Players come by and choose whether or not. I hope we can have a couple different machines since there are signs for ammo,armour,etc...
---
I am debating that too. But with enough time you can have the perk cards necessary to switch between them. But for the sake of stealthiness and ammo, I’m a rifleman right now 
---
Its PVP focused, so I'm fully able to say, "Nope!  Not gonna, Nuh Uh!"
---
I am hoping that all the people that like PVP do go to Survival mode though, that'll leave the other mode for those of us who just want a PVE, co-op experience to have even more fun without having to look over our shoulders at every player that comes near us.
---
Lots of possibilities, without knowing the name and doing some research, it's all speculation (don't post it here, not much point).
---
Could be OK with some games, but Bethesda is more picky.  Could be something that became and issue more recently (times change).    Might be something that translates from a foreign language that no one else caught.
---
Also possible that someone else made the same name at about the same time (or earlier, but the lookup wasn't working for whatever reason), and it didn't get caught right off the bat, and some algorithm caught it and renamed one of them.
---
Not much to do about it, you can check online to see if there's a way to rename the account, I haven't looked into that for Bethesda at all.
---
Does he really? That's so odd. Thanks, i'll change my comment
---
Point taken 👍
---
are you really saying your X levels that werent rewarded were really "wasted"? 
---
the idea seems to be to retain players rather than reward current grinders and is a slippery slope where if you open up the pandoras box of "bonus rewards" i mean what if for example someone(me) has a 185 110 105 and 70 on their account do they deserve 8?
---
Wouldn't you like to get away?
---
Yeah in 2 months I'll be doing the orange justice over a fallen deathclaw....fuck
---
Quality of life perks like weight reduction and good with salt should be included in the passive category i see people requesting. It should be limited to crafting perks and only then if you keep your special points high enough to equip them. The entire point of having a limited number of perk slots is that you need to weigh your options and make a well thought out build. If you so choose there are enough cards that make food/water consumption become a triviality. That said, if you don't want to waste cards just get the carnivore mutation and you will always have no danger food to consume. The biggest issue is having to open the pip boy and eat it or re hotkey new meat types.
---
It was always advertised a A Multiplayer game .. Not a PVP game.. not sure why this is the argument people are clinging too. We all asked for a Fallout 4 online, Multiplayer, and yet some people argue it was Advertised as a strictly PVP game .. WRONG.  Its a Multiplayer Co-Op with PVP Aspects. I let them keep on keeping on, cause it makes them feel good. 
---
I have two xbox's. One has my mule account. The other has my main account. My mule is level 15 living in an end game palace. Lmao. But I can have both in some together. So my high level character built my mules "shop"
---
Should NOT be lol
---
No problem. I geel like a lot of us have made that mistake, myself included.
---
lol still reading these problems months later. nice... 
---
They better raise the cap limit per character.
---
what?  do you burn yourself every time you drain the boiling water from pasta?  who the fuck burns themselves canning boiled water?  you aren't canning boil*ing* water, the water was already boiled, past tense, why does everyone thing boiled water is currently boiling?  in a survival situation if you need to drink water from a lake or stream you are supposed to boil it for 20 minutes to make it safe to drink, you let it cool down before drinking it, you don't drink boiling water ffs...  tf is wrong with people?
---
Right...glad you got the name right didn’t know off the top of my head😂
---
I’m dyslexic so spelling that was a highlight for he day. 
---
I love it! I saw her running alone through Flatwoods one day. I tried to chase her down, but she was running too fast. 
---
Am I right in thinking the critical .50 cal is the refined one?
---
You get loot but not xp.
---
I don't have a problem with rocket turrets 🙂
---
If you haven't been to Whitesprings I'll sum up the problem better.
---
There is a building that people can put a camp close to. The building has a high ghoul spawn rate, and a lot of open windows.
---
The problem is people are building camps with nothing but rocket turrets pointed at those windows.
---
Because the owner gets no reward they are just killing mobs for no reason and denying other players.
---
Hope that clears that up 🙂
---
Also apparently the effect of the endangerol stacks on each player that fires one. Yours just refreshes timer. So yeah. Down with explosive. Up with syringers. 
---
Might not be a pipe dream after all, there's speculation that the road map hints to robot companions in the Wastelanders DLC.  It shows the Vault Boy waving at what appears to be a small sentry bot, possibly modified, meaning we may be getting automatron included into 76.  I'm hoping so because it was my favorite Fallout 4 DLC, I had well over 5p different bots between my characters.
---
I've got the white version of that for sale on PC

Glad I was here to witness👍🏻
---
Its extremely finicky, but you can get the CAMP device to place on just about any surface that isn't perfectly vertical if you find the exact right spot. For this spot the CAMP was placed 4 stories up the side of that tall tree right by the stairs. There's kind of a trick to it, but so far I haven't found a single tree yet that I couldn't (eventually, with great amounts of patience) place a CAMP on the side of. If you have patience, any spot with a tall tree can give you an 8-story tall camp.
---
How come every time their forums go down for maintenance its "Bethesda shut down their own website"
---
Sounds like she misses Graham and was trying to catch up to him lol
---
Love that you're downvoted for stating the obvious
---
Something close to it at least.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/ax6ll8/bethesda_should_fix_pvp_its_not_fair_to_those_of/ehsgjgt
---
And since they're adding dedicated PvP servers it should effectively do that 🙂
---
In other games each vendor had a limit AND you could exchange items for items, a system that makes more sense to me. 
---
It seems odd that factions would worry about cap limits when players are selling such large quantities of purified water (the entire base of the cap economy is that 1 cap = a bottle of purified water) 
---
It breaks my immersion for me that Watoga and Graham share a cap pool anyway, how do they both know that I traded to the other? Why do they share a pool? 
---
Why would Raiders / Responders/ Free-State/ Modus all follow the same arbitrary rules and why does MODUS care when he can fabricate as many caps as he wants...
---
I do not just log-in to sell to vendors I like to explore and try to find interesting unmarked locations, but often I forget which vendor pool I have already hit as I explore different areas. It makes sense that my character would see a record of when the new automated shipments are coming in, or who has a new trade table available, and go to see the vendors new wares. 
---
Well theres nothing worse then having PVP forced on you when you don't want it. 
---
On XBox and its all the time.  I've gotten used to manually working my quick item bar instead of selecting alternates from within the PIP menu.  Normal battle strategy now:
---
1. Quick menu - select sniper rifle
---
2. Take a shot on target
---
3. Quick menu - select super sledge
---
4. Enemies on me by this time
---
5. swing sledge
---
6. step forward
---
7. swing sledge
---
8. enemy dead?
---
"head east down the highway between the train station and The Whitesprings entrance, you'll come upon a couple of vehicle pile ups. The one furthest east spawns 5-7 ghouls"
---
The highway between Whitesprings and the train stations runs N/S. Do you mean South? I'm asking because I'd like to find this spot.
---
Woahhh didn’t know that. Bold statement but I’ll have to test it out! Will the effects show on the awareness perk? I tried it once and it didn’t show up as doing anything...heard it was bugged and didn’t work but maybe they fixed it
---
I'd focus on one style until you're 50+, then you have more flexibility on what card combo's you can take. 
---
Semi-auto gives you access to the BP, Dragon Hunting, Lever action and handmade rifles. 
---
Auto gives you the submachine, auto handmade, LMG, and the 10mm SMG.
---
sure, but then they had to send out canvas bags.
---
Why the fuck did that change? 
---
DUDE! I got that the other night. It was a drop near Top of the World and no one in sight. Felt it odd I had to lockpick it then got wanted after opening it. It said "Government Supply Drop" not "XxPussySlayer69xX Supply Drop". Luckily a nice lvl 145 guy helped me clear my wanted bounty.
---
Played Destiny 1 and 2. I think that the gameplay is what excelled the story. I'm a fan of D1 and D2, no hate, but I get your point. Just wanted to put my perspective here 
---
Almost exact situation happened to me over the weekend, three nuke drop kills all within 20-30 minutes, and the group we had dropped the SBQ in about 5-10 minutes every time.. Seems like she is rarely bugging now.
---
&gt;If not, the real estate near Whitesprings and Watoga (for example) could be all spoken for, no matter which server you hop on.
---
Going to be cap farmers with alt accounts that are logged in 24x7 to hold these camp spots.
---
No idea. I don’t use awareness. 
---
Me either, just wanted to test it out once
---
I'll have to try that.  I tried placing it in a tree but never got a lock.  lol, where do guests spawn at your camp?  At mine they always spawn at the original camp spot and I spawn due north 1 diameter  out from the camp device.  Since I put my camp device on the roof, I've been spawning and falling several stories.  Are you on PC?
---
Go for it 
---
You and I have different ideas of fun.  Or maybe I learned a long time ago that getting stuff handed to you without earning it makes games boring and ruins them faster than anything else.
---
Tried the SBQ Saturday night someone else launched. I stuck to melee so I didn't waste my ammo this time. Failed the event because she wouldn't take damage like she should. PS4...
---
Ah. Gotcha. 
---
I mention this in practically every post I see about atom shop wishlists, but I just want a coffin bed for my vampire themed character.
---
I'm in agreement here with you, but granted we don't know how the prestige system is going to operate or what kind of bonuses we will get, so it's a rather moot point. Could be nothing happens, or it could be you gain X amount of prestige on your character because of said levels.
---
That's 1 way to get the bitching out.
---
It wasn’t really.  I’m glad I am not having to deal with the extra weight of mostly useless food being put in my inventory randomly.
---
I know it takes a second longer but just add it to your favorites hotkeys and don't pick up any other weapons of that type because it almost always will mess up the hotkey and add the level 5 sledgehammer you just looted instead. Dropping or selling the unwanted item will rekey your proper weapon but it's kind of a ridiculous bug to still be around.
---
salt doesn't preserve already cooked food though
---
PC mod - glowing loot bags. A lifesaver for me. Great in nuke zones for the legendaries people drop because they can't fast travel as well.
---
sorry not trying to argue just wanted to point out that tea time and the others mentioned will pop every 110 mins while jail break has a chance to pop. 
---
Weapon damage goes down as it deteriorates. It looks freshly repaired here. Did you notice the decrease after some use? 
---
See that I understand.
---
It happens to me constantly on PS4.  It's becoming incredibly annoying, especially when surrounded by glowing ghouls in a Nuke zone.  Try to switch to my melee weapon and I get fists and I'm like "Well, I guess I'll die"
---
Also, was that a destructible tree (one that can be bulldozed)?
---
&gt;Raiders don't wear power armor. 
---
Yes they do, raider power armor.
---
&gt; it doesn't take ebay or OP weapons to git gud 
---
It's fallout. There is no skill in the pvp at all. There is no "Git gud" period. If someone has a two shot explosive automatic and sprays you down, you're dead. Unless you've got one yourself or a really good sniper, then you lose.
---
&gt; People need to realize that weapons, armor, and level do not matter as much as skill does
---
There is no skill. Get a TSE and spray someone. You win.
---
&gt;seriously everyone can die with the right strategy
---
When the right strategy is spraying them with a TSE then yes.
---
&gt; and that they faced the same fate of many other wastelanders in the fallout series.
---
You're not roleplaying as a raider. You're just being a jackass.
---
Line in sand, tea time, path to enlightenment only pop from people being a certain distance from it to trigger. Pure anecdotal though 
---
I thought lmg was a heavy? 
---
187, 14 and 4  :)
---
I don't know enough to answer your question but yeah, the aoe on the quantum is ridiculously small.
---
Had something lioe that happen but it was an invisible person with an explosive rifle or shotgun, not sure.  He wiped the floor with all three of us because he took us out one by one.  I would have gone back and launched my twoshot fatman at his general area but there were too many innocent players in the way and I didn't want to hurt them.
---
Cargobot was stuck in midair being attacked by other bots. I killed the enemies and it just sat there floating.  I poked it with my spear for a good 5 minutes until it dropped and I was wanted. Where in the game does it tell you interfering with them is bad? 
---
This is literally what the new alchohol crafting is all about. 
---
Its an adjustment so melee now needs to harvest / grind flux...
---
Use the flux in the alchohol. The alchohol adds explosive dmg to your melee attacks...
---
why pretend you "roleplay" an asshole, you just are an asshole.
---
Ah that may be it! I'll check percentage when I log in Tonite. I didn't realize it dropped. I swear there's so much they don't tell you in this game. 
---
It might be, I don't remember
---
I would argue that goofy is fine .. but at the same time you have gore and serious nightmare educing things running around .. Its not just "My Little Pony". As I have stated in a previous Post .. this whole design scheme being create by Barbie's fun house marketing team is tired and old at this point.  No one is saying get rid the the rainbow bright items they have created ... But its time for some serious carnivore, hell on earth stuff to come. I want raider cages with bodies in them to Hang outside my base. I want heads on spikes .. 
---
This little kid/ girly shite has gotta stop. Mix it up .. And I don't know what you mean by saying the universe is based off goofiness ? When I played Fallout 2, I never got the goofiness vibe , Neither did I with Fallout 4. The Universe is a  post apocalyptic wasteland with scourged zombies, bat dragons flying around , heads are exploding and blood and guts .  Meanwhile I can buy a pink fairy princess castle bed to sleep on? Just not doing it for me .. and have only bought 4 things with atomic points. its time to cater to everyone. Lets get a little Darker please Mr Design team...
---
Agreed 100%! I had my cliff side house on overlooking Watoga and it was a pain to get there. I moved it to a location I don't like as much, but it is really easy to reach my house. I did this when I saw player trading announced.
---
It seems like a lot of the discontent could be solved by making peoples camps impervious to damage. Camp griefing complaints far outweigh actual pvp complaints as far as I can see. No separate servers required. I don't participate in pvp, and yea some of those folks are jerks, but they add a bit of excitement and diversity to an otherwise moldy experience. I know that they will go back and fourth between modes, and the jerky ones will find a way around the improved pacifist mode restrictions, so why not just lessen the grief that they can cause? You know whats more annoying than being one shotted by a lvl 200 for no reason? being slap damaged to death by one over the course of 20 minutes because you don't want to buy anything from their stupid "shop". 
---
I guess I just fundamentally don't understand this argument. You have consumers who are asking for some specific feature in a product and the response from other consumers is, "Well, this is role playing." And, so? Some people are asking for it to be removed because some people's "role playing" interferes with their enjoyment of the game. 
---
Just get an acid pit and then get into your Excavator armor and clear out Lucky Hole mine.  You can easily pull out 600-800 lead ore each day there.  The only combo is by a fissure and you will NOT have a good time of it - every friend I have that has built there has given up rather quickly.
---
Do you have a bounty on your head? That might cause it.
---
Invest in Batteries Included my fren. You will never worry about energy ammo or fusion cores ever again.
---
I've been arguing for the same things, but people would rather split the playerbase for some reason.
---
I was doing this event all the time and then had back to back empty container events, and then no problems since.  Seems to be an occasionally occurring issue.
---
Is Perfect Storm an auto rifle or auto pistol?
---
Not true.  My wife and I found a drop last night.  I got loot from it.  It was empty for her.
---
Sometimes you want to go (raises Zippo lighter and sways to the beat) where everybody knows your name!
---
yeah i would like that i dont pvp at all..but maybe some days i may feel like and go into that server 
---
I’ve taken lots of photos posing with corpses. I laugh and then think omg what is wrong with me. Then I laugh again.
---
Reminds me of the loot farm I build in Fallout 4 with the cages from the Wasteland Workshop DLC  and a bunch of turrets. Throw in the AutoButcher from the Manufacturing Extended mod and my settlers never knew their Brahmin Burgers were actually made from Raiders.
---
I kinda think of the pvp as gta v does it its awful yeah but theres no real stopping that op lvl 300 vs the low lvl 10 with a woodshack the Pacifist modes is getting revamped to make yoy and your camp completely untouchable probably with a cool down tho and cant activated mid pvp
---
Nope.
---
Wall/ceiling mounted turrets, yes. Really want those.
---
There's porn for that, I'm sure.
---
Teammates can build things in your camp. I have turrets, metal walls, street light, etc that I can't build myself. I built a fusion generator for someone who doesn't have the plan. A friend is going to build me a decontamination arch, for which I do not have the plan. And so on. 
---
That's great to hear! I'm so looking forward to this new crafting, as my character is hobo themed and I keep professional drinker and party boy perks up at all times.
---
Do you think that party boy would also increase other positive effects on those new drinks?
---
Can i take my gear into survival?
---
Any other details on survival to pass on? I dont care about pacifist changes!
---
Can I also add that I hate when I am fighting a Scorchbeast, using up all my stimpaks and ammo, only to have the body dissappear when I finally kill it.  I get zero loot. I spent forever fighting it AND a Mirelurk Queen only to have the body dissappear. Bullshit
---
Greifers are watching the map for player idle in remote areas.  That's a sign that you're in your camp and a possible target.  I avoid this by first not spending a lot of time in the camp, and second when I am there I try to stay crouched so I don't show up on the map.  What I don't know is if my character is working at a bench, sleeping, or playing an instrument if I show up on the map or not.  If someone does show up unannounced I am pretty weary of them and ready to server hop if they start getting frisky.  I don't like the camp griefing at all so I try very hard to avoid becoming a target. 
---
Well depends on grenade type some land and are unmovable and others just go ham on the floor till its there time 
---
It's too bad you can't hit us instead too.
---
Look at captainnoob on youtube. I'm gearing my alt to a combat shotgun build. 
---
So do you mean setup a workshop with an acid (like Hemlock Holes) and then set your base at Lucky Hole to mine the Lead Ore?
---
If you just bought it you have no idea what it's worth.
---
The 99% Invisible podcast did a great episode on this:

[https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/ten-thousand-years/](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/ten-thousand-years/)
---
They signal vertibots....
---
If you own a workshop that has a vertibot pad (Grafton steel, converted munitions, Poseidon energy, etc) and the pad is repaired, throwing the grenade will call the vertibot to fly over and assist you.
---
“Since the game didn’t do well.”
---
Well, it didn’t start off well, but is doing better. 
---
In a nuke zone, pump out team requests and equip rad sponge it will do the job on that radiation. 
---
Prime does
---
Super Mutants up at Pleasant Valley knocked down a cargo bot and 1 of the vertibirds while I was at the station doing some trading. I go up, mop up and open the dropped loot box.
---
Wanted
---
but what about origin-al?
---
I like to use it for selfies.
---
Supposedly, this system is changing soon so your base will be immune if you are in Pacifist mode.
---
But nevertheless, these things happen.  If it's not another player, then it's enemy NPCs.  Just keep your base flexible.
---
Sitting atop a building sniping burn victims near 34. I discover I'm rather famished and desire some delicious foodstuff. Opening my wrist mounted backpack I dsicovered nary a week from today this hard fact: Food spoils. Lasts forever in the open air but once that shit enters the not-so-endless void of my wrist that it starts to rot in whatever vacuum I've placed it in. 
---
All of my food rotted and I was a few seconds from starving to death. I jumped off the roof, broke a leg, hobbled over to a building and promptly died in the doorway.
---
This is a great suggestion, though I'll never make that mistake again.
---
On Xbox, and I deal with this constantly. I've also had an issue where I have two different weapons with the same name (Barbed Something Baseball Bat), even though they have different mods on them, and the game will always unfavorite one of them after logging out.
---
I'm not here for the upvotes so it's all good :)
---
The cargobot can appear several places across the map. I've seen them in the Toxic Valley and in the Savage Divide.   
---
The launch sites are marked as Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. 
---
You should nuke fissure site prime someday. You shouldn't feed obligated to drop your first nuke there unless you're role-playing the story. If you're role-playing the story, you shouldn't be throwing nukes around casually. 
---
Thanks bro ! Apreciated!!
---
This is why I'm trying to refrain from playing my high levels characters until we learn more.
---
I'd prefer something like borderlands where the bonuses you unlock are shared across all your characters.
---
I'd also like to keep my animated perk cards, and plans / recipes for the character that prestiges.  
---
I will 😂
---
Gargoyles and Devil's horned heads and pictures of agonizing death might do it
---
You could, but what I meant was to find an ordinary acid node an set up your base there.  Then every couple of days make a trip to Lucky Hole to get the lead ore.  You will have a hard time storing it all afterward.  I made 3000 rounds of ammo and then 35 bulk lead after one run.  
---
Thanks!!
---
The solution is (used to be) make the ammo (and gun) weights realistic, so that you'd have to use your heavy weapons sparingly (or put everything into big a heavy gunner, making other parts of the game harder.)
---
How did they lose the plot there?
---
That's a fair point, although an argument can be made that none of the other weapon types outside of heavy weapons demand an ammo reduction perk, and right now, energy weapons don't have the same kick.
---
 I make my own. Presently my guy is making up for having to sneak into Harper's Ferry to talk to Wallace, when he was a lowly plan whore. I am now enjoying wiping out the entire town then going and talking to Wallace. It takes just a little while and I take very little damage.
---
 Stabby stabby. ;)
---
The cargobots can appear anywhere, but it is certainly more noticeable when they're doing flyover practice over Watoga, due to all the city's bots having a shot. Here's a hint, if you have a scoped weapon, try taking out the 4 rotors on the cargo bot, it'll end up just  floating in one spot after you destroy the 3rd rotor.
---
Players tried to become the end game content. 
---
Then everyone reeeeed and called them greifers
---
I agree. You can't just recode something this big in a couple of months. This is a fundamental change to gameplay mechanics so whatever they were planning, it's already set in stone with very little deviation.
---
The people that came to constructively criticize got ran off by those who'd die on the cross defending everything about this game.
---
I don't think there will ever be any endgame content as we understand games nowadays.  I feel this will be continually added to for a while.
---
Holy crap.  You mean Lucky Hole (haven’t been yet) has that much Lead Ore just there to be plucked?
---
Thank you soooooo much!!
---
Nuka bars with cage death matches???
---
Anytime! Good luck!
---
It's because they refuse to provide the media critics with prereleases since DOOM. It's not hard to imagine this circle of professionals retaliating for Bethesda literally taking work away from them. Every talking point about 76 is bullshit and typically entitled opinions like "if i had made fallout i'd have hurr durr." Don't even get me started about the existential issues of an individual utilizing that type of delusional omnipotence just to force an opinion out to the world.. 
---
Thanks!!!!
---
That might be it but was invisible, was a weird one i also killed 3 scorched that was wielding bigass baby rattles, wanted to take a photo but was crazy  
---
I built a lookout tower over a platform that encloses the junk node below.  Five stories tall.
---
Thanks!!!
---
Thanks you for the great add on ideas! :)
---
Thanks bro!

FO has always been a mix of *Seriously* dark with goofy shit built in. That was it's appeal, it always had that dark humour... the "man in a big rubber suit" vibe... giving it that cheesy 50s sci-fi feel.I don't deny that they are skewing hard to the goofier side of it al right now.
---
I've had a couple of bases over in the Mire that have always been attacked by Toads, Anglers, and Mirelurks. So it helps to have a couple turrets fire off to keep them from blowing my walls all to hell. These bases are not in any main quest area that effects gameplay or grinding (i.e. White Springs). I like coming back with the assist on food at least. :)
---
Perk cards 
---
Perks affecting weight maybe? 
---
I treat it like most open world games. Trust nobody and assume their all a threat. But like already mentioned, don't stay in your camp too long and crouch if you do. My camp is also in a location far from most locations, so if I see somebody suddenly at the closest location to my camp, I'm prepared. I also look at my map alot when at my camp for awhile, so I'll see anyone coming.
---
Yeah that would great also
---
EVERY. SINGLE. DAY.  
---
It respawns after a day.
---
My character should be able to perform interpretive dance in order to communicate the entire spectrum of human interaction.  Devs, make it happen,  chop chop.
---
So, today, I found a 3\* Mutant's Minigun.  I don't run Miniguns, but my friend does, and this Minigun had the damage bonus for being mutated, faster move speed when aiming, and something like +50% VATS critical damage.  Does that latter perk make this weapon really good based on what you've said?

Not sure if it’s on YouTube  but here’s a link to the trailer https://youtu.be/GmWadizC8AQ

Super Hitler needs more enclave gear for his lead up to legendary status—though the monocle is fetching.
---
Refined .50 Cal is pure damage increase (Like Hardened, just a lower percent) the .50 Cal one that increases critical damage is just called a .50 Cal Critical Receiver.

Protip, when reading the effects of the mods as you go to apply them you will see it say something along the lines of:

"Improved Damage and Hip Fire Accuracy" or you will see "Superior Damage and Hip Fire Accuracy."
---
For Criticals Improved is 1.5x and Superior is 2.0x. With a hunting rifle you can only get the 2x with using .308, Max of 1.5x with the 50 cal
---
(Please correct me if I am wrong, I am going off the top of my head)
---
Throw me a message here when you're on. I've got a window open.
---
I'm betting that I'm one of the few that both know this exists and plays FO76, whole living in the US.  It is pretty much a dead on match, isn't it? 👍😂
---
Ayy I have my camp there too! I had the same issue, but I decided to stay. I enjoy my camp and it's location very much, so if I end up with no customers so be it. However, I still do hope they tweak camp publicizing tho lol. I would still like some business
---
My name's not Al but nice guess :)
---
I don't mind the silly stuff, but I would agree that they are missing a real opportunity by not having more faction-specific gear.  BoS flags for your CAMP, BoS T-Shirt, Responder trucker hats, things like that.
---
But they don't affect STASH weight I didn't think, do they?
---
My main is a lvl74 and my ALT is a lvl15, I might try an launch my first Nuke tonight.
---
Blantons is my go to. You should try it some time and you should try legends brewy
---
This happened to me and I was wanted for days. Finally some kind soul killed me after I asked them to do it. 
---
I've solved it. 
---
* Make a copy of the Fallout.exe in root
---
* Rename the copy
---
* Make a copy of the Fallout.ini and rename according to the correlating .exe
---
* Add FalloutCustom.ini if needed and rename 
---
* Launch each instance from the respective .exe
---
Example:
---
* Fallout\_low.exe
---
* Fallout\_low.ini
---
* FalloutCustom\_low.ini

Some things like bobby pins and some ammo shows up as 0.00 weight when you first look at it, however if you go to the examine the item it will actually be something like .005 I can see how items like that add up
---
Sorry if you did take that into account, if you have I’d be interested to see if my stash isn’t as accurate as it says. 
---
Yeah, I was basing that off of a supply drop I found this weekend with stuff in it but I also just learned there are random supply drops so it may have been one of those.
---
I will agree if worded that way .. !! :P hahaha 
---
The vault raids are coming in a month, the road map visually teased 5 stars, there will definitely be end game content
---
Until private servers become a thing, there's only so much that the modding community can do... Which more or less amounts to client-end texture changes.
---
The whole PA naming thing is something that needed to happen months ago.
---
Not sure why I haven't done this for fun anyway.
---
Beyond perk cards, the tool tip weights are wrong. If you go by the tool-tip weight, bulking only helps significantly for lead and aluminium, but if you go by "what fits in the box", then bulking helps. 
---
Practical player and stash weights are what maters, yet they don't show enough decimal points to make precise calculations. Sorry, but I think you're on a doomed endeavor. 
---
Because in Fallout 3 toilets were open faced drug containers basically. Some habits stick.
---
The 2,000+ shotgun shells in my inventory and my charred ghoul melting legendary plasma flamer disagree with your personal assessment. But I will agree that by and large energy weapons are extremely unbalanced in terms of damage, durability, weight, and resource allocation as compared to their much more diverse and effective ballistic cousins.
---
They don't affect the actual weight, but they do affect the weight you see, whether the items are on your character or in your STASH. 
---
There are challenges you can set for yourself such as playing without power armor or using any legendaries, be chem-free, etc.
---
If your biggest concern is that someone is not sharing a legendary kill with you, I’d say you’ve had a very good run.  Luckily more content is ahead!
---
Not true, you opt into or out of the mode on a whim. As planned someone can gear out in normal mode with zero pvp threat and switch to survival, and back out again when they want.
---
I once got a rare plan (a prime reciever I think!) from a level 80 SB at Whitesprings. Thought that was normal.
---
I've killed a couple more dozen of them with nothing now, including 3 level 80 SB at once at Whitesprings bunker entrance. Nothing since.
---
 No! I drink single malts mostly, although Johnny Walker Red is hard to beat for Wiskey Sours.
---
They only wok if you own a vertibot pad which right now is just those three locations.  Other than that you don't need to keep any on you or in your stash.  The boxes replenish themselves when you re-own the pad location.
---
It would be a fair point if it weren't the only objective in the entire game that promoted having you do a hostile thing to another player.
---
I'm personally of the mindset that there was nothing wrong with the way it used to be - democratized loot is fun.  Heck, back when Mama Dolce's rewarded stew to everyone on the map, it made that whole thing worth doing.
---
They all need unlocking now, including the ones you trigger that won't give you a bounty.
---
I can agree with that
---
I don't think it's working. I take SO much more damage with this g.d. mutation.  I took level 4 Lone Wanderer to offset the damage when I'm solo, while I grind out getting all the perks. I spent all day yesterday grinding mutations, starting over when I get empath because for some reason, this one is always the last to cure. Once I have them all I'll cure one, get it back, repeat until I'm cured of Empath.    I would pay all my money if you could sell me a "Cure Specific Mutation" serum.  
---
7676 would be equally easy to remember. Grats on finding one that sticks. Also, grats for not using your ATM pin code......I hope.
---
AHHHH  That is so dumb...but that would make sense then hahaha
---
So, I'm apparently on the late show, the OP is removed? What was the gist of it? 
---
I'm on IGN GeekGasm10101
---
What kind of community is it? The one I joined on PC at Beta is pretty much dead. We had like 40 active players :-(
---
Just had a misplaced loot bag bug yesterday. Died on the Watoga Mayor quest where you're on the roof and the robots spawn en masse. Town was also under a Scorchbeast attack, so I died in two seconds. My bag was nowhere to be found, and the indicator was basically at an infinite Z point at X,Y location. The indicator was on the ground and air whether I was on the roof or at the base of the building. I'm guessing it somehow dropped under the map.
---
Wait, you get wanted if you didn’t call for it now? Fuck, I think I’m wanted from last night 😶
---
Wendigo cave if I remember rightly has a lot. 
---
They're all locked now, including the ones you summoned.
---
Tbh honest we have seen most go into hibernation (promising to return with new content) As of now we have 3-9 actives on at a given night.
---
Yes, You are correct, I am at work and was relying on my faulty memory of the map in my head.  Thank you for the correction
---
It’s not the only one. What about workshops? They give atoms for claiming a specific workshop that day and a lot of the time you have to steal it because it’s already occupied in your server due to the atom challenge.
---
Why do people go for supply drops anyway? I have a better chance at loot from the SBQ than supply drops.. &amp; she drops total shit 
---
There’s a perk card called “good with salt”. 
---
Yeah I agree. The damage you take is insane. I can barely fight scorchbeasts now because their sonic attack takes out crazy amounts of my health with empath on. And I def do not want to try to get rid of it and end up losing all my other mutations.
---
Make sure it’s already exploded or you’ll have a bad time. 
---
They're all locked now, even the ones you summon.
---
\*snorts and moos happily\*
---
A few days ago I made myself a look out tower in a similar way. It looks more believable though, in the nicest way possible haha
---
Just sleeping new sleeps and making new piles. Life is good!
---
Can't wait, a nice break from the griefers lol 
---
True 
---
No.  Only you can move or remove something that you placed.  They can only mess with what they create.
---
Yes. I have found that the weapons reset when entering/exiting PA -always, or loading (entering/exiting named building or fast travel)
---
I believe I have also noticed it randomly, but can't say for sure.
---
I started puttin weapons on the favorites real but then hit that other bug where it takes the first weapon alphabetically of the weapon type you chose...
---
I use the small lettering set to put the code above the keypad.
---
&gt;But there are 5 different recipes for Disease Cure, Detoxing Salve, and Healing Salve.
---
Yes, and that's a lot less than all the food recipes that require water.
---
&gt;And almost every piece of armor and weapon has multiple crafting plans with different required components depending on the level you want to craft.
---
Which would also be a pretty awkward way to do this, but at least it wouldn't swamp the recipe window.
---
 My present is immune to explosions. The fall will probably kill him though. I need to try this out. ;)
---
Yep I had this with mine. It decided the best possible spawn point is the very edge of a corner. Except my camp hasn't loaded in when I load in... so I fall all the way down and die. Strangely once isn't enough, so I respawn to fall again.
---
Eventually I moved the camp unit around enough that I now spawn at the bottom though.
---
96, 46, 24, 10.
---
You so show when using benches sitting sleeping and playing. 
---
I get wanting to keep track of your things, but why stress about finding errors knowing full well Bethesda won't do anything to fix the issue? 
---
I'm curious to how much you can sell. Like how much is the vender limit, compared to the stash limit? I have way too much ammo and once it's hopefully sold, will take a nice chunk away of my stash.
---
 Combat Knives. The game's best kept secret.
---
Hello. Thrown grenades. They are not terribly heavy, Think baseball with a few more ounces since it’s metal. The ones I’ve thrown don’t really bounce.m, but can get a good roll going. 
---
From US, knew how it worked pretty much immediately. Not that hard to work out by its design.
---
I got all of the heavy combat armor plans while doing my vendor runs. I think Watoga and Harper's Ferry, but don't quote me. 
---
Heavily missing the point. This would be NPC,s and it already something that happens. This is just a type of camp attack event suggestion.
---
It's how many legendary effects the gun has. Some drop with 1,2, or 3 effects (dots) and on specific weapons using specific mods, a 4th can be added but it's not an actual legendary effect. It's just a special effect that gives it another dot
---
Same here on PS4.  Happens every time I play.  It's just recently too like between updates or I just didn't notice until last week. 
---
you were mentioned in another thread as being a prime asshole in fallout76 and i happen to be one too. my joy in f76 is repeatedly raiding camps especially when i have 0 caps; that way when i killed i lose nothing and cause only mayhem. someone has to be the bad guy. I think its time to team up. my ign is malta888
---
Hell yes,its awesome
---
I’ve gotten all my plans from the events in Watoga and the area as a whole. 
---
That isn't a camp attack, that is 3 scorchbeasts heading to fissure sites. 
---
Xbox player here. Happens to me all the time. It got me killed twice yesterday trying to kill a scorchbeast. 
---
My current CAMP is there. It's been a dream of mine to build on the actual elevator part but alas, no real way of a) placing the CAMP unit and b) building allllll the way from foundation on the ground to the 2nd or 3rd level. 
---
Legendary Weapons can have up to 3 different extra stats [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout\_76\_legendary\_effects](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_legendary_effects)
---
a 4th star can be achieved by some speacial reciever/weapon modification. i dont know if its possible to make a 5th star but maybe later with a dlc or so
---
But, they won't bounce like 20 to 30 feet away when they hit a rock? 
---
 That's just the star rating. So with 4 greyed out, its a one star Legendary.
---
ultimately the engine has very specific limitations it seems it cant overcome. Its stretched gamebryo to its limits rather than rebuild on a more stable surface, without changing engines certain things like combat for example have a fixed limit.
---
I like the game but its infuriating at the same time. While I dont agree with the negativity, those people are entitled to their opinions. Sure some are just jerks, but many are just people who care deeply about the IP and seem to have issues expressing their frustrations.
---
Ditto.
---
Those definitely make sense considering the factions. Sturdy is such a pain to find though. Never once have a found a plan for it.
---
Nope! The community (of people who play the game) are pretty much all really great, helpful, nice and funny.
---
I've found that the internet is full of douchebags, and if you're just now realizing this, strap in, kiddo. 
---
Not really. Maybe a foot or so if tossed hard enough, but nothing like a super ball. It’s a solid metal casing hollowed in the middle. If you go to a surplus store you may find some empty shells and get a feel for them. 
---
Yes it does, thank you for adding that. I know alot of places that have a few growths here and there, but I had forgotten Wendigo Cave as a major spawn area.
---
Just put 1 point into each until lvl 50 then you can max out perk as needed.
---
Just to point out that when it comes to Perks, the Mole Miner Gauntlet is Unarmed (ie Ironfist Perk) and not 1-Handed.
---
Basically if you can wield it in Power Armor then its 1-Handed or 2-Handed.  If you cannot wiled it in PA, then is unarmed.
---
&gt;you start nerfing things cause it doesn't work in PvP, and then all the PvE players get screwed over, as their weapons suddenly turn useless.
---
Yep. I'm 90% positive that's where things are going.
---
I'm having the same issue, PS4.  Just happened a week or so ago like you said.
---
I will be getting all four just because they look fantastic. Now if only I could put the power armor on permanent display......
---
That's kind of what I figured. In this game they bounce way too much. It gets frustrating. Thanks. 
---
The game is almost exactly the same as when it came out and it was and still is unfinished to this day, most people prefer not having to wait for a game to be good
---
 The Heavy Combat plans drop fairly well now. As well as the mentioned Watoga and Harper's Ferry, I got Heavy Combat Chest from the Responder bot in Grafton.
---
That's awesome. Once the patch drops tomorrow, I may just move back there. Early apologies to you friend if I end causing you to server hop!! :)
---
Hopefully it's not intentional because you 100% could do this before. 
---
plans from an alt character. As others said, you can give to a friend to give back. Or, if you want to risk it all... put it in a container somewhere on a friend's world, quit game, change to your alt, rejoin them and pick up your stuff. Which is crazy risky and not recommended.
---
I think you've got it right. Furious might be a good option for dumping ammo into the queen, but is second best (bad) against everything else. 
---
I thought that too but since I've taken a single point in it I've been really happy with my food's shelf life. I used to have things go bad all the time, now it's only if I have leftover ingredients I forget about.
---
One of the next updates includes that I think.
---
No problem. I always throw them short in game since they seemed to never stop moving as if physics isn’t a thing or something. 
---
Aside from legendary farming and queen runs, end game is what you make of it right now. I’m trying to get every plan/recipe available in game, rare outfit hunting, and legendary farming myself. Keeps me plenty busy
---
Because it's that little bit of radiation that gives it zing.
---
What I mean is we will probably never "complete" the game as they have envisioned it.  If that makes sense? 
---
Neither are in game.
---
228, I really hope the prestige doesn't punish me when it comes out.
---
It was mostly to keep track of my main and mule inventories...
---
Just when I saw the discrepancy I was dumbfounded.  I can accept a little movement here or there due to rounding, but 84lbs?  nah...
---
I do that too, but they often hit something and fly into the Capital Wasteland. 
---
Sometimes I can't fast travel places for free that I could normally.  Most of the time it's a temporary glitch and fixes itself after some time or a server change. 
---
I’m a Pipefitter down south. I wear the welding hood on my main and mechanic jumpsuit. I actually work at a nuke plant now 👍🏼
---
Fair. Why I stick to Molotovs. Hit and explode. Or try to hit someone with the grenade and hope it doesn’t go to the Common Wealth on some grand trip. 
---
OMG I just noticed the AP loss the other night! I drew aggro from the queen and wasn't able to vats again since I was bottomed out the entire time! I though something weird was going on
---
Can I ask a really dumb question innocently?  What does “endgame” content mean?  🤷🏼‍♀️
---
Again RuneScape had the answer for that. They let you choose which "world" you joined and the community had agreed certain servers were for trading rare items and others for PvP etc. It all still happened elsewhere but the manual selection allowed those wanting a focus to choose one that enticed them. Not only did the allow people to avoid the places known for it if wanted a busier population in a different part of the map, it allowed regulars to meet frequently as they chose the same place. It did mean if it was busy you couldn't always join that world but there was still a healthy community on other servers so it didn't prevent people playing the way they wanted.
---
76 is outdone by an outdated game. 
---
FYI, you can keep walking while in favs menu.
---
Ditto on the PC. Happens just about every time I fast travel and randomly otherwise. It has gotten me killed several times already when my backup weapon turned out to by my bloody knuckles. :P
---
This only really happens to me when I'm in the middle of a battle with the Scorchbeasts... \*grumble\*
---
Just trying to confirm. 
---
Ain’t that there is another post with spreadsheet and clear math find out the total damage increase from critical receiver is less than hardened receiver, thus always use hardened receiver?
---
Thank you for the info that is kind of you to help me :)
---
Yeah, 1861 is gonna be pretty hard to forget
---
Thank you so much for the help!
---
It falls under the rifle perk line.
---
Thank you for the help!
---
I obtained one. But thank you anyway.
---
Ditto... huge ditto!
---
220 187 90 2 
---
All communities have that. They are just more obvious when it is the Internet and the barrier to entry is negligible.
---
OK. So I'm not crazy? 
---
I think that only the teammate who actually owns it can FT for free. Other teammates can then FT to the owner teammate for free.
---
I'm getting close to 200 myself.  It would be cool if they did that.  But most likely not, I'm fine either way honestly.
---
Woah, something has changed recently? I several times looted the drop and had no problems. But the last time was a month or so ago.
---
Double check your stash for any un-scrapped items, if your in the habit of hitting scrap all and then going to your stash and hitting store all junk any items that don’t auto scrap will have transferred at their full weight. Not everything auto scraps. You will need to manually scrap things like beer bottles ruptured and non ruptured hallucinogen gas canisters, scorchbeast bones etc
---
Awesome. Thanks. Love that gun
---
That's the full name? I'll log on now.
---
I finally had this happen last night!  Low level player was bopping around my camp.  Invited them in, since my front door is locked.  After a few minutes I get a message "I locked myself in your bathroom".  It was great.  
---
You think 76 will have a GOTY edition when the first batch of content is free? Raids free DLC? What are you paying for? What’s the GOTY version of this game? Lol 
---
Opposite of decontamination -- a place to get more rads, yeesss
---
Happens on almost every login but also my throwables get deselected as well. I have died quite a few times thanks to that
---
yep :)
---
They have legendary characters coming at some point.  That's supposed to reset your character back to one from fifty with whatever bonus they havent shared yet.
---
Actually, all boiled water is in disposable(???) Saturnite bottles so it stays hot. They can’t be used for anything else though because they melt when you empty them.
---
1. The weight on you and in your stash box can differ due to perk cards that affect weight
---
2. Rounding error.  I have 2500 Halloween candy that is marked at a weight of 0.000, but it weighs something like 7lbs.
---
Yep, got heavy and sturdy. Both from Watoga vendors
---
I moved a few things so I could keep picklock and hacking along with a few things.  How vital where the things you had to this build? I've also added in thru-hiker to carry around water and food that doesn't go off.
---
Let me know what you think.
---

---
WHAT???!! I have to go try this... I forgot terminals were a thing and I know so many people that are so annoyed you can't set your own keypad. If that works, I'll love you forever
---
Dropped my first nuke this weekend on pc at fissure prime site.  There were only four or so of us and we were unable to kill the SQB. I mostly want nuke zones for flux at this point so I can install advanced mods on my PA.
---
Well, after we all get vending machines at our camps the market for rare mats will be awesome.  Just sell them. 
---
I've found one-handed lackluster compared to two-handed. I really wanted to like one-handed, but I really like the Instigating (double dmg on full health) legendary effect, which seems to have better synergy with the high damage of two handed weapons. That said, before level 50 I think I was using the "Black Diamond" ski sword and a power fist almost exclusively. 
---
BTW, I believe the mole miners gauntlet counts as unarmed, but I could be wrong. Unarmed seems to work great, even without perks. For my build, I put a couple points into Incisor, and Martial Artist, and only one point in each of the slugger perks. There is a a faster swing speed legendary effect that is great if you can find a weapon with it.
---
Yesss I want a cat!!! Cats and dogs are the best. I have the fish lamp, but the damn thing is too bright in corners and when the lamp is off the fish won't swim... Like wyd Bethesda that's so annoying 
---
Strength can bug, serums can bug, if your diseased it can reduce strength, the condition affects dmg by up to 10% of base damage.
---
They are extremely rare to drop now from some reason.  But, I've seen them after patch 6 at the Watoga vendors and in the train car outside the Watoga train station.
---
Sorry, was logging in when you sent invite. Try again!
---
And if you have marsupial, you don't need more than 1 hop.  If you have strange in numbers too, you have to be careful not to hop clear over the bus.
---
And i'm only level 4
---
I do the same but Mine is on the inside of the door above it. Why have the keypad if you advertise the way through it?
---
The problem with a minigun is how insanely fast it eats up your AP. I toyed around with an unbuffed minigun on my critical character to see how it worked and my AP was gone in a fraction of a second. The burst of damage from a critical headshot was fairly impressive, but I lost confidence in a potential critical heavy build rather quickly. The insane fire rate and high cost of AP for heavy weapons just does not make it viable.
---
Or the ability to only repair items when they get below 5% durability.  So people can't go for hour long walks killing everything and they need to go back and repair when things break or are about to break.
---
It would get some lesser used perks being used more often.
---
I think we got off on the wrong foot. I specifically said in my first comment that I'm not advocating for the argument that its a feature of the game that players should just have to deal with. I completely agree that there should be different game modes since I myself do not participate in the PvP feature. I just like playing co-op with my buddy. I'm just saying I understand where he's coming from as Survival mode will be that immersive role-playing world of the Wild Wasteland where there's no holds bar to kill and pillage if someone wanted to role-play as a raider. It might be fun to try it sometime and I'm glad they are going to separate as I have no interest in participating in it myself at the moment. 
---
 Yeah, but you don't need anything at all to get on a bus. That is my only point. ;)
---
thank you
---
I placed and re-placed it until I got one that was made up of numbers that only a combination contain 1, 2 or 4.  I use a controller and it's a PITA to scroll to the other numbers.
---
Workshops should be an exception to pacifist. They are public grounds meant to be contested. Otherwise, I can log into a server in the morning, quickly go claim them all, then sit on resources the rest of the day with no worries. That would be terrible for an online game... 
---
Just get a drilling crew up there. 
---
Not yet. 
---
Wondering the same thing 
---
Well, I know I'm crazy. I'm asking if I'm not crazy for THIS reason. 
---
Yup, but get Marsupial and you can balance on the top of the tennis court fence or jump on the awnings.
---
That's what I mean - I think this didn't use to be the case. 
---
the one I summoned last night was not locked.
---
Sorry couldn't hear you, mic was just static. Anyways when you hit 50 let me know if you need I can make you another excavator or a X-01
---
I watch over the Prydwen - I am security guard
---
They already locked in the Fallout audience...why waste time making them happy? /s
---
Do you know what's also annoying? Posts spamming the same complaint 
---
32. I don’t get much of a chance to play 
---
You are getting all my upvotes. That was an incredibly kind and generous thing to do, thank you very very much. I promise to pay it forward.
---
My camp is near a map marker that almost nobody visits.  People assume that I'm at that site instead of at my camp.
---
Yeah the last time I seriously posted in attempt to get the rest of my fallout ppl on board the modding and fully custom server / content hype train they come out to do elitist mockery and Charisma policing. Like hey I'm a programmer brain not a charisma build, don't come on here and try to bully or tell me what Bethesda thinks for the community's modding enthusiasm, F off ya miserable saps
---
All pretty good here although Grahm shares caps with existing vendors. Either one of the Watoga ones or Whitesprings train station. Sorry I don't remember which.
---
Together we will rebuild Appalachia! If you ever see me on feel free to join up, I have a Discord server if you ever want to come check us out!
---
Is the flamer mod for the regular rifle or the enclave one?
---
How do you know it was his base?
---
I make sure to check mine before entering any dangerous area just because I have that happen consistently as well. I’m also Xbox. 
---
 One guy in a t-shirt and slacks and A Nocturnal 40% Speed Combat Knife can clear Harper's Ferry in just a couple of minutes. And take almost no damage doing it. 
---
 Its my latest play. At 180 per hit and say 4 a second I destroy large ghoul swarms in no time at all. 
---
Yeah there is a severe prob with its very vocal elitist Jerks. Wow had that prob too
---
Contested yes.  This can be done without PvP...  have a PvE contest for workshop ownership, the defend workshop event becomes a PvE contest with waves of attackers, and the player with the highest weighted overall contribution to the defense wins ownership.  There should be a cooldown before it can be contested again.
---
If it was clipped into a built workshop object, you can move that object.  Otherwise... it's gone
---
I found the regular flight helmet at the Ranger Station.
---
The jacuzzi is already a object in the game world so I would like to see it added
---
Like I said, not yet. 
---
I get nervous every time someone brings this up because I know they're making changes to the build area around Whitesprings and my camp is close. I'm not one of those who has a turret wall directly south of the club, (I don't even have any turrets), but I'm on Hole 6 which is pretty close. It's one of my favorite spots in the game and I'll be crushed if my camp disappears one day.
---
That limits content, some people want things like fight clubs or arenas, which pvp is needed.  Going all pve severely gimps this games potential.  I'm a very passive and active player.  So while that doesn't benefit me personally, I can see it's necessary.  If you want this game to last, it needs diversity within the current modes, not separation.  Strict pvp servers make sense as a separate mode.  Pve only doesn't sound good for this game.  But adventure mode in it's currently state is even better.  This way you get both types of players.  Sure there's griefers, but not everyone is like that.
---
Use vats?
---
Exactly what I was thinking.. That way I can try out the various new specs
---
Door locked, he was the only character there. No level 5 character can pick a lvl 3 lock.
---
Plasma grenades.
---
Lots of plasma grenades.
---
Weirdly I got my birthday 0323, 
---
 my old phone unlock pin, 
---
and I've had 6969. 
---
I'm taking it as proof that we're in a simulation and Rngesus got lazy and reused some old passwords from the main simulation to use in the fo76 simulation. 
---
If you crouch, you won’t appear on the map?
---
The ultracite laser weapons use regular cores and fusion cells, they’re no different in terms of ammo to the regular versions.
---
You don't appear on the map sitting and sleeping right?
---
Fair enough, but this is more of an unintended consequence of upcoming changes that could be overlooked.
---
Just trying to help 🙂
---
But he can open his teammate's locked door...

Sacrificial Blade mod for machete adds a star. [Hunter’s Machete](https://imgur.com/a/17cV9vC) 
---
 No. I have Jet Packs and can get to places you can't. ;)
---
I think it's funny how they went to all the trouble to keep people out, and we all decide to settle there and farm a little nuclear waste. It's a lovely spot.  When I read that terminal entry I was imagining super mutants trying to read a sign. :-D :-D
---
No disease when I checked both times. Had to wait for the perpetual rad worms to clear 😂
---
As do I.  That gives me a 2 story lead on you before I even hit the jetpack.
---
Here's a little secret, the Meat Hook is affected by both one handed melee perks (Gladiator) and unarmed (Iron Fist).
---
It's condition.  Use Weapon Artisan to repair over 100%.  The higher you go, the more damage dealt, 200% being the max.  It will go down as your condition falls. 
---
Wade airport has one as well. Found some at level 7 on the pad (somebody must of claimed it and hopped) and was psyched for my own personal vertibot air force. Imagine my disappointment when I threw it at the snallygaster down by the Capitol Building.
---
I would like to build one of those tubs of green goo from westtek.
---
Shhhhhh ;)
---
If you're on PC, wanna buy the marsupial and bird-bones mutation serums?
---
 What is wrong with you? No one cares! It is interesting to those without these things, that they can just hop on a fucking bus.
---
With all perks you can do +90% more damage (Max Rank of Gladiator, Expert Gladiator, Master Gladiator and Iron Fist).
---
It's been 6 hours since OP posted on god oh fuck.
---
Correct
---
Omg. I had no idea. If they add lootboxes they’ll have all the trimmings of a predatory game! Currently they only have the trimmings of a shit game.
---
Commando who still carries a sniper rifle and combat knife . Perks in commando and 1-h melee. Get the 2x sneak damage from range with sniper rifle, then take care of next wave in close with auto-rifle (VATS or not) Then combat knife (VATS or not).
---
Hard to explain... I watch the map, A LOT. It just... it's part of my schtick with my character. You may be right, but it doesn't seem that way.
---
I’ve managed to get s hold of a few of the miniguns. They’re called Gilded Miniguns and are always lvl 35.
---
I'm not criticizing!  That's an awesome PSA.  I've had the mutations so long that I've forgotten that I once couldn't do that.
---
Don't rush. You just be you!
---
If it is your drop or an open drop, then it won't be locked.  If it is locked, it is meant for a different player. Always check the area in the map as i have requested a drop on one side of the map and it was delivered on the other. LOL 
---
Well the traditional Fallout audience did this to themselves.
---
I loved the game from day one and I like the focus on pvp as well. There is no point in making a Multiplayer Open World MMORPG if you don't at least actively try to make world PvP work. Plenty of older games have shown that it is possible.
---
I would consider myself even more traditional than the "traditional Fallout audience". That thinks all Bethesda games should be single player interactive movies. 
---
Everybody knows in their secret heart that the story focus in new vegas makes for a worse game than the exploration experience you get in Fallout 3. In fact new vegas is one of the few exceptions where the story doesn't suck balls. Story and NPC have never been the most important thing in a Bethesda game, there is a reason most people never finish even 10% of the main in game story in the older games.
---
 F76 is the game that is most faithful to Fallout 3 the game that made Fallout originally popular among a wider audience than just the most harcore RPG players.
---
The Vault's are opening over the next month or so, that's going to be "high-level raiding" as Beth calls it, there's also quite a bit more plans for CAMP and PA, as well as weapon mods and other such paraphernalia. That's pretty much as end game as it gets in Fallout 76, besides nuking different sites and continuing to explore locations.
---
And the small pile I summoned last weekend were all locked.
---
Were yours dropped near Flatwoods, or did you use another tower?
---
Yeah, I'm just suggesting it because he shouldn't have enough camp budget to make it otherwise.
---
No. I may get to mutations, but I have to arrange my Luck. I'm arranging other things right now. 
---
 I think they are overrated myself, but thanks for the offer. 
---
Worked in FO4, haven't tried myself in 76.
---
Did the weapon deteriorate or did you eat some food that increased melee damage, such as glowing meat steak?
---
And my apologies to you my god sir! Good luck with the move!
---
I got mine from the wall safe in Watoga emergency services 
---
They stated that they did not want the Maps heavily populated hence the reason for 24 player limit ( I love this decision and if they had made 76 an MMO I would have been deeply saddened) 
---
I do wish the had the Runescspe Wilderness, ESOs Cyrodil, or the Divisions dark zone mechanic. 
---
Because honestly, slap damage isn't fun for anyone. Those that do and don't enjoy PvP can all agree that slap damage sucks.
---
I’ve walked in on several people sleeping and they were on map. 
---
Trapper Armor, Rad X, Rad Shield, and Nuka Orange. Mod for more radiation reduction, and shoot for at least one rad resist legendary effect. You'll be able to wear regular armor no problem, maybe you'll take more than a PA suit but not much
---
Ignore defense quests, leave before they show up. Eventually you will have a one wave "retake" quest. Much easier to deal with.
---
I just want a koi pond with water feature lol, 3 eyed koi lol 🐟🐠🐡
---
Well... i think the playerbase and their motivation have also changed over the years unfortunately.
---
&gt;The Vault's are opening over the next month or so
---
False, they won't be opening until sometime this summer, so sever months away at the very least
---
I find it helpful to build lots of fence sections (the cheap wooden ones) in the workshops. The mobs will try to destroy the fences first, giving you an opportunity to attack more effectively and protect the more critical stuff.  You don't even really need to put them in very carefully, or even connect them. It disrupts their movement and pathing a bit too. And put one in front of that little shack between the power plant and the fusion generator. For some reason, the mobs always want to attack something in there and it's hard for the turrets to hit them... 
---
Also, in a less high pressure spot (your camp or an easier workshop) set up a Blueprint Item that's just a foundation, stairs and floors up high with 2-4 turrets that you can then pop down super fast when you cap the workshop. I put fences around the foundation piece as well. The higher the turrets, the better, but I usually keep the blueprint smallish (1 foundation, 1 stair up from that, 3 floor pieces + 2 turrets) so it can fit in smaller places. 
---
The ‘random supply drop’ isnt random. Some other player called it in.
---
Y'know, I hopped on the "why is VATS a thing in an online game its probably trash with time not getting slowed down" train and never got off. Haven't picked any perks towards it either. 
---
 I have just discovered that its possible. ;)
---
I have a vampires speedy switchblade that I love to stabby stabby with. Oddly enough it seems to work best against high-health enemies like the scorchbeast queen. It hits so fast, I out-heal any damage I take from the queen, and any other spawns that join in.
---
There is a minimum and maximum range. You do not seem to get a lot out of them.
---
Got it. Thanks for clarifying. 
---
Trolls in this game are the shittiest demographic, the only reason why Bethesda games have been dumbed down is to appeal to these sorts of players. Fuck the game, the items, putting thought into a character, they hop online and copy exactly what everyone else is doing so they can be OP and avoid playing the game. Fucking embarrassing tbh and even worse that Bethesda has catered this entire experience to these players 
---
I got the Furious Combat Knife with higher damage each hit. Amazing.
---
I don't think they're overrated.  The ones that will totally change your game are Marsupial and Speed Demon.  Once you try them, you'll never look back.
---
When mole-rats attack, I jump in the air and target them with VATS and kill them before I land.  In the Savage divide, you can scale the tall mountains without running through all your cores.  You can even climb Senaca Rocks.  Speed demon makes me move crouched faster than a standing person and walk at almost sprinting speed.
---
I dont have perks for it either but always use it with annoying mobs like flying insects and molerats. Would probably help you with the wolves.
---
The game decides these battles must be finished in a fashion a true man would, by smashing your enemy into a bloody(or oily) goo with your bare hands! But for real I have to do the same thing my guy.
---
I will especially go check vendor pools when I see the nuke zones on the map, lots of people offloading legendaries then.
---
Snagged a Bloodied Gauss Rifle that way, made my day.
---
You're probably right... I haven't seen a CAMP of this size ever in game up to this point. It was massive.
---
My problem now is we are seeing a person go to a server and claim every single workshop in it. They will not build a single item in it nor do any defend events. All they are doing is capturing them so that if anybody else wants it they are forced to have to enter into a PvP status. It's a little ironic that after the last patch and the latest announcement of the possible Pacifist Mode change that we started to see this occur almost over night. All they did was simply turn PvE players away from enjoying another aspect of the game they paid for. Just like making the Supply Drops a PvP event if you loot it. Anytime they do something to try and cause more PvP in the game, all they do is end up turning the PvE players away from using that aspect of the game.
---
Because Zenimax built ESO. Bethesda just published it for them. Zenimax now owns Bethesda, but not sure how they run their shit. Ya know?
---
Thank you very much! I play with some Aussie friends so the hours might be a bit out but I'm going to tell them all about you and your generous helpful self. :)
---
 Yeah I found the Vampire effect not that useful, but I never used it on a Queen. ;) I carry 6 knives now. They weigh fuck all. ;)
---
Yep, use VATS. Try it with your melee weapon anyway. Can't hurt. It definitely helps target things swarming at your feet.
---
Until I find something that's better than All Rise I'm sticking with 2 hand
---
I do not think I have seen that post, but if you are building for criticals
---
Using Eagle Eyes, better Criticals and a Calibrated .308 receiver (Without accounting for Sneaking/Headshots)
---
Each shot would have a crit modifier of 3.65x
---
A level 50 hunting rifle has a base damage of 70 without perks or modifiers. 
---
This means a crit shot would do 255.5, and a base shot would do 70
---
On average I crit every second to third shot. So assuming 3 shots to crit and opening with a crit
---
255.5/70/70/255.5/70 - 721 for 5 shots
---
If I am not mistaken a Hardened Receiver adds 20% to the weapons base damage 70x1.2 = 84
---
5 Shots in a row with the same critical modifier (-1x for the calibrated receiver) 2.65
---
222.6/84/84/222.6/84 - 697.2 for 5 shots.
---
Obviously I am pulling this out of my ass, and it is not very scientific (please let me know if the hardened is more than 20%, I am at work and cant research it atm) Both are obviously Ideal conditions, and clear shots on targets.
---
Why not both?
---
Probably shoulda thought one through. Welp, that's probably way easier.
---
Unfortunately, it wasn't.  I still think it's a basic mistake that should've been fixed before launch though.
---
Oh, well without turrets, I had built a 5x5x5 building that was filled with everything.
---
Oh yeahhhhhh
---
Oh damn that's fair. Funny thing is, those damn wolves gave me tons of xp. 
---
Drops have to be picked up by the person that called it first, then they are public loot.  Your just getting to them because you only respond when they are nearby, before the low level player that ordered it can get there.
---
While true, those aren't formal Quests.
---
At Hemlock holes, I teleport in, collect from all 5 collectors and dump it straight into a stash box.  That way if somebody kills me, I lose nothing.
---
Please don't and keep the danger in the Fallout franchise. War never changes remember?
---
It's somewhat of a support issue because every answer I have seen online pointed to one of the vendors in grafton having the plan, but they have glitched the vendors so that it's no longer available. 
---
Additionally, I can't point to it, but I could swear that I posted the issue here on reddit and got a. Bot telling me to submit it online. 
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Specifically deep pocketed combat armor limbs?
---
As these would obviously be different characters, then no you wouldn't be getting 8 prestige levels. It would be based off an individual character's levels, not your combined levels across your account. Thus the 185th level character might prestige three times, the 110 twice and so on. Seems more likely we'll only get one level regardless.
---
 Well all you get is 20% Speed. I can do that by carrying a pistol with no need for a Mutation. The Speeds do not stack! 
---
 You can climb Senaca Rocks with nothing at all.
---
 Molerats die to my Combat Knives extremely fast and often do no damage.
---
I love the healthy green glow of FEV.
---
Has to be shared stash, otherwise it would be used as free storage space.
---
That would work pretty well I'd say. It's just a shame that every time I log off I'll be plopped into a different server(PS4) and then everything will be gone. I guess the blueprint for the turrets would be great but then everything else would be gone in a woosh. Not to mention the server becomes unresponsive more than I'd like and I'm booted off.
---
Excellent. Thanks!
---
Get cards for both. IMO rifleman first then commando. Grinding the game out and exploring I enjoyed rifleman and saved on bullets. Now that caps, ammo and weapons are not a thing I find I enjoy commando more. Be prepared to do a vats build with at least 4 leaf clover for crits is you go commando though.
---
It's an old bug that they put back in. I hope that they fix it. 
---
At first one handed was great, but after lvl 50 2 handed seemed to do a lot better for me. 
---
But it was way ugly, so I changed it to a ground floor enclosing the junk collector (and roofing it over) and a single floor 5x5 three stories above that.  I added stilts so it looks right from an engineering perspective.
---
Then how about just making it an option in the settings? Everyone wins then. People who want it can have it, and those who don’t can have it set to off/hidden.
---
We should team up, do a tour and do photoshoots with dead vault people.
---
Because you want to keep the critters out, but don't mind if a player wants to come in.
---
Not many people blow up and fly thru a box and lose their junk within the box. Pretty rare instance that needs to occur before it can be fixed. I’m pretty confident when I say you are probably the first/only person this has happened to lol
---
Wait, that's grafton. 
---
Yes, it used to be offered there. No more since about a month ago when all the inventories changed. 
---
A berserker handmade and a hazmat suit, or a bloodied handmade explosive... That's why I use, I don't like power armor... I always go for a rifleman build, sniper build so power armor is out and I do very well vs enemy and player. I shit you not. Obviously some radaway, medx, psycho and stims help but I never take over 30 of those in total. 
---
They’re only getting a PVP audience because their lack of content in the game. We have no emotional attachment to anything going on.
---
(I don’t PVP, but many of my high level friends are doing it now because they’re bored.)
---
Speaking of wanted stories, one time I was playing and I looted a random container only to find some basic loot until every turret in the settlement went haywire and started shooting at me, I guess looting randomly generated junk in settlements counts as stealing, so I run into A house with turrets shooting through the window and get to the bathroom when some high level guy comes  and shoots me for like 10 caps. I tell the guy what happens and he apologizes no harm done as he couldn’t have know. So I go back to the house only to find that all the doors have been randomly locked, and since all my best loot was in there I tried shooting down the door, before realizing that once again I was being shot down by turrets. The wanted level system sure does suck.
---
Its too much loot thats too easy to get in Bethesdas eyes. Because you know, fuck fun....
---
They want you to grind for everything, which is one of the worst philosophies especially how they apply it.
---
Well, I don't really accept the argument, "in other games". Simply because I don't want all games to be the same. I want games to be creative and inventive. 
---
Same with, "It seems odd". I mean, I can run around with a pitchfork that heated by a never ending supply of lighter fluid squirting out past a never ending lighter, to heat the metal prongs of the pitchfork. 
---
All these games involve a high level of suspension of disbelief. We know animals wouldn't mutate into dangerous monsters. 
---
Why would the different factions follow the same arbitrary rules? That's what humans do. We copy what others do. 
---
But all of that aside. I think it's clear they reason why it's done this way. To limit the amount of caps enter into the game. It's that simple I think. 
---
When in game currency enters any game, very little of leaves the game. Currently, caps enter the game, and leave the game via buying stuff from vendors, namely pans and recipes. 
---
Once player vending enters the game, caps are going to really stick around. Because when in game currency starts being traded player to player, the amount in the game grows very fast. 
---
So it's really for the best if they don't make it so easy to cap farm the vendors. 
---
Some things, while seeming arbitrary to you, are actually for trying to keep the game healthy. 
---
If you shoot down the robot thingy that delivers it before it drops, it will be unlocked as well i think. I have never found a locked one that i shot down. 
---
Hopefully when player vending drops we can put our camps in pacifist mode and publicize our camps on the map for people to see. 
---
I'm running Stealth sniper, so I"m crouched most of the time and invisible most of the time (Chameleon mutation).  My adjusted stats are:
---
STR 0
---
PER 24
---
END 3
---
CHR 5
---
INT 14
---
AGI 23
---
LCK 7
---
No mele for me.  If they even see me, I'm dead.  That's why I headshot the enemies from 200 M away.  They never see me.
---
Sure thing. I will add you
---
People will just know. Nuclear waste sites aren't going to be forgotten.
---
And that doesn't seem like a lot of extra work, (and don't say it should be an easy toggle option for coding. it's just never good to decide someone's job is easy to do.) for something that really isn't a problem? I could see how frustrating it would be if it was a every 24 hours. But every 20 isn't that bad. Most people have regular play schedules, and so for them, it's not a problem I think. 
---
Ah ok that makes sense
---
Yea. Just realized I said "the mire". Meant cranberry bog. Sorry bout that. I've gotten enough where I stick them in boxes by train vendors. But I've also gotten them from events in the mire. Got protective marine lining plans from a hoard event in the mire as well. 
---
I'm fairly certain it's the weapon degrading. Which I feel dumb as hell for not knowing. This is my primary weapon and it gets tons of use. I want to say it was under 70% when I last checked. 
---
A regular locked door does that doesn’t it?
---
I play pretty regularly on ps4 and rarely encounter bugs. Haven't had a disconnect in a while, but sometimes if you stay on the same server too long things start to slow down. Then you just hop to a new server and its fine. 
---
The stash increases help a lot. Nothing will truly help hoarding though. Drop/sell your stuff and you won't have to spend so much time managing everything.
---
yeah its annoying as hell, happens all the time on ps4
---
and i HAVE gotten killed by it... just like Op alluded to
---
In rl you don’t salt cooked meat. You salt raw meat to remove moisture to preserve it. Perhaps they do allow us to salt raw meat in game but remove most of the benefits? Catch 22. 
---
If they'd make the scorchbeasts drop at least one stable flux, they would be worth farming.
---
In 100,000 years, yes they will.
---
It's really odd I seemed to be able to use it at any range almost first time I ever built one then they just became worthless out of nowhere
---
Well considering I use Adrenal Reaction as a Bloodied Build, use Heavy Energy Weapons AND love building my camp to the best it can be, this is the most excited I've ever been for a patch since FO76 started.
---
How about fixes? Not more junk added to the game. 
---
The basic idea is that we should replace the nuclear danger symbol or it will become like what the Jolly Roger has become, a pop culture symbol. A proposal was made to structure bizarre and alien structures like the spiky obelisks pointing out of the ground everywhere at the site, to add an idea of fear and the unknown. Its cool to see they added that into the game.
---
If you dont care then why did you reply and if you dont play the game why are you here?
---
It did get me killed a couple times when I was low level. Now at 158 and it’s just annoying. 
---
Oh my fucking God not this shit again.
---
Just give it a rest, will ya?
---
Theres no secret hiding in plain sight and we have the data mine to prove it.
---
No, I found it at Harpers Ferry.
---
Which would be excusable if 76 even tried to take on influence from modern ideas of such games. 
---
Just noticed this yesterday
---
They do not...
---
I feel your pain. lots of achievements seem bugged. i have been hit in the face by a nuke at least 5 times. I literally stood there and watched it hit me. no "ground zero" achievement. 
---
He just doesn't do enough damage. Might as well spawn.a level 16 scorched with a pipe pistol. It's 5 seconds of distraction and that's it.
---
Requires them to pick the lock, which makes them Wanted, right?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/axffrc/psa_damage_per_second_calculations_how_sneak/?st=JT4RSU4B&amp;sh=00f192cb
---
And I apologize he also calculated the sneak attack bonus also. That’s why harden always win out. 
---
"Well all you get is 20% Speed. I can do that by carrying a pistol with no need for a Mutation. The Speeds do not stack!"
---
I think they do stack, but I'm not sure.  (And I carry rifles.)
---
"You can climb Senaca Rocks with nothing at all."  The south mountain?  Without power armor?  I mean the north mountain is much easier, but I start by the railroad bridge in the southwest and go up.
---
Can you upgrade my raider armour?
---
 I run a balanced build, always have. I can take out stuff from a distance, my Instigating Lever Action is pretty killer. I must admit I have been neglecting my Shotguns as I build towards my new binky. Combat Knives are devastating and immense fun.
---
 With a full set of BoS Heavy Combat with Dense on the chest I'm immune to explosions. I hunt Scrochbeasts in this outfit as their screeching is explosive and does nothing to me. 
---
 I put on my X0-1 and melt Ghouls at The Whitespring to the point people get upset with me.
---
 I can both take and deliver lots of damage to any damn thing. ;) I test on the Gulper Pack at Watoga Train Yard as their regen is insane and I can see what has the most DPS. They hit hard. ;)
---
This thing was a pure "Brutalist" Soviet-looking block of concrete and steel. Full concrete foundation.
---
Oh certainly! If you need the experience, fight all the waves. If you just want the goodies and to avoid more PVPers, run away.
---
I see far more posts like this complaining about people who're negative assholes than I see negative assholes. Granted I'm not on fo76 subreddit half as much as I used to be, but I still check in once a day or so.
---
Either way a quick look at the front page of this subreddit suggests that OP is sorta full of poo. This community surely has some assholes, but any more than normal?
---
What's the harm in them testing, don't ruin there fun
---
It’s is already tracked, why not display it.  I think it should only be visible at the vendor, not on the map though.
---
I know this isn't your point at all, but I'd just like to say that this online community really is better than pretty mich any other I've seen. I got the game two days ago and was just setting up a base when two high level players walked up to me and started answering my questions about building.  They then ran me through some level 50 dungeons for fast xp and loot I can't use for a long time. We just explored a few areas together after that. One of them asked what my main weapon is and I said a .44 but I'm out of ammo. He said just a second and made me 100 rounds. I offered him caps and he just said "that's not how this works." 
---
Saturday I capped that Workshop 4 times. Got logged off, had to go have lunch, crashed... then my teammates got on the same server I had been on, and we went past Monongah... my stuff was still there.   
---
I was like "hey, how did someone build EXACT set of structures in the workshop... Oh, right. It was me. :) Then I recaptured it and repaired my previous build.   
---
Teaching people stuff and teaching people to teach people.
---
The displayed damage can also change based on if the item is equipped or not, as that is when your perks and other items are added in, such as bloodied. 
---
I did it twice yesterday. Both times it had no ore but I did get the meteoric sword in one of the containers. 
---
Yea still dont know how he got it tho.
---
Maybe I'm just missing something, but the Meat Hook, even with Extra Hooks, never seemed that remarkable compared to other Unarmed weapons, even with this quirk.
---
88 also
---
Worst case scenario, we petition Bethesda to add an achievement in a future dlc. 
---
 They do not stack. I have tested it when I got Speed Demon in the wild. 
---
 I will go and try the other hill. ;)
---
Haha do it mate! I’d love to see it
---
i saw thanks
---
I don't hate them, I feel sorry for them. Can you imagine being gay and homeless? You wouldn't have a closet to come out of. Horrible.
---
This. He's a good guy that just does his thing instead of complaining.
---
Absolutely.  I know I could stand to commit more damage with other weapons, but with the Vampire's Combat Knife, I can sit there and stab the Queen and end up gaining HP from it.
---
And it might even work out in the end, because you're not putting all your eggs into a single swing like you are with a Super Sledge.  If they block one stab, that's alright, there's more where that came from.
---
Maybe someone discarded it or he got it in a trade deal. Whatever, he was very kind!
---
&gt;The MEGA campaign also supports a mile high border wall to block out all the scorch beasts.
---
And we're gonna make the scorched pay for it!
---
I think Sun could absorb pretty much anything. 
---
I think it's just quite impossible to launch anything a lot into orbit and beond.
---
Yeah those gulpers take about 3 shots from my TSE Lever action.  I have demolition expert 5 and I stack a 2.5 sneak multiplier, so that particular weapon does about 600 damage.  
---
It's different play styles.
---
I can cruise (crouched) across the bogs and the scorch beasts keep flapping overhead with me in hidden the whole way. I go to fissure sites and collect from all the decaying Ultracite veins.  As long as I don't bump into one, the scorched can't see me.  I just have to kill the dogs and wolves.  They have better eyesight.
---
At level 40, I snuck through the glassed cavern with only a single piece of chameleon armor and no legendary weapons at all.  I think I only had to kill about 10 scorched.  I'm going to try it again and this time shoot the scorch beast at the end.
---
I only briefly skimmed it (thank you for linking it!!) only thing that stands out is the better Criticals in F04 was 60%, it is only 40% in FO76.
---
I am going to look into this some more after work.
---
This is actually the dumbest idea I've ever heard. Of you hate PvP that much don't play an online rpg. 
---
😁
---
I would :)
---
Thing is...If you take Adventure Mode and Survival Mode, they are next to each other like two players in current game- where one is duper and other aint. We could also say:"Hey, I don't like challenge, I'll dupe my items. You wan't challenge go farm SBQ".
---
That's actually a great idea - they could do it account wide (how the Paragon system in Diablo 3 works) so that even if you start a brand new character, you get bonuses. More incentive to level up alts, more incentive to keep playing.
---
Might wanna add what platform :)
---
PC
---
Sorry what do you mean about platform? New to reddit
---
Jh just jumps on Reddit thread controversy and turns it into a 10 minute 44 second video. Of which the bulk is just assuming the tread is good and Bethesda bad. Then the last 6 minutes is an unrelated thing from his studies. Which is lovely and all but not what I'm looking up right now.
---
Mxr seems alright but I've not seen enough tbh. Does some funny vids though it seems.
---
Well for one, this isn't a MMORPG. You have to have "massively multiplayer" for it to be an MMORPG. 24 people per instance doesn't hit that mark on any level.
---
Two, congrats on thinking you're more X than X. It's a very dickish mentality to decide you're superior than others of the same category just by virtue of being you.
---
Three, PvP is not the only way to have an online multiplayer experience. Cooperative play is a thing. Unchecked PvP and forcing people to PvP when they don't want to causes a negative experience, not a positive one.
---
Four, do you realize you basically said that NV sucks and then immediately turned around and said it was the best story? Like, dude, your opinion is *yours* and that's fine, but stop trying to force it on everyone else. Ofc, you *do* think you're "more traditional than traditional", so I'm not really surprised by this.
---
Five, I enjoy FO76. I like playing. I've spent hours exploring with my SO and that's the experience I was looking for. Know what I *wasn't* looking for? Getting harrassed by someone 50 levels higher than me that wants to PvP so they keep potshotting me while I'm trying to do stuff. Yeah, it's slap damage, but it is *negatively* affecting my play because I'm not *interested* in that shit. I shouldn't have to ditch my team and server hop because some stranger is being an annoying dick.
---
If you want to PvP, that is *fine*, but go PvP with *other* people who want to PvP and leave those of us that want to PvE *alone*.
---
Actually, I have a camp just outside the western fence of Whitesprings and I can put artillery rounds in the Golf Club without any issue.  They do reasonable damage and I generally tag everything  on both floors if I pop smoke in the main door
---
Wait for someone smarter l, but I’ve heard Morgantown has some

We will be doing it on xbox

It’s alright! Lol. Are you on Xbox, pc or ps4?
---
15 in intelligence is massive overkill, you need 5 max to run the crafting perks or demo expert. Although the durability perks are nice, weapon artisan allows you to repair a weapon upto 200% and allows you to put more special points into more useful areas like luck, agility, strength etc. 
---
Exactly .. LOL .. Switch then relaize no weapon .. My brain locks up cause it thinks something different should happen .. HAHAH next thing you know I am scrambling to get far enough away to be able to D-pad selection so I can swap to a weapon . .
---
To get a ton of caps you can try PvPing, each time you kill someone they lose about the same about of caps as the level they are. However you also do the same so it's a risk / reward type of thing.
---
Xbox
---
Hahaha. Keep dreaming. Seriously, unless you're rolling with a team and they're all feeding you their flux, I don't think that's even close to possible. Morgantown is the best I've found/seen so far. Make sure to get the farm at the airport and all around Mama Dulce's. Corn, silt beans, and mutfruit all turn to cobalt as does bloodleaf, I think. 
---
I'd like to know about if we lose cards as well. It will suck to have to get all those crafting cards again, and, as I said, I may just keep my level 300 as a crafter since he has 100+ points to spare in case I ever want to unlock something for crafting.
---
What do you play on? The demographically differences between different consoles and PC is amazing.
---
The internet equivalent of slowly driving by your ex's house at night.

Nooo. Far larger. Far more imposing.

since when do you get wanted for looting supply drops?!
---
Anyone see instantly spawned and dead ten cows on road? Whats going in fo76?
---
There will be a huge update tomorrow.
---
Nice! How does one get the free armor? I’ve thought of getting some. Atm I’m rocking  a full set of bos heavy combat except one arm that’s chameleon 
---
locked doors can only be opened by teammates. otherwise it counts as picking an owned lock, and thus makes you wanted.
---
LOL. I hunt Scorchbeasts. It is a big part of my play. The more the merrier. I can hide from em' too, but I only do that when I want to get somewhere and not deal with em'.
---
 My Alt farmed the Glass Caverns from about level 24 or so. Its like home for me. ;)
---
Well we can only wait and see, I wonder if Bungie will sue Bethesda next for basically copying their vendor for the legendary items 'cough cough, xur, cough cough'
---
It's not so much that I wanted everyone on an even playing field (though knowing that there wouldn't be a bunch a duped god tier legendary items won't be floating around would be nice), I just liked the idea of a harder game mode, like Survival mode in Fallout 4. Actually, now that I say that it'd be awesome if they also ramped up damage done/received like FO4 Survival too.
---
The idea of a game mode where everyone CAN initiate PvP at any point but that doesn't necessarily mean they do is really what I'd like, but that's probably not going go happen since it's primarily going to be people who built their character up in Adventure and are now just looking for a fight. If characters had to choose at creation which mode they were in, you'd at least have a chance that not every single player you run into kills you on sight. I'd even be cool with allowing a one time transfer from Adventure to Survival as a compromise for the folks who don't want to or don't have the time to build up a completely new character.
---
That said, I was just being a little salty about what could have been when I called it a deal breaker. I know I'll end up checking it out on both my main as well as make another character that I play strictly in Survival anyways.
---
Currently, I believe it's Morgantown, but you're not going to get anywhere close to 250.
---
Hahaha I actually joined a server earlier today where someone had built basically a settlement. I hope they knew there was a slim chance they'd find themselves in that server again.
---
The first one there was 4x4x4.  the second one was 5x4x5. I've changed it a few times since.  Your limits of build area are a circle somewhere around 8 squares diameter.
---
Look up power armor spawns in the forest and you will probably find it or level 30 T51 
---
Yea that's why I felt like an ass, he literally bribed me to stop. Just wish I caught on earlier. Hopefully he will have better experiences with other people in the community. 
---
if your on PS4 I can probably find you a full set in less than an hour 
---
I've been playing since shortly before Xmas last year.  I recall NOT having free teleports to my teammates Workshops since then.  We used to capture them often (exp/plans) and would always have to fast travel to each other instead of the workshop to participate in the Defend/Retake quests.
---
I'm fairly confident this was the case since at least Xmas, because we always complained to each other about not being able to fast travel to each others' owned workshops.  Only to our own and each others' CAMPs.
---
Sounds like you need either different armor, a different melee weapon, or perhaps a combat shotgun?  
---
Although which is better depends on the levels of the wolves.
---
I like the chest piece that does stealth for a few seconds after you take a hit.
---
If you have a sniper rifle, stand on top of a processor and snipe them.  
---
Even better if you combine that with one piece of chameleon armor.
---
Ran into that in the Ash Heap. There's a tree over there which has mannequins and bones hanging from it, as well as some stuff at the base. It looks like a shrine of some kind. The Super Mutant was standing there, with his hands raised, and it looked like he was praying, so it worked.
---
I also listened to some of the dialog for a few minutes, and it's pretty good.
---
"Hot here. Even for Super Mutant!"
---
"So dusty. Like breathing sand."
---
You'll find, reviewing his post history, that the fellow you replied to is a bit of a cunt.
---
Also, if you want a bit better defense, depending on if you're going a low health bloodied build or a high health tank melee, you'll want at least max rank blocker for 45% melee damage reduction, possibly dodgy is agility to reduce inbound damage at the cost of ap and (if low health build) max rank nerd rage in intelligence and serendipity in luck. Intelligence 5 is all you need. Luck has a lot of good perks. Melee vats with rapid and more powerful crit builds can be incredibly powerful.
---
It's funny because most of the complains sum down to "I wanted ___ and didn't get it". There's enough game here for people who have a taste for it and for the studio to flesh it out. But that's just it. People don't care about if it makes others happy. It sucks they get such a loud voice when we need to tackle issues in the game with actual critiques and feedback. Whenever you see "lol this game is shit", let's just all agree to ignore them. If there isn't any legitimate concerns presented, let's just ignore them until their only audience left are other assholes. Then they can form an asshole infinite loop and implode.
---
I hunt them too.  If I use a silenced, non-explosive weapon and hide behind a tree, I usually won't come out of caution for the entire fight.
---
Helps me a lot thanks to all you guys. I will go hunt the watoga vendor for the the 50. Cal crit receiver till I get a nicer rifle higher level after I bank a bunch of .308. Thanks guys.
---
to be fair, there's a difference between "hey come fight me if you want a challenge" and "i'm going to kill the same person over and over even though they don't fight back cuz it makes me laugh"
---
The BoS Vendor in Watoga sometimes sells the individual parts, but you are much better off searching for them yourself.  There are three in Watoga itself, one to the southeast, one at Big B's Rest Stop in the Mire, one at Camp Venture, you get the idea...
---
Thanks. Yeah I’ll have to keep looking. Tried earlier and just kept finding duplicates or empty frames.
---
Message faewolfgirl1 on xbox and I will fill u in on the details :)
---
 That's one of big things about Combat Knives, especially faster ones, no one blocks em' Not enough time. ;) 
---
You probably just saw pieces being sold by a vendor that a player had previously sold to the Vendor.  Anything a player sells to a Vendor is available for purchase later.  (Until someone else buys it).
---
None of the vendors sell power armor pieces (only plans). If you found a vendor that was selling armor pieces it would only because somebody else sold them to the vendor.
---
Best thing to do would be to look up easy to get to power armor spawn points and you should get the T-45 pieces pretty quick.
---
For anyone interested message faewolfgirl1 on xbox to get full details
---
Nope thanks.. and offline story play version would be better for future dlc.. just sayin
---
Okay yeah I was over in Watoga last night that might actually be it. Thanks!
---
Alrighty. I’m not at home yet but I’ll do it through the Xbox app
---
Same. Had that happen to me. Had a supply drop come in close to my CAMP, so i thought I'd just grab it since it was close and the quest came up. Next thing,i have the first Wanted I've ever had in the game. I just quickly went back to CAMP, dropped off all my good stuff and then went out and taunted emote the first player i encountered to get it over with. 
---
Thanks for pointing this spot out. I wasn't even aware of it. I can skirt the zone now and not jump into the center for quick attempts at material farming
---
Momma dulce has plenty mutfruits outside when nuked I’ve walked with close to 80 ( with green thumb )
---
You can do this Already - I had a Full pool set up and Everything .. I will add a picture later hahaha..
---
Find a place with water that's not to deep place your concrete foundation for your entire base .. and where you want the pool .. just delete the concrete blocks .. and BOOM .. you now have a pool. 
---
I even had a group of Strangers show up and take a dip in the pool and Keep waving me over to join them.  It was clear they were taking pictures and I'm not sure but I think they got insulted when I placed a rad shower in the middle of the pool .. and one of them one shotted me ? They probably thought I was being a perv .. but I was just trying to trick out the pool with a shower hahaha. it was fun and they left my base alone .. so never really figured out why they shot me.  Maybe an Accident? 
---
Interesting. Thanks!
---
Both at once.  3 cards for each (most efficient usage) with perks which apply to both, e.g. Tank Killer and Tormentor.  Lever action for VATS limb sniping, auto handmade for closer work.  Works great.
---
52
---
Adding turrets and punji boards around them at choke points to slow the wolves down can help, but melee vats is your best bet.
---
Everything in my camp is open to any and all.   Except my porta potty.  A man's Throne is his castle after all.
---
I used to booby trap it with Nuka mines.  Unfortunately they disappear. 
---
Disappointing. 
---
Eh, yeah :)
---
PLEASE GOD tell me it's PC.

This must have been built to max dimensions, then.
---
Totally not your fault, but I have a real issue with this mentality of trying to perfect a character build at level 12, there's no reason you should be worried about this and wondering about mutations already. I've seen players robbed of this entire game because their only concern is hitting the next big milestone. Enjoy the early game while you can and don't stress it too much I guess is all I'm saying.
---
&gt; This is why I want so badly for the servers to be separate, and to require new characters 
---
This is f#cking bs, because I have already invested 200+ hours into character, farmed all the gear and now you force me to do new character- redo quest I have already done and explore the world what I have already seen. And this all because the developer was sort sighted and didn't actually bother analyzing game concept before building it. And message it send is that, maybe don't bother playing Survival Mode, because there might be coming 3rd and 4th mode, that are even more survival than survival mode and instead of wasting you time developing character in survival mode, you could save that time playing some other game and then playing F76 when 3rd mode lands.

Are you able to launch a nuke there from silo Charlie or do i have to use one of the silos in the north?  I've only launched one Nuke personally on prime fissure so haven't checked,  and reason i ask someone said that area was protected and you couldn't launch a nuke there or something
---
Lol try faewolfgirl without the 1 lol 
---
It’s okay, I know what you mean. That’s why I just try to explore as much as possible. This build stuff is overwhelming me a bit, so i thought by reaching out to ya’ll here, I could get a clearer understanding of it all, and stop worrying about it. 
---
Yup.  Different play styles.  For example, I'm a whiz at Sniper Elite and once played Deus Ex (the first one) non-lethal.
---
Well, there's nuclear winter mode, so that's already a 3rd.
---
I feel you. This game takes a fair amount of ignoring issues.
---
Um, lead belly 3 is kinda pointless without cannibalism. That's probably something to work at.
---
I think I’ve only bought a pose too!
---
And empty...
---
It worked lol I messaged you 
---
Hmm. I can't really recall because I don't usually play multiplayer. But I vaguely remember being able to do this at some point. I've been playing since the beginning (BETA) , so my memory is foggy of everything that has changed or remained. 
---
How about each prestige you gain every 50 levels and return level 1, and that prestige point goes for implants: stable, permanent gains!.. And no refund :)
---
You have to pick the lock on the ones that you snipe with the nuke cards, and you don't get marked wanted for that... at least, I haven't yet, and I've looted 3 of them in recent days.
---
I also have a problem with griefers. Not PVP in general, as that’s designed to be a part of the game, but the a-holes that show up with the intention of ruining your day. Supposedly this will all be fixed soon, so don’t stop playing the game. Until pacifist mode actually works, just server hop like I do. It’s a shitty solution to an even worse problem, but at least that way you don’t have to continuously move your camp. I hope you keep enjoying all the wonderful aspects of this game and just avoid those people for the time being. 
---
UPDATE - I repasted my GPU and CPU with Arctic MX4, and installed DDR4 3400 RAM as part of troubleshooting to stop this game from freezing, but all I managed to do was boost my FPS (84 now) with the RAM. The game is still freezing.
---
So, just max out Makeshift Warrior to 5? I think i’d prefer the high health tank type situation btw.

Anyone ever try some area near lake Eloise in the south?  Supposedly there's a ton but i haven't scouted and confirmed there's ample mut fruit corn n sap

Have the devs and decision makers been in the loop on this? Based on what I’ve seen on Reddit, this change has been universally disliked. 
---
Dude, the bloodied pole hook rocks. Does it not swing slightly faster than most slow weapons? I only have a one star but it has literally carried me through 150 levels. It's now my back up melee but never leaves my side. 
---
Uhh that's a mirelurk....
---
&gt;Bethesda has catered this entire experience to these players
---
How.
---
Honestly, just keep using the 50 receiver, it will still be easier to obtain than 308 even at higher levels.
---
That’s hilarious! I will absolutely be “borrowing” your idea! 
---
I was heading along the power lines near Sutton once and a cargobot came and dropped a supply drop in a grass clearing ahead and a bunch of protectrons spawned around it. I went right up to it to kill the protectrons and noticed the supply drop wasn't locked and wasn't marked "steal" on the take button. So I took some stuff and hid for a little while nearby to see if anyone else came, and two other people did and none of them got wanted for taking from it. I didn't call it in. So either it was a random event or maybe if someone calls one in and leaves the server right away it drops with no owner and is unlocked.

I think the different soda grenades are meant for different enemies. The nuka ones are great for groups, the quantum ones are better for large beasts, where you can land them and do damage, even if your friends are meleeing.

Fire in the hole and Grenadier are great perks to have if you like grenades.

Have done Whitesprings countless times at low and high levels with a hazmat, because I don't like PA.  Marsupial mutation is important, so you can jump on the bus, awning, or walls to escape and snipe.  Below level 40 use molotovs, after that use an auto tesla.  You can tag everything to get all the loot.  The hazmat gives you better rad resistance than PA.
---
Keep in mind during the queen fight most people will be fully geared and have all their buffs equipped, most are more than happy to kill other people if given an excuse or motivation. Outside the queen fight people either aren't fully geared or aren't prepared for combat. It requires little to no effort to one shot someone if you are full build and armed to the teeth. 
---
I am unfamiliar with the lore behind these weapons, but maybe the plasma is actually stored in the cartridge? Whereas for fusion you would just need a bunch of atoms floating around? Either way, I agree that these weapons are severely underpowered. I’ve been sticking to ballistic heavy weapons on my main build, but they’re only slightly better at this point. 
---
Is posted my experiences here.  Have this bug and a specialised team at bethesa is looking into it.
---
Make it rp-friendly and give a small speed buff afterwards. 
---
Was available in the atom store, think it's gone now. Never seen it in game.
---
You might have to wait for them to put it on sale again.

I have it on a regular. Probably exists for enclave too but I haven’t looked for one
---
Its a bug.  Have the same problem
---
Cool, thanks for letting me know! 🤙🏼
---
I'm not sure about this theory. I went to that billboard by Whitesprings with a bunch of cats. I thought, oh, how cute! Then, the little fuckers started dying. I thought, shit, we're under attack,.... but nothing. One by one, they were programmed to die. 
---
Any particular reason that may be available to the public? 
---
Its a bug...
---
There are raider camps throughout the savage divide that you can place your camp on if you want that look. 
---
I've never really compared it to others. I know it typically injures things if it doesn't one shot them (gotta have adrenaline going for it to one shot). I do j is this, a spear outside of power armor does an extra poke move that it doesn't do in power armor making its swing speed real nice. I have a vamp spear with swing speed that I use when I don't wanna run around in power armor. 
---
I prefer the X01 but now i am not using any.

Why else would you do it?  Not to be flippant but this happened to me yesterday farming ghouls at WS.  A lvl 250+ unannounced arrived and went nuts. Before I knew what hit me I was dead and I’m a lvl 135 player just minding my own business.  What pissed me off the worst about it was I went back to get some revenge and dude was long gone.  Probably server hopping just 1 shotting fools to get their caps and junk.  
---
Huh? What’s that?
---
Yes!  I saw it weeks ago and couldn't remember the name of the place off the top of my head.
---
Thanks for telling us. I'm glad that you did this. I'm hoping it's because you found a bag bug or glitch, and just need a day to work it out. Whatever the reason, and I am curious to the reason, I don't think waiting a day is that terrible. Also, if you don't want to say why, I'm good with that. 
---
It was just in passing as a place where I have experienced stuff falling from the sky.  I have had several good Legendary drops from this group in the past, 2 shot radium rifle and a 2 shot western revolver comes to mind.  Good luck! 
---
I had seen that a few minutes later
---
I've had the same bug but with ceramic.  Seems to happen when looking at component view while carrying certain mods in your inventory.
---
I think the weapon will ignore 50% of the armor anyways
---
Tells us delayed release yet no explanation of why and gives shitty response OMEGALUL. Can't you say the same for the base game?
---
Against the Queen, Zealot’s (should) still be better. I can’t verify it against the queen (she’s got too much damn health for me to tell), but Zealots certainly works against normal SB, and I’ve no reason to believe the queen would be an exception to that. 
---
You want either the hardest hitting 2H, the fastest swinging 1H. Unarmed is for NonPA.
---
 The fastest 1H type is knives, Combat is best. Get it with faster swing speed.
---
The strongest 2H at base is the Super Sledge, but can't find base Grognak Axe stats.
---
For UA it's the Power Fist, but due to a bug meathooks benefit from 1H and so becomes the highest damaging, possibly even more than 2H. Don't get used to this, as it will eventually be fixed and you don't wanna feel as silly as m79/Gatling gun users

High health tank? Ok. Makeshift warrior 5 is good then. Also, make sure you don't worry about mutations until you get starched genes in the luck tree (I think in the 30's), else, if you get a mutation, you would likely lose it by using a rad away or decontamination shower. Putting a few points into agility for sneak is good in addition to getting dodgy. Sneak attack critical attacks can help you reduce the number of hits it takes to kill stuff. With mutations, in would also recommend class freak as mutations all come with cons to go with the pros and class freak reduces their severity by up to 75%. For food, u would also recommend carnivore. With that, you get double hunger benefit from meat with no chance of disease, but you get no benefit from eating non-meat. Use that and you don't need lead belly. Instead of that, get sun kissed to natural heal yourself of rad damage and get rank 3 fireproof, which reduces the damage received from explosives, including the scorch beast scream attacks. You can further reduce explosive damage by putting the dense mod onto your chest armor piece. Look for Vanguard's legendary gear, provides additional damage resistance when at high health.
---
Try powered switches instead. I’ve never seen enemies open them, and no wanted. 
---
I was thinking when you take a shit you get a lighter load buff and can jump higher, that combined with marsupial would be hectic haha. 
---
Curious what this means for tomorrow. Guessing we will just have new daily/weekly challenges, but no weekly event/new atom shop items until Wednesday? 
---
Hell , They could Just Hire us to build one - I love building and its always something different - I want free reign though and then they can come in and tweak it to their satisfaction. I was offering to do this before .. but there was some bug that if you moved your camp you lost the ability to move/place an item that you as the owner did not place ? Been a while since then ? is this still a known bug ?
---
Why are people paying $60 for a game thats good 2 years down the pipe. Video games weren't supposed to be like stock investments, you were supposed to have fun out of the box.
---
I'm sorry, are you DEFENDING the guy being a douche towards those of us just trying to have fun?...
---
thx u just saved me atoms
---
Waaaaaant.  Just let me salt my meat and eventually ice it and nuka cola through the cooking station for increased condition and effects.
---
They could do so much with the cooking system, why decapitate it with a single perk in, of all things, luck.
---
You'd think being good with salt is more an intelligence thing.
---
I mean as much as i disliked the launch of the game for reasons of my own, the reason i would continue to play is because i'm a fan of the franchise and i've already bought the game . As long as now that they have a lot of the issues ironed out from launch (i said a lot not all )they are able to show us what fallout 76 could really be all about, you're in the same boat as everyone else. We have all been waiting for new content since we got the game unfortunately they launched the game in a mediocre state , now that they have room to breathe they can start showing us the potential of the game and if it doesn't live up to what you want then stop playing once you get an idea of what the post launch content will be like.
---
I know it sucks but this is what these kinds of games entail waiting to see what the post launch support will be like they can put whatever they want down on paper concept and execution are more often than not 2 different things.
---
The really need to buff the chainsaw. I keep a flaming one just for show. 
---
Good, take your time and don't try screwing it up
---
I have 2 Grogs and they are both favored, it takes my vamp out of upper slot, leaving it blank, but leaves the Zealot., one slot down the wheel.  Alphabetical selection perhaps?  It will still leave the last one i used in my grip regardless.  Only happens on log in or server change.  Xbox.
---
Right, but how do you value a game?  Just on its polish, really?  I mean there are games out there that are all polish and about 5 hours of good gameplay. 60 bucks there?  
---
When people play a game for 100 hours and experience a dozen bugs that affected maybe 50 minutes of their total experience, does that mean you dock 66% of its value?  Just doesn't make sense.
---
I'm fine with that, I eat for food more than given stats.  Oh but let us make jerky if salting meat removes additional stat boosts for additional condition.
---
Under luck, why not intelligence?
---
Me
---
Power connectors or power pylon cotagory
---
Awww glad you’ve mentioned this. I was going to buy it but was in two minds. Assumed it came with the helmet 
---
Give me the option to place a copy of the head(s) of the player(s) I slay in PVP, and you've got my vote.
---
No, you won't.  You ded :P
---
PS4 suffers from this hard lmao
---
Are you looking for a boyfriend free girl to be your sweetie gal pal?
---
I’ve had those experiences too.  I’m cool if someone shows aggression and they initiate PVP in a combat type setting but when you are simply minding your own business buying stuff or crafting ammo or farming a location and someone tries to gank you that gets really old.  That’s not being a raider - that’s being an asshole.  Most of the time I can and do fight back but I’ve had plenty of occasions getting 1 shotted or slapped a few times by much higher level players.  Much like my feeling of players building turret camps at WS (no build zone) there should be no grief zones like I mentioned above.  
---
I literally didn't realize this until today when it made me wanted. I really wish Bethesda would stop actively making the game worse. 
---
Seriously, whose fucking idea was it to make these player specific? It's not like they contain super great shit to begin with.
---
I would like to hear this too
---
it's still an option, just did it on my lunch break in the bog.
---
I tried putting together some builds, they might not be the best builds but I tried here are 3:
---
-
---
Prototype 1 "Rifleman"
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=8f53898&amp;d=sb2sg2s01pd2pk2pl2pp2p02eo2ev0ce0cq0i12ic4a72a80a04l71lt2e10e60lu2&amp;w=pg2ph2pi2ik0iq2at1lm2&amp;n=Prototype%201%20"Rifleman"

---
Suggested Weapon: Shotguns (of any kind)
---
Could this be done with the rad emitters?
---
Noted!!
---
I like that and we should expand on it. We should be able to mount thier heads on the wall like a deer. Complete with name plate.
---
Interesting. I’ve heard the opposite about zealots affecting SB &amp; SBQ from several others. I hope they’re wrong. Seems we need some science. Not an easy test. 
---
What platform are you on? If Xbox I can pop one to you until it’s fixed. 
---
Does Bethesda even know they're bugged? Every time I see a list of things they're working on, they never seem to have this issue noted. 
---
At the cost of more thirst. 
---
Sure does!
---
I think the consensus is that we cheated and dont ever deserve to play again. But for real would be nice to know at least if we should wait around or not.
---
The trenches of the Cranberry bog has a lot. 
---
What about the stabilised perk?
---
&gt; This reminds me of the Feed the People patch.
---
I was talking to a friend about this last night. Most of the events aren't scaled up to max level, so if you get loot or legendaries nobody is going to want to them because they're not going to be as effective. This means a lot of events like Feed the People, Fly Swatter, or Swarm of Suiters never get done because there's zero incentive to do so.
---
However, if these events gave temporary buffs to players server wide a lot more people would be interested in doing the events if it benefit everyone. It would give the events a bit more of a reason to exist.
---
Pretty sure that armor price is for a set which is 5 pieces of armor, so each piece is 20k. Honestly, for high tier end game armor that's a good price. Prices are not that outrageous. Caps are easy to get. For starters you can make 10k in a week just from selling to vendors. That doesnt include anything you sell to other players. If it was easy to get it would be cheap. What is broken is people coming in and expecting to get something some people have been trading up for since launch for 2k caps and think it's fair that they offer it. Truth be told the prices are a reflection of just how bad the RNG can be. 
---
I have all the explosive perks maxxed, including grenadier and Fire in the Hole. I'm saying you'd have to land a quantum grenade right on top of an enemy to damage it. That becomes very difficult since they bounce like super balls. Above I wrote about try to hit a behemoth with a quantum grenade. I actually threw three from different angles and the behemoth was stationary. None of them hit.
---
Also, does explosive damage harm friendly players? Pretty sure it does slap damage. 
---
Precisely!! Post of the year.  I’m lvl 135 with decent weapons and armor but still no match for the dude running sentinel bloodied build with gear or inflated leveling by virtue of duping their way to prominence.  I mean, TSEs got nerfed (rightfully so) but there are still major balancing issues and they really never addressed the cheaters properly.  To that extent I say anyone that duped is automatically moved to PVP or they can choose to drop their duped shit and start over or respec without their fancy gear. 
---
I value a game by the amount of fun, replay value, polish, and such. 80 dollars for a game has to be top notch. Fun, can replay tons, and not super buddy. This game is fun but for how long? Most people high leveled say they mostly just try and help others as theyre bored... Theres no end game. As soon as they add that maybe it will be worth it. 
---
Every time I use a supply drop tape nothing happens. I don't get a quest, I don't get a drop... I don't get anything. I see zero reason to do them. I assume it just goes out to some random player on the server.
---
I’m pretty sure nobody will be unbanned once they can guarantee that nobody can duplicate items or utilize cheats to benefit
---
I like the people I play with. We build camps and take photos. Fucking lit.
---
I've always just left my door shut but not locked so passers by can do what they need.   Whenever my camp gets AI visitors they tend to stick to messing up my food as its 99% the time mole rats or a few wolves. Not much of a problem with finding a wrecked house.  Just a lot of wasted fertilizer\~
---
My suggestion would be to server hop and find an already-nuked Whitespring, which is common enough. You can definitely get 10 cobalt to make a stable from picking what's near the entrance/surrounding grounds with Green Thumb equipped.
---
We nuked the Generals Steakhouse the other day, I'm pretty sure one of the plants in the garden turns into cobalt but idk which.
---
Sucks, but I'd rather they delay things and get them (more) right, than have them push out something that doesn't work / needs to be fixed later.
---
My game runs fine with similar specs, there must be something else causing issues.
---
hahah .. I try not to even look at anything over 10k .. if its that much Ima just keep on farming. Cause anything that price IMO is crazy and I don't think any item in the game is gonna change my experience that dramatic.  I also think people that have Hundreds of thousands of caps were dupers who made their money fast and easy .. or other weapons and armor vendors who  get amazing trade/drops/buys and know how to market them. but for us average players I wont ever get to 100k not on my lifestyle of playing. HAHAh .. don't forget to check the robot vendors sometimes people sell things and don't even know what they have/had .. I found a two shot exploding the other day and snatched it up for like a hundo .. 
---
So I put your build into a format that's easier to read:
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4DBQUOBAQBAQEAMkAC8AEDbwVaAVwBowEDDQPiAQEOAS8DeQNUAwsBDwWzAQNdAY0BA7ABARIBIgPsAQM2AuUBAdcBARkBAA==
---
It's....not pretty.
---
Looks like you want a 2-h Melee build, which indeed can be a monster. Probably not with this combo though....
---
Issues:
---
- Str - Pain train - waste of points, does nothing. Take it back.
---
- Per - You'll probably never use picklock, and when you do, swap it in. Fortune finder is beyond useless.
---
- End - Lead belly is one of the most pointless perks in the whole game. I sell Rad-Away to merchants for my daily caps run. It's everywhere. Solar powered....what, are you just going to hunt at night???
---
- Cha - Hard Bargain and Travel Agent are awesome perks....if you're doing a trade run. They give you nothing while you're actually playing. Lone Wanderer is awesome, but max it or don't bother.
---
- Int - Hacker, drop them. You'll swap in if needed, which is never. First aid....you won't need this if you're not made of paper (which this build is, sorry). Makeshift warrior is not crap, but you don't need 5 points, you just need a backup emergency weapon to let you finish the run, then go repair. You're not a rifleman!
---
- Luck - Both great perks. Essential tbh. No mistakes here, but where's Class Freak? Mutations HURT if you're not minimising the drawbacks.
---
I'm assuming you want a 2-h power-armor wearing tank, so try this:
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/planner/#Aw4AAAUCBQcBAQEAIE8DeAPwAQPEAQM/A6MBA34BeQMLA6QBA/EBA8IBASIDNgIYAdcBAQA=
---
This brings you only to 45 perk points (out of 56). You can put in whatever you want, but my advice is to make them QOL (carry weight, etc).
---
For a rationale on the build:
---
- Offense - Maxed 2-h damage, maxed adrenaline (60% damage as long as you keep killing, 30s refresh), incisor (ignore 75% armor). Bloody Mess, +15% damage, always. Glow sight for WS nuked ghouls. There's no better 1 point in Per (which you have to have).
---
- Extra offense - Hit low health and hit harder (Nerd Rage), Radicool  is more damage when your rads get high.
---
- Defense - Power armor. Non-negotiable. Put on max level excavator and rock. Dodgy + Action Boy means you get massive DR until your AP runs out, so one-hit everything and keep moving. If they're melee, hello Blocker, which is 45% less damage if something takes a swipe at you. Add emergency protocols to your Excavator suit, and laugh when you get to low health, cos 50% DR.
---
- Other - Luck - Class Freak to minimise bad mutation effects, Starched Genes to make your mutations stick. You want these.
---
- Mutations - All of em. Fuck it, why not. There are no massive downsides to anything.
---
- Weapon - Anything. I build this for 2-h, so that means Grognak Axe or Sledge or Super-Sledge. The absolute best is a Bloodied legendary weapon so when you get low on health all those bonuses start to stack. Nerd rage + Radicool + Booze + Chems + Adrenal Reaction + Bloodied....you ever wonder how these guys take down the Scorchbeast Queen in 5 hits? This is how.
---
Anyhow, please share this with your friend, he might like it too :P
---
God is it ugly. I was hoping for the terminals in game but thank you!
---
I think you are right about there being different uses for them though. The massive nuka explosion does energy and ballistic damage. The quantum does only ballistic and is actually weaker than the nuka overall. Just from the one time the quantum hit, it seems like it does a lot of limb damage though. That could just be because I hit ghouls with it. They seem to lose limbs easy. 
---
I doubt anyone knows, including Bethesda. Chuck a charging barrel on it to reduce the fire rate, and test it on Watoga robots.
---
I picked up a Vampires Handmade a few days ago, and it immediately took over the slot for my TSE Handmade, no matter how many times I switched it back, without FT or anything else, whenever I toggled weapons it always came back.
---
A lot of it depends on the terrain your on. I never aim where they are, i try and aim it where I think they will be by the time the grenade lands and ends its movement. 
---
As far as hurting team mates. I’ve certainly hurt people on my Group with them. 
---
Create a new psn account and then link both of your account so you can play it again on your new account
---
I’ve seen multiple posts for this and I just don’t get it.  It’s not that hard to get food in this game. It’s literally everywhere. I have the vegetarian mute and just make soup. But you also carnivore mute paired with purified water  and you have cannibal perk. So many options. I don’t even use the perk cards to make food last longer. Completely useless. 
---
Thanks for the offer, but I’m PS4.
---
From what I read they specifically stated that the accounts would be unbanned after they duping bug (or at least the relevant ones) were verified to be fixed.  
---
I wouldn't expect to hear any additional information until said patch is actually released, there isn't much point in putting out a schedule that won't really be realistic until the fix has been verified.
---
The buffed armor and melee weapons are worse.  Unless you think a sledgehammer should run 900dmg per hit while mini nukes barely touch 700.  
---
Enclave events. BOS events too, but not as common.
---
I have a two shot explosive gatling plasma. Its pretty devastating in pvp. I normally lose 30% of the time to melee though, if they get close enough to vats. 
---
What we really need is to reduce the damage you deal in pvp heavily. Right now everyone deals so much damage its easy to kill each other.  My brother has a instigating power fist. He can one shot me in power armor if I'm at max hp.
---
endgame content more accurately, was being hyperbolic. Players who haven't dedicated any time to countering a PvP encounter are suddenly expected to be able to fend off these unbalanced attacks. PvP related armor and weapon effects, camp destruction perks, zero meaningful reprecussion for destroying someone's camp; a player who sets out to grief is infinitely better off than the player who has to deal with it, one is a willing participant and one isn't. I find it hard to believe that they thought caps bounties in the hundreds would ever be enough to deter dedicated no-lifers from attacking people, and frankly the entire endgame is made for fucking with other people in a game series that isn't exactly loved for it's combat.
---
It does, if people would read the patch notes it states that they've separated the nuka girl costume into two separate pieces at the crafting bench.
---
I agree completely. Kind of like jungling in LoL.
---
Are you on console or PC? 
---
I'm on PC. I looted a supply drop last night. It wasn't locked and I didn't become wanted. Not sure why it was different for you.
---
Check the Plans tab and Underarmor tabs of my spreadsheet for a list of all things that can be learned by plan. It also contains a list of all things that can be learned by scrapping.
---
Is it cool if I'm not a super high level? I play semi-regularly and I'm lvl 81 right now. I don't drink much but I am 21+ 
---
I really do believe myself that these items are only going to be brought by the dupers 
---
I mostly stick to the nuka for that reason. Better damage, wider area, nice limb damage. I’ve taken out large groups of creature with them.
---
I do think it’s a shame about the Quantum ones. The blue nuke is cool looking. 
---
Yes, all the people who've been on the edge of their seats waiting for "brewing."
---
Yea it’s pretty disappointing 
---
Can we get more information on why you did this? This is fine though, take all the time needed.
---
The dirt adds flavor. 
---
Make sure you let your friends know about this. Trying to get at least 25 people on to do the giveaway
---
You are correct.  There is a cargo bot drop that occurs at the "random spawn' locations.
---
I spent about 5 hours yesterday cycling through random spawns (part of my 'what can you tame and when' research) and I saw one occur.  It is not one spawned by a player request.  There's also a downed vertibird, down satellite, etc. that all occur at random spawns.  I find the cut-the-wire nukes amusing.
---
They're mad there are people still enjoying this game. But yeah, it's absolutely ridiculous.
---
I had an opposite type of experience last night actually (on PS4)
---
Fissure prime was nuked, about 12-14 people showed up and I was probably the lowest at lvl 88. We beat on the SBQ for 30 minutes and the quest failed. She seemed to be taking no damage for a few minutes at a time with all of us wailing on her - a couple of orbital strikes directly on her and her health never went down. Then she would take damage normally it seemed for maybe 30 seconds or so and then back to taking no damage. This was rinse and repeat for 30 minutes.
---
 After the timer expired, she came back, still hostile and was still able to take damage (which I have never seen before - I have always been in groups that either killed her or didn't). We kept wailing on her and finally after another 15 minutes or so she finally died. The entire thing was a giant lag fest - lots of really low fps during the fight, very frustrating.
---
Her loot showed up on her corpse right away, but it took a good 15 minutes for it to all show in my inventory. Meat piles took 15 to 20 minutes to become lootable as well. Trying to loot flora in the zone took 10 to 15 seconds to loot. Even after I left the nuke zone and went back to camp, opening stash or crafting anything was laggy as hell. Got disconnected about 10 minutes after that, guess that particular server instance crashed.
---
Maybe it just depends on the server instance and what all is happening on it at the time?
---
Community never happy.
---
 "A mic is required to make sure you're not some thirsty dude trying to catfish us " Says the 45 year old man trying to find his next girlfriend in a video game.. hahahahha /jking 
---
Or am I ? I kid , I kid ... 
---
Lol I've seen you a couple times on my map within the last week or two
---
Wow... I think you said it way better than I could.
---
I'd be happy if the prestige levels added extra perk card slots, but only for certain cards -- things that have a passive effect like lockpicking, hacking, or cards like Good With Salt. So many card abilities end up going to waste.
---
You just can't launch in the area around vault 76 and the overseer's camp. I've launched from Charlie, and I don't recall any area of the map being off-limits besides that one, but I'm always needing violet flux so the queen gets it. 
---
I did make 20-some stable cobalt fluxes yesterday after someone nuked Morgantown, but I had two teammates (one with green thumb, one without) feeding me their raw flux. You just need pals who don't want it for themselves.
---
I've never seen Lake Eloise nuked. 
---
I've noticed that it's just how social media is.  I've been that douche bag, especially in the red dead reddit when I couldn't stand playing fallout 76 for all its issues.
---
Now I'm just pissed that game companies can pull the shit Bethesda did.
---
Other than that, it's become a decent game that could be extraordinary if it were treated with the respect it deserves by Bethesda and not fast tracked out the door writhing with bugs and encouraged to be broken by the company that then bans everyone who broke their game the way they encouraged.
---
Also stupid people, I'm one of them sonetimes though so consider this a hypocritical complaint.
---
Beyond ALL of that, humanity sucks, I just want to immerse myself in fallout to get away, and this is the first fallout I couldn't actually do that with.  At least not yet anyways and what's more I worry and even get anxiety that they'll just keep adding content without fixing what's already there basically 7 days to die style.
---
So much potential, so much bitterness, way salty, woah.  I just want a sweet experience, not to feel like I've taken over legitimate game tester jobs but had to pay to do so instead of getting paid.  Not how I imagined my dream job going.
---
Please delay it even more. I am not ready for a new wave of bugs and glitches.
---
Welcome to unregulated capitalism.
---
This is probably a better topic for r/Fallout but what made Fallout 1 and 2 so fun for me, is the characters. Like Frank Horrigan. 
---
The Characters and realism they put into it did made it fun too.
---
How close? I'm originally from Hurricane.
---
+1 I read the plan on my main before patch 6 and can't craft it either.
---
Why charging barrels?
---
Agreed. Take another week for all I care. Don't release it until you feel it's ready.
---
Understatement.  Strap in like you're in a rocket seat.  Cause there's gonna be a day when they target you...
---
And that day will not be okay in anyway.
---
Nice, really like the layout!
---
Related: have you ever looked into a portapotty in-game? The damn things are literally brimming with shit, almost overflowing to the top. The amount of detail that they put into the waste inside there is, uh... whoo. Yeah. It's a sloshed mixture of toilet paper and bio-waste. You just know some texture artist literally had to look at real images of that crap (pun intended) to get the texture just right.
---
I only drink boiling water and I'm waiting for Bethesda to patch the game where I can take on a "Scalded" condition where I can't taste anything for 2 hours.
---
Dupers definitely broke the economy, no doubt, but I think non duped rare items and sets should require a hefty price tag.  Imagine getting a full 3* cavalier assassin set through RNG.  I highly doubt you’d give that up for less than 25K and items, if you’d give it up at all.
---
In any event, I think you may have stumbled across something that was intended.  There are a few clans who’s mission is to eliminate the market for a particular item so that only their clan has them.  That’s raider as fuck, and definitely within the bounds of the game.  While they may have originally gathered wealth through duping, it does them no good now because it would make what they have worthless (think of the TSE handmade, which started at 10K easy, even when dupers had hundreds of copies...now it goes for 2K because there are hundreds of thousands of copies...or were prior to Bethesdas purge)
---
Ah, it disappears once you leave (least the current food does). Discovered it when I decided to eat some and it already was gone from my inventory (had done the quest a little before but had changed servers by then).
---
Thank you that was one part of the camp i’m most pleased with ! 
---
They *did encourage people to break their game, then banned them.*
---
Ugh, yeah those should just be passive. A lot of the crafting stuff should IMO. But I'd settle for getting them passively applied through Prestige.
---
lol end game.  alright well whatever.  no reasoning with some.
---
I'm encouraged by this.  It suggests to me that in a final qc sweep they found a bug they needed to fix and could fix quickly but needed an extra day to pull it off.  I would rather wait an extra day for the patch then get the patch then have another bit of downtime to fix a bug.
---
Yeah , And I am not hating on them players who are making out - I have seen a gun go for 10k and the  very next day someone bought same type of gun for 2.5K. Supply and demand is huge, and knowledge of what you have too .. but 100k is sic, caps do come cheap and I hope after the duping age,  prices can come down. I don't wanna have to create 15 character so I can store 25 K on each one so that I can one day buy a good set of armor ? 
---
This system should be re-visited once they get further into fixing the broken aspects of the game. 
---
The list of craftable foods and drinks is already enormous and awkward.  I should have more ways to sort this than food/drink or meat/plant.  At least we can winnow the list down to only available recipes with a button click.
---
Plz give this upvotes so bethesda can see this
---
Nice project, I hope you discover some interesting things at the conclusion.
---
I love the vault tec jumpsuit. I often wear it with a hard hat and carry a wrench to fix the disconnects and black screens. 
---
Id like to see them unbanned immediately. Then restricted to servers without the new content for a week every time new content drops for the first wave. 
---
Servers of dupers with their fellow cheaters, waiting like it's purgatory.
---
Yeah, I'd be happy with that. Having to card swap every time I do a repair or crafting gets gets really old really, really fast after a while. The card swapping UI isn't exactly smooth.
---
Passive card perks would be amazing.
---
Of course! One of my other regular teammates is around your level, the witch costume thing was her idea. After lvl 50 it's all pretty much the same anyway, only difference is I've had longer to grind for legendaries.
---
They haven't added anything to the shop for a week and a half, and the items on sale aren't coming back. Safe to say they're already making room for those sick 4 Horsemen PA skins and more. Looks like you're getting your wish OP
---
Thanks for the update, looking forward to this.
---
If it’s possible, I’d like to take you up on this offer.  GT is BenevolentDM and I haven’t been able to craft one thinking that I’ll get around to it eventually 
---
Insane if you will be able to pull it off. 
---
 Lmfao I'm on lvl 21 😂 this game is fun but challenging 
---
If you are on PC, I can craft you a full set of any power armor in the game and mod it anyway you'd like. If you have the materials, it will be very affordable. IGN: jchamlin
---
What level are you? Monongah Power Plant has no level restrictions so it can get tricky. You're lucky you didn't get the three scorchbeasts.
---
I think the Bethesda Fallout games have some great stuff, I just wish they didn't focus so much on the lulz side of Fallout and kept more of the dark and gritty tone.
---
Agreed more bang for buck needed, hopefully update this week brings new items to the shop
---
I just hope they keep on adding sick skins that I feel I got my money's worth
---
Im only playing if they force everyone to make a new character. Will be DOA otherwise.
---
70, I've almost got my core build. Made some mistakes leveling up. Helped with two nuke launches.
---
I heard that, so I tested it for myself. I’m satisfied with my testing, but I didn’t post a detailed write up of my methodology. I did of my slap damage testing, if you want to snoop my post history before you believe me ;)
---
I believe the flamer counts as a big gun, and there's a legendary flamer to be earned fRom the quest tracking unknowns
---
I have 4.3K atoms saved up. I \*want\* to spend them but there's nothing I can see worth spending them on. The only power armor skin I wanted was Blackbird but that was only up for a short period of time. They could make a mint just by flooding the shop with various skin colors and themes but they haven't.
---
okay so i compared and the loss of both first aid and feild surgeon will make it a bit harder to health gate, but if your not having a problem then its not really an issue, personally i would probobly at least run first aid 3 and swap in hacker when you need it. (i hate that response too trust me, hate swapping on the fy) but personally locked terminals feel VERY rare in 76
---
i dont extend that same opinion to lockpicking though, i would leave that at 3 as locked containers are pretty constant.
---
droping cannibal is fine, especially with the inclusion of thru hiker it should not be too much of an issue, fireproof was i guess more personal, as i love the % damage reductions but i understand the loss.
---
photosynthetic is a wasted perk though, healing factor will be better in every situation and not cost you perk points, so you could either swap it with something else (1 aqua girl / boy and 1 cannibal perhaps) or plain put those points elsewhere, but that sacrifices even more HP and thus survivability (as this build thrives on high hp and its interaction with stimpack % healing)
---
born survivor can stay at 1, as it really is only needed in case of emergency and the higher of a % it activates the more it would likely fight against its own cooldown and then NOT activate when you need it too (say you get droped to 30-50% at rank 3, it activates when you were fine or could have easily stim'd yourself, you then take way more damage a few seconds later and drop very low to around 10% and nothing happens because its on cooldown) its an emergency jetpack, i would leave it at rank one for those "oh s\*\*t" moments.
---
that frees you up a point as well.
---
like i said most of your changes are fine, but i would fit in first aid as that 45% bumps super stims to heal half your life instantly (around 200 HP with this build) and another 100% over a few seconds (400 hp) there are very few scenarios in this game where you will be taking the kind of damage that will be able to brute force its way past that amount of healing. 
---
and photosynthetic is wasted compared to healing factor.
---
after that your changes are fine!
---
im assuming notes are also delayed, could we get a rough guess on patch size so us with slower connections can plan ahead please?
---
on the plus side i can expand my house before the patch drops
---
I understand the capitalism but say your switching between characters to pay a 100k price you now switch to your last character after paying 75k and now they just leave the server leaving you down 75k with nothing to show for it
---
doubling the size of something already unwieldy isn't much of an issue when you can already shorten the list to available ingredients...
---
It’s actually easy to test SB with high-damage weapons. I did my testing with hunting rifles on a low-health VATS character, so it was pretty obvious the difference in damage done. 
---
I played since BETA and you certainly couldn't fast travel to a team mate's workshops back then. We used workshops all the time, and you had to be careful choosing who took the workshop. I can't rule out that it worked for one or two patches though.
---
what does it require?
---
I wouldn't say that TSE or Bloodied are overpowered so much as that a lot of weapons are underpowered.  
---
Fully agree that non-legendary explosives were the hardest hit in the TSE nerf.  At the minimum, they should be increasing demo weapon base damage by an amount that effectively makes up the difference in lost demolitions expert being reduced from +100% to +60%.   IE: If a grenade used to do 400 DMG pre-nerf with rank 3 demo, it should at least do the same 400 DMG with post-nerf rank 3 demo.
---
I really hope that's brand new legendary power armour with unique abilities and not just skins
---
I always loved the look of T45 but I liked using the Gannon Family Telsa Armor in New Vegas the most.
---
I agree with the 100k part but normally, at least in the past, and how I like to do rare items is, you trade me and item for this item and maybe one of us throws caps on top, usually the buyer but not always. Really rare stuff has value and it cant be matched by cap value, which is nothing, if they make you pay caps to get into high end loot raids maybe this would change the value of caps. Also on the guns going for different values, dont forget that there is private messaging. He could have shot an offer and then sent something behind the scenes so it looks like he got it for this but it was actually something else. Or, like you said, the guy selling for cheap didnt know the value or maybe he had stacks of them so he didnt care. Once the legendary vendor comes prices may fluctuate some, it's going to be interesting. Until then if it's too much just forget about it. Try with something not quite as good and trade up. More people are willing to trade high end gear if they get something in return versus just caps where they may not be able to get what they want. Make sense?
---
I don't get it....did the game improve since I started playing it?    
---
I'm enjoying it immensely.  The world map is top notch, the environmental storytelling is fantastic, etc... I'm not really finding anything wrong with it.  A few quirks here and there....sure...but other games also have quirks.  The one beef I have about it is the 'griefing' that sometimes occurs.  However, there are easy workarounds and Bethesda also stated they are working to tweak pacifist mode to address it.
---
If you were a fan of Fallout3/4 then I really don't see what the complaints are all about.   
---
heavy gunner does impact the flamer. stabilized allows for armor ignorance. one gun army also helps a good amount
---
I think they value a game the same way we evaluate any product.
---
Does it work as intended?
---
Does the price seem fair for what you're getting?
---
Is it a decently designed product or shoddy and barely functioning?  Did the creator put any 'love' into it basically?
---
Trying to rigidly evaluate it by numbers denies how most evaluate a product, by feeling.
---
100 hours should have 5 minutes of experiencing bugs ideally.  If you're at 1 hour of experienced bugs out of 100 hours of gameplay, and those bugs you didn't seek out, that does sound like a problem.  Ting is between building, items disappearing, menu issues, and the whole smorgasbord of bugs both technical and graphical, I would dock more than 66%.  This is an entertainment product that breaks immersion, fails to work as intended several times during one sitdown at least in some small parts, a few large parts (infinite loading symbol on loot, game crashes, server disconnects, infinite loading screens.)
---
It's like paying full price to see a marvel movie and instead you get the post production unfinished product with wires and cgi all still clearly showing it is a movie production and not a *movie that shows you a different universe*.
---
Man if you had to use them.  The amount of times I've had dysentery; my camp would look like the portolet row of an rock festival. 
---
All I can say is, incredible work. Cannot wait to see what happens when this is all said and done.
---
it definitely is worse for some than others, I have just got into the habit of checking everytime I join a server.  Annoying mostly, but I think they are looking into it.
---
 I find the sniper thing a bit boring. I can headshot out to a long way with my Western Revolver. My Instigating Lever Action has a dot sight as its so useful midrange. My Handmade carries a Short Night Vision scope as I find its good to the limits of the gun. A long one is just painful.
---
 The game before this one was Doom and its just great. I can play it on Nightmare but UV is more fun for this very old man. 
---
I even had myself a camp in the Toxic Valley to farm for Bleached Dogwood and bailed when I forgot I didn't have the pharmacist perk (didn't even have the card available).  
---
It's such a rare commodity I basically just waited out getting the large water purifier and haven't looked back.
---
Well, you did cheat.
---
*shrug*
---
After playing for months with the big where you lose your side arm when your equipped weapon breaks....I can deal with this.
---
Rather see this than another botched release, thanks.
---
Context. Context made them fun. There was nothing else like them at the time. 
---
it was dark, funny, gritty and black. The score... ohhhhh that wonderful discordant score. 
---
it was everything gaming should be... exciting and immersive. All that wonderful choice. The ability to "play as you wish", the get 75% of the way through the game and realize your stupid choices screwed you over in ways you never expected.
---
That was the first game where I felt I could create a character that was "my own". 
---
It absolutely doesn't. Without Class Freak: +33% damage to player, -25% damage to team. With Class Freak: +33% damage to player, -25% damage to team. If you're not on a team, who are you taking extra damage for? NO ONE, THAT'S WHO. Herd Mentality without Class Freak: +2 to all special when on team, -2 to all special when not on team. Herd Mentality with Class Freak: +2 to all special when on team, -2 to all special when not on team. Neither of these mutations have any upside for a solo player, and Class Freak does nothing at all to reduce negative effects.
---
So that's new. 
---
I want to be able to call one in, and let anyone get it who happens to be nearby. ... the way it used to be. 
---
Thanks everyone!
---
Thats how I found the tunnel going under road into Watoga, farming the trenches in the bog.  Good part about the tunnel, is no enemies except rad roaches as far as I have seen.  Don't have to worry about SB interrupting.
---
Dude... it's damn DARK. Seriously. Conman priests killing entire congregations with rat poison and lies? Pagan shrines and sacrifices? Drug addled suicides, and debt-slave whores? It's dark, if you pay attention and take it all in. 
---
You know what would be really cool? If we got some new soda grenades with this brewing update. 
---
You will notice if you work with multiple accounts enough that when someone is fast traveling to you or joining to you direct from menu screen that if you point where they will be standing (the load point for that area) they are already there but invisible for about 5-10 seconds while they are in loading screen. You are still vulnerable to elements and explosions etc even though for the loading/moving player all that is seen is a loading screen. So basically the game is still syncing up on your end, but for the server you are ready to go and standing idle.   
---
Just a sloppy sync issue.
---
If you're on PS4, and happen across another plan, please message me. It's the one thing i'll pay caps for. 
---
Building a car, and hookers.  'insert Tim the Toolman grunts'
---
Then don't play. Who cares.
---
Had enough of that from my dad, no thanks.
---
I mean, focusing on the problems is more important than backpatting, especially when it's not even a matter of tuning or balance, but literally making the game playable. My character has been been broke for almost 3 months now.
---
We found a dead civil war actor in the middle of the road that gave us all different plans. I got the civil war era suit. Sorry I can't remember where on the map it was. 
---
Haven't explored there much for some reason.  Thanks, I'll give it a look.  
---
 Not cheating is the fucking real world!
---
I’m unfortunately working today and won’t be home till around 8 pacific time.  If that’s too late then no worries 
---
You don't have to spend any money. Just do the daily, weekly, and character challenges. Sitting on 3300 atoms rn. I've spent just around there already, so maybe 6500 atoms?
---
I was just thinking about this: For the next title from the Studio, we should get a Release date and a date when the game will be finished :D
---
Sounds like Fallout 
---
I dunno… but I imagine the game is gonna be super weird on the day they are.
---
Agreed
---
Yo dawg, heard you like 76 so we made you level 76 in 76 so you can be more 76 whilst you play 76
---
Better to indulge online and in fantasy than to do so in real life...
---
Make a new account and repurchase the game. You can play again right away.
---
The drops always seem to be in the opposite direction of the quest i'm following. 
---
At this point, I've turned purified water into my cash crop.  After going through this mess where I kept thinking I needed to farm for junk, farm for metals, etc...  Water is the best bet for farming.  40 water can take me like an hour to make (or less if I take over a workshop with water farming) and lets me buy up an entire cap pool from a vendor.  That combined with the normal junk and scrap I already find, it's enough to push me through not bothering with any other workshop farming of any kind.  
---
If I workshop for uranium, silver, aluminum, gold, etc then I have to get acid as well, which just makes for more work when I can scrap stuff for silver, copper et al so much faster.
---
The only other workshops worth going after are the munitions factory for ammo or the power plants to get Fusion Cores, but I don't like having a target on my back at either location for people looking to take my workshops by other players.  
---
I doubt they are 'part of the community', just outside trolls who hate the idea that a game once absolutely slated for being terrible might be improving.
---
If I went back and remade another melee character I'd prioritize Martial Artist, incisor, blocker, and damage increase related perks. A lot of people shit on intelligence, but it's no coincidence players on this sub also complain about condition of weapons and repair costs. High level players like to forget how hard it is to maintain weapon condition early on. Intelligence is also a good thing early on because it increases your XP gain. 
---
The title was something like fallout 76 is so unrealistic ....and the poster pretty much was joking and made a joke about cats i forget the whole thing. The reason i put what i did was because the community manager looked at the post even though the title was negative which showed they were willing to see a negative post and not just browse over it which i respected. Even if the post turned out to be a joke either way.
---
I'm a FarCry stan, but I never even tried Primal. Didn't really look like a FarCry game. Nice try at a different kinda game, though.
---
I'm talking about over all we need better items so when I grind out atoms and spend them I'm getting somthing good
---
I’ll pop on then for you, will just double check the times. I think that’s 3am gmt. 
---
You on psn or xb1? 
---
 I get my own stuff. Its part of the game for me. The idea of paying some fool for crap that will eventually drop anyway seems just wrong.
---
 I don't depend on Legendaries, although I do use em'.
---
I totally agree with you on the 15 characters I myself only run 2 just like the majority of my friends so to me these prices are pricing out more than 50% of the normal 76 players 
---
I don't remember this ever being the case, and I almost always play on teams. However, we've stopped taking workshops for months, so it may have been something that worked and then stopped working somewhere along the way between patch 4-6.
---
By the time the 4 Horsemen will arrive in the atom store, i will be long-time bored of Fallout76. Don't get your hopes up too soon, they follow a strict schedule.
---
Heck yeah! 
---
I PERSONALLY think this is awesome. And I would think it can’t be that hard to get a couple skilled guys to launch those nukes! I’ve seen people do it in like 15 minutes! Can’t wait to read more about it!
---
I agree fortune finder and lead belly are pointless and your better off spending those perk points elsewhere. Honestly endurance is a garbage stay in general my character is lvl 45 and I’ve got 2 endurance. 
---
Also with carnivore, you get health benefits from preserved food as well. And you can still enjoy the stat benefits from vegetable foods even though they don't increase health. And soups and juices still go towards water. 
---
 My daughter has 3 in a box ... oh you mean ...
---
If I googled it correctly that sounds right.  Where about are you from if you don’t mind me asking?
---

Nuclear material is already in our environment, most of it is at very low concentrations, we mine it an concentrate it and in the process of using it make addition isotopes that shorter lived (from billions of years to hundreds to thousands).  Storing that waste in a geologically stable area is the preferred method due to it being economical. Sending it into space will not be economical for the forseeable future.  Ethics has never been the over riding concern for the vast majority of industry and likely never will be until our species develops a higher sense of ethics and concern with consequences beyond two or three generations.  I don't see that happening any time soon so painful consequences will continue to be endured.  I hope I am wrong, but I don't expect that I am.  I like how the game highlights these situations and gets some people to actually consider the implications.  Cheers.
---
I hope not. The servers have been more stable since the ban wave.
---
Update: I’ve successfully removed the disc by following the manual instructions.
---
Turns out my CD drive is definitely broken as it won’t accept anything now.
---
I’m going to purchase and DL FO76.
---
Does anyone know what I’m supposed to do successfully keep my save file and character, while deleting the physical game and downloading digital?
---
Does anything need to be removed or do I simply purchase, download and wait.
---
nice write up..and sorry about the lame turnout
---
ive only done sbq a couple times..its not that exciting to me
---
Join the club. I started with Doom. Then went to Doom II...
---
Actually, I started out getting eaten by a Grue. 
---
It’s kind of amazing how there’s so much like this in game if you take time to really explore 
---
PS4 .. why ? This happened last night. Just wanted to Share hahahah 
---
They are reportedly a source of rare weapon plans (someone told me they got Tomahawk plans from a drop) 
---
Yes there is a lot a lake Eloise I have nuked it just for that reason
---
I wish nobody showed up on mine every time I get half of the server show up and only 4 of us trying to kill the queen but obviously she is not going to die because of the buff she has
---
i went semi auto rifle.  its more efficient imo, semi auto with a hardened receiver lowers overshooting, and bullet waste.  and it procs luck of the draw more since (last i checked) the proc is based off trigger pull and not per shot.
---
You think there or Morgantowns better?  Which side of the lake is preferred,  thanks
---
Or a fireball. Like a giant molotov. 
---
I’m in the Uk, I can pop on then, that’s no problem at all. 
---
Well something good is subjective. There’s a lot of great things in the shop that i like.
---
But there has been mostly silly humorous stuff added. I would like to see more serious wasteland stuff.
---
So I get what your saying 
---
Pc/Xbox my dude. I would just give em to ya. I'm pretending to be a prize bot right now dropping meds/chems/plans/ammo to lower level people. Lol. 
---
You can sit in the Porta potty but you can't close the door while sitting.
---
I've yet to see a sniper I consider must-have in the game.  I've been busy with collecting caps to buy up plans to have too much thought put into it, but the base .50 cal seems nerfed in this game than in past titles, so I've largely avoided it.
---
I've spent most of my time and effort with the lever-action rifle.  While the damage isn't much different than the .50 cal, I like that I can get five rounds off in the span of one shot from the .50 cal.
---
Oh cool, that's my birthday. Yall prolly found a bad bug or some shit, it's okay, take your time.
---
I bought the game about a week ago, it's been pretty fun, very enjoyable
---
LMAO at people that think the 4 Horsemen will arrive any time soon.
---
Damn I'm off tomorrow and was hoping I could get some time in but better not to rush and spend the time before releasing it
---
Yeah right? I fucking hate that the release date is not the date when the game is finished and playable anymore. I tried to play again last week-end and stopped after several bugs that rolled back progress and would have forced me to stupidly repeat stuff. 
---
Shame to see it, but rather the patch comes out well tested and free(ish) of issues!
---
They have said the ability to join previous serve is something that is coming in a future patch 
---
Honestly, Cola Nut is way better with the Whitespring-exclusive colas, namely Nuka Grape and Nuka Dark. Grape is super useful if you either have mutations you don't want to get rid and rads you do or you want to heal and remove rads at the same time (technically isn't radaway) and Dark gives you 3 bonus strength instead of the usual 1, which can also be stacked with Party Boy/Girl, which means you can get a bonus 9 STRENGTH.
---
Deep lore right there. I'll keep an eye out for that story whilst exploring
---
I'll be home around 11 central time and can get you one if still needed at that time.
---
I am so down for helping with this. lucentshade on PSN. I'm only level 67 so I'll need a hand with the Silos but I'm in. 
---
Last night someone nuked the fissure by the miner statue and I kept an eye on it and can absolutely confirm the fissure closing time too. Happened at the same timing for me. 
---
Yeeeeeeees.
---
The question is how looooooow can you go???  -11 and falling!
---
You still play this game?
---
We will soon get out of Alpha state, just give the developers a little time /s
---
For some reason that got me thinking of the Oogie Boogie Song
---
_Snake and Spider Stew recipe coming in Wild Appalachia confirmed?_
---
FWIW a day ain't enuff time to fix anything. So I hope it ain't that...
---
Thanks Ill give it another chance
---
Ah, if accuracy affects your spread/shot deviation while aiming out of VATS that's very useful info...I assumed it just affected your VATs shooting. 
---
If I go back to level 1, I am likely not regrinding the game. It would take a VERY substantial benefit to reset a character back to level 1. Things like I don’t need to eat or drink, I get plus 5 on special levels, etc. if it’s a star by my name, no thank you. 
---
Because it would completely be invalid during PVP to wait for a long-delay weapon like the gatlings.
---
I don't know about that.  We'd probably get an option to sift through it like SB feces piles.
---
That would be lovely
---
It’s not that I’m not happy it’s that if it’s one day of work why couldn’t they have crammed that in. I’m curious as to what is it that delayed it 
---
it works and its fantastic for queen fights.  
---
it does not show the reduction with the perk card, but if you tag a mob it does take less shots in practice
---
Much more ?
---
Wait, how do you set a backup weapon?  I'm always going into pip boy to switch ranged/melee, it is very dangerous.  I'm on PC.
---
I had a bit of a play with gunfu yesterday- it did keep spinning me around to friendly robots whilst another ghoul was nearly within swinging distance but Ill get use to it.
---
No, it will only work once per 50 levels to benefit the new buyers, not the older players. In every game it's like that. We saw that from the time when they discounted the game like 50% only a few weeks after its release.
---
Thats what I figured must be the case
---
I see what you mean. I notice that quite often, when waiting for friends to join my server. Their character will appear and is interactable, but they themselves will remain stationary for 5-10 seconds, like you said. Bethesda needs to fix their synchronisation issues. It gets really annoying when you by chance spawn into a nuked server.
---
I didn't stick by, but revisited it last weekend. Didn't like it, had annoying bugs that rolled back progress, vital areas for my lvl 25 Quests that had lvl 50 enemies in it (because players were there before me) and everything got topped off by a server disconnect. Feels like an Alpha to me.    
---
That being said, I want to play the game, but I don't want to waste my time "trying" to play. I will dig it up again in a few months.  
---
there is no item called boiling water in the game...
---
 Yeah I cut my teeth on Doom. My son and I played the hell out of it. Then Quake and Multiplayer came out and that was so cool. Maybe 2000 deathmatchers in the whole world then, and I knew a lot of em'. We went on to Q3, still the best, and I was actually almost good at one time. ;) My daughter owned the fucking game. Blew our minds, my son and I. 
---
 She is a natural and dominated serious Q3 games and developed her fist kills for the huge HUMILIATION voice when she punched people to death. She would train a group into a place and Rocket the fuck out of em', then run and finish the lot. HUMILIATION went on and on. ;)
---
 The latest Doom is serious cake. ;) Looking forward to Eternal.
---
Do you guys do this often? I'm actually very interested in seeing stuff like this. And, also looking for a marsupial mutation serum, as well.
---
True. Grinding for legendaries sucks like crazy. Nevermind trying to get enough caps to afford mods for power armor. -_-
---
Thank you so much for taking the time to put it into an easier format! I like this, but based off where I'm at now, is it too late to do this build? 
---
*lol* Yes I've definitely noticed that blocking does nothing- the enemy has already well and truly landed its hit.
---
Thats a fair point.. perhaps Ill give it a shot on another character and see how it feels.
---
She is very broken at the moment. The rewards aren’t worth the resources, so no one goes any longer. We can only get so many Ultracite explosive vents and two star armor. 
---
Ok thanks:)
---
Wow, just got/completed this quest last night...hopefully did put me on a wanted list...what a stupid game mechanic.
---
its so fucking sad that you need to fear for your account just because you found something new. The state of this game.. unbelievable
---
we all know as much as you, and I doubt you will get more than one "prestige", just like the ones that hit level 50 after the patch will only get one...
---
that's how I got my first pvp kill, hardly a fair fight lmao but I was mad I lost my loot. I fucking waited for him to finish lockpicking it, not knowing it had changed lol
---
Yeah that's about how many I have also..don't even use them and stopped picking them up..
---
Or they probably mapped it to some general texture used elsewhere in the game and it conveniently fit their stock photo of waste.
---
I've not looked in the toilets, but odds are that texture is something else in the game as well and just colored to look like portapotty sludge.  I just built one in my camp the other day, I should go look inside.
---
Welcome to the internet fallout community*. I've never seen any other gaming community with people that will go way out of their way to spoil a games story. For a week before Fallout 4 came out spoilers were literally everywhere. Go to r/pics and BAM, spoilers are written into a corner of the picture. Go on to r/aww and a link redirects you to a page with the spoilers written huge on the page. It's truly baffling. 
---
Awesome advice, thank you :)
---
Is just 1 piece of dense armor enough or does it need to be across your full set?
---
Thank you very much
---
My gt is my name here btw. 
---
No problem!
---
My favorite thing about collecting flux in that area is that the ground is a mostly uniform brown and relatively free of tall grass, so all the flux pops right out at you.
---
Considering how frequently we have to eat and drink, I would fear those toilets if I had to use it all the time.
---
There's clearly toilet paper in there. Heh. I don't think it's re-used anywhere else. It's sludge.
---
I fortunately haven't had this happen to me whilst in pvp, but I can just imagine how frustrating it must be. Someone on the post mentioned that it's probably a sychronisation issue, where even though you are still loading in, the server thinks you're just standing idlely.
---
it notified you and the food gave an XP bonus and was just really good in general
---
This has been driving me crazy on XB1 it always shows up at the worst possible time 
---
I’ve been playing alone since beta. Might be fun to team up once in a while. 
---
Psn: Wunderkind1980
---
You can use the bloatfly version for food/extra selling fodder. It says a chance to spawn one on death and so far 9/10 times it works for me so you can just hit something kill it repeat and keep spawning bloatflies on top of each other lol you could use it to make more rifles for other people because honestly getting 10 glands without accidentally scraping them was the hardest part for me it’s a bit dumb but I like it lol
---
If people went as out of their way to spoil Fallout 4 before it came out then yeah...this doesn't seem that far fetched. 
---
It’s going to need to be fixed later.  I guarantee it 
---
Ah ok. I’ve not read all the patch notes 
---
Obviously, you didn't watch the video, and your points are so far off base you ought to feel embarrassed. The mechanics for taking over "owned" workshops changed dramatically for the worse. Watch the video and come back if you have something actually useful to add. 
---
Considering how flimsy some of the camp materials are, I'd rather avoid one SM coming in with a Fat Man and laying total waste to my shit when I may or may not have spare stuff to rebuild the whole thing over again.  I'd be less inclined to keep a camp period if a nuke-carrying SM could ruin it all.
---
Just dense in the chest piece.  Its the only piece that gets explosive resistance.  Padded is the lesser option if you can't find dense.
---
I'm glad to see that I've been vindicated for a previous heavily downvoted comment I'd made about this topic suggesting that rather than wasting resources on trying to close down all nine several times over, just to close 1 and see if it remains closed long enough for you to be able to complete the full set of closures.
---
Thanks for the update. Hopefully this puts the issue the bed.
---
Welcome to planet Earth!

Just how fast are you going through Stimpacks lad?  I have around 250 of them from looting - get the Pharma Farma perk and you'll never look back at meds/chems... oh... and Travelling Pharmacy...
---
You can’t make a new one in the Mistress hq? 
---
This I would be okay with as it's more of an encounter and one that I would enjoy.
---
OMG, you put it's ma'am on your house.  That's awesome.
---
I would really love if the progress you made at workshops carried over. 
---
I tried it didn't work unless I did something wrong  
---
Ah, well this is reassuring.
---
                                         /s
---
I would gladly take this as a workshop defense mission, especially over some of the ones where it's just hoards of a single kind of enemy over and over again.  I don't really want to kill 15 level 42 ghouls to defend a single workshop.
---
I loot everything so I usually end up bulking and selling off acid I wind up with so much of it. I get it from Abraxo boxes, coolant containers and fertilizer mostly. Find acid in your pipboy and then tag it for search. 
---
I genuinely wish I was on PS4 to join you, sounds like a blast! &lt;3
---
Apparently that changed with patch 6: There's no dependence on player count anymore, so the more players turn up, the better.
---
However it's now hard even with eight players, so most people can't be bothered to spend the ammo.
---
That's great advice, thank you. Will be nice to go back to not blowing myself up anymore *lol*
---
The game does do random supply drops you see a crashed cargo bot surrounded by enimies typically super mutants. If you kill the enimies then the crate is fair game. They are not intended to be supply drops though if you want to get technical due to the fact the game suggests the enimies that surround the create shot the cargo bot down lol.
---
That's... actually a really good suggestion. Being able to log in directly to the [Bethesda.net](https://Bethesda.net) account through our consoles/PC from inside the game without having to exit and then re-enter would be a really cool feature. Might even have an option for an in game forum system to post pictures and discussions.

FO 1/2 are still my favorite games. Don’t know how many times I‘ve saved my vault or my tribe. I played this games when i was a child. There were many things i did not understand at the age of 8 or 9. But it was fun. Still remember when i had to get down a ladder, but didn’t know how to do. Until i figured it out i got killed by a pack of Rad Scorpions. Or i just started exploring the map at lvl 1 - ended up at the top left corner at the mutants base. Got shredded on their first single turn. I think it‘s the freedom we have in these games. You can do whatever you want, but you have to deal with the consequences. And that Dark Humor - damn i laughed my ass off so many times. They‘re just great games and a part of my childhood. 
---
Sorry for my english, it‘s not my native language.
---
They aren't banned, they're suspended.
---
Perhaps they should be allowed back.....if all if their characters and related stashes are deleted. 
---
Jesus Christ, whose running Bethesda these days, some cold-hearted AI with a giant screen for a face?
---
this sounds super fun but i'm only level 45 
---
Unless I did something wrong I don't think so...
---
Nope. Didn't play Hardcore in Diablo II/III, either. Permadeath in any MMO is stupid.
---
I bought the pink paint for the armor in fo76. I’ve applied it to a helmet and leg armor, but can’t figure out which chest armor I can apply it too. Any tips? 
---
Hmm weird I figured there would be some mechanic to recreate one if you lost it. 
---
Shouldn't be weird if it's just another newb exiting the vault. 
---
I'm one of those people willing to spend cash in the Atoms store and other than some Atoms I bought in December for Christmas lights I wanted, I've yet to spend a dime. 
---
It's really hard to spend Atoms in the Atoms store, there is so little stuff I'm interested in. (And my camp budget is full, so no more Atoms store camp items for me.)
---
I use stealth in nuke zones. to level entire courtyards before I'm found. suppressor and sneak make it where most things die before I'm ever in jeopardy.
---
I only wear a hazmat suit in nuke zones. makes me a glass cannon but as long as i dont get spotted it doesnt matter and if i do i still can usually get away
---
Ikr. It was like that when I first played 76. But I noticed when o played with my cousin that when I got the loot he didnt. I didn't realize why till this post
---
For anyone wanting to "school" me on how public workshops operate, you're wasting our time.
---
WATCH THE VIDEO! 
---
All you commenters assuming I'm against PVP are so far off point it's ridiculous. It's almost as if you read a few lines without understanding a thing then filled in the blanks for yourselves. 
---
I was farming clipboards when I got the notification to loot a supply drop. I didn't call it in, but I went after it. I looted and left, I didn't get flagged. Half the time I find the supply drops empty. 
---
Crashed satellite happens semi-regularly in lake bed between New Gad and Summersville.

---
This sounds exactly like my own SBQ last night. Solo launched my second nuke ever and went down all geared up, and a single level 45 showed up (i am 94). Barely scratched the queens health bar. I’ve avoided reading all of these scorched earth posts wanting my first queen experience to be fresh, but it seems like I picked a bad time to finish. 
---
Could you please release patch notes as planned?
---
I'm hoping to be able to rock Gage's Eyepatch along with the Warhawk (which we know is in the Atomic Shop files).
---
Fair enough, better to get it right than release too early 
---
Right, agreed then. OP must ltp. 
---
I haven't played since increase will check it out
---
I'm 100% okay with waiting an extra day for QA purposes :)
---
Do what ya gotta do!
---
Fat Bastard ate your baby.....get in my belly!
---
Bethesda.net forum tell you the minute its released....
---
&gt; work why couldn’t they have crammed that in.
---
game devs be like 👀
---
You're saying stuff about ruining immersion, but there's no penalties for not sleeping, you have to eat like every hour in-game or more if you sprint regularly (who eats meals every hour, IRL?), stimpacks and food should not heal that quickly (if someone crits you in the leg, you limp, but only until you heal over all, no stimpacks are tied to limb damage), no one should ever really be able to know what their radiation levels are like outside of a PA suit, yet it's built into the health bar...  And there's workshops and resource gathering devices with predictable rates of delivery already baked into the game.
---
Immersion is what suits the player in so far as what they choose to acknowledge or ignore.  I'd gladly take counters and timers for restocking.  I sometimes luck out and get 2-3 hours in per session when my daughter is asleep before I go to bed.  I don't recall anything where I was or what I was doing on my last play session, because it could have been 2-5 days prior, easily.  My need for deep immersion is low and I'd gladly take some help.
---
Hello and good day! Thanks for keeping us up to date, will any issues regarding the Scorchbeast queen not taking damage be addressed on the 13th?
---
You right, i was assuming you meant an actual flown in drop with smoke, flares, and the whole nine yards. Didn’t think about the supply crash’s.
---
source ?
---
 The old one is a requirement, in the mats you need.

Chally is great man, but my man Grahm is a friendly face *(and voice)* welcoming a weary traveler.

This happened to me recently, I asked the same question and the responses advised that it is unusual (as in it doesn’t happen often) but not unheard of.  Sorry if that’s a little vague. 
---
*punches Flatwood monster*
---
Damn I’d be totally down for this is I was on the same platform 
---
Must have been reading a lot, not too far back huh?
---
Who said anything about what I do in the game?
---
High five for doing the only thing I really wanted, which was to tell me when the time-frame changed. It makes a world of difference for me, and I assume at least a few others, that you took the time to warn us.
---
still would be happy about an official answer!
---
Oh and more thirst!
---
Glad you are taking the time to polish the product before pushing out a release with problems. Some people get mad about delays. I usually interpret it instead as care being taken.
---
lol they started working on this dlc this morning and we're like fuck we don't have enough time.
---
is there someone I should call, a caretaker perhaps?  I'm worried about you, you probably shouldn't be living alone...
---
It happens about an hour after a nuke zone disappears. You'll probably notice glowing ghouls in other areas of whitesprings at the same time. 
---
Same. I’ll buy something if it’s needed for current goals.  But in no way am I spending 20k on a gun that isn’t really that good or has 1-2 good effects on it. 
---
BEGONE
---
That's all right, thanks for the response.
---
I thought either a) I missed some change in the spawn at whitesprings fixed/broken from a patch or b)I got extremely lucky
---
Yes, create a new character, never take it above level 5 and harass high level players. Follow them around, jabbing them with a combat knife, wearing only the vault party hat. Attack camps. That would be cool endgame stuff. Newb griefing.
---
Appreciate the heads up. Here's to hoping this update will be a change from the regular screwed up releases we've come to expect. 
---
Rofl supply crash that is good. You could even call it a supply hijack.
---
I'd rather have it arrive a bit late and be in good working order.
---
... I am now imagining them slowly driving by in a beat up 1979 camero, roughly spraypainted black because real paint costs money, staring at my house while wearing a wifebeater and smoking a cheap cigar, what might be booze or possibly vomit on their shirt, mouthing "you game is shit" before speeding off when I actually look at them.
---
... Thanks for that.
---
Because i want others to hate this game and stop playing it 
---
But PvP is *Optional*.
---
Unfortunately i had the problem before i took adrenal reaction too.
---
If they don't combine it with DNA from Superman and Lex Luthor then it won't become Nuclear Man and won't have the hots for Mariel Hemmingway.
---
Risks are minimal
---
Yes in fact all the ghouls I came across were glowing.
---
The whole time I was logged in, I did not notice a nuke zone at whitesprings so thought that was a little odd seeing so many bloated glowing ones.
---
That is interesting, thank you for the info.
---
Slightly disappointed that I have to work another week before setting up my own little moonshiner shack, but definitely glad to see advanced notice! 
---
Agree with the majority. Take your time, much rather have it done right than just on schedule. Thanks for the heads up. 
---
\+1 Amenity per tile.
---
Oh, youre a troll
---
Nice to know
---
It's a cool concept and all, but the one in FO76 would not take the stresses and would just fail or straight up not work at all.
---
Sounds like you just picked me up. Sell one to a player who doesn’t. I sell my nuka cola plans for 500 a piece cause it’s kinda easy but hard to get 
---
131
---
Mostly true, but currently any armor-reduction effects (such as Stabilized) doesn’t work on Energy resistance, which means it doesn’t work for Flamers :-/ 
---
I haven't seen it in the shop.
---
Never.  They chose their life of crime.  They can find another game to ruin.
---
So you point is that because something's already go against immersion, nothing matters? 
---
See, there's logical reasons why you have to do somethings, and not others. If we had to sleep, would it be because we get a penalties when we go without sleep? So, now we have to sleep, eat and drink? With eating and drinking, at least we can carry food with us.   
---
Immersion doesn't mean realistic. It means making a world that has rules to follow. Stimpacks are contains medicine that increases how fast you heal. That's the lore of the game. 
---
Radiation levels? This is a world where they tamed the atom, and was able to use atomic energy to power everyday items, like clocks. 
---
Just because you aren't into immersion, doesn't mean it shouldn't be considered. That's just thinking only your thoughts matter.   
---
If you can only play every few days, the vendors are always going to be reset in caps for you. 
---
Not trolling but how is that easy to remember?
---
Couple for each silo. Synced. With perfect timing. Dedicated and reliable. 
---
In a {quote} "softcore survival game" of 7 hours.
---
This is incredible and demanding, Sir, if you ask me) 
---
76, as in Fallout 76, surrounded by 1s
---
&gt;The worst part is these douches go on to say they haven't played in months lol!!
---
Nothing has happened in months so what is your point?
---
I'll play the game again when shit gets fixed.  There are still way too many balance issues.
---
You're too far.  It has a range, which I think should be visible on the map.  But I've tried the smoke grenade well within range and it works fine.
---
I agree. For the ammount of difficultly the event is, she should be dropping way better loot. 
---
The favorites list.  You can favorite specific weapons and other usable items from your inventory (I think the key for favoriting is Q) and then activate them with the number keys.
---
I wish there was a way to return the old trade menu with a Runescape-esque confirmation screen to allow for bartering of items with items. 
---
Eg I wanna grade my Bloodied Supersledge for your Explosive 44
---
there should be a window for that not just trust trading..
---
Never had any decent drop from sbq's, just useless gun plans and resource. Not worth the aggro. 
---
Remind me whats your ign
---
Because I'm still waiting for the bug fixes and rebalances that aren't coming.  And because I paid like $55 for this game.
---
Yep! The reddit/internet community is pretty shitty, the fallout community is pretty shitty but the 76 community? 90% of you are cunts.
---
I've fought the queen maybe twice since they screwed up adrenal reaction.  I used to fight her everyday basically.  Just not worth it now. 
---
Yes, I began seeing this starting about a week ago. Seems to happen when you find yourself in a sticky situation.
---
It is still logistically possible.
---
This happens to me on PC, but only when they're the same weapon.  I had two nearly identical one-star legendary rifles that I swap out depending on what I'm shooting (one is Zealot and one is Ghoul-Slaying), and every so often one will get de-favorited.
---
Mine too! 
---
113 55 15
---
Ahhhh ok, thank you!
---
Yes or no.....contact them and ask them. 
---
Oops, I just fed a troll.
---
I still get hate messages to this day simply for playing fallout 76. There is a portion of humanity that just fucking suck. 900 hours guy for reference.
---
What if we identify as females...... Asking for a friend. 
---
No absolutely not too late.
---
Many of the cards are way above your level, and there's probably not a way to actually make them 1:1 to levels so that you can hit 50 with all of them (I haven't checked).
---
You should have some general idea of what you want as you go, and pick stuff from that loadout that you can grab at the time. Nothing available? Grab something about weight reduction - I can recommend stuff like Thru-Hiker and Travelling Pharmacy.
---
After 50, you'll be still short a few cards, but you'll be VERY self-sufficient. You can go anywhere, do anything, and you'll level up FAST. Use those levels afterwards to flesh it out and play around.
---
Fallout 76 is (thankfully) not a min-max game (although that build kinda is hehe - enjoy destroying!) and is infinitely forgiving. You pretty much can't screw up as long as you have some sort of plan.
---
Let me know if you're on PC and ever need help levellling. Can definitely show you the spots :)
---
Totally BUT I swear to this day this has NEVER been a problem. People are usually really cool... or have been. It's always just a few randos that sour things.
---
Immersion matters, even if you don't care about it. 
---
Everything has to be a choice of how they balance the game to appeal to many people. A level of immersion, an ease of understanding, and still be a challenge to play. 
---
Also, Immersion doesn't mean realistic to our world. But to the world they established, with the rules they established. That's why stimpacks work the way they do. In that world, they contain medicine that works very fast in seconds, to heal you. 
---
Besides, if your only able to play every few days, then your vendors should always be full of fresh caps everytime you go to sell. 
---
It seems that I better knock on some mahogany because for the few weeks I've been playing I haven't had a single negative interaction with another player. 
---
I had the same thing happen in Watoga. All the bots on street and coming from the tubes all were legendary of various stars.  I assumed it was a spawn bug but hey. Walked away with 10-15 items. 
---
Ah just logged off!
---
do you have firewood?  You need that to turned water into boiling.
---
join me, i’m back - gonna stay for a while
---
Hurry, dupe a few hundred thousand of them sell them across dozens of mule accounts. Use the proceeds to buy god-builds, weapons, armor, ammo mutations for several characters.
---
Then bitch and moan when you get your account suspended.
---
I have an extra one, i'll give it to you
---
They didn't cram it in as that causes mistakes, and overtime that is not necessary. 
---
I’m off for the night now. Can I add you and maybe join another time?
---
You currently can’t wear armor with the hazmat suit, so chameleon mutation FTW! Plus the mutation saves you a spot for other armor enhancements.
---
Interested in adrenal reaction, grounded, healing factor, marsupial, scaly skin, and twisted muscles
---
Gatling guns are quite a hard one to spawn, I'd recommend spending the caps to buy the plan and make them yourself. 
---
I feel your pain. I really like building at workshops but it is infuriating to put all that time in and then just lose it all.
---
yeah sure, add me if u want.
---
Ditto- we are all excited for new content but tired of bugs and mistakes. Take the time!
---
No it’s not. Those weapons going for those prices are “naturally” incredibly rare. like literally one in a million. Ever played other MMO’s? Think of how much something like Windfury or Sulfuras would have gone for back in the early days of WoW, if it could have been sold. 
---
You just want the absolutely best weapon but you don’t think it should be valued accordingly. 
---
I think she still does. After patch 6, my friend and I duo the queen couple times. Either we are really excellent at what we are doing or she still scale with how many people are in the area. 
---
Awesome, thanks! I’ll add you when I’m back on :) 
---
I’m a professional counselor, and emergency room crisis worker.
---
You‘re welcome!
---
Short answer, no. 
---
No armor-reducing effects that I’m aware of work on Energy Resistance. You can verify for yourself with the Awareness perk. 
---
Lower levels are absolutely welcome. Being a high level myself I tend to bring the nasty enemies into any area I enter but as long as you can handle that (even if that means hiding somewhere safe) it's all good. And I love helping out on quests, I got the Platinum trophy two months after beta so for me it's fun to get to experience those quests anew with teammates.
---
Also, we tend to wear ritual bindings/masks soooo... any friend of our most beneficent Mothman is a friend of mine.
---
... What do you use the glands for? I don't recall seeing a recipe that needs them.
---
By my experience you can find plenty of Mothmen in the mountains of the Savage Divide outside of 'inhabited' areas..
---
As for the Flatwooods Monster, maybe try the very northern areas of the Mire like Abbie's bunker and/or where the Mire borders the Divide.
---
Both are mostly a thing of luck to catch, no guaranteed spans afaik.
---
Not sure if I should feel good or bad about this. On the one hand, they're taking the extra time to seemingly get it right. On the other hand, they can't stick to a schedule.
---
Very much prefer the former to the latter. Let's hope that the extra time means that there won't be game-breaking bugs like there have been pretty much every patch beforehand.
---
I got it from an event or workshop event/defence, same with Radaway and Psycho recipes
---
Duping ruined the economy. We need an entire gear reset.
---
The best items only have trade value. Players don't need 10k more caps to spend on nothing.
---
Just for that syringer barrel if I’m correct (might not be glands I can’t recall off hand but it is a bloatfly part for the barrel)
---
I know that but is it still a requirement if you try to use the fabrication system itself? 
---
What mods are you looking for? I don't wear PA unless I have to (SBQ mainly, and even then I prefer a hazmat suit), I've learned a bunch of plans.
---
To OP, if the nuke location is not decent, people will just avoid going now. We noticed this. Not saying OP is new but our observation is a lot of new player that drop the nuke directly on prime will have no one go to the location to fight the queen. 
---
We also talked in chat group regarding the nuke that drop on prime directly. 
---
Please drop the nuke southeast of the prime and just enough to include prime in the circle for the best result. 
---
I respect this decision despite the mad shit i talk. Mhm
---
Selling Salt, buy one get one for a cap!
---
Hm, I guess it's time to start investing my perk cards more wisely.
---
You sir - are correct , just not worth it
---
Honestly I still think that getting dirty water and thirst quencher is the end game way of getting water, you can just remove the rads with a decontamination arch anyway.
---
And honestly I think Herbivore is just as good as Carnivore, since berries are generally really common as well. 
---
Whew, gives me an extra day to move camp to VTU or around Morgantown. Can’t fast travel due to encumbrance so it’s going to be a hike.
---
Honestly, the first few levels are ruff but when you have the right perks and even a base level 45 handmade you will be destroying everything 
---
I didn't know Grahm had a side act!
---
Oh wow, I like that
---
Reminds me of the roarin' 20's! (2020's?)
---
So in short my gun is shite?
---
Are you on Xbox?
---
What kinda plans are we talking about here?
---
Happy cake day by the way. Or should I say “perfectly preserved pie day” 
---
You got it. Instigating Lever action. Add speed demon into the mix and youre loading rounds like an addicting rocks into a crack pipe. 
---
This is like the plot to a movie where in attempting to learn more we set off some sort of Uber / Mega Sierra Bravo. Like you guys couldn’t just leave curiosity alone, could you. You brought death to us all.
---
oh cool, i'll add you then! my psn is veeraprkl
---
If you can get a full set of Weightless armor with the Sentinel Affix on it and all of the gear does actually weigh 0. It should then let you have perma stealth and massive shield wall while standing still. In theory.
---
Yikes, sounds like night and day between you and OP.
---
That’s a really cool idea, though! Never thought of doing that 
---
I currently have 1500 gunpowder... 75 pounds! byebye!

OMG. YES. WTF 
---
inb4 OP is a neckbeard basement lurker with a voice changer 
---
Chally is a good Moo Moo.  Never kills over for anything.  Give him some green stuff.
---
Me! I’ve been really enjoying the game but the last couple of sessions have become a bit of a boring slog. I’m level 32 and I’m in the same boat. It’s even getting to the point where I can’t find all the materials I need to fix up stuff. I think teaming up may be the answer but not always possible. 
---
Welcome to ***unregulated*** capitalisim, where there is no law or rule or regulation to prevent people from "accidentally" doing just that. That might even be why they want 100k.
---
That said, now that duping is gone, the economy is swinging radically from "high supply and high demand" to "low supply and high demand." Under such circumstances, prices skyrocket to the point where only the super-rich can reliably purchase goods.
---
If it helps, even in unregulated capitalism, there will eventually be a market crash when they run out of %1 to sell to and start trying to undercut.
---
All that said, where are you seeing those prices? Your source might be shit. Consider posting in /r/fo76bazaar, I've seen mostly reasonable responses to requests there. Of course, if you're looking for the currant Meta-preferred Best in Slot, you might be SOL for now.
---
To any haters out there whining about a slight adjustment to the release of the new content:
---
Just be glad they don't have Cazadores in the game...yet.
---
There's a 4 person team limit for a reason. Name another console game that u can have 20+ ppl invited privately. I know 24 person hunter/hunted events sound cool but that was never intended. It would also be cool to get better legendary drops for 3*'s......it would be cool if we were allowed duping as much as we want......the game isnt gonna be what we want it to be, it is how it is
---
I’m camped out in the forest and I fed enemy attacks but low level so it’s more than manageable

Really? Cause you post here almost every day

It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed under Rule 5 and your post has been removed.

yess. thats my favorite too.

Tbh I might think the same if I read a post like this but the tell is that I want old ladies on the squad. A real neckbeard would only want virginal anime princesses with Snap or some shit.

Currently. They were talking about a bunch of bugfixes and balance chances coming to weapons, specifically energy and heavy weapons, very soon (maybe even the patch in a couple days).

Is it still the "loser in mom's basement" gamer stereotype if I'm the mom and don't have a basement? The world may never know...

Chill out you maniac. You're not dealing with your unwarranted rage very well. Getting too emotionally attached to your camp and the idea of not dieing is silly. there's very little drawbacks to dieing or repairing your camp.

Yeah I’m starting to think so, Gona try get an AA hunting rifle later and make a proper .50 cal rifle lol

I like playing w/out power armor but right now I run a mainly melee build and I find that I can't quite take enough hits in combat without it. Still tweaking my build and figuring out what works, ya know? 
---
Happened to me too. Looted a supply drop and "wanted 10" pops up bottom right . I check the map and saw 2 player level 100+ moving towards me. I stood there and wait for the inevitable. 
---
good point
---
I liked the hardened power armor from the original fallout.
---
I wouldn't mind visibility on the map so I don't waste caps checking them.  I mean owned workshops give visibility, why not do the same for vendors?
---
I'm switching immediately and only playing survival.
---
Stuff like that helps immersion for me.  My character would know better than I.
---
And people were wondering what that tube/wire on the vault suit was for...
---
that's just not very immersive of you. 
---
Thats not what a troll is or does just so you know

I believe the new quests are side quests, and the only prerequisite is visiting the speakeasy to get the quest.

Yes. the majority of it will be by the roadside and tracks to the east, and some to the north. If the blast radius doesnt get to the station and tracks it's pretty poor though.
---
So weird because i too came across this and had this exact thought too. Good post OP.
---
Yep, there's probably a bunch of different stuff that could drop right there, but the hood is definitely one of them.
---
I got another question though, I try lean away from hip fire accuracy when modding, am I wrong to?  
---
Thanks, good to know I didn't miss it! It doesn't seem like people post atom shop updates to the sub anymore 😢
---
Absolutely not, I just used that as an example, I personally lean away from hip fire as well!
---
Look it up, thats exactly what a troll does
---
So displaying what players own workshops isn't immersion breaking despite having no clear way of knowing who owns one without prior visits, but having characters remember how many caps they left vendors with from a prior visit IS immersion breaking?
---
Naw, your logic is weird.
---
PM’d you
---
hahahah .. good luck in your endeavor!! I love the idea of a Female Only Pack/ Gang roaming the wasteland Fing shit up.   
---
This is good to hear! Do you have a link to this, please? Thanks
---
Me too!!! I can't wait to pair it with the fringe or cream dress 😍😍
---
T60 every time
---
Thanks, forgive all the questions, my other character is a hammer wielding caveman who’s only worry is a bigger heavier weapon.
---
The corn turns into cobalt, with green thumb I was able to get 30 raw flux. Additionally, lots of violet, crimson, and yellowcake spawn in the area, with a bit of floresent flux as well.
---
Psn: Fubarchaeo
---
Level 77, rifle sneaky build. I play with my fiancee a lot but I am also looking for some lady friends to ravage the wastelands with. 
---
I go one handed because I can't stand it taking up screen space lol
---
While it’s true that SBQ may not be worth the effort, I still go every time and am rarely unsuccessful.  I feel I owe my fellow wastelanders to pitch in when I can.
---
How much can even be done in one day anyway? 
---
Ate you on pc
---
There is a fair amount of brain fungus in camp venture, in the building where you turn in technical data.
---
Hey,  just so you know,  this thing is getting out there, I follow all the Fallout pages on FB and there's a lot of chatter about your project
---
THIS is why you dont wait to fix bugs &amp; shit that is broken and bundle it up with a new content patch.  Everything that BGS broke 3 weeks ago in that patch should have been fixed PRIOR to this new content patch.  
---
But instead what we are going to get it a patch filled with new bugged content that is attempting to fix old bugged content at the same time....terrible, just terrible.
---
No worries at all, like I said tho, my information may be wrong, I am just basing it off my own experiences playing these creation engine games!
---
Thanks for letting us know!
---
It's because they are naive to the many bad things Bethesda is doing, but try so hard to believe that Todd Howard is God.
---
All sorts! I don't have one build style tbh.
---
I've made [churches](https://imgur.com/6fQ1KBM) in the Mire (inside [shot 1](https://imgur.com/80KCPg5) and [shot 2](https://imgur.com/viXWkuY), along with a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pLIos9gVrZ4&amp;list=PLQZ1OpHOj2mPitYTvozoF8JYbzz7cKWTe) for those that care), a home and workshop built through a [bus](https://imgur.com/Ohg32sX) in Cranberry Bog, a strange barn / house built in a [rocky outcrop](https://imgur.com/CL4v86I) around the Forrest. The others don't have a video but I'll probably do one when I have time.
---
My latest are a [lead mining camp](https://imgur.com/N0a8Cvh) and a giant [lookout tower](https://imgur.com/RLXSEK2) in the mountains.
---
Next is a small village in the mountains (again) and then I have a couple of intricate ones I want to make.
---
No, it's not. 
---
What's weird is people that can't remember if they visited any of SEVEN factions just 20 hours ago. 
---
Then complain on the internet that a video game is making their life have less quality because of this. 
---
I mean, of the two, I think I'm less weird. 
---
Thanks. I think i had already watched it a bit when it was posted. This guy must have amazing thumb stick precision moving skills. Really amazed this is done on console. But also, at what level can we have that much budget? I get there's not turrets.
---
I could go back and try and find it. But what I've done is follow the official Bethesda game account on here, and check it every other day or so to see if they have answered and questions like that. I also follow their twitter and check that ever few days. 
---
Yes, it's level 25 but you can re-craft it to 45
---
Or food could just last longer. No need to complicate what's obviously broken.
---
No problem. I happened to be nearby and decided to fast-travel to the edge of the blast radius to get a pic of the fireball and figured it wouldn't hurt to check out.
---
I guess the best places are Whitesprings, Fissure Prime, Morgantown and *occasionally* Monongah.
---
Huge mistake it is. I say, do not instance it and do not player booked it. Just let anyone loot supply drops with no 'wanted' penalty. However, if the person who summon the supply drop is not happy some lowbie looted the supply drop, he have a choice to kill him and be wanted..or not
---
But you shot them so by your own cribaby logic you are also a griefer.
---
I like this idea, a protectron DJ that details stuff like when events will start, what events are where, what factions have caps, and maybe even drop cool hints like where to find the alien blaster or what workshops give what and where (for new players), as well as other little things like Grahms current location or where specific random encounters are, bonus points if it's Rose that DJ's for some of the segments since she can see so much of the wasteland.  And maybe MODUS can hack himself in to detail where enclave events are and what fissure sites have activity around them (to help find/avoid scorched beasts).
---
Good idear!
---
I run in pacifist mode so when I get to the club house I ignore the turret fire since it doesn't harm me and I go wipe out the mobs...draw them to me, stand on the awning at the back window, one hit with death claw and get most of them before the turrets can tag them too. The mobs run toward me ducking the bullets! Its as if they prefer melee!
---
The other day I stayed close to the club after my first run and each time I heard the turrets go active I went in again and cleared. I don't know if this affected the CAMPer but I figure he has no right to complain if it did. He wasn't there as far as I could tell so not sure what the point was for him.
---
I don't think ask prices can make or break an economy. If they did, eBay wouldn't work. 
---
I’ve got a bloodied no explosive sorry. 
---
It's called fighting back you potato.
---
No worries, glad to see it happening
---
I got that stupid thing too.
---
I did everything, but in the end, nothing happened!  The quest was just there, no follow-up intructions (in the case, Rose should have talked and invited me to her place).
---
NOW
---
Here's what I did right this time:
---
I logged out and back in.
---
THEN, I dis NOT go to the computer before installing the device on the antenna.
---
What caused the problem was that I checked the damn computer before I installed the device.
---
You can also get on the White Springs busses once they are blown up by jumping over the driver side headlight.
---
There’s no way man, that’s a Big Mt staple 
---
THIS IS THE TYPE OF SHIT I WANT TO SEE!
---
After playing the BETA and seeing how rushed it was, I am absolutely in favor of you guys holding off on the release to improve on it.
---
With the drop?
---
I never had anything happen to me after doing one, what was supposed to happen to me lmao
---
With all the limitations and the bugs the game has, and while being aware that this is a spin-off game, an online fallout like this is something that I always wanted to have. I'm playing less and less games (nothing special, just losing the habit), but I always come back for more FO76, and the interactions I had with other unknown players have always been great. 
---
Push it back if you need to, delayed things are better than rushed
---
Sadly you ain't wrong.
---
I wish we could have our faction items that are hidden in the game. The only time I will say the enclave need more equipment that is faction specific because for me the Fan run Faction groups are really what has kept players interested...
---
lol I instantly thought of that wizard in Morrowind when reading the first couple sentences. respek
---
Oh! That has neen bugging me in the past few days. I was wondering...
---
Don't give them that idea. I absolutely loathed those bastards. 
---
Xbox is definitely not as bad as PC or ps4. Some persistent idiots who u can ignore and go about your day while a mosquito just keeps buzzing around using all your stimpaks, but nothing like what I've read on this post. I generally dont have a problem holding workshops for a couple hours unless it is the ammo factory. Can't blame ppl for needing ammo!lol
---
I called out of work tomorrow for this.  :(
---
Too bad you're actually right about this.I know why they do this, they have to sync the updates with the atom store.They don't care about you experiencing bugs, they have to update the game once with the new skins so they can sell. Really low...
---
No joke I sneak in my camp constantly just to avoid players coming along, I even try to not craft for too long so players don't see my dot just staying in one spot forever.
---
Ya I know which station lol, I was wondering if you knew about the actual suit's spawn location. But that's fine, I'll find it someday
---
They will once the patch is implemented on Wednesday
---
You can buy the plans at the white spring bunker and I would help but I am on XB1 and I sold mine because the armor is absolute garbage
---
Why respond to me?
---
It has happened yes.  Occasionally you will see Liberators as well.
---
Gives me one more day to get as far as I can in AC odyssey
---
If the patch is delayed then of course the notes are delayed...
---
No joke, I'd take a suicider over that, at least that guy can be stopped from detonating.
---
That or expect a crap ton more 'foundation' camps to crop up in response to this.
---
FYI you MUST craft the PA yourself to get credit for quest progression.  Possession of a suit crafted by someone else does not advance you.  I tried 😁
---
Lol right on I actually just fast traveled there for a quest👌
---
I'm on pitols and my secondary is a ski sword low level legendary i found somewhere.
---
New update= new wave of nerfs and bugs. Can't even be hyped about updates anymore since it will certainly break my character in some form or other.
---
I don’t think you can get those items at the moment. 
---
Grahm trap? Please elaborate....
---
Would someone loan me theirs so I can craft another?   Accidentally sold mine.   It's a great sword.  
---
Flamers are fun but the ammo is too hard to maintain. For every fuel ammo you make it only gives you 9 (with the ammo Smith perk). 9 fuel lasts about 5 seconds :(
---
If Bethesda adds a '0' to the end of the amount of fuel you can craft it would make the gun a lot more viable.
---
Still that is a really fun 5 seconds though....
---
Shit okay thanks. I crafted the armor but I got rid of them for weight savings when the stash limits where low. 
---
You can log in to any PS4 that is not your "Primary" or "Home" PS4 (I cannot remember the nomenclature) and download/play digital games that are in your library.  All accounts logged in to your "Primary" PS4 will also have access to your game library.  So if the game is purchased on your account, you can log in to your "Secondary" PS4 and play while another account is logged in to your "Primary" PS4 and playing at the same time. 
---
*It just works!*
---
&gt; another week
---
???
---
Too bad you couldn't delay the actual game until it was ready
---
While you think it is unfair to you, I also think it is unfair to other players who prestiged the correct way because they went through the grind multiple times from level one, which is an added challenge than simply gaining levels while already max level with all the perks and gear
---
&gt; Downvote away white knights...
---
You're getting downvoted for being an asshole, don't blame the white knights
---
That build is a level 25 character, but I’m out of budget. Next revision will use half walls for a thinner outer ring with a bulge in the center (more UFO like). The garden is inside the floating building on camp fires. I think I can get more budget with rug tricks instead of campfires. Or just wait for the proposed budget increase.
---
My workaround for finicky controls was a friend placing the doorway walls for me while I only rotated the foundations. He also ran along the top (marsupial) checking for gaps and helping me make small corrections. 
---
Really helps to have level ground so the foundations don’t pop up or down. On another character’s build I only managed a 1/4 circle.
---
I haven't noticed problems with .50 cal. I was in the forties using my level 25 one, then i found a level 35 furious that i continue to use at 50+. The mini gun is lackluster though in my opinion. The gat tho is dope. Even if it sucked (which it doesn't) it sounds like you're really bringing the noise and reloading once every other week is luxurious.
---
Well I’m only about a Lvl. 50, but I’ve never seen any trench coat that looks like the Stranger’s. There are fedoras and similar hats out the wazoo, and possibly some outfits that look similar, I’m thinking of the suits, like the patched suit or whatever it’s called, but I’m fairly certain there’s no trench coat in the game that you can wear. If you’re on PC you might be able to pull the Mysterious Stranger’s outfit out of the game files, but idk.
---
FYI not every attempt for women to organize is a cliche lesbian porn stereotype. Sorry to disappoint.
---
You get a lot of heavy weapon-related perks at higher levels. I use all the heavy gunner and heavy weapons perks and my gatling lasers and plasmas do just fine against Sierra bravos and anything else.
---
P.s. Did anyone else see "bravos" and get a GoT stiffy?
---
Yeah I agree that the TSE weapons are powerful but they are really the only good, regular ammo taking weapons in the game because a lot of the other legendary perks are horrible and regular guns are just plain garbage. I think the regular explosive weapons need to be buffed because I think that a mini nuke should 1 shot kill a level 68 super mutant.
---
Hence the reason I ended up giving up on FO76. I understand it is an "MMO" and there needs to be some kind of grinding or else everyone will be OP and that is fine. But they did not get even close to making a grind that is fun and feels like it is worth it, at least in my opinion. Making weapons takes an annoyingly long time, gathering supplies or caps takes an annoyingly long time.. and when in comparison to other FO games the grinding REALLY stands out in this game. Why? Because the other games dont have a forced grind, but a slow and steady pace or leveling up and you gaining access to new items, weapons, supplies, etc.
---
Oh I know it’s in the files https://fallout.gamepedia.com/Yellow_trench_coat_(Fallout_76) I was just wondering how to get it but thanks again
---
Oh lol.  It was an accident.  But how YOU doin?
---
This. I never read about the notes on this and saw the quest and went on over to get my loot as always. I thought it was odd it was locked, but it did not appear to have anyone around or tied to it by name. Imagine my surprise when I leave it and am suddenly wanted and then being hunted by someone that was just trying to get his supply drop. Of course there isn't a way to switch voice channels before he killed me and took way more junk than the 2 stims and ammo were worth.
---
I don't blame the guy; I did him dirty and he had a right to come after me. I blame Bethesda encouraging me to screw him over via a quest; tell me to do something and then punish me for it? I've been playing something else for a couple weeks now over the bad taste that left me with.
---
Thats why I tried summoning her...
---
Put a welcome mat down on floor or a table, put crop on it. I read about it in another thread. Need to test it now.
---
Vats works like aim-bot and with melee weapons you can basically teleport and hit the thing. I use vats and melee when I’m trying to save fusion cores on my jet pack when I need to kill a high up enemy.
---
Thank you so much.... ive spent over an hour up north with the crash virtibird and only got a stunted yao gui, but the first time i came to this spot i got a scorched megasloth. While i will miss chad, bruno is pretty awesome.
---
Glad I asked. I thought maybe you were upset because I thanked Bethesda 
---
I’m doin fine 
---
It used to work. I lent mine to a friend once. He just pressed the button with a full set on and it completed the quest and he got the PA Station plan. That was very early on, soon after release. I guess Bethesda must have patched that since then.
---
Huh ? This hasn’t happen to me. Has this been going on since the game started or since the last patch? 
---
I actually quit for about a month and a half but kept coming here. I originally came to see if the game was improving while I wasn't playing but stayed for the cool stories and pictures.
---
I started again two weeks ago and kind of wonder what the haters are talking about now. The game is stable and consistently improving every couple of weeks. 
---
Like what are you complaining about? They made burgers.
---
Things weigh more in the stash box because they no longer be idiot from the perks you are using on your character. Causing weapons, chems, and armor to weigh a lot more than in inventory
---
Bobby pins went back to 0.1lbs.
---
Thank you. I managed to get one from another player, but I'm going to keep checking there to see if I can find extras to help other players out.
---
Definitely not.  I love the transparency from BGS
---
Found this through a search as well - also Ryzen 7 2700x
---
I can usually walk around the outside of Charleston and get close to downtown, but when I look at or get close to Hornwright Industrial it almost always crashes.
---
Then when I load back into the game - the it crashes every time. Usually it's instantly, but sometimes the game fully loads and I have a chance to pull up the map and frantically attempt to fast travel to my CAMP. If I can, I'm able to play the game with no issues unless I go back to Charleston.
---
Ooo some people aren’t going to like you said that!
---
Lol
---
Hello kitty mod...
---
You need it in your life
---
&gt; it's primarily going to be people who built their character up in Adventure and are now just looking for a fight.
---
As opposed to people who build their character in survival mode and are just looking for a fight.   Because I'm sure that is what it would devolve into after a month or so  if everyone were required to make new characters for it. 
---
What's your Ign
---
Thank you. I found this place at like 2am after a long sesh and then completely forgot where I was. Been searching for it ever since, scant info anywhere about it. 
---
It’s like a screw-nanza bonus room, everything in one place and tons of screws 
---
You are good.  Everything is saved online so you will log back in right where you left off.  Nothing has to be removed.  If you want to free up space, you could delete the game data because it will be downloaded again with the rest of the digital game but this is not required.
---
Does this mean the CAMP budget might get a slight increase?
---
&gt;The buffed armor and melee weapons are worse.
---
Absolutely. 
---
Armor and melee have legendary effects too. I just used TSE as an example, but it's certainly not the only one. 
---
Oh snaps I forgot that comes out tomorrow!!
---
You picked up a second copy of the plans. If you need mods for your new Nuka Cola T-51b PA look me up. I can make all PA parts at max durability and do all PA mods (except X-01). IGN: jchamlin
---
I just need the clean park ranger uniform and Ranger PA paint to hit!
---
I'll take the Marine and toilet plans.  I'll be on in 15 mins
---
What levels were you at? I’m at 32 with no luck for either.
---
If I get an alert the only time I get wanted is if the cargo bot becomes hostile, like when I accidentally shot it while I was shooting enemies. Usually if it is not my drop I don't have to lock pick it, unless I do not get the message to retrieve the supply drop. I don't touch it if I don't get the message. 
---
Actually, you can just register an excavator that someone else has crafted, but you do need to have made it to the point where you log into the terminal and get the plans and the objective to craft the armor. After that you can just jump into your gifted excavator armor and register it. That completes the quest. I saw that someone missed the getting the excavator PA plans part and they are sol now. So be sure to get the plans, or it will not work.
---
I just did this last night. I had gotten to the building phase last week, but needed to collect additional mats. In the meantime some friends took me for my first WS nuke experience and a kind soul crafted and gifted me excavator PA for the occasion. I went back last night and wore it and just hit the register button. Quest completed. PA station plan downloaded and learned.
---
I'm the guy dressed up as Vault Boy, you can't miss me. Looking forward to making a deal!
---
i just wish i could see black PA paint again. It was out the first week of release, and i had no idea what would (or... wouldnt) be coming out. I figured there would be much more offered than there is. Ive sat on over 1800 since... just in case.
---
Huh I though that it was that I was putting the weapon away (long press square on ps) and it counted as equipping fists and forgot the other weapon I had equipped. Haven't tested it but I have been re-equipping everything regularly so haven't noticed any patterns. 
---
Imagine if you will,  that once long ago,  that you where the god of your own Wasteland, then one day Todd Howard throws you into the wastes and your no longer a god..  Your just a man like everyone else,  and instead of having it the best guns and armor you could found at location X, you have to grind them or worse yet buy them from other players in order to get and edge, heavy stuff man. 
---
They are part of a code to launch a nukr
---
Surely there's no shortage of your kind these days, pathetic inbred degenerates, just because you qualified for welfare that doesn't make you entitled to everything. 
---
Thanks. But, I was talking about the level of Jug. ;-)
---
I'm currently level 37 or 38. And I concerned about how much buget player vending will take. I fear one vending will be as much as a turret.
---
I spent the last few evening/nights building a nice a camp over the river just south of the dam. Then i wanted to changed the staircase on the other shore so it goes down in the river with a room for the safety of my generator. But in the end i had to rip everything in pieces and even after removing all i could, there was several part that could not be removed even though it was floating over the river.
---
Now i decided to build another camp further north in the toxic river. Each time i try to build something nice, i'm like pulling my hairs off while fighting with clunky system.
---
Hunters Hood please!!
---
&gt;The people who were the most toxic are most likely to stay. 
---
Which is why they should really be forced to play in survival mode, IMO.   I'm in the minority on this board probably, but I think adventure mode should have zero opportunities for griefing. 
---
If it were up to me, workshops wouldn't even be contestable in adventure mode.  If you need a workshop that badly, there's a server out there where it's available. If you don't need it that badly, then you are probably just a griefer. 
---
"It warns you that PVP is possible if you take the workshop!" 
---
Well, then it can stop warning you.  Ask if  you wanna pay the caps, then open it up.  Maybe increase the cost of claiming the shop if that makes you feel better. 
---
Someone clicks on the workshop work bench while you own it, they get a notice saying "you are not aligned with this settlement."
---
This is why I stopped playing Fallout 76 about 4 months ago because I was frustrated with the game and now looking on what is new I am glad I quit because it seems Bethesda has only fucked the game up even more.
---
You gotta buy the plans
---
R/no context 
---
I think there is a random drop sometimes, I could be wrong, but when another player requests a supply drop and you get to it and pick the lock it gives you warning message and if you still pick the lock you get wanted. The ones like that I have come across do not give me a message to get the supply drop. When I get the the message to get the supply drop I don't even have to pick the lock.
---
So, that’s it?
---
I was lucky enough to get a lot of different torso mods and ultracite calibrated shocks off SBQ and a few off normal SB. 
---
I think they should have the current camp system but also offer instanced locations to build a permanent camp/player base. It's frustrating having to repair camps and pack up and move all the time
---
I was level 12.
---
I’m off work today and tomorrow. I work late so I rarely get to play after work. 
---
Personally won’t be able to play the patch content for another week. Apologies if it came across as though I had some insider information. Heh. 
---
Not correct. I've never seen X01 plans for sale at any vendor. I have however seen (and purchased) an X01 jetpack mod from Modus in the bunker. 
---
There are no plans for the X-01. Have to buy the individual mods from the Enclave. 
---
It's pure RNG. The only place I've seen them was Modus.
---
Go to Watoga and farm the robots in their robot dispensers once you e completed the mission that makes them passive. Get you best melee weapon, touch the robodispenser, crouch, and spam your attack once they come out. Do it at night because there is a lot of legendaries at night for some reason.
---
Crazy question,  but are there specific plans to make deep pocketed if you already have the armor. Looking but have to found. I may be looking on the wrong place. 
---
I have server hopped alot. At least 200 times and still nothing. I know im looking there for the mod,but nothing yet. I know people sell it but i only have 1800 caps.
---
X01, because the future is now.
---
It’s not for me that’s for sure! Lol. But I will surely read it with the same enthusiasm as reading about it real life!!! I love reading about these things
---
Hmm, odd
---
Thanks for the reply, on my old character I noticed they just stayed passive although I assumed that was some bug since their health was red, I've also tried farming the monster mash event but I have no clue how people keep it going indefinitely, but thanks for the heads up
---
Regardless of whether or not closing all of the fissure sites and then killing the queen does anything *new* there was a clear uptick in nuke sites and player count on XB1 shortly after that thread. 
---
AND, if you're out there and listening Devs, this game could really use some end-game content that requires 8+ people to work together over an extended period of time to achieve... making the queen stronger, drop better items or other unique occurances could breath a lot of life into this game 
---
U kidding me, I found a whole torso level 50 with a jet pack lying around in a paper bag multiple times.
---
Try disabling Intel SpeedStep Technology from your bios.
---
It’s only 10 lbs, and it’s convenient when you’re over encumbered. 
---
Man I wish..truly I do. 
---
Legendary 1 star baron
---
So adding the mini nukes does not up the destructive level at all? Some dude with a bowie knife already fucks up my crops in the span of time it takes me to load in(but not really load in so it warps me back to my original spot so I cant save my tatos in time).
---
My desire is to make my camp more safe, not less so.... Im almost at the point after the 4th time my entire camp has been razed by pcs/npcs in the past week to leave everything in ruins and just use my camp as a fast travel point and nothing more which is a shame because its a creative outlet.
---
Pay attention to the players names around you, odds are you are just hopping back into the same server most of them time. If you leave server and then mess around in the atom shop for a minute or two, that usually puts you in a new server once you join again.
---
When you complete the mission, the robots just can no longer see you as you are always [hidden] when you are right in front of them.
---
0 for 2 on power armor posts. The plans for Excavator are given as part of the Miner Miracles quest. You are given the plans for X01 at the bunker. 
---
I sympathize for the cheaters and dupers. Paying upwards of 60 bucks for a half finished game and then being banned for exploiting pre-existing bugs.
---
I'm not tryna justify their behavior, but I hope they're unbanned eventually
---
Concentrated Fire 3 works with any ranged primary weapon. When you switch targeted shots from head-&gt;torso accuracy and damage resets. Damage is capped, probably at 30% and hits cap in just a few shots whether they land or not, so you can't do ridiculous damage with just it like in Fallout4.
---
Yeah, don't be like me in Wendigo cave and miss 3 shots with the endangerol syringer in a row and end up dead cause you can't stimpak during the reload animation.
---
Don't be that guy, like me...
---
Oops I meant the plans for the power armor station
---
I generally do the same and haven't had a problem with enemy NPCs coming into my CAMP, but there's also nothing in there they'd want anyway.  Like you say, they tend to go after the garden.
---
I have seen messages that say get the supply drop. There is no crashed cargo bot next to it, but all of them spawn enemies that I have seen. So either it was a random one or the player that called for it left the server. There have been times I watch it drop, don't have to pick the lock either. Other times I see it already on the ground no crashed cargo bot and there is loot. I have also seen supply drops without getting the message and they are locked or empty.

I gun bash to cancel the reload. It’s risky but at that point what have you got to lose. 
---
Dude I’m a professional edgy troll i do trolling for a living i know more than you and can be considered as an authority when it comes to trolling. You are wrong, what trolls do is they throw out b8 for idiots to take and get angry. What i did was not b8 i was serious i don’t want people playing this shit game. 
---
Yes Explosives especially are super weak I just want u/ladydevann to see this and pass it over to the team
---
Wow, this would be awesome. I got DC'd yesterday in the middle of a SBQ fight, would have loved to get back into the fight.
---
Um, I’ve noticed that a lot of these people are actually really nice. I get a lot of free stuff and advice from these people.
---
I don't think they are in the game as items you can wear, but your idea is amazing. 😁
---
Also nice username
---
Hey man get I get the sniper? SownDoughnut882, I'm just outside your build
---
Thänk you bröther
---
You seem to seriously misunderstand role-playing dude. There's a lot of things my character can do, or knows, that I don't.   And vice versa.  
---
There are also things my main character knows that my alt doesn't.
---
A timer for venders would be a great QOL feature.  It might be hard to implement and I wouldn't want to see them working on something like that as opposed to new content... But it would help people.
---
I usually do my selling when I'm about ready to quit playing for the night.  Since I don't have a set schedule to play and usually don't pay attention to the time when I do... Unless one of my alarms go off, or something, sometimes I forget when I sold things.
---
"I should remember!"
---
Maybe I should.  But since I take care of a family member with dementia, who was just diagnosed with cancer, making sure everything is alright with them takes priority, yanno?
---
And maybe the other dude just wants a timer so he can sell his crap... To which I have to say... So what?  Different people play different games in different ways.
---
Lol I did that to a radscorpion tail and the bugger used instant transmission and still was able to sting me even with a crippled tail. 
---
I had just finished killing SB and was reloading the dart and saw the tail stick up.  Hit it and realized it wasn’t the right play. 
---
Wanted those back in fallout 4, their mounting options are super handy, and they looked great in Vault 88 via mod. 
---
No the crafting is actually an upgrade. It consumes the lower level sword and replaces it with the higher level. 
---
I cant fucking wait! I love this game, and spent a fuck load of hours grinding to get my level up. I'm super stoked they're dropping new content for it and will leave my PS4 on rest mode so it can update thru the night. 
---
If anyone wants to team up my PSN handle is: the_dabman710
---
They never leave my stash... Literally looked at each item, marked down weight and quantity 
---
Not like my stimpaks that are 1.00 in stash or 0.1 on me. 
---
Stash only has junk, apparel, and grenades. Bethesdas math is just fucked
---
That's what I thought. Is this intended to not work or is it a bug?  Has this been confirmed anywhere? I can't find any official answers. 
---
I have the deep pocketed combat armor limbs plan. Unfortunately someone already offered to buy. But yes there are deep pocket limbs and a deep pocket chest plan.
---
Thanks for the heads up, appreciate it
---
I may try that in a bit. Thanks for the advise. If you know anyone thay wants to sell it I'll buy it,though I know people overprice it for how rare it is.
---
You seem to be really getting overly emotional. 
---
I'm stepping away from this conversation, and you can keep going at it.
---
I'm pretty sure this isn't something they are going to put in the game. So no real reason for me to debate someone that I don't feel is being very reasonable. 
---
I might saw some in Atom Shop leaks
---
AH! Yes, right away
---
Yeah, I ran into a few of them over the weekend. Had to hide in the trenches and get my health back up at first...
---
Goodluck folks.
---
I hope if there's one thing Bethesda as a whole took from this game it's that delaying to make things right is a necessity.
---
Either this or the guy with the keys to the server cabinet called out sick. 
---
Hello. The jet pack is sold and can only be bought at the military wing vendor at the enclave bunker. Not any other wing in the bunker. Every server hop, just need to check the military wing vendor. You will get it eventually. I just sold a jet pack to a customer last night. So it is not impossible to find. Good luck!
---
No like a place besides players
---
Thanks.  I guess I already knew the Marine plans.  
---
I was finally able to test the combination of Revenant, Mysterious Savior and 1 piece of Life Saving armor. I can confirm that it almost always results in a rez along with a 50% damage buff that lasts 2 minutes. Since your build involves doing increased damage at low health, it could serve as a nice synergy/insurance policy. 
---
I straight up don't use Stimpaks, I just wreck face at low health 'til I die, then pop back up in beast mode. I'd be curious what kind of numbers you could do with this factored in. Dig your work, figured I'd share this!
---
I wish I encountered Graham more often. Only twice in 350 hours. Does he ever come to the Mire or Bog?
---
Screw the downvoters, that made me laugh. 😂
---
Thanks for putting together a spot where i can grief those not wanting to be griefed. /s
---
Thank you, left some screws behind for you too
---
All well and good. Thank you for the table plan!
---
That happened to me too. It's bullshit, especially since *steal* isn't red any more. Also, there are containers that you can steal from but no wanted level (at the robot farm). It makes no sense. What gets even more confusing is that yesterday I called an airdrop and watched some player take the crap I didn't want out, but they didn't get a wanted level. This game needs to explain shit to me.
---
Np
---
The 26 screws are the best part tbh
---
Could be, you never know.
---
Got it, thank you :D
---
The in game place would physically not allow players to be harmed by other players.
---
Um, okay, lol.
---
Not emotional at all.  Just saying some of your reasoning throughout this thread is... Well, poor? And if you noticed, I even said I'm not sure it's something that can and will do. But... Sit on that high giddy-up buttercup, I suppose.
---
Really? What percentage? I thought mouse &amp; keyboard was better for FPS games -- can turn faster with a mouse than a stick.
---
RAIDER!!!!
---
Please, take your time with this release to ensure it's as bug-free as possible.  I'm sure 99% of the folks here will agree.  Quality &gt; quantity, always.
---
Yeah, I use that, but I'd rather not have to go into the pip-boy first.
---
Thats entertainment in the wasteland 
---
Thank you very much :D
---
I would probably just log out and log back in, it might undo one or two of your most recently completed stages of the quest but it’s better than not being able to complete it at all
---
Yeah. That's how I play too. Have given away 3 or 4 legendaries already today. 
---
Honestly once survival mode drops with full PVP, Chameleon VATS will become the meta, because only the first shot matters, a banked Critical hits anything VATS can target, even if its 0% accuracy.
---
its way more fun then melee or aiming down sights, because you can do ridiculous crap they can't do, like use nearly any ranged weapon of any level that can be modified for improved critical with zero perks and still have fun.
---
i currently run around with random pile of 20 1-3\* weapons, quad double barrel, furious assault rifle, executioners western revolver, etc.
---
Server hop the Grafton vendors. The station vendor as well as the one inside the city but the bot inside the city seems to have better spawn chance.
---
You're doing the Lord's work, friend. 
---
Oh, so you want me to get angry so your trolling works
---
Well that's gonna be tough
---
That’s no Mole Miner, that’s Sonic the Hedgehog!
---
It's why you can aim at the same spot manually and have the round land in different spots around the center of where you're aiming, if your accuracy is only 40 or 50 what have you. If anyone has played World of Tanks it's the same concept. It's an EZ mode way to simulate "realistic" shooting.
---
Lol i like that
---
Can we get a "DUH"?
