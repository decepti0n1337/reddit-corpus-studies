Nearly the entirety of the studio was focused on 76 prior to launch as needed. Problems CLEARLY arose. They had to release. And we lived angrily ever after. Who knows who‚Äôs really upset about how it came out and the ridicule and misplaced hatred bgs recieved? Bgs. Could‚Äôve been anthem ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they‚Äôve got tons of content and patches coming all the ti... oh wait. It‚Äôs an unfortunate serious of events that lead us here and that‚Äôs all. Nobody wanted it like this. Belittling or lying about them as they try to improve something helps nothing.

Thats good news then! I transition to a rifle main with little explosive and its great fun. Most of my nades and such are free pickups but i use nuka nades when im punching above my weight.
---
Yeah if other people love it that‚Äôs great. If it‚Äôs not something I want to do I just won‚Äôt. I‚Äôm not saying it won‚Äôt be good just that if it‚Äôs BR like we think I‚Äôll be ‚Äúmeh‚Äù about it. I know other content will still appeal to me.  Saying I‚Äôm not necessarily interested in something isn‚Äôt complaining. I love this game.
---
 I really hope BSG can figure out PVP.  I'm tired of having to deal with PVP crap in Adventure.  I want to fight legendary enemies not OP asshats with duped gear.
---
Would be nice to actually playthe game longer than a minute at a time..
---
Absolutely. I feel like the game isnt refined enough for a successful BR. I'll probably try it once or twice and like you said just be 'meh'and over it back to waiting for the next dlc. 
---

---
As it is now I'm on a hiatus until we get some new content.
---
Those silly posters.
---
they're already in the game
---
That is most likely because the apes who programmed the viewmodel programmed it to send the bullets from the gun's actual barrel instead of the center of the screen where your crosshair is like with most other FPS games as well as VATS. So if you go up close to an enemy and stick the barrel through their model the game can't tell what the fuck is going on because by all logic the bullets should be hitting the enemy but aren't. 
---
Doubt they're ever going to fix that since it would mean re-doing the viewmodels from the ground up most likely and who the fuck knows if bethesda austin even has any control over it since it might be old code lifted from FO4 and those devs had nothing to do with FO76 despite what todd wants you to believe.

Yay. BR!

What? The girls are girls
---
I feel you. I‚Äôm just grinding legendaries and hitting up the purveyor. Checking player vending machines had been my biggest time sink lol
---
Fair point about needing to opt in.
---
Could be. But i think its more having my camp near a popular = crowded area of spots and like i said since shops were implemented i kept more attention to names or their camps.
---
Funny thing is - it adds a sort of a "home" feeling if i end a with a neighbour which i recon from another day. lol
---
I'm curious how you know that the majority of players are PvE exclusive.
---
Theres colored lines on the ground that lead you in the direction of each area....A is blue...B is white i think....theyre labled. Sounds stupid but it does help...especially when ur in a hurry

If anything the outrage is that the game is still super buggy and unpolished and they‚Äôre adding low demand modes that will introduce more bugs to the game.

- Swapping ironclad for Fire Proof and Sunkissed (at least 1, I like 2) the day time rad-removal is such a huge lazy QOL item for me.  With Healing Factor plus Sun Kissed, what you need to keep for aids is so minimal.
---
 - See if you can find a place for at least 1 point in Tenderizer (Charisma). Since you‚Äôre swinging smaller weapons, that‚Äôs a good damage add (not as important for the one-hit kill things, but for knife or sword dudes, handy)
---
 - Of of the nice things about unyielding is the STR boost. You can do a few things to mitigate that - consider enough points for Professional Drinker ... Whiskey will give +6 STR in this case.
---
They are piece specific really frustrating
---
Read this in the order of mysteries gals voice
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind if they did a few different things for the various models. Like don‚Äôt give the AR a straight damage buff, give it something like Armor Pen (which is really a damage buff, but will feel different)

If they manage a Fallout MMO that has PVE, PVP and BR modes all on the same place and you can move your characters ... that‚Äôd be a pretty decent accomplishment.

And the crazy thing is, as bad as the assault rifle is, it's *still* better than the laser rifle....FML

If you have a question about something, please put the question **in the title**. Reddit does not make it possible to edit titles, so you will have to post again with a LONGER, MORE DESCRIPTIVE TITLE. Once again, MAKE A TITLE WHICH IS LONGER AND MORE DESCRIPTIVE.

Bethesda‚Äôs best move is to pull an Apple-2019 iTunes-death keynote. 
---
A brief/humerous mea-culpa and then show us all in feature &amp; content bullet points. 
---
I‚Äôd also like to note that all of the Besthesda games except fallout 76 had free &amp; specifically E3 content releases including fallout 4. 
---
_(Atom shop discounts under the guise of leaving the shop don‚Äôt count - that‚Äôs just marketplace entropy)_
---
So I‚Äôm really hoping their holding back for the big day.
---
There has to be some form of group raids, of course. But overall playing in a group takes away from the world and lore exploration, unlike in any other MMO where those things are non-existent anyway.
---
After the announcement of the improved combat patch, i think its time for more radio stations. Maybe some quest related npc.maybe
---
I gave you a up to counter the haters.

That's hilarious, love it!

It's all completely random you can get badges from either the camp counselor ending or the bug wave ending I did this event the other day and all I got was caps but a friend of mine earned a badge another spot to try your luck for a badge would be at the kiddie corner cabins in the toxic valley to clean up the toxic waste very easy quest to do and that will also give you a chance at earning a badge and also try doing the scout leaders quest in dolly sods collecting all those bug pieces he may give you a badge as well if they don't just server hop and keep trying
---
E3
---
Ah yes. Good ol' Rust. That game has most of what you are looking for. Except you get to see what people are really like when you take the guardrails off of the game. 
---
If you're interested in it, I recommend watching Rcham, the YouTuber. He builds trap bases and makes people kill themselves and each other, like the "Saw" series.

Fallout is WAY more vanilla. I like vanilla.

I get them very very rarely from all of the things.

Because leather will increase your energy resist, and you don‚Äôt really need that. If you run mutations and you aren‚Äôt using energy weapons, Grounded gets you 100 right there.

---
What platform and can you DM me your secrets for not encountering endless errors when placing.
---
Skill = mechanical skill, as I'm your ability to aim and it's the same in every shooter.  I thought this is what you meant by the game is "extremely skill based" but using your definition turn based games like Civilization could be considered "extremely skill based".  
---
&gt; A game where you must move smartly because enemies have an aim bot is skill based.  Its different skill than typical FPS and if you approach this game like a typical FPS you are doomed to fail.
---
While understanding proper positioning is a "skill" in this context we would say proper positioning is important.  Similarly, perk and SPECIAL point allocation is important and while there is "skill" involved in making a suitable build in this context we would say character build is important.  Yes positioning, character build, communication/teamwork, map knowledge, and understanding game mechanics are all "skills" but you just call them what they are.  In overwatch some heroes require a lot of skill(widowmaker) and others rely more of positioning and teamwork(Reinhardt, Mercy).
---
&gt; I suppose that if you put top tier FPS players and gave them all the gear they wanted I'd still shred them easy, for a short period of two to three weeks tops. Afterwards they would git gud and would probably shred me.
---
That's not what I was saying at all.  I said take people with extremely high levels of skill and force them to play survival with only gear that can be crafted, as in no legendarie effects.  They can use all max level stuff, can use whatever type of armor or weapon and can mod them however they want, just no legendary effects. I'm confident that in these circumstances the players with extremely high skill but basic gear wouldnt stand a chance.  Also, not that it matters, if they were similarly geared they would be beating you and 99.9% of players in a matter of hours not weeks.
---
My point originally is that the PvP is centered around the gear.  Yeah you need to build your character around it, understand the game's mechanics, and position yourself to not be an easy target for the enemy but gear off the market subs/Ebay is required before any of the above really matters.  The google doc you link to has multuple columns dedicated to the very specific legendary effects a particular build's armor requires.
---
A not so great analogy: its entirely possible to know how to skate and suck at hockey, however, if you practice stick handling, are in great shape, know all the rules, and have a deep understanding of proper positioning you wont be able to play hockey unless you can skate.  Its entirely possible to have the proper market sub gear and suck at fo76 PvP, however, if you choose the right perks, know the map like the back of your hand, always have great positioning, and communicate well with your teammates you wont stand a chance at fo76 PvP without proper market sub gear.
---
I wouldn't put it past Bethesda to use them for future content updates. As of right now though, there's nothing behind the doors, unfortunately.
---
True. But as a general rule, single player &gt; multiplayer &gt; BR. Similarly, games with consensual PvP are almost always &gt; games with non-consensual PvP. And when a game that started as non-consensual suddenly switches to consensual, its population tends to grow. Ultima Online being an excellent example, it went from a dying game in '99 to biggest subscription MMO in 2003, before WoW unseated it in late '04 early '05.
---
I'm not denying there's fans of BR. I just don't think what FO76 would offer with its BR that other games, dedicated 100% to BR, don't already do and significantly better. And splitting already tiny FO76 player base by modes can't be very healthy for the game either.
---
Indeed, I do. GT: PlayAsMask
---
There is also a perk card believe it to be "batteries included" that double the life of your cores.
---
In my hvy wepaons/pa build it would give me 500 shots of ammo for my 100 cores. If I crafted them ( 15 int at the time I go a core with 115 durability) witch gave me 640 shots. This was also 2 patches ago. But. Try it out yourself. It worked for both plasma cores and fusion cores.
---
r/FO76FC is also a toxic rad hole.
---
the broadsider
---
Great, I'm always glad to see people willing to try something before shitting all over it, which is atypical of people that *only* want PvE content. 
---
I think you'd be surprised by how many people are interested in PvP. Survival is a ghost town because of some design decisions, not because PvP in Fallout doesn't interest anyone. Threads about improving Survival often do quite well, and I see people talking about how to improve PvP in twitch chats all the time. I don't think it's strictly about bringing in new players, but adding value to the game through different uses of the sandbox.
---
There are a lot of different kinds of players out there, and hybrid players that enjoy PvE and PvP content is increasing all the time as people play more games and widen their interests. But in my experience, people that put their foot down and demand PvE content above all else are very vocal, resulting in things looking a bit more lopsided than they actually are. I mean, clearly Fallout has PvE roots, and it makes sense that a majority of the playerbase wants more PvE. But people that want it all do exist, often beneath piles of downvotes from people that hate the idea of expanding the experience beyond what they're personally comfortable with.
---
This. Why are all of the scorched mods (not legendaries) crap? It's so tedious to make and use anti scorched equipment, plus there's limited payout
---
I‚Äôve had better badge drop from sting wings and things and the toxic clean up, I‚Äôve only got one from camp fire tales and about 12 from the others.
---
He's talking about the one's you could perform using melee though: *"I meant at least moves against humans could be used on scorched and ghouls."*
---
You could use the power attack button to perform special execution animations and some other stuff. Even with ranged weapons, you could kill the oponent with a bash and get a special animation, I did it with pistols all the time.
---
It was really cool and it actually added dept to the game (ever seen a Fallout 4 companion kicking or grabbing someone and stuff like that? YOU could do it too! Iirc bashing right before getting bashed) but it only worked against humans.
---
There would probably be problems because enemies are a server thing (unless they die and ragdoll) or something like that.
---
Which is a shame because they were actually pretty cool and would make the game more fun. And well, Deathclaws were way more dangerous too thanks to those.
---
Which one was it, New Vegas I believe? You upgrade your unarmed or melee for different attacks every 10 points you put into it. I thought that made it interesting, having different attacks to use, though it was kind of clunky since it depended on which way you put the stick before attacking. I wish there was a system similar to this implemented with fo4 and fo76, would definitely have spiced things up a bit!
---
Yeah that is a great run at it. Smart.
---
I don‚Äôt want to do Survival myself-  it just isn‚Äôt enjoyable to me, people standing around train stations waiting to kill people who spawn there. I love how Adventure mode is going, keep to myself mostly; and when I visit someone‚Äôs camp they are generally lovely. My kind of game
---
I never said it wasn‚Äôt an option. I think that if your primary reason for getting a five-piece set of unyielding is so you can get +15 Charisma so you can sell to vendors for more caps, then that‚Äôs not a great reason. 
---
YMMV.
---
What do we want from new PvE modes though? More challenge? Unless the new mode expanded the map or adds private/modded servers I feel like we only have room for like one more PvE server. Like a mode where there‚Äôs more rad storms, or harder enemies, or death claw hordes. Imo though they could fit that all into a new ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù server. Whose challenge changes every month or so for new rewards. If they put something like that out there this early though there‚Äôs not a ton of chances to expanded on other new PvE servers.
---
who pissed in your ass?
---
Haha same here
---
Missed opportunity to call it "Raider Royal".

More than decent. It's very impressive for a first go at the whole online thing.

I hope that their ambition doesn't drown them, because it'll be extremely cool if they can pull it off.
---
Logging on.
---
Where's the update
---
They Won't Have to Worry About Hurting Anyone too since the Fatman Currently Doesn't Do any damage in Fallout 76!.   win/win for everyone!
---
Whatever it ends up being, it will be a seperate gamemode from Adventure (Normal),  &amp; Survival (Regular PvP). The entire game is not going to change.
---
Most wanted... quests and NPCs 
---
So, a whole Fallout game on top of this Fallout game. Should be easy enough. /s
---
I have one too. It‚Äôs not *bad,* but it‚Äôs not even close to best in class. It‚Äôs a good mid-game weapon that works for your build until you find something better.
---
92 days later lol still no word. How do they even get away with banning people that were accused of trading more than 100,000 items when we are on reddit everyday hustling and trading like I don‚Äôt get it ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Use rifleman for semiautomatic, or commando for full auto, and demolition expert. Hopefully this will help

The melee card that cuts through enemy armor greatly helps against super mutantsn

You can get possum badges from cleaning up toxic waste daily quest?

Seriously. If in a year from now we‚Äôre all looking back and say ‚ÄúHuh. We have PVE, PVP, Battle Royals, Intense Survival / Resource all in different modes and all Fallout themed in one platform‚Äù it‚Äôll be mighty impressive.

Fought it with my level 25 toon last week and got a three star armor piece, actually better than all the one star stalkers golf club my heavy main has been getting

Nice!

Inventing Swear Words series is a classic!

I‚Äôve never ever seen plasma grenade plans. Don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever seen pulse either and I‚Äôm level 72.
---
Ive seen the freerange event start in the forest, didnt know it could randomly spawn in the forest!
---
There is a wood pile, as in a proper large one like in a workshop, over near Silva Homestead, just near the river so it's close enough I think for water and wood. You will get the option for a resource extractor for whatever is available in your build area.
---
Pretty much what this gent said.  Christ, they've had it for over 30 years now.  Testament to its craftsmanship.

Oh it‚Äôs server based then or at least maybe is. Okay thanks all along I was under the impression it was account-daily

It‚Äôs just going to be all the ready-made crap they‚Äôre remastering for the google stadia

I would pay extra to see that.

A lot of the issues are generally gone. Some bugs still here and there. They added a decent amount of new content since launch. Much of the PvP system has rebalanced a lot of the gear. The state is Still West Virginia.

Vampire laser rifle with beam spliter is amazing. It takes 4-6 shots to heal from 10% to 100%.

I have a a vampire/fire rate laser rifle and I can tank 3 pylons easily. When I drop to 20-30% HP I only need to do around 10 shots on gutsy and I am back to full health. With repair kits I can easily finish the event with no death.

Highly recommended.

There is a small quest circle west of whitesprings in the mountains, it is small so it is easy to miss. If you go there it will spawn a specific group of mongrels. Throw it at them.

What BBQ shack?

This is a great idea!! Also a PSA for folks who are trying to get rid of one particular mutation(looking at you Empath)- if you use diluted rad-away you will only lose one mutation at a time, rather than potentially clearing multiple in one run through a decontamination shower.
---
You just ain‚Äôt lucky. A majority of stuff I get does not suit my build but I‚Äôve received a few gems I was an able to use or resell.

yes and it‚Äôs really the easiest in terms of effort. just do it once a day and cross your fingers.

There's nothing to fix (besides the wood armor and assaultron head bugs). The rolls are random and you have just had bad luck. Some people have had good luck and have obtained great loot. Just need to pray to RNGesus

Read the responses to the other people that ask this question every damned day
---
It interesting, I picked up a fixer for 500c the other day, rebuilt it correctly for my build (sneak riflemen) and it does more damage than my two shot combat, the only reason why it's not my main is because I run a silenced instigating handmade with FFR.  Glad I gave it a chance
---
This sub has been pure outrage for at least 6 months.  Outrage, then gushing praise, then right back to outrage.  It‚Äôs exhausting.
---
Oh alright thank you
---
Im interested in what else there will be aside from a BR
---
They're useless as far as I know. You can find them in a waste barrel in emmet mountain disposal site
---
I don't think a new mode should be put in. ESPECIALLY a new pvp mode. Survival is too dead. I don't want BR to split even more of the playerbase.
---
Snallygaster Spit Explosions can be obtained without hacking, it's probably just a bug.  Haven't heard of how you can get Super Mutant body parts, but it is probably similar.
---
Not surprised at all. Bethesda has failed to create any interesting new content to FO76. People are always exciting when hearing new things are coming to game, but we have seen now: Burrows, Paradise, Scout quest missions, Legendary vendor, player vendors etc... and all these have failed miserably. All these features have been boring after few min of game playing.
---
Tout can actually get the super mutant body parts in the cave at Emmet's Disposal Site. Some of the barrels past the deathclaw spawn area are filled with bloody limbs.
---
It's a pretty freaky/gruesome spot.
---
Nope I have a two shot and the fixer, same level with same options and the fixer does more damage, crazy right
---
Ah, the good ole days. I still know at least one player that trades without machines.
---
I'm actually super stoked about tomorrow in general. Not only are we getting news about 76, but the Canadian Grand Prix is tomorrow and I'm watching it with my bros
---
This game is 99.9% PvE content. Yeah, that's too much PvP.
---
/insert Jurassic Park theme here/
---
Then I might be tempted to reinstall it BEFORE I hear what's planned for Wastelanders.   
---
Didn't ragequit, just beat the enclave quest, decided I was done and uninstalled. PVP holds zero interest for me.
---
Having people looking at you when you are in the shop is not PvP.
---
I like the animations personally. I think it would be weird if the gun just disappeared and reappeared, and wish they would show your weapon holstered on your body.
---
If you go into your photo gallery there is a key/button to set your profile picture. It'll show up as a hint down the bottom

---
The snallygaster spit attack explosion can be obtained by spamming the pickup button when getting hit by their attack. Same thing with a behemoth rock throwing explosion. Just selling little novelties
---
I'd like to know this too, in all my time looking at player vendors I have never seen anybody selling mr fuzzy tokens or stuff you get for tokens. I'd pay big money for them, I want to learn all the paddle ball mods
---
It works for me. Video games aren't real life, buddy.
---
I think it's safer to see what content is announce and the immediate responses involved, set up a megathread beforehand and wait to see how bad it might get, then enforce properly.
---
Operation Tidy is the name of the quest
---
I faced this same issue a few weeks ago and TBH by far the best way is to visit player vendors till you find it cheap. I tried taking the workshop that has nuclear deposits, tried farming glowing creatures, tried hitting up the few spawns for the stuff... all were wasted efforts. I gathered maybe 25. I ended up buying a few hundred of the stuff for about 1-5 caps each from players.
---
1) power armour degrades much more slowly than normal armour, but the agility perk "white knight" makes your normal armour last 60% longer and cheaper to repair
---
2) No they don't permanently break, that sounds like a bug and I'd put in a Bethesda ticket, at least to let them know
---
3) certain sets have better base damage resistance, but it's very dependent on the legendary effects as well
---
4) yes
---
5) no

For some reason I thought t was for the tadpole badges ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Consumable one hour buffs are really just supper annoying. I'm sure almost everybody simply ignores them. And they are especially unfair because they stack for some reason.

They clearly have to be permanent, one way or another.
---
Same has been happening to me, sadly I‚Äôve just given up on this challenge now
---
beyond
---
Lol that'd be great. Bet it's just Fallout Shelter 2 and a more in depth Elder Scrolls VI demo. Oh and of course an announcement of Skyrim on Stadia.
---
1. You will want to use the white knight perk
---
2. That shouldn't happen.. possibly a bug? 
---
3. No advantage to full sets. A rmor with good legendary effects are what you would want to go for. 
---
4. Scrapping armor has a chance to unlock plans for mods for the type of armor you scrapped.
---
5. Helmets are mostly cosmetic. Although gas masks can prevent disease.
---
6. Some armors have rad resistance and there are mods to increase rad resistance. Armor doesn't help with disease
---
7. Underarmor will increase special stats when modded. Different underarmors will increase different stats.
---
In reply to 4 yes but a lot less frequently than rifles, for example. It happened so rarely it didn‚Äôt occur to me that it did, but break down enough and you‚Äôll start getting more mods. Some are rare as hell, I have never gotten stabilised.
---
I added you
---
I don‚Äôt think they drop till you‚Äôve completed the tadpole challenge and  the possum badges, although they still refer to you as a tadpole.
---
1. Use the white knight perk. Slows wear and is cheaper to fix. 
---
2. Shouldn't have disappeared.  So...idk
---
3. No advantage of full sets (full combat armor, full marine, ect.) That's purely your taste. Some go for specifically the legendary effects. Some go for looks. Some is what type of damage resistance they want. 
---
4. Yes but it takes awhile. Best bet is learn to craft it, use armorer perk to lessen material use, and build up a bunch and mass scrap. 
---
5. No. There's massive costume heads like the park ranger mole but that provides 1 point. I believe it's so everyone can be unique and not just min/max armor and look the same. 
---
6. Rad protection in normal armor you want marine and robot.  (Maybe trapper. I'm at work can't verify) diseases vary on your characters wellness (hunger and thirst) and your endurance and if you use any perks. 
---
7. Cosmetics, and if you can upgrade them they can provide a bit of damage resistance and special points. BOS under armor provides additional strength and endurance points with better modifications. 
---
Hope this helps. By all means correct me anywhere i'm wrong.
---
name checks out
---
*finally, you‚Äôre awake.* enjoy the wagon ride.
---
The only way that I‚Äôve been able to pull better rolls is waiting until I have 500-1000 scrip.
---
Probably will, and some people might actually like the supposed BR coming. Others won't. But then there's pve group. Just farming whitesprings for our tenth Junkies Flamer.
---
Loot from barrels in Emmet Mountain Disposal and to pick up explosion you just spam pickup when a snallygaster attacks. No hacks needed, both are very easy to get and has no use nor real value.
---
True
---
Heavy combat armor with the BOS mod on all pieces
---
Heavy combat armor, i think
---
So I‚Äôm thinking of trying out the heavy gun guide you have on another alt, but say I want to do a non-bloodied build (I know it‚Äôs much less damage) what perks would I want to change out?
---
Taxes...
---
You open the bag.
---
Inside lies a copy of Skyrim Special Edition 
---
Todd strikes again.
---
Thank You! Never noticed the option!
---
I got the responder fireman helmet as a reward from Fertile Soil awhile back, was super awesome
---
Yep it's all RNG. I got none 15 times and then had 2 badges
---
Im pretty sure its bugged and no one has finished it.
---
Form what I have searched it is still broken  can not be finished
---
Heavy combat armor with BOS mod, and dense upgrade on chest. Preferably with vanguard legendary trait if you are going for pure stats resistance.
---
No problem
---
Well, that backpack has straps, so that means we'll never get it. ;)
---
This is honestly the best advice. Find one room and stick to it. Once you have done a few events and got an idea of the layout then maybe start trying to spread out a bit so each room has players.
---
Now we knew the Fatman canvas launcher wasn't ready for e3 this year and was going to break immediately but we used it anyway. It is ok though we expected that and next year the launcher will be even better. Don't let that stop you from purchasing your own fatman canvas bag launchers now for $59.99, they will totally be fixed and great next year and 1/5th the price, buy now!
---
Her journey isn‚Äôt over
---
Ok is there plans for the BOS mod or do you have to just hope to find it?
---
It is not finished, it has been stated the the jounrney will continue in future DLCs.
---
I always avoided them, waste of resources...
---
U can buy the plan at a vendor, I think at Grafton station
---
I think people forgot the roadmap existed loool.
---
They used to be on the watoga trainstation vendor sometimes, might also be on the whitesprings BOS vendor these days. I am not sure since I have had them since forever. They also drop from BOS events in the Bog.
---
Do you think no one spends money and buys atoms and they have no revenue coming in?
---
Oh you're one of those guys. I bet you feel more original than the other thousand guys using Stealth Boys and TSE Lasers. Disney called, they want their unoriginality back
---
I want the officer uniform I'm tired of wearing the airforce one
---
That "what level are you" is little problematic because for example I have lvl 106, lvl 98 and lvl 40 characters. So should I answer lvl 244 or pick one randomly?
---

The playerbase is one of the best things about the game. During the beta, i went exploring in the ash heap. Some guy came along, we teamed, and we ended up going around the whole heap, getting some awesome legendaries. Also have some friends at the moment who i play with everyday on it, who i literally met from one of them asking me if i had any screws or adhesive. The game is brilliant with things like this. Do this on a game like Rust and you'd be dead before you could ask for basic mats. 76 grasps the playerbase and signals that you have to work cooperatively, in the best way possible. Thats why i still play it today.
---
You want Bethesda to fix your luck? Buddy, that is between you and the universe. And the universe has a bad sense of humor...
---
Nah no stealth boy and a variety of weapons, I don't need to be original I want to have fun and still be effective. You can't do a bloodied or stealth build with my playstile, I like to collect stuff
---
And only one rank of starched genes. I want my skill point back.
---
I think you covered most of my favourites there. Hopefully we will slowly see more stuff pour into the game-world.
---
No use and no value... parts also add to weight!
---
You've given me hope.
---
Good idea, but probably won't be implemented...to many people writing foul stuff and hard to police.
---
I‚Äôm up to 4 from various Pioneer events. May never have to finish a damn badge to get my high capacity if RNG holds out.
---
The problem comes when you use up a plasma coil in a plasma gatling, or a fusion cell in a Tesla rifle, during a battle, and it takes roughly 9 weeks for the reload animation to run while you are getting your ass laminated. Yeah sure, switch to your secondary you're saying, but once you blow through that, you have two guns to reload.
---
id like some weapons to come back from New vegas, mostly these

Why are you searching that, didn't you get one during main quest??
---
I craft "starter packages" made up of a BoS Recon rifle (lvl 1) and full set of deep pocketed leather armor (lvl 1) and some diluted stims and .308 ammo and put these in the overseers camp box, flatwoods mailboxes and similar places for newbies to find. I would have preferred direct interaction, but most people dont seem to hear my mic and seem scared when you approach, so I just tuck help items away in easy to find locations and hope someone will find them.
---
Awesome comment! Kinda makes me want to farm it myself!
---
the SMMG would be dope. sorta wonder if it and other heavier weapons though should gain an accuracy bonus in power armour, as a small positive for using pa over legendary regular armour
---
My boyfriend and I were grinding campfire tales together. He got to 8 badges about 15 events before I did. He even got 2 fucking badges on a single event completion when I didnt get any. It really is RNG.
---
Control room
---
R91 and the chinese assault rifle from fallout 3. The chinese pistol, specifically the incendiary zhu rong v418 if possible. Gauss minigun from tactics would be awesome as an end-game weapon. The bb gun, and maybe the LE version. Gauss pistol for sure, and the OG gauss rifle instead of the weird charging gun we have now. G11/e, P90, needler pistol, XL70E3. FN fal. Oh, and make the alien blaster great again!
---
outrage culture
---
Being effective? As someone who tries to at least put a modicum of effort into my build it frightening how you can come in and steam roll without so much as knowing how to make a build. You sound like every other clown that plays survival with death rays. I cannot imagine you having fun just holding down the trigger and getting kills.
---
Never heard of this before.
---
Tbh everything that‚Äôs positive on this sub gets downvoted for no reason
---
Each year I realize E3 is going on or I just missed it and google videos.  Long time gamer, and now enjoying FO76 every day.  I could not pinpoint why, but this year I must admit I have planned out watching what Bethesda is going to say.  I think I have just enjoyed the exploration in Fallout 76 so much that it just feels like an extension of the game to see what is coming next.  I honestly think several years from now many people will be surprised with how well Fallout 76 has done/is doing.
---
That Gun. From F:NV
---
My favorite gun in the entire Fallout series.
---
I added all my character levels up.
---
It took me about two weeks constantly farming it to get all the plans. I still farm it now for duplicates to sell, they always sell quick.
---
Holy shit.
---
Mountain Mama.
---
Max overall balanced DR + ER is probably two heavy metal limbs, two heavy leather limbs and a heavy combat torso, switching in more heavy metal pieces if you value DR higher. 
---
In practice heavy combat is a lot easier to find because Scorched Earth drops a 2\* piece every time.
---
Just take all the fallout 3 guns( that isn't in 76 already) and port em in
---
Scout Armor upgraded to polymer has better ballistic damage on arms and legs. I can't remember about energy damage or the chest piece ballistic damage, but I think the chest ballistic when upgraded is also a hair better than the BOS Heavy combat armor. It is, however, more difficult to get, seeing as the polymer mod can only be purchased from the Enclave armory.
---
What about mods and private servers? Is it already known if they'll talk about them/did they already/or even are they already a thing? Sorry, it's exams season for me and I haven't been following much news about this.
---
If only my WiFi was on so I could install the game
---
Depends on how big the damage buff is going to be because if the damage buff will be a lot then there will be no point in grinding so hard for handmade rifles and using them - you will just be able to get tons of assault rifles and scrap them for mods at west tek and get a powerful weapon easily
---
Damn about to drop now
---
I‚Äôve been meeting some cool people when I head over to fight the Scorch Queen when someone nukes it. I‚Äôve yet to nuke it myself but I found out I can get a ton of xp from going and helping kill stuff in the blast zone (Yes I‚Äôm a noob). 
---
It‚Äôs been awesome to meet helpful folks who genuinely enjoy helping others. Gives me hope for humanity in this post apocalyptic world.
---
Yeah! Game crashes constantly. It's a joke. Last patch broke the game.
---
Damn, I recently bought the game but my WiFi is out so I can‚Äôt even install it lol.
---
im sure any of the new big guns they throw in would benefit from Stabilized's Accuracy and Armor Penetration Bonuses
---
Sure that's exactly what I do lol. I don't need a stealth build to camp in corners waiting for my enemy to show me his back, that's not what I pvp for. I mean you're probably the only one with a decent build, they're for sure not on youtube, reddit and ect. I don't play survival, why should I play this broken mode? Has nothing to do with skill when you camp to shoot newbies when they collect stuff. There's a reason no real pvp game has full invisibility like fallout has, it's unbalanced. Skill is defined by aim, your walkways, your reaction time and so on, not by auto-aim spraying your enemy and dodging all bullets through perk cards. No need to leave your shit here, I was just asking what this guy was doing, because it's broken as hell obviously
---
What are the ammo types you are mentioning? Fusion cells go quick for me but not much else seems to sell.
---
I think it's combat armor chest, and leather limbs offer the highest stat line. Most people go full combat, or marine that I've seen. I really haven't looked too far into it tho.
---
They're easy to acquire, and the weapons aren't useful until you can get legendary versions. I'd dump them if I were you.
---
That‚Äôs a first. I‚Äôve lost a many items from my stash randomly but never caps
---
Sounds good doesn't work. I had my CAMP dozens of hours on Flatwoods near the responder church and I specifically crafted armor and guns for low level players and stuffed all my vendors with food, water, ammo and aid items for them. And prices were low af and I wrote on the vendors that they are for low lvl players only. No low level player that visited bought anything, not even free .38 ammo or super modified armor and weapon... meanwhile for example one lvl250 player bought everything on my aid section including food and water, probably to sell it with 2000% price. I just wonder why... Like You are lvl 6 and you see lvl5 rifle with hardened receiver, long barrel and stabilized stock, long scope and perforating magazine and silencer. You can't get that shit in next 50h and you could buy it for 5 caps!!! But no. You don't buy even one stimpak for 5 caps or strength bobblehead for 20 caps... My idea is to lock vendors with player level cap: Vendor could only be uses by players level 20 or below or like that.
---
It was. The brother responsible for not doing so sooner has been disciplined. Ad Victorium.
---
Enforcer in Agility is an amazing perk to take for a shotgun using build
---
Exactly. Shoot first... Nope. That's it. Ad Victorium.
---
No, I play on PC
---
You only get fire breather uniform from main quest. The unique variant is much cooler looking.
---
Just what we were all hoping for!
---
How did you get your character to sit like in 0:42 and more importantly 1:28 (on the bed)? Is it a photomode pose?
---
Oprah joins him. "You get a bag, you get a bag.  YOU ALL GET BAGS."
---
I can‚Äôt help but feel the ‚Äúloneliness‚Äù is perhaps not an uncommon trope for post-apocalyptic themed things to go for.
---
They stack, multiplicatively. The legendary version is a fixed value refresh-on-hit effect, while the perk version stacks with itself to a max reduction of 40%.
---
I was just thinking of going back to ultracite PA since I don‚Äôt use the jetpack anymore on my T60. Gotta research more on the plans for it now though.
---
Ok, good to note. Thanks.
---
why would you use a laser rifle the fusion cells are so hard to grind and expensive to craft; the weapon mods are also very hard to grind. you should use a handmade rifle or at least a combat rifle because their ammo is very cheap to craft just have a ton of steel lead and gunpowder and craft thousands of it easily. if you don't know where to get the handmade rifle plans just go to watoga station there is definitely gonna be the plans. if you still want to have a vampire's handmade or combat rifle i can give you a max level vampire's handmade rifle with all upgrades, only 1 star but still something. I'm on PS4, name is vladgor2008
---
To answer your question on how one would be able to access a backpack in power armor. Answer: Because it is Fallout.
---
I guess you should now ask, how can a person carry 40 water bottles, 10 weapons, wear armor and carry other armor, carry food, several junk items, 300 bobby pins and much more and still be able to run and jump?
---
Hmm, a battle royal?  Fallout 76's main strength is not it's shooter mechanics.
---
E3 starts the 11th right?
---
Thank you. Found them right way
---
I'm not that experienced, but I'm at level 62 and specced for shotguns. I don't have any legendaries yet, but, my combat shotgun has a perforating magazine and does 200+ damage a shot.   
---
Use enforcer and cripple everything, and then shoot it in the face a few times and it's dead.   
---
Most enemies seem to die within 10 shells, which yeah, isn't that great... but good enough for me until I can find a decent legendary shotgun.
---
The chainsaw from NV(Please?), the double barrel from 3(this could just be a mod that lets the double barrel we have fire both barrels at once), and the red glare(just for that insane reloading animation).  
---
  
---
[](/crazyfs)Altho if given the choice I'd rather they bring back one of my odd favorite features from 3, and New Vegas. Weapon Jamming. The unique animations not only gave you incentive to keep your weapons in good shape, but let you know when they were getting in bad shape, and most of all made the weapons feel more real.  
---
I could see it being an unpopular addition since it would obviously be a liability in combat, but god I miss it.
---
At least trading with people can give you more than 4 caps for a legendary
---
Technically yes but really, No. for example E3 already had their e3 showcase today. Bethesdsa and Microsoft are going tomorrow the 9th. So really by the 11th it will be half over. Not sure why they said it starts the 11th
---
Two-shot might be good (if you can handle the horrific accuracy), because I suspect it more than doubles the damage on explosive heavies. Not tested though.
---
Otherwise Bloodied should be good. Not sure if Instigating or Anti-armor would work correctly.
---
My apologies
---
I'm just not willing to compete head to head with cheaters.
---
I'm simply not willing to compete head to head with cheaters.
---
Oh, no reason to craft plasma cores, they're so plentiful in the game. I have like 90 right now, and haven't crafted a single one.
---
You wouldn't need nerd rage, and you wouldn't need Adrenal Reaction mutation. Just be aware... a TSE .50 cal at 100% HP is like 1/10th the dps of a 1 star bloodied .50 cal when at 19% HP. Because adrenal reaction works for literally any build, and because of how insanely tanky you are at 19% HP with emergency protocols, I can't see any reason to run a non bloodied build. If your goal is to be a healer or something, there are builds that are vastly different. If you want to do PvP, you shouldn't be using power armor at all really.
---
Gotta add the beep tho
---
1) Yeah, it breaks quickly. Especially from multihits - minigun super mutants and mkVII turrets (with explosive bullets) will wreck your armor condition. White knight is strongly recommended to keep repairs to a minimum.
---
2) Nope, it shouldn't happen. If you have items disappearing, DO NOT spam while scrapping/selling/etc items. That seems to be the #1 reason for why people are mysteriously losing things, perhaps even the only reason
---
3) Full suits are not particularly efficient, each piece has their own trade-offs. I know somebody calculated the best possible resistances come from a mix of armors, not any one individually. People also usually care far more for the legendary effects on their armor than what kind it is
---
4) Yes, but some mods (like ultra-light, deep pocketed, etc) can only be learned from plans
---
5) Only gas masks, they prevent you from taking damage and getting lung disease in like 3 parts of the game that actually make use of the feature, at the cost of 2 perception
---
6) Poisoner's armor exists, and so does radiation resistant, but people report that the radiation one sometimes doesn't work. Trapper armor also has a bit of rad resistance by default, although its physical defenses are really weak and it's heavy.
---
7) Under armor is the "clothing" of your character like it worked in fo4. The armor only covers your limbs, you're still naked underneath the armor without under armor. You can mod under armor to give you a tiny bit of resistance and some SPECIAL bonuses, but it's mostly used for fashion. In this game you can also wear an outfit to completely hide your armor/under armor if you want
---
6 if you are a stealth ranged, there are orange hazmat suits with zero armor protection but 500 And 1000 rad resistance.  Great in nuc zones with marsupial. Never tried it regarding disease.
---
Wow bummer. :-( Thanks!
---
This looks awesome :D
---
Glowing mole miners. Blackwater is full of them.
---
I am a podacst fiend. I'll give it a shot.
---
Gunsmith 5 will work I believe the other is for repairing it to 200% and crafting
---
Broken as hell? What you're doing is broken as hell with explosige laser guns
---
licensed plumber makes it break 60% slower and cheaper to repair
---
I run into this too.  super frustrating
---
If there are no gatling plasma magazine mods, why is the magazine slot shown when you're creating or modifying the weapon?
---
I meant because the PvP is horribly unbalanced and just plain not fun. Not because there's too much of it. There's also no reward incentive to ever PvP.
---
To be honest the R91 but in reality I wants to see guns from other parts of the world again namely being since the USA ANNEXED Canada I would like to see some Canadian/British weapons. I mean the lore itself supports this that Toronto survived the bombs in some form to be able to conduct trade and you are telling me not a SINGLE British SMLE MK3 made it back into the states via a trader? I just don't buy the fact that the USA and Canada would not post 2077 not have certain weapons floating around. I love the fact the MG42 is in the game but yet some of the other most popular weapons of the second world war are not even a thought.
---
Yall have some trash builds lol..... a non bloodied rifleman puts them down eith ease when using sneak.
---
Not really, a good vats build can still compete pretty good. They've not been removed because they were op rather because they're nonsense, otherwise they'd nerfed them. Still not as broken as beeing fully invisible
---
They can put whatever they want in the game as long as I get some decent outfits out of it. 
---
Just like all online games fashion is the real end game content.
---
Neon letters is one of the rarer camp plans actually, they show up at robot vendors once in a while but they're like 9000 caps
---
they should just have a big event quest where the whole server participates and banishes all the scorched out (kills em for good or shuts em down) then bring back more ghouls and raiders and some new enemy ..maybe a pack of hunter/predator creatures that only come out at night in certain locations and stalk you and if you arent on your toes they can end up messing you up bad
---
You have one for sale or remember where it was dropped?
---
I was about to say I knew you!  Thanks for the clarification.
---
Thanks
---
Could be added to the pvp. But with the idea of dividing up the land would cause to many problem for the ones that don‚Äôt want to join factions. 
---
May be when they allow private servers.
---
Participating in this sub, multiple discords and with people in game?
---
Like, I was literally the only person on my survival server when I went to get Unstoppable Monster this week.
---
And no, I'm definitely not saying they should never ever accommodate the PvP players.
---
I am stoked just like always. 
---
If my blind and completely unsupported hopes come true we might get a fallout 3 remake reveal. 
---
And even more blind my hopes for seeing sweet sweet details about wastelanders and nuclear winter.
---
Where and what is the scorched earth event? I probably have done it I just don't go by names ya know
---
I've seen a video on YouTube that the south mountain lookout over close by fort defiance has one but I have yet to see one I server hop after server hop and no luck I did however find a megasloth there to be tamed but I'm looking for a deathclaw so you got my upvote
---
Take me home from these posts...
---
So, anecdotal then. Got it.
---
Take me home...
---
My camp is near a fissure &amp; it frequently gets attack by a scorched beast. I usually just leave the server when that happens since I‚Äôm sick of it destroying my camp whilst I try to kill it. I‚Äôve tried to kite it away from my camp but that dick pirate always insists on destroying my ceiling fan lights (usually the first things to get destroyed) amongst many other things. Definitely annoying.
---
And also the cap cap has been removed in addition to now having plans for crafting every outfit and armor type in the game.
---
I tamed a megasloth earlier but I have yet to see it at camp
---
Nothing to add constructively. Maybe ask Taggert if he took it for the Lapetomane Thruway?
---
I just want my dog back I miss dogmeat.
---
For the land being divided all it does is make it our "country" we have a capital which is my camp. And it does not effect anyone not in our faction
---
That's a great question!

Well it has to travel there, and If it happened across say, somewhere supper mutants, well it might have died.
---
I saw one guy selling chemistry bench plans for over a thousand caps and I nearly shit myself.
---
Yeah when playing without other players in a team it feels really lonely and fallout 4 was good cuz every u go u could just encounter random npcs
---
It's the event where you kill the Scorchbeast Queen. The queen itself drops random legendary loot but the event reward is always a 2\* combat armor piece, I think.
---
Just down the mountain by top of the world to the south a bit. A 100% spawn death claw.
---
It was in the mire by sunset farm, my camp is in the forest
---
Am I raidery enough for the raider club?
---
I fought the Flatwood monster earlier today. He spawned right as a scorched beast attacked me. It was way Northeast, by the NESW mark on the map.
---
I have tons of junk too
---
There a feature called pacifist mode you can turn on so it won't trigger PvP if you shoot someone.
---
Oh shit yeah every time I've killed her it gives me crappy legendaries if it doesn't lag me out before I can loot her
---
Inagine if he had given them to people who paid for them at the date they expected.
---
The dream scenario, for me, is multiplayer FROST or HORIZONS type stuff (both ultrahard f4 overhaul mods, if you're unfamiliar.)
---
Where everything is more scarce, surviving is an actual challenge and dying is absolutely brutal. Probably with a sub split for PvE and PvP servers too.
---
When you tame an animal it has to physically walk to your camp you can't just server hop and it will be there and while it's on its way it can be killed
---
Yes I have handmade but they are inferior in DPS/utility comparing to many weapons. I use handmade mainly because I have too many steel/lead and I have to craft 5.56 to sell. Need a quad/fire rate auto handmade to keep my stash space balance.
---
DPS is weak comparing to quad/explosive railway rifle. If I want AOE damage I use my quad tesla/fire rate. If I want heal I use laser rifle. I also have a secondary vampire plasma flamer in case laser rifle is broken and when I don't have time to repair. Ammo is not really a problem for me at this point.
---
From trading, I have 10k\~20k fusion cells right now sharing with my girlfriend. If you need help to finding fusion cells let me know. Solomon pond for copper. Lucky hole mine for lead. For plastic, the best way is any super mutant locations like westtek or grafton steel. Then scrap all the laser rifle with scrapper. You get 9 plastics per rifle. You can also get so many fusion cells by silo runs/AWOL/staying in Watoga.
---
It may have changed, but it used to be: polished metal armor has the best ballistic damage resistance, studded leather armor has the best energy damage resistance, and BoS combat armor has the best (ballistic + energy) damage resistance.
---
I know where that one is but each time I go there it's always a lvl 60 or so
---
Stay in adventure mode and put on pacifist mode.  Thats the only way to truly enjoy the game.  Knuckleheads will always walk in front of someone firing.
---
A West Virginia history book. We learned all about stuff like that during high school and middle school
---
I run into it several times a week in WS near the Water Fountain.
---
The armor on the cover is T-51, not Ultracite. The cover pic of the helmet is taken from the shot right at the end of the official trailer that has a person putting on T-51.
---
I'll take a quad or AA explosive assault rifle off the hands of anyone who's got one... hehe
---
Yeah I know lol but it's been like 3 hours
---
What he said. Btw, with only two exceptions, I‚Äôve never been griefed like that. Most folks are cool
---
If you're on pc hmu I could help. Also turn pacifist mode on
---
But the weekly challenge specials... those weapons are insane! (Selling a resolute veteran btw... ps4 )do go into survival from time to time, so pacifist is off just so I dont get too caught off guard. And pvp is fine when it's fair, and one or two kills. But they not only kill me, I find them going to my camp and destroying my stuff. The repair costs for it all alone make it more worthwhile to scrap everything and start over somewhere else.
---
I like marsupial jumping above a bear and still getting staggered
---
:)
---
Maybe they should fix the bugs before they start worrying about more content.   If I launch another nuke just to get lagged out when it comes time to cash in, I'm done with this broken, laggy shit storm.
---
Beep on but only so others can hear it
---
I have had a few people do that crap, but very rare.  Maybe it is a console thing?
---
How many screws would he need to fix it
---
It could have died along the way
---
Heavy Metal for DR
---
Heavy Leather for ER
---
Scout armor for balance (it‚Äôs only a tiny bit better, I‚Äôd just go Heavy Combat)
---
Trapper for Radiation
---
Heavy robot for balanced of all 3
---
Marine for low weight and decent balance
---
Wood for sneaking.
---
Know any good spawns for deathclaws?
---
Do you have a base with turrets on the Whitesprings golf course or something? Is it specific griefers who you have history with?
---
Dragon bone
---
I‚Äôm trying the same thing up by the Overseer‚Äôs camp and running into the same problem. I literally can‚Äôt give weapons away to low level characters, and all the free ammo gets hovered up by level 90+ shitheads. I don‚Äôt care that much because I‚Äôm not giving away anything I can‚Äôt afford, but it‚Äôs annoying.
---
Great debuff.
---
Immediately envisioned someone getting konked by one in the face and waking up in a horse cart...
---
Yea, of course. It spawns to your level. Get a low level to go before you. Otherwise wait until level 120.
---
Its gonna be like a CTD and everyone will have to leave E3
---
Licensed plumber is only for pipe weapons
---
How much would you take for it
---
i know im trying to use a tse pipe revolver
---
Nope. Currently right by Arktos so people can have a free spawn to project paradise if they're on my team, or so they can shop before or after. But everything is gone currently and so is my junk to fix it (that's not already for sale)
---
I just want to use the giant evil weather machine already. So as long as it turns that thing on I'll be happy.
---
I‚Äôm going to regret feeding the troll but so you like paying for a product and not getting it for 6 months?
---
Laughed at that last bit for too long
---
If it‚Äôs the same group of people you might have someone on your ‚Äúfriends‚Äù list who is griefing you
---
Stairs now require 1.5 empty squares above. Yay
---
In an MMO based game, a PvP mode where none of your grind matters is terrible, nobody would play it.
---
Sure, there would be new players, but you‚Äôd lose all the old ones in the process.
---
This game doesn't have any bugs
---
If adding a second floor and roof wasn‚Äôt so damn infuriating then I‚Äôd honestly say the building side of F76 was pretty good.
---
Or your account got hacked
---
To be fair 'nuclear winter' is also the name of the new game mode, so I can kinda get why people are confused.
---
The biggest common denominator in these confrontations seems to be you.
---
You mean, you don't like being melted by Two shot explosive bloodied energy weapons you can't even get anymore for owning a mundane workshop?
---
It's the ***BEST PART OF THE GAAAAAAAAME***
---
Sunday, June 8. Press conference starts at 8:30pm E. Bethesda will stream from their Twitch.
---
With the fallout fan base, down is up. The more garbage the game was in the In the eyes of the fallout fan base, the better it sold, take 3 and 4 for prime examples. This was just the game that they bluffed too hard on. I hope they don‚Äôt BR, but I know it will probably happen, because they have nothing to lose at this point.
---
Thanks for posting. I joined and it was my first time taking her down. üò¨
---
&gt;Spoken like a true career victim. Who is cheating? Not everyone who kills you is cheating, and no TSEs are not uBeRh4x.
---
Fair Point, still a shame about Ultracite being trash, though.
---
If you need a rifle to heal you up, I've got a max level 1 star vampire's handmade rifle with all upgrades - powerful auto receiver, forceful stock, suppressor, aligned long barrel, reflex sight dot, drum mag. I can trade you it for, say, 500 caps?
---
 I enjoy watching some good Rust youtube players, but that game is not at all what I want.  I too am a fan of Vanilla.
---
Fair enough. PvP is just a thing that exists, to me. I avoid it where I can, but i do get workshop-gimped occasionally, I honestly don't understand why people get so pissed about it when it happens to them personally. It'd be nice if it *didn't* happen, but the game warns you lol. I always just ignore and respawn w/o seeking revenge, cause I'd rather get right to farming back up whatever i lost instead of going at it over that lost loot.
---
I definitely *do* want them to improve PvP though. It's not something you can avoid in an online game of this style. Improving it would make people happy and improve the game's standing, which is something I'm all for. I'm just concerned that it might be a trade off that will piss off more people than fixing PvP appeases in the first place.
---
Maybe they should've just had Survival be battle royale from the start, it does seem better than whatever Survival is now.
---
I'm lvl 123 already
---
Some wikis have incorrect info carried over from FO4. Also, some apparently just don't drop anymore, even though they are a part of the game files.
---
That‚Äôs just how pvp is these days. Rarely a one on one deal. As for battle royal. I hope to god they don‚Äôt give into the fortnite theme. That‚Äôs exactly why I skipped black ops. I‚Äôll lose big respect if they turn this franchise into anything but their own interpretation of what post apocalyptic wastelands is. That‚Äôs a bandwagon they don‚Äôt want to play with. I know damn well that they will fail at implementing it. They‚Äôve come a long way since launch but I don‚Äôt think battle royal will keep anyone around. It‚Äôs just more bugs. Even survival is a joke. They tried for sure but let‚Äôs face it. Not nearly enough people care for that style of pvp. I keep saying it. Make survival like the original mode and have adventure for those who just want to farm Day in and day out. Then complain that they have nothing to do.
---
I jumped ship cause Chinese hackers but I guess it was the content.
---
Well done!
---
How to delete someone else's post...
---
Agreed. Honestly, I‚Äôve had a hard time being convinced to even leave my Excavator suit behind, just due to how much more carry weight it gives over other unmodded PAs. Mods cost way too much money imo, especially since PA in general aren‚Äôt really the best endgame setup.
---
Haha awesome
---
" I just really hope that if it is a royale mode people don't start hating on it or bashing it writing it off because its a br "
---
{Future Narrator Voice} They did.
---
You‚Äôre doing this to yourself by refusing to turn pacifist on. Turn it on in Adventure, off in Survival. 
---
It‚Äôs fine if you don‚Äôt want to do that, but then you have to accept the consequences that come with it.
---
Haha, you wanna see hackers just wait until you see a Battle Royale mode done in FO76 where there is no anti cheat.
---
Of course it won't happen but it'd be the most tone-deaf thing to happen if they did.
---
War never changes.
---
 On the one hand that sounds cool, then I remember what we gamers are like and cringe at the shit I will have to eye bleach away.
---
True true. It is nice not having to worry about rads and worry less about repairs. Still, I'm in it for the style. I'm an old ass hipster, I guess. I only wanna use the cool busted stuff.
---
If you didnt know, for every picture you take in photo mode, a copy gets added to your capture gallery. You can then go into the capture gallery and copy the desired items onto a usb stick. Then plug the usb into a laptop, send them to imgur, and post the link on reddit. You can also transfer them to a mobile device by sending the pictures to a friend, then going onto the ps messages app and saving them to your device from there. Hope that helps
---
Than at double the level you should be able to tame a lv 60 if I'm not mistaken
---
I had one lvl 60 or so spawn there at that spot by the top of the world I had both animal friend and wasteland whisperer maxed out and it didn't let me tame it only passify it
---
Now to sell every single one you find for 1k caps.  They‚Äôll sell.  Oh they‚Äôll sell...
---
I‚Äôm gonna make everyone fight naked for them instead.
---
This guy doesn't read too good. Also there are dozens of us who dont shoot on sight!
---
 Just head to the lumbermill south of Vault 76 once in a while, tons of wood there.
---
It seems to happen with increasing frequency the longer we go without new content.
---
When the game launched I was shocked by how cooperative and kind the community was.  In those days I loved taking a workshop just to play with the bae building mechanics.  I would have the same workshop for hours while repeatedly doing the defend events and hopping from workshop to workshop to help others with theirs.  Folks would routinely stop by, help out, and move on.  These days I don‚Äôt even stick around for the initial defense attempt as I know I will be murdered.
---
It got ugly before Wild Appalachia and I suspect it will continue to build up until Nuclear Winter.
---
I had hoped that the launch of the survival servers would give the folks looking for this outlet a place to satisfy their urges but apparently it‚Äôs more fun for them when the other party doesn‚Äôt consent.
---
Well hopefully they can add some stuff to flesh Ultracite out a bit in the future. Your vision of terrorizing the wastes with a flaming chainsaw in Ultracite sounds fuckin rad lol
---
It's called "Plan: Signs and Letters", and it's in the list for BoS (Watoga) and Raider vendors. I've seen it at both the Pleasant Valley vendors, but I'm not too sure about the other raider stations. As it's a random spawn chance, server hopping for it should work if you're desperate. I don't think it's particularly rare though.
---
decontamination shower seems to only take one at a time also
---
I might have to start doing that. I‚Äôve got a vending machine full of free ammo and aid for low levels right across from the Overseer‚Äôs camp, but everything gets taken by high level players. Including the damn salt and pepper, which pisses me off more than it probably should.
---
I've found 7 in total.  Best scavenger hunt ever.
---
&gt;By your logic, the game, with all its issues, should not release a single new thing, including PVE content until all the issues are fixed. This includes the last patch everyone loved so much.
---
This is exactly what I mean
---
Yep, i‚Äôve got one for the submachine gun that won‚Äôt attach.  There‚Äôs probably more.
---
never argued video games were real life, just think they should fix ongoing issues because ignoring them won't work
---
And those 5 foundations glued to the back of my house aren't holding anything up. If they were gone **MORE** of my home would be accessible. So please if you would be so kind as to let me remove them like the build budget cancer they've grown to be?
---
Did I ever say that dumb dumb? They should fix the game breaking bugs, stability issues before they introduce any new content which break it further.
---
Yeah it's a bug. If you can, relog. Then it'll show you your actual weight. You have something counting that isn't there anymore. Happens to me a lot. Or something stopped calculating in when it's actually still there.
---
Rare fellow to find.  I have four level 100+ characters and have encountered him exactly 3 times in all those hours.  Memorable when it happens.  Good luck!
---
I just checked my emails and... It hasn't been sent yet.
---
Good idea. I use it with my medic to notify my team when I drop drop bags with  stmpacks and med supplies.
---
What if he cannibalized someone?
---
That's just wild.
---
I use:
---
https://www.falloutbuilds.com/fo76/builds/
---
Haha hell yeah! I want start THAT faction.
---
I have 4 bare ass walls and a mattress on the floor....
---
Sorry man pc master race
---
This E3 is a smash for me.
---
F76, DE, ES6, BL3, CP77, and also a few Nintendo things I'm far too manly to admit.
---
I find it sold at player vendors for a cap per round all the time.
---
Can‚Äôt agree more.  I guess I‚Äôm just irritated because I correctly assessed how to deal with my assailant (attacked me unprovoked, low DR, low health), but I threw caution to the wind instead of analyzing my surroundings (Whitespring Train Station...typical place to be ‚Äúmugged‚Äù).  I ‚Äúwon‚Äù fair and square but this jerkwad had an unsportsmanlike ace hidden in his tightly whiteys.
---
Bugs...bugs never change....
---
They took our jerrrrrrrrrrrrbs!
---
Except in MGS4 when "war... Has changed" lol
---
So.... endless clips? I'm sorry but that really doesn't appeal to me - just imagining an endless harpoon gun or dragon makes me feel hard with rigor mortis.
---
Sorry, I already have vampire 3 stars handmade so I don't need it. It is a decent weapon so I think you can sell it easily. Good luck!
---
Very true, watched a horde of them maul me and several other players to death many times over. It is till this day the best 76 experience ive had. It was a Horde Event in savage divide. I was after it for atleast. 1 1/2 and never killed the alpha, died many times as it kept spawning more bears. Glowing, Dusky and legendary Dusky. Prob 5-7 bears at any given time.
---
Better yet. Fallout 3 wastes as a 76 expansion. Like Morrowind for ESO
---
I don‚Äôt think it would have been nearly as bad as a death match but in a way, I like that there is a group risk. You can either under estimate one guy and the whole group goes down or vise versa. Plus the idea of potential factions would be nice. But they kind of ruined that concept by allowing people to join all factions through quests. They should have gone with a reputation style quest line where the more you do for a faction, the opposing faction dislikes you more and that‚Äôs how you create faction based enemies and perks. It could have been a concept for legendary mode and perk decks. Each major faction unlocks certain benefits while blocking others.
---
Gooooooooooooal!
---
Yup. Yesterday I went through the Russian Roulette process to remove "Eagle Eyes". I had 10 Mutations. TLDR: That was the second last mutation to go... lost eight useful mutations. Fortunately they are inexpensive now and I bought all the lost ones back again. Still - I'd pay 1000 caps for an anti-specific serum remover...
---
Is campfire the only event that gives possum badges?
---
The closest I've ever came is when I blew a scorched's head off and it kept coming at me, still yelling scorched stuff.
---
Then why do I not see cheaters right now?
---
I mean they could just cheat in items.
---
Ugh finding this quest is a bitch. Your best bet is to go to a monument, i went to the kelly monument in the toxic valley and server hopped.
---
[Vault-Tec still doesn't care about you]
---
This isn't a secret.The Austin studio was always intended to be the long term caretakers of the game. The Maryland studio is moving on to develop Starfield and TES6.
---
I think you'd actually be really surprised how many people try out a BR mode for 76 during like a free weekend or something. Just pure speculation by me but I bet you get a lot of people who wouldn't look twice at the game to try it out
---
Was honestly thinking of doing that at wavy Willard. Thanks I'll keep trying.
---
Id help out but I'm busy at the moment, good luck
---
I think the confusion stems from the fact that the new gamemode seems to be in fact named Nuclear Winter, but the next DLC wave is also named Nuclear Winter. It'd be like if they named Wild Appalachia the survival DLC and then also released a survival mode within it 
---
It reality maybe the mode gets a different name, might just be called NW on the roadmap
---
I don't think you're really blowing the lid off some deep, dark secret like you think you are. You could say the same thing about pretty much every DLC Bethesda has ever released.
---
Where can I read about this?
---
Whut's dat swattah yer swangin?
---
Now I'm getting the understanding. Thanks
---
XD
---
No worries. I was super bummed when I found out the 4 broken ones I was carrying aren't a dropable item.
---
Bloodied +40% Power attack +Str ü§ò
---
People aren't pvping because it's broken.  A no legendary mode would make pvp playable
---
Looks like a modified handmade. Ive got one in my stash, I‚Äôll confirm in a bit.
---
When I first saw this I thought you wanted the devs to add the army facility of the same name near Paris, KY to the game....
---
He also shows up often at wavy Willard's next to a car and the front entrance to white springs where fast travel drops you
---
Yo call me stupid but wat does E3 mean exactly
---
He already has, his player base ohhhhhh
---
Message me
---
The game itself isn't bad. The state of it is.
---
Not everyone's opinion. I like pvp, and I'm not a duping lvl400, shocking! People get so mad because one more pvp thing gets added. If it's not 100% PVE content, this board flips.
---
That would be awesome
---
Nice thanks
---
It's almost like the new mode can make balanced pvp
---
Does it drop high level or something? I don't think ive seen it
---
BR didn't help Battlefield V. 
---
I have, and enjoy BFV, but Firestorm isn't why people bought the game. I think EA realized this when they just recently removed a popular BR mode, and a month later reveal 6+ new maps and more MP content.
---
I can't picture a BR mode working in the Fallout universe, and I really hope it's something new. Hell, even Survival Mode (minus the beta), where we are forced to keep characters within that Mode would be fine with me.
---
I completed the weekly challenge by wearing an enclave officer uniform and hat. The outfit that worked for me for the last daily challenge that required formal wear did not work for the weekly challenge, it seems to be much pickier.
---
My wife found out the easy way that Fashionable Glasses count
---
Have you heard of GTOA 
---
They made millions from shark cards. Very much like atoms
---
You don‚Äôt design a game with back end server infrastructure requirements with out some way to monetize new content
---
Granted FO76 at launch was in much worse shape than gtao at launch
---
But both games had bad starts
---
Nukes are kinda like hand grenades.
---
Yep, there's even the giant mural in the Kansas state capital building where he's front and center. He was pretty instrumental to Kansas being free state and Bleeding Kansas, the precusor to the Civil war.
---
This, right there. I felt they were lazy when making the 4 horsemen change  armor types (visually), but your point is even better, they should make paint jobs from the shop usable on each type of armor.
---
Anywhere else you know of? I have the Kelly monument and wavy Willard but idk where else they show up
---
If this is happening literally every time you play then there is a reason for it. I don't mean you are doing anything to instigate it or that it is your fault, but it's too often to be random chancers. 
---
I play the game every single day, have done since beta, and I have never been griefed once. Not one single time. 
---
Is it the same group attacking you each time? Any particular IGNs pop up more than once?
---
I get it from the queen and every 3 star legendary enemies
---
Easiest is to server hop giant tea pot as hes usually right infront on the table
---
If I had a service rifle and ballistic fist that would be amazing.
---
Cool thanks
---
They are indeed hard to get. I got mine upgraded from a friend who owns the plans and I'm currently raising my luck to try and get them myself.
---
Literally this. Everytime I see a chemistry workbench sell for &gt;5c I'll just skip looking further.
---
It‚Äôs not about how the fatman is on release, it‚Äôs about what it becomes later
---
Thank you
---
Many of those TSE weapons were likely created from duping, so.. cheaters.
---
I loved that movie
---
So you are saying there should be more players on a server?
---
Thank you for the suggestion, I got some of my favorite screenshots added through the PlayStation Apps!
---
ah, i see. by holding the build button within the ring you can contest from any point
---
You can't.  We don't know how it works, but you'll be able to do something with level 50+ characters to make them better in some way.  Not sure if it's 're-rolling' and starting from scratch with more SPECIAL points to level up with, or more powerful Perk cards or what.  My guess, for ease of management, is the former.  It'd be easier for Bethesda to give us more SPECIAL points to get as we level up a second time.
---
I had no idea that you could pick out a new profile pic while looking through photo gallery as you ran around on a character! Instead, on PC, I would go: Documents &gt; My Games &gt; Fallout 76 &gt; CharacterPics &gt; \[you'll see a folder or more labeled with numbers - those are your different characters\] &gt; \[ProfilePicture.png\]
---
I've edited my profile pics to show what builds I'm using on each of them. You could also switch them out for whatever else.
---
Worth it.
---
I'd love dogs in the future as well but the Automatron stuff is just sitting there waiting to be used, and the Wastelanders last icon seems to hint at this. Dogs, I'd like them to put some effort into making different breeds we could get.
---
Technically yes they do. More int more exp gained from mobs.
---
I‚Äôm so hyped. Partially for E3, partially for the end of our giant sales event at work
---
Honestly, a BR mode might make PVP actually happen. Right now, Survival is just "Fallout 76, but random schmucks can shoot me", which was \*demanded\* back during launch, I might add. It has a mild flavor of PVP, but it's mostly the same shit but with griefers. A BR mode will have objectives of some sorts, some sort of pressure to get players to fight, and most importantly, it wont be wishy washy about it.
---
Idk man but I hope he‚Äôs actually serious for once and talks about the genuine issues the game is facing. Like I love a good Todd meme but I need some heart to heart talk.
---
That's not a backpack though, you can't put anything in it.  It's a mobile communication platform.  Satellite phone, radio, whatever.
---
Assuming it actually is Battle Royal, instead of something else. My understanding was that it was not confirmed beyond audio files that imply something like that.
---
And even if it is, \*why do people care so much?\* Yes, I hate Fortnut and UncertainEntity's Fighting Arena, but FFS, you and I are not going to be playing it, now are we? Let those that want it play (because let's be honest here, Survival is \*barely\* pvp), and let us enjoy all the other shit that we're going tog et along with it.
---
I got it with a level 35 tse 50 cal. My other guns didn't but that one still does.
---
Stimpaks, healing and chems: chemist is double product when making chems and super duper is 30% chance to get double that
---
Materials use the scrapper intelligence perk, do a few locations picking up junk and scrap all weapons and armour and you'll get most of the materials you need, springs you can farm at camp McClintock, plastic at AVR medical, sugar Grove is good for screws and springs too
---
Get the excavator armour, with calibrated shocks it's 200 bonus carry weight, it weighs 10 on a chassis so just carry and wear it when overencumbered and keep looting
---
If you're on Xbox I can make those
---
The landscape feels a lot less empty once you get to know some people, there's always someone wanting to do something
---
No it's a well known fact that the number of players pvping are in the single digit percentile, and the low single digit percentile at that. If I had to guess I'd say about 3-4%, but that part is actually just my educated guess and not fact.
---
Hey may mention something like ‚ÄúI know we had a bumpy launch‚Äù but I heavily doubt he‚Äôs going to use the stage to discuss all the issues with the game, rather I think he‚Äôs going to spin it into a positive and talk about all the ‚Äúgreat new content‚Äù coming for the game. That‚Äôs just how he‚Äôs always been
---
Itll come. They're adding displays for weapons eventually, so power armor will come, especially since the display can be found standing in the building where the excavator plans are
---
Yess ^^^^^^üôÇ
---
Scream a little angrier, can't make sense of what you are yelling about.
---
They need to update that
---
**Everyone** with a duped weapon, even if they bought it from the market, is a cheater.
---
We know a tiny bit, we know you get a character reset option to some degree at lvl 50, we know you go back to lvl 1, and we know each time you do this you receive "new and powerful perks". Beyond that, we're in the dark.
---
I just imagined master of disguise in X-01 turtling with those massive shoulders lol
---
Oft I made once with 30 $ and an air compressor
---
some random lvl 35 nightvision handmade i found lvling
---
Not going to lie, I'd cheer him on just for the balls to do it.
---
So disappointing slapping the drum mag on and getting... 35 bullets.
---
I would rather see him step down from his position..
---
Some things and thoughts are just too little too late.
---
So that's still anecdotal then.  
---
Look, I'll agree that most people playing right now are doing PvE.  But that doesn't mean that no one wants to play PvP, it just means that the PvP experience that we're getting right now isn't fun.  Can you really blame them for trying to find something that works?
---
Not screaming. I'm just calling out the complete brokenness of this "PvP". You should not be able to be able to one shot or be one shot by players. That takes no skill and isn't fun.
---
&gt;  If the new mode is Battle Royale I wouldn't honestly care. It's free content at the end of the day and we're getting soooo much more like the Vault raids.
---
Has anyone played with the possibility that it could be the vault raids that are BR? As in, only the last player standing gets all the loot?
---
You blame Todd for fallout 76?
---
you can buy the plans from the vendors in the mire, i think watoga. you can also find them in the world or from event rewards. its a very popular late game choice but you can technically buy and craft them at lvl 1-10
---
The evidence is utterly and totally overwhelming that it will be a crappy forkknife mode. It's 99.8% confirmed at this point. The last 0.2% will come tomorrow.
---
I don't count workshop captures as PVP. I literally just hop onto a server where it is not held, take it, and hop out so the next fellow can do the same. Not once have I entered PvP, even when there were other players there (I asked, they gave the okay)
---
25c for CAMP stuff, 50 for Weapons/Mods/Outfits
---
Like, say, a battle royal mode? \*exaggerated wink\*
---
And it would have happened if not for the MASSIVE backlash against it.
---
Do the daily quest 'Queen of the Hunt' over in the mire. It starts at the hunters cabin up in the northern area of the mire, somewhere close to Abbie's bunker. It will put a few locations on your map that you have to go check for cryptids. If you're lucky, you'll get a flatwoods monster. 
---
Try to limit how much you fast travel, and actually head on foot from place to place. I've run into it at least 2 or 3 times in the last week just wandering around. Even had it spawn just outside of my camp yesterday. Ultimately, just play the game normally while wandering around instead of fast traveling and you'll eventually stumble across one.
---
Assassin's gear with either sentinel or cavalier. Power armor is overrated in PvP.
---
vertibirds with miniguns
---
so the people who have no idea where the weapon came from are cheaters? you sound like the victim here
---
They are built into your game's files so technically anyone can access them. Afraid I havn't seen them uploaded anywhere outside of said clickbaity youtube videos.
---
Got em
---
Yea while I'm more like a very guy I just wanted to stop getting one shotted
---
\*Heavy Breathing\* "TSE Shotgun, please"
---
"Here you go"
---
\*Sounds like someone eating corn chips\* "TSE Shotgun, please"
---
\*More static than a cat in cling wrap\* "TSE Shotgun, please"
---
[PvE guy] sorry
---
The only way you won't get one shot by a melee build is if their build is bad. Melee is extremely OP. There may be perks that can help like dodgy or serendipity.
---
hi hve you found it yet i tried everything too about to just do events and see wht i get.
---
Ok thanks
---
Yup. Gotta hop out the PA and put on the expensive assassin's sent BoS heavy combat armor 
---
I've seen a lot of Unyielding sent/cav go into PvP also. Plus you'd one one piece Chameleon.
---
If I recall, the vault raids were specifically mentioned as end game PvE.
---
Yeah, and Vettel has the pole position, so it might become an interesting race, for a change. That is, if he manages to not crash with Verstappen in the first round, somehow...
---
Ever heard of catharsis?
---
Got any idea I could use of put up my build to use heavy weapons and power armor
---
Depending on interest we may be able to have 2 going at once. Not a lot of traction currently but I'll be posting the notice again Wednesday as a free ammo advert rather than a raider thread
---
They basically have that in 4 through the CC shop. Would not be hard to port it.
---
I had one... scraped or accidentally....fuck me
---
Not only does it need to be from a random spawn point (meaning anything that always spawns something is not going to be tameable) but the tameable creatures are only level 1-30 depending on the type.
---
Man thatd be great except for the people that actually ordered them wouldn't be the ones getting them, it would just be fans who showed up to E3. Not trying to crush your dream I just think it would be better if he hand delivered them or had all the postmen wear vault suits or something.
---
Electronics Entertainment Expo, as far as I remember.
---
Ok so why do you want them? You're lonely?
---
Back during pre-launch they mentioned mods/private servers being at least a year out. I am guessing that's not going to be in this year's show other than "we're still committed to blah blah blah"
---
Nope. You don't have the same damage mitigation in PA no matter what build.
---
How did I admit I was crying buddy? I don't see that anywhere.
---
You can't tame anything that always spawns, those are just regular enemies. Tameable ones spawn in alone level 1-30 based on type, only at random event locations around the map.
---
It may help offset all the "booing" he's going to receive for the first time. So not a bad idea.
---
Electronic Entertainment Expo, or something like that.
---
Oxhorn hates gay people. Simple as that.
---
Well I was planning on starting a new character I know what kind of build I'm doing
---
PC... Place the camp on the bridge edge itself to get the height. You'll want to try and capture as much of the far pylons as possible. From there it's really about how you line up the foundations at the base of the bridge pylons and set their height. I'll usually build up from the bottom first with standard stairs to confirm the top lines up, then deconstruct the temporary stairs and structure before using the stair stacking glitch to build the main stair column. After that it's just being judicous with how you set the flooring, since any mistakes are likely to mean that you have to start over, given the limitations of the stacking glitch.
---
Well Im on now if anyone would like to "off themselves to help me :) JanynFletcher in game...PC
---
Same
---
Outstanding build.  Thank you for sharing!
---
What platform
---
Could you define "wander and scavenge" in the context of what you said?
---
Ps4 sorry
---
Sure it does, it kills it's user quite frequently when somehow the explosion goes off at your feet despite landing 500 yards away.
---
You can compare some stupid noodle vendor you like because "he's so quirky Lol!" All day but the truth is any modern Beth game has shit npcs and 76 is gonna be no exception.
---
More sneak perks and gear, thats the only way i can compete with teams of people
---
That‚Äôs ok! I wish you were on Xbox I would find it for ya!
---
Yes, please. I have been searching for the damned Fashwhatever Balloon Plans since vendors launched (they'd make a great way to enhance my "find the vault boy" game). Even got a guy who has one, but is never on because life got busy for them.
---
PA is a joke for pvp
---
Just wondering this today^
---
Tried that. They don't seem to have much market for non-god roll weapons and armor now days.
---
You can see the struggle they experienced with the holotapes buddy. You don't have to be there to feel it, put yourself in there shoes. You can obviously feel the basics of a war veterans pain, you can do that same thing with a dead box. You, my friend, don't seem to understand.
---
Thanks is the mistress of mystery stuff God for stealth builds or is it worthless because of legendary?
---
(0\_0)
---
(Slowly backs out of the room)
---
Yea I realize that now. But that account was mostly for PvE not for pvp I just wanted to stop bin gone shot
---
As long as the new quests can be played in any game mode I'm happy.
---
Where'd you find 'em at?
---
Ive heard its suppose to be good for sneaking but it doesnt really show how much it effects sneaking, so i havent used it much since ive got to higher levels. I have a set of armor all with harder to detect, some with chameleon.. made a huge difference for me. But id use the garb of mysteries if i didnt have anything else. And make sure your sneak perks are maxed
---
You have to scrap them that‚Äôs the point ü§£
---
Thanks for the advice
---
You find them literally everywhere in metal containers or footlockers.  Sometimes on gulpers.  It‚Äôs an effing crapshoot.  Good luck took me a month ü§£
---
Someone has been getting rekt
---
Glad I could help, fuck :|
---
they can take the model and remove the straps it would not be hard
---
I'd point out that this is a poll of people on this specific subreddit, who are presumably die-hard fans who got in on it as soon as possible. People who came into it later presumably aren't such super-avid Fallout fans that they take part in Fallout-specific subreddits or contribute to polls about it.
---
In fairness, most people are in the majority.
---
yeah but it would look great as a backpack skin
---
I've not been getting rekt. I've been one shotting and getting one shot and it's garbage. How in the world are fallout players of all people this cancerous?
---
Yes, it is a photomode pose. You can buy it from the atom shop for 150 atoms.
---
Paddleball Vs. Paddleball
---
At least with machines, you can't get the rare individual that disco's 'accidentally' after getting your half of the deal... :)
---
have an upboat
---
Danke.....honestly these last few few scout badges are giving me something to do while waiting on new content..
---
I'm not selling the extra hides.  I'm just giving them to my friends that need them.
---
I can,  bored and down.  If you have a headset and still on message me,  psn LostKind
---
It ain't for me ... I've never done Hunter/Hunter nor have I done Survival, so a battle Royale mode? Not for me.  
---
But SOME people will dig it and for them, I say shine on you crazy diamonds! Enjoy teh game however you want!  
---
I mean, hey, I'm questing to gather every single cooking recipe so I can be the best chef around, and last week I sold off all of my Brain Bombs ... Royal Jelly's a pain to gather but still cool to make stuff with! But I imagine this playstyle would bore other people to death. Its all cool! Everybody gets to enjoy teh game their own way.
---
One shot isnt the problem with me. Im a sniper build and with my tse dragon i can one shot most people with 2500, but definitely not everyone and it took me a long time to be able to get my damage up like that, its not easy. My griefs with pvp are that you cant put bounties on people and camps are unbreakable if you havent engaged pvp with that person. Also its a pain having to run across the map to catch up with people on the leaderboard, would be nice to have some more spawns. And some more rewards
---
 I sell Stimpacks, I don't use em' much. I actually ran out of springs today. First time in months.
---
 Fallout 4 is boring compared to Fallout 76.
---
My buddies and I had a rad roach that we couldnt kill... I would use my tesla and its health would go down to a sliver and come right back.
---
I wonder what the rules are on that stuff though, there might be more complicated situations Bethesda might not wanna deal with.
---
I'd like it if they did port some CC stuff over to 76 tho.
---
In my experience it's a bad idea to server hop this item. I just coughed up the caps to fast travel to each location.
---

---
they call you "The Creeper".  Jokes aside, the Overseers Camp box is a great place to leave stuff for low level players.  Another thing to do is place your camp in the forest.  Moved mine from the Mire to the southern forest area this past week and had numerous below level 30 players asking for help.
---
If you like survival pvp im your guy
---
damn...
---
Lol my daughter loved it also! Lol she remind me of poppy!
---
Cool. Im level 43 idk how i missed it for so long
---
I'm on a boat and it's going fast and..
---
Thank you so much AVxVoid, I literally couldn't have done it without you :)
---
I just keep my Gamma Gun on me and shoot the floor
---
If by Canvas Bag you mean his scrotum, then holy shit it WILL be great!
---
Yeah,  it's a bit upsetting they aren't terrifying like in 3 or NV.  At least knowing there are 5 high level Deathclaws out for your ass specifically would be mildly threatening.  
---
They need inherent armor-pen again at least.
---
If you think this is cancerous you're fucking delusional
---
What level are you? and I'm PvE
---
Damnit, why you gotta be on PS4 üò≠
---
Lol yep
---
Oof, -60.
---
Gatling gun is better imo. Slower fire but packs a punch. Gatling is my go to for scorchbeasts in the air.  
---
Although If you get a great legendary on the .50 cal, then it becomes much better considering the rate of fire. 
---
Also ammo for Gatling is cheaper and you won‚Äôt run through it
---
I'm trying to launch a Nuke legitimately and not by using a code generator, i am using my pencil haha
---
you know i am going to thoroughly enjoy nuking Morgantown
---
How recently was this? I've been at it for days and believe they removed it from loot tables because it'll be an atom shop item soon
---
This is the best flare gun suggestion I‚Äôve seen so far.
---
IS IT STILL HAPPENING?
---
Yep very frustrating also seen it happen on SBQ,  ten or more heavy gunners going hard and old Queeny goes silvery with no damage whatsoever.
---
I‚Äôm gonna be there
---
Most of my ammo goes-to my AK. Im also a lvl 30 that foght a lvl 68 super mutan for power armor
---
Well, consider how each weapon functions. On one hand, the Gatling gun is a slow firing, high damage weapon. On the other hand, the 50 cal is the inverse, or opposite. It also depends on how much of each ammo type you have available.
---
What's the regular one?
---
Hear hear. I don‚Äôt want to play PVP all that much personally, but if you do? You do you. I do like that you get a chance to get a unique weapon in PvP mode too. That‚Äôs great for all of us who love collecting weapons.
---
YES COME
---
Did you ever find a fix for this? I also have this problem running 5760x1080
---
I have unlimited 10 mm a good amount of 50. And no 5mm
---
IM COMING
---
Hit the ‚Äòstore‚Äô button and it should break up all the pieces in your camp. Sucks, but it‚Äôs the only way sometimes to rebuild.
---
Would still work for that... only if at an event you would notify the server you want help.
---
But doesn't  the items in 'store' take up space in the budget?
---
It‚Äôll cost 62 caps though. (43 caps with the travel card, however.)
---
Glad you like it.  Please upvote for visibility.  Maybe will get lucky and a dev will see it.
---
If you get the ammosmith perk, you can make 180 rounds per batch of materials at its max rank. I believe it‚Äôs at level 32 that you unlock that perk. In my personal opinion, I‚Äôd say the Gatling gun might be better. It does very well against more tanking enemies, while a 50 cal is better for things like ghouls and scorched.
---
Well we learned everything he did both good and bad
---
Like the time he killed a family ( who didn‚Äôt own slaves and where only pro slavery)
---
Or the time he like started a small battle which was kinda the first battle in the civil war( if I remember correctly)
---
I personally like the story of the sacking of Lawrence,
---
This one dude who was a notorious slave tracker(I think) after admittedly some Men killed about 10 people in an event. So he makes the decision to go to the town of Lawrence and burn the whole place down while shooting people ( I believe 500 people died)
---
This is just what I remember from Kansas history
---
Where and how
---
Yes, you use those pieces to build your new camp without using up resources
---
You are allowed to like it. That doesn't make it good.
---
I believe ammosmith is under agility. You‚Äôll need a good amount of gunpowder, lead and steel. Bring them to a tinker‚Äôs workbench, that‚Äôs where you craft ammo.
---
If it can make balanced PvP that is fun and has a reward system, great. But if Bethesda could do that, they would've done it before launch.
---
*lets do this sound affect from CID plays in background*
---
He very much was
---
Ok...I'll give it a try. Thanks
---
Them bad reviews really hurt the game from getting new players.  Bad launch = bad for games.
---
I guess I just really want to know when PVP became this. I stopped playing for a while because I got bored and came back within the past month and all the sudden my self and everyone else is insta killing other players. Before the PvP was actually a fight and it was fun now it's stupid.
---
Get off the internet, you‚Äôre dead Hunter.
---
I drop propaganda or you've been insulted lol. Thousand caps for a serum I see constantly for three to four hundred? Good luck with that
---
I feel you, before this game even came out and people were already going off on it I thought this would be a case of No Man's Sky; a rocky start on a climb to a beautiful mountain top.
---
R u still down
---
You can server hop at the pond at the top of the mire that has a crashed vertibird in it - this is a random spawn location and you might have to hop for quite a bit to get one but this is where I have tamed all of my deathclaws - I have also tamed a molerat, mongrel, house cat and snallygaster from this location
---
Yep - I have one set up for my character who makes his money off hunting and butchers bounty because there is practically no wood in the mire but I still like living there.
---
If you want to role play a lumberjack there is a lumber resource you can build on just south of the lumber mill in the northwest corner of the map.
---
ps4? if so I could use some squadmates.
---
Take a gold for that
---
Going to the Purveyor is not for the faint hearted.
---
Twice I've been there when this occurred. It seems completely random. Both times for me it was a bloodbug.
---
Gabe Newall (however the fuck his last name is spelt) could have beent his much of a meme lord. Todd howard may have made Fo76 a horrific shitpile on release, onyl now it's tolerable and a bit enjoying to play now with all the updates, but goddamn the MEMES this man creates unintentionally are everlasting.
---
I wonder if the scorchbeast sonic attacks can be picked up in this way
---
Don't forget to grab super duper from luck, ammo will come quickly
---
Also, late night player in the US, I play anywhere from 8:30pm-4am.
---
and yet the survey that guy did with over 1500+ people only 6% like pvp on a multiple choice.  That means only 6% of players only like pvp in any way shape or form and not jsut like pvp the best.  That is abismale.  And FO76 Reddit is very PRO pvp in its tone as well. 
---
I see game companies do this time and time again.  Instead of growing their strengths they try to grow their weakness.  They see it as a business person would.  An untapped market.  As potential but it really is just killing off what makes the game marketable and desirable.
---
Oh hell yeah
---
It‚Äôs going to be worse than fortnite, I swear.
---
No they confirmed it‚Äôs a new gamemode on the road map.
---
Well I for one look forward to the inferno, Bethesda is going to light the fire with that garbage, I may as well bring the marshmellows and try to make the best of a terrible situation. (Maybe we'll get some good news too in the form of content real players actually want. I'd like to know more about the legendary player system.)
---
Wait, huh? Fatman doesn't do any damage? Daisycutter does. Is the Fatman somehow different?
---
Mods, this is a solid suggestion.
---
Super duper also works on cooking and crafting armor/guns, so anytime you're crafting anything doesn't hurt to pop it up.
---
Source? At all?...
---
It could be the game is recognizing it for the rifleman perks
---
Let me look...
---
Get a friend to make a new character then travel to you, you leave the server, have them place their camp down, join them again and it should tell you your camp cannot be placed yada yada, join anyways and then rebuild. It's tedious as shit but works for me when all else fails.
---
I have the powerful auto receiver on all my handmades - I think it has the most damage ( for auto ). Then I mostly use the perforating mag for armor penetration.
---
You can also scrap anything you have in the store column.
---
Not really ..  Nuka World?  Far Harbour?  .... not part of those original games in any way.  Same is true of the add-ons to Fallout New Vegas. ... none of them are like Ever Upwards and the Backpack or Anders and Bucket List.   
---
And no one has put up a convincing argument about them being anything but launch content not launched at launch.  Only that it might not have been held back due to it not being complete or bugged, but it might have been intentionally held back (making the launch content weak and seem unfinished) in order to have slowly leakable content to keep players playing, where they wouldn't have been able to stretch add-on content out for as long had they given these things at launch.  The game wasn't just buggy at launch.  It was empty.
---
...story of my life...
---
I craft those and sell them to the robot vendors and also have a machine at my camp where I sell them for 5 caps for others to buy to resell.  it's easy money/xp.  surprisingly sells really well at my camp.
---
People mostly go to that event to farm for possum badges so they want to finish it as quick as possible. The end boss is a lower level enemy so it's easy to one shot. It's not a good event to get legendaries from.
---
I finna got a sick pic
---
Thanks guys...got it sorted out...much appreciation for the responses
---
Had a guy shooting at my pet with a TSE shotgun and it was doing nothing so I'm not sure what to make of these situations, sorry.
---
Same, I‚Äôm wondering what suggestions OP mentions here that made it more enjoyable.
---
Hey there - You can find L50 Hand-mades at my  vending machines if you like - very cheap at around 60 caps. I have a Furious one which is my main weapon. I can make you one at a lower level if you like and option it up \[PC\].
---
I wore PA for the first 100 levels then went to body armor. I have 4 pieces with weapon weight reduction and now I can carry more weight than any of my PA suits that have calibrated shocks.
---
Which gun?
---
Oh ok, thx man for the reply
---
Honestly I would like to see all of the ones that would make sense.
---
Heavy Weapons
---
- Shoulder Mounted Machine Gun 
---
- Tesla Cannon
---
- Plasma Caster
---
- Arc Welder
---
Rifles
---
- R91 Assault Rifle
---
- Chinese Assault Rifle
---
- Service Rifle
---
- Semi-Auto Sniper Rifle
---
- Laser RCW
---
- LAER
---
Shotguns
---
- Riot Shotgun
---
- Caravan Shotgun
---
- Pipe Shotgun
---
- Lever Action Shotgun
---
Pistols
---
- 5.56 Pistol
---
- Plasma Defender
---
- Chinese Pistol
---
- .45 Auto Pistol
---
Melee
---
- Bumper Sword
---
- Rebar Club
---
- Cattle Prod
---
Unarmed
---
- Ballistic Fist
---
- Displacer Glove
---
- Industrial Hand
---
- Yao Guai Gauntlet [Not the Arktos Pharma weapon]
---
Those are the weapons that immediately come to mind but you get the point.  They are part of the world and some existed before the Great War and others can easily be made in the Wasteland, like the Bumper Sword.
---
&gt;Or the time he like started a small battle which was kinda the first battle in the civil war( if I remember correctly)
---
Yep, the Battle of Black Jack. I know that well cause my great-grand parents use to live right on the place where the battle took place. Now it's a national historical park.
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Black_Jack
---
Has it been stated officially? Most people assume that‚Äôs the case but I haven‚Äôt seen (or can‚Äôt remember) an official word on it.
---
I keep wishing it was August already
---
It's a logical thing, the playerbase is more than 95% pve oriented players, you don't spend half or more of the resources adding pvp focused content when almost none of your customers want or use that. It's like being a propane company in the arctic, and you decide to spend half your revenue from selling propone to try and sell ice cubes to your Eskimo customers.
---
The playerbase is fine. There are hundreds of thousands of active daily users. Sometimes i join a slow server then server hop and hit 20.maxed servers in a row. It just depends on how old the server you joined is.
---
Who cares? It's free anyway. You paid for the game and anything that they release content wise is free.
---
On the PC, but I modded my Unyielding chest armor to BoS/Ultralight and I think I accidentally fixed the Hunters Long Coat problem, unless it was something else, as you say it was Bizarre.  Since then, no more see through. I will post again if it comes back, but I am hoping whatever caused it is gone for good.
---
I don‚Äôt have a lot of hope for NPCs and single player style quests.
---
That‚Äôd literally be building a whole new Fallout game worth of content inside of an already 8 month old game. I think we‚Äôll get *something* the size of a regular Fallout DLC‚Äôs worth of NPCs and a few quests, but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to satisfy for very long. I think everyone wanted 76 to be Fallout 5 with multiplayer, and it‚Äôll never be that.
---
No the stings and wings and tidy ones can too.
---
What cheaters? Battle royal games tend to not let you use assets from earlier character development. We will probably all just spawn randomly and find weapons. I even bet they will let us literally pick up perk cards off the ground for in game.
---
Those level 300 dupers have a less than 1% chance realistically of having any advantage. If they do let us load our maxed put characters into the game with full pvp sets that would just be short sited.
---
You can see straight away if a player vendor is a waste of time or not. 
---
 Some have good gear that is super expensive - others shit items that are expensive.
---
Some have really good bargains.
---
Damn im on ps4

I'm going to put this on copypasta

Someone here ^ says 5/10/15% no confirmation.
---
Ah I'm farming badges lol, I have no backpack mods yet and the possum challenges are such a hassle to do
---
Again ... not really.  When there is a subscription fee to stay active, and the game was pre-ordered.  But this seems to not be acknowledged by anyone, nor is it what I am discussing.  It's off topic. 
---
The question is whether or not is seems like normal tutorial/foundational content added late, and no one is putting up a single convincing argument that it is anything but that.
---
Such a great group photo.
---
Just so everyone knows the PvP is still filled with one shotters in 2019 as well even after the nerf to 2 shot and explosive and it's honestly pretty garbage.
---
I used to have a handmade two shot rifle but i dropped it by accident and it fell through the map
---
I would be very pleasantly surprised, given there is a 0.2% chance of this coming true at this point. But hey, good on you for remaining optimistic.
---
I want to see a horde of Wanamingos! 
---
Make an underground cave dungeon full of the frightening Xenomorph-esque monsters. With skin that has resistance to anything but fire, and long tentacles to smack the life out of you. With a Wanamingo Queen and the end larger than a Deathclaw as you try to destroy her eggs.
---
They existed shortly before The Great War and existed at least until the events of Fallout 2. The only thing is they were only shown prevalent on the West Coast, but as an FEV Experiment, bound to be some colonies in the East.
---
Your being heavily downvoted but you are correct. That is not evidence of an absolute but conjecture based on personal experience. I think pvp is excellent in this game when it works. I spent hours hunting down players 1 at a time when pvp released.
---
Is it like this on the other platforms?
---
Starting to wonder if I‚Äôd have better luck if I wasn‚Äôt PC. Good luck finding your squad.
---
How do I enter ?
---
If the counsellor survives too long .... the fire goes out.  Event Failure.  Everybody loses.  They should have at least dropped whatever crap they picked off his body though... not like they need it.
---
Scorchbeast crap is the only place I've ever found them before.
---
Gt is cl88t
---
I wish I had that problem.
---
The event and daily quests are definitely the quickest way. I only did a couple of challenges and stopped when I realized a lot of them were bugged.
---
Thanks, these are actually really helpful tips. I'll definetly follow up on them.
---
I'm on PC and I almost never seen anyone, every day I see around 8 to 10 people on the entire map. All with incredibly high levels. I've bumped into a couple but they are always running off somewhere and never had a conversation let alone try to do something. 
---
I don't know if it's a timezone thing, a PC thing, I'm not sure how it works out but there is almost no one online
---
Granted it's probably a 1* but I'm 102, with no legendary armor lol, trying to get 3* heavy combat from purveyor so i can add the Bos material to it
---
Did you get message
---
I have a feeling that the servers are regional as I see the same folks time and again.
---
I‚Äôve seen you before
---
No i didnt get any messages
---
Is it faster to server hop for campfire or server hop and wait for night?
---
I am excited to see what‚Äôs to come in this game and hoping for Fallout 4 on Switch or a 3 remaster on the other consoles.
---
would LOVE Starfield to be a 2019 game but guessing not
---
I wish you all the RNG luck you can get ..... ;)
---
 My buddy has a base near the snake on the whitespring lawn where the small  stream that runs from east to west near a where the break in the wall protected by Robot is. There  is a chance for the monster to spawn at that location. That's where most of our crew has completed that atom challenge.
---
Make sure you make you character build correctly. Keep in mind that if you want raw damage there are a bunch of perk cards that all multiply it. If you search up 'nukes and dragons' on google you should get a fallout 76 build maker. And make sure you get mutations when you can keep them. If you have any questions let me know.
---
&gt;which was \*demanded\* back during launch
---
While true, let's not pretend it was much of a demand. Even the most recent survey shows that PvP is very low in the list of desirable features.
---
Apply the same thinking here. Is there much call for a BR mode? Posts and comments seem to indicate not.
---
While I agree with the OP about not going OTT about it, let's not pretend that it's a desired feature that people have been asking for.
---
Have to break it down
---
Not much actually. Many of the resources translate directly. Heroes of the storm devs comment about this "fan logic" all the time and how its not true. In reality for most games tons of content is started that never sees the light of day because it doesnt pan out properly. I get why it makes sense to think that BR would slow down your pvp experience, but in reality it doesnt at all. It is just another avenue for them to attract attention to the game "which based on this post is working", uses the already developed pvp tech they have and allows them to test it more openly on a broader scale and find and eliminate more bugs (which they will also create being them. 
---
The main reason this isnt true is that each developer has their specific part of the game they work on no matter the mode. The artists, the coders, the writers, ect. Pvp doesnt require much from the writers and artists or anyone else for that matter. Typically the people who would be working on this type to project are the team members who are meant to be working on experimental content and we dont know if any of that would have worked out either wasting even more time. Ita never clear cut.
---
Regular weapons and clothing found pretty much everywhere is a waste of time... players should just scrap it and bulk the scrap to sell which people would buy. 
---
Outside of legendary items, anything marked higher than at vendors I highly doubt will sell at all.
---
Couldn't you just rebuild your camp right off the bat?
---
&gt;There are hundreds of thousands of active daily users
---
Based on what data? Do Xbox or Playstation make numbers available? Bethesda certainly goes out of its way not to provide numbers.
---
It says it directly on the roadmap a few months back. This is confirmed.
---
What I did is server hop and if the event was up I would do it. If it wasn't up I would check the in game time in the pip boy and if it was close to around night time I would wait. The time it triggered was around 8 or 9pm I believe. It's been awhile since I did it so I can't remember the exact time but I remember an exact time I was able to trigger it.
---
It doesn‚Äôt speak on how it works.
---
Gee, just did my first launch 2 hours ago! I still have a key card to use but I‚Äôm east coast so it‚Äôs bedtime for my old bones now... lol
---
Must admit taking down the cargo bot is the hardest part for me (with my rifle build).
---
Go to Toxic Valley ASAP and begin the Ever Upwards quest line FIRST.  (Look at a Scout poster at a train station and accept the quest when prompted).  The backpack you get is game changing.
---
I usually see it go for 40-60 caps each
---
Same here. I drop some frames to lower levels to help out. I try to explain the "pick up" mechanic so they don't burn out their cores.
---
It was in one of the Bethesda blog posts about the legendary system. I can't remember which one though.
---
You can, however I've had mine glitch after being destroyed and not been able to move it, so this is my go to from time to time.
---
Run whitepsrings a couple times on the same server and look for patterns in the types of weapons and armor that's dropping. If you are looking for bloodied or unyielding and you are seeing multiple drops of those prefixes head over and give it a go. If the drops are stuff you would not want, stay away from the vendor. Also, the second and third prefixes seem to have a fairly good chance to be the same on each purchase so if you get shit rolls on the first go, odds are the same shit rolls will be on the next piece.
---
Whoa, he said he hit 20 max servers in a row (never hit one I know of). That‚Äôs, like, science dude.
---
&gt;Stimpaks, healing and chems: chemist is double product when making chems and super duper is 30% chance to get double that
---
How about when you were leveling I imagine you used them then?, I just don't think we should have to log in and spend two hours collecting components and then be able to start questing.
---
I come how from work and want to play something.
---
I don't come home and want more work lol
---
What if they do it like Fortnite and make the Battle Royale mode free and the rest of the game pay?
---
Stick to the forest for a while. The first town you come upon has a ton of stories in it... Its almost too much! Big exposition dump. Just take your time.. The quests will always be there. Id do the first few as they are kinda hand holding but if you get tired of it go wander and find some places!
---
After that town you kinda need to look for the stories so if your an explorer you will have a good time.
---
Yeh I sell mine for 50c each
---
Yeah I'll try it, I always try new modes in whatever games I'm playing, but I'm absolutely certain its going to be a ghost town a couple weeks after it releases.
---
Unless they tie some insane reward to it, in which case people will play it for the reward and constantly bitch about being forced to play it.
---
I'd like to see a rework. It's a neat idea the way it's implemented, but I don't think it's working as they intended. I really don't see them intending for players to constantly swap out cards depending on what they are doing at that moment.
---
It says everything the guy above said except the specific level of prestige
---
Yes very much a weapon to grab.
---
It's the only survival I have done since it launched haven't wanted any of the other weapons never appealed but this works on any level with or without bloodied build still strong for effort required to acquire it.
---
There was a massive backlash against repair kits and those went in. If the lunchboxes were lootboxes they didn't get into the game because of fans saying no.
---
Careful ... you are on shaky ground with down votes.
---
It's going to be a bit more difficult for someone who just starts tho.
---
And honestly, the clueless people who charge a hundred (no one buys them) make your 50 look way more appealing! 50 is a fair price but put them at 40 and they will move fast!
---
Link it.
---
That's what Epic did to Fortnite. Save The World had plenty of issues then they made the Battle Royale mode. That's not going to happen with Fallout 76 though.
---
They just did a huge data post. Did you not see the numbers from phase 1?
---
Thanks for the info
---
Like woah dude. Science. More conjecture based of experience. The player data post they dropped last week is really what shows.
---
Sell all chems except psycho and all its variants (psychobuff etc), anything diluted (except stims), all guns, all landmines, and depending on character, all missiles, mini nukes, fusion cores. Scrap everything else. Learn which junk gives what material. Except things you want or using obviously. Most importantly have fun.
---
Ps: if someone tells you to follow them and start taking you to a workshop. Run away from them.
---
Nah no pvp here, but after looking over the guide some more I‚Äôm gonna give the bloodied build a shot. Thanks again for all your advice and help!
---
I really dont think this game could ever be capable enough to be a successful br, and itd take a fundamental change to achieve that, and do we really want this game completely changing to become more like fortnite.
---
Here's something people are forgetting, the player cap is both due to gameplay and technical reasons. I don't see how a full battle royale mode would work in Fallout 76 unless they are secretly upgrading the netcode and renderer.
---
This is exactly what I have been hoping for and think it would take this game to another level. I dont think this is the direction it's going but we can dream.
---
&gt; Beware, the angry outrage youtuber posts are coming.
---
How dare they continue to provide free DLC their community enjoys and fix bugs. This is blatantly anti-consumer!
---
Didn't even think about checking the time lol
---
Shake it.
---
People! Bunch of Bastards!
---
Bop that shit
---
Fallout 4 was quite easy compared to F76. It does get easier as you level up  - I tried hard to get to Level 50 then backed off.
---
I have not played Fallout 4 at all since I started Fallout 76 ( a game I was not originally going to buy ).
---
Now I have many more hours in 76 than 4.
---
Waste your own time. Its the most recent post or second most on the site.
---
Twist it.
---
Are you on ps4? If your selling florescent I'd be intrested to buy some
---
When did we stop engaging in interesting discussions, I don't fear downvotes!
---
It's not about completing it.  Starting is easy.  3/4 of the tedious tasks on the list AND on the Possum list start counting ONLY once you start the quest.  You could literally have the majority of that stuff done, just playing the game (including scrapping DeathClaw Hides) by the time you are about level 35, and easily have the backpack at level 10 (the first level it is craftable).
---
Otherwise you have to redo all that tedious crap later .... after you start the quest at whatever level you are when you start.
---
Also weapon artisan and fix it good, both intelligence perks, let you repair weapons and armour to 200% durability
---
Yeah I'm not sure what would be going on there, the maps on Xbox usually have 20ish people, there are a lot who aren't much for talking though lmao
---
I'd say keep an eye on the Reddit subs for people looking for groups, maybe make a post of your own :) or if you meet someone working on the same quest or event as you use a wave emote and send an invite, friendly people do exist :P there's just a lot of jerks too lol
---
Yea PSN: D20Manning I think I have about 8 Florescent
---
Awesome how much per?
---
So what are you looking for as proof? A peer reviewed academic study?
---
If you look [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/bya94s/the_results_are_in_for_fallout_76_wild_appalachia/) you can see the most recent subreddit survey results which show that (at least for this subs population) players **heavily** favor PvE.
---
Even if the 'average' player is three times more likely to be a PvP player than someone who took the time to answer that survey, that would still be only ~20% of players.
---
PvE is heavily favored by players of Fallout 76.
---
Do you mean the one with the stats like Top 10 vendor items? If so, there weren't any stats at all regarding number of players, daily, active or otherwise.
---
Would you mind providing a link to the data?
---
Lmao
---
I'm guessing it triggers at like midnight lol, at this moment my pip boy says 11:30
---
Turns out they‚Äôre ballistic fiber bags
---
I've done that event so many times now that I can't get that damn bug song out of my head.  up to 7 badges at least.
---
This reminds me of a sketch from Monty Python's Flying Circus:
---
https://youtu.be/T-VFvlH0cQM
---
This was happening to a friend of mine today - we couldn‚Äôt figure it out either. At first I thought it might be because one of us had the very same card equipped but none of us did :(
---
Same happens to me and my team sometimes I‚Äôd love to know why as well
---
Don't forget the guys with the PA security guards!
---
I just want my backpack mods lol, 35 badges iirc
---
http://beesbeesbees.com
---
In the long run it is a smart thing to do,and he could also get someone to help to get it done sooner. do you happen to know if he would still be able to rent the high capacity backpack mod?
---
If you build back to them from a ground mounted point, then start deleting backwards from the furthest one from the ground mounted point, you should be able to get rid of them. The freedom they added to make it easier to lay down foundations on uneven ground added a deletion glitch if you remove them in the wrong order
---
Not sure what I just read here...
---
Are you talking about the Biometric cards?
---
Or the actual nuclear keycards? Cause those get **inserted** into the machine. Slurp, goneskies
---
Cryptid here also, being your cultist clothes,  let's do 2 challenges!
---
My fallout buddy sold a ton of flux for 100 caps a piece, so apparently some people are willing to pay that. Makes a bit more sense when you can turn it into serums and sell it for 300+.
---
If you want to clear stash space then 50 caps is fair enough.
---
It never stops happening to me
---
walk from Sugar Grove to Fort Venture.  usually get a flatwoods monster or a mothman spawn.
---
With better weapons you will have an easier time in game. Try and get the best Legendary weapons and armor you can. A lot is trial and error. People are always talking about their builds so take notice of what they say.
---
The game to me is a grind fest but you can get smarter about it.
---
I don't do the horde events anymore but if you're up to it Westek is generally rewarding. Not Watoga anymore.
---
WS is good for one star legendary and occasionally 3 star but a bit boring. The thing that keeps me playing is getting that perfect weapon(s) I suppose.
---
I doubt Todd has the balls to show up this year.
---
And then the agony of deciding if you're going to buy something from someone even though they have an annoying political message.
---
I am not jealous, i just don't like this is only build which is not boring, because u actualy can kill SBQ in minute without wasting 10k ammo.
---
I would likr balance, you know, like thanos did.
---
Yes that and couldn't find the link in a quick search. I do remember seeing some of the stats being things like "players killed by sheepsquatch imposter in the 10s of millions plus and since its a rare event with mostly only high level players involved it can be assumed that at the least the player base count is 1% of that number being in the hundreds of thousands... you seem like the kind of consistent downvoter who won't care what i say however and feels right in their original logic and won't be swayed and just downvotes even though that's not really how they work.. but i digress. Even if its player base is literally 100,000  which it is most certainly more than, its got a bigger following the heroes of the storm, starcraft and diablo 3 combined and they are doing fine for the most part. Slowed down but fine.
---
Wow, i will stop you right there!
---
Not really.
---
It would be even better if the cannon shot out refunds

Oh yeah sorry. Very tired half sleep post. I will fix
---
Todd is an Alpha Malle, he won‚Äôt be scared off by some trolls

Gotcha, yeah, super crap we have to get those every time...
---
Broadsider, no modifications required. Pour in powder, stuff bag in and fire. One flamingüî• bag delivered.
---
Yeah still happening and I‚Äôm on XB1
---
Does power user not help with that? That seems crazy to me, also maybe critical savvy? I think that's the one that makes you only use x% of your Crit bar
---
&gt;  nothing but positive feedback for the most basic of things.
---
"What do you most enjoy in 76?"
---
PVE: 65%
---
PVP: 6%
---
That is overwhelming positive feedback imo.
---
nothing but positive feedback for the most basic of things.
---
Funny thing is sometimes you pop into a camp, and some shits crazy overpriced, and other stuff is crazy underpriced. I've seen people with plans for 1000 that should be 50, and weapons for 1-2k that were over 10k. made lots of money this way. Some people just don't know the market.
---
What about the M1 Thompson? It‚Äôs so lame
---
fallout's main focus is PVE after all. if you want pvp go play a balanced game with balanced weapons. right now pvp in fallout 76 is just some dingdongs jumping around with 2 shot explosive legendaries, making u die with just 1 hit.  its kinda the only late game "content" u have...killing players and proof your build or whatever, but yet this game wasnt made for pvp. i dont see the point in making pvp a bigger part as long as they dont give us a new perk system with seperate characters just for pvp. RPGs are no freakin FPS games, they shouldnt stress you out in the way that you have to watch your back once u accidently hit a player while raiding blast zones...i mean wtf is this??? by far one of the most stupid things in FO76 and so are the weapons and/or builds of players when it comes to balancing  
---
this game needs endgame content...fast! even with the side quests you are more or less finished with the game once u hit lvl 60. gives us dungeons, give us challenges that are not taking stupid useless photos of things spending heaps of caps fast travelling around to get them, give us more tanky bosses not just 1 freakin endgame boss, .... and so on. they were heading in the right direction with the last patches but now kinda lost the focus on the right things, it seems.
---
You have to have 3 charisma per level on the card you're sharing (so a rank 3 would require 9 charisma). Temporary buffs and debuffs do affect this so if you have a base of 9 charisma and are afflicted with something like swamp gas or blight you won't be able to share. 
---
Conversely, effects like Unyielding armor or Magnetic Personality can allow you to share cards you otherwise wouldn't have been able to, however this seems bugged as I have to have several points higher than 9 to share a rank 3 and have it stay on, otherwise it'll show that it's shared, but unshare as soon as I start moving.
---
How about changing the assault rifle from 5.56 to 5mm? That way it doesn't get onto the way of the handmade anymore.
---
Did you walk up towards the campfire? It triggers once you get close. I would wait at the entrance until 9 or whatever and then walk to the fire to trigger it. I was able to do it consistently.
---
I have 9 chr, but 7 are actually points and the other 2 are from buffs
---
Yeah i gotta concur in this one, while i‚Äôm sure not everyone coming into survival is going to go after the guys at top and just want the extra experience, some people are going to come in and want to challenge that top spot.  Having an unfair advantage of knowing where they are at all times as well.
---
There's the problem then. Try getting it up higher.  I think when I was at 11 or 12 it let me share a 3* utilizing buffs even though my base charisma was 3.
---
Oh good you found it in the third one. 1.9 million killed by imposter. My memory was a little off. So lets go with my old logic. 1% of that would mean tens of thousands of active users. In reality many people probably are very casual with this game, or now own it but dont play due to its terrible release. My guess is a new mode and all these patches will convince old players to return but even still, if it doesnt, it has more active users than heroes of the storm or SC2
---
And just your time my angry bitter friend
---
Exactly how does what you just said relate to literally anything we‚Äôve been discussing?...
---
&gt;you seem like the kind of consistent downvoter who won't care what i say
---
Let's not presume what I am and let's go off what is actually said.
---
If you had the data, I would be 100% "oh that's interesting. good to know" and then know that said data exists for future reference.
---
Since I've seen no data it was clear either a) I missed it, or as it seems to be the case here, b) you just pulled that number out of your arse.
---
I care about factual data. If you got that data, more than happy to go by that. 
---
You know what, what you said could even be true. However, until we have said data, we're just making up number really, aren't we? 
---
Surely, that much you can agree on?
---
Agreed will probably repost this better in the morning.
---
You just posted the data in the third link
---
Sorry about that Deathclaw
---
 Hahahahahah
---
Wow youre really bad at getting proven wrong
---
guess we got a party crasher after all lmao
---
Not one word proved me wrong. We do not know how the ‚Äúlegendary player system‚Äù will work. If you‚Äôre actually going to continue from here I‚Äôll just leave you to it.
---
Emergency protocols for torso, targeting HUD for helmet and calibrated shocks for the legs. Arm mods doesn¬¥t really matter. I personally think the jetpack is overrated.
---
Most extended mags suck in this game, idk why they got nerfed so hard from fo4.
---
Compared to perforating or swift magazines, drum mags offer close to no benefit.
---
I have a furious explosive automatic pipe pistol but its disappointing when the max ammo in a magazine is 18 for a pipe gun.
---
Ah okay I loaded in and just chilled at the campfire
---
BATTLE ROYALE BAD. DOWNBOATED
---
Umm... where?
---
Come on dude, are you making shit up again? :)
---
 If you just do the quests they will carefully feed you everything you need. You do have to pay attention and loot with care, but its not hard.
---
 Later the game is a treat, and there's nothing really like it in Fallout 4 for late game.
---
I‚Äôd have to assume the survival player base is actually just that small
---
Will be interesting if we see an update to ‚Äúbeta‚Äù survival servers tomorrow.
---
Maybe an introduction of ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù survival servers as part of the nuclear winter update
---
Move your camp lol...
---
There's only like what....four turret options right? And if you feel like you'd have to snipe the scorched out of existence you'd be better off just moving your camp.
---
Left to go adventuring after the group photo and came across him in the parking lot and couldn't resist.
---
oh my god lmao
---
pro tip #5..... do not build c.a.m.p next to an enemy stronghold
---
Only 9 more homenoptera to go!
---
Just goes to show how broken tames are, my bear never came back so you are super lucky; enjoy it while it lasts.
---
There are points when you're diseased that pulls your special points down far enough to affect your perk sharing, always check your stats to see if your charisma is affected.
---
Camps being unbreakable is the #1 issue currently with pvp servers as they are currently.
---
Hopefully we see that addressed in the next game update.
---
Would be really nice if Bethesda decides to ditch survival beta, and introduce permanent servers where everyone starts at lvl 1, would balance the servers.
---
nope
---
My charisma says +9
---
2 caps each..... I'll be right over
---
I think what you‚Äôre trying to say is that you‚Äôre surprised that this isn‚Äôt fallout 5 and that you went into this not understanding what kind of game you were purchasing
---
Upvote submitted üëç
---
If i come across any good low level legendaries(usually from the leader of the pack event) i try to find a low level player to give it to especially if its a two shot or instigating weapon. 
---
And i also craft and mod strong low level weapons and armor when i come across when i come across a friendly low level player.
---
Did someone say free canvas pouches?
---
Any tips on how to choose a better location?
---
Haha small world. Maybe it just is that small of a playerbase.
---
That‚Äôs where mine is! Great location
---
where did you get the flooring that looks similar to the whitespring floor? was it in the atom shop at some point?
---
base looks great, really cool location
---
Some just want to see the world burn
---
Well if bullets are the problem, craft your own. It sounds to me you‚Äôre buying ammo from vendors which ammo is horribly overpriced at vendors. For some lead and steal you can make your own ammo for rifles at tinker workbenches.
---
If anything, bring a melee to take care of small week enemies so you don‚Äôt waste ammo on radroaches, radstag, gouls, etc.
---
one would hope they'd give them to the people that actually paid for one, and not toss them out to E3 attendees..
---
I think you can fit a few more cacti on the dresser to the left
---
Why do people keep bringing up the person's level? Everyone is the same after level 50, there's no benefit of leveling up.
---
Getting downvoted doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt any discussion
---
If you want to get different sets of power armor, say, for lvl 30, 40, and 50, loot a few chassis and fill those babies up with armor pieces. Then store them in your stash. Hoarding full sets with no chassis was a noob mistake I luckily did not suffer through long.
---
Get that shit outta here I don't need it!
---
It's like how certain years of a car model are better than other years, with changed interior parts or mechanical systems.  They've worked all the kinks out so it's way better than the 1st generation.
---
Ultracite is still new and wibbly.
---
Depends on what you want to do with your camp. If you wanna sell a lot of stuff out of vending machines, somewhere with a ton of foot traffic like around white spring. If you wanna be left alone...I used to have my camp built into a cave in the upper east corner just above the ammo factory and nobody ever came to visit. I did have an occasional spawn of super mutants or wolves but I had missile turrets that took care of them. Currently I have mine in the forest and see minimal enemies and not as heavy foot traffic as white spring.
---
This would be really cool I think. After all, the whole premise of the game is to rebuild and resettle Appalachia, right? A way in-game to streamline helping new players would be like carrying on what the Responders tried to do in helping survivors. Great idea! :)
---
In pc, with a little of patience and method, flux sells very easy for 100, Violet for more also.
---
I will happily spend 25K in flux at 50c right now! (100 of each flux).
---
This can happen with seemingly any weapon. Sometimes you just spawn in empty.
---
When is it starting for Bethesda?
---
Tweaked has the same damage plus extra crit damage. Probably not intended.
---
Check reply
---
Took me about 10-15 server hops at Wavy Willard‚Äôs, but eventually Ansel appeared
---
Are you winning
---
So no comment? Were you confused as to who you were replying to and about what?
---
You can do this too.  If you knew how to make a friend.
---
Not a bad idea, but I feel a sorting option for recent rewards would be better.

---
Find it.
---
Griefing is the most over used word of 2019.
---
Nope, i like 76 much better. Its fallout with friends, and for the last 3 weeks my wife has played as well. Its fallout where i show up to events and work with other people to kill scorchbeast queens, sheepsquatchs and whatever's in the basement of arktos pharma.
---
Timezone and have a mic?
---
Yea thats the cosmetic i use my brain cant handle it anymore haha
---
tbh if they say playable ghouls would happen as a skin due to a mutation I wouldn't give a fuck or due to an FEV quest
---
the game definitely gets easier as you level up. first character getting to 40 or so was a grind, now it doesn't matter what level or build i'm playing the games just more fun and easier. Having friends makes it easier to start, and then being leveled and geared makes it easier to stay. I got a crew now thats not the same crew i started with, my RL friends all bailed but my in game friends are tight.
---
It doesnt clip through armour but the cosmetics ive tried bos bomber jacket huter long coat recently tried that new stalker jacket clips as well
---
I dont wanna know
---
i think changing the handmade to 7.62 then adding something like a RPK as an early mid-game heavy weapon would be good
---
could also add another bolt-action (7.62x54r in a Mosin)?
---
AAA game with AAA bugs.
---
Thanks for your 'important edit' at the top. I had been trying out an auto plasma due to this original post and was wondering what was going on because the AP cost wasn't very good. Glad it's not just me.
---
Dont be in a huge rush to reach endgame. 76 is not like other MMOs, the main focus is the story. Enjoy the story, enjoy your squishy days terrified of deathclaws.
---
Do events, its a great way early on to get some xp and loot, and some simple plans to make your camp more fun.
---
Some people in the game suck, but for the most part it is a nice community. Dont be afraid of high levels running up to you, they may just want to dump stuff that can help you.
---
If you dont want to pvp, turn on Pacifist mode.
---
Death isnt too big of a deal, but be sure to stash your junk often. The people that suck will take your loot bag if they see it. 
---
As your mom would like to say, get well rested, eat well, and drink plenty of water. The bonus' may be small, but they help.
---
Lastly, have fun.
---
I've found that the rooves with either 2 or 3 open small peaks usually contain one roof option that will cover the space above a stair exit.
---
Once you find the one that works for your build you can work back from there to end up with a complete roof. It's not the prettiest option but it's better than holes in the ceiling.
---
I too had been making an energy weapons character. It took me 35 levels before discovering this. Oh well, it looks like it's ballistic weapons only for Vats builds.
---
What annoys me is that after you kill them, the bodies travel with you. After every day travel, the corpse spawns in a nearby structure a second later. I'm tired of having to server hop just to not have my camp getting humped by swarms of dead Scorchbeasts.

&gt;New Feature: Legendary Players ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Which does not explain the system nor say anything about more powerful perk cards.
---
Really? What you get?
---
Sorry for you there Sil. That can be pretty disappointing.
---
But try it again - not only because of the badges drop every now and then - but maybe you'll have the luck run it solo and then it's all yours!
---
*Always upwards.*
---
I was lucky enough to run them solo but my last run failed because I either ran put of wood or something, it wouldnt let me keep it lit
---
I‚Äôll be on today! Add me: CaptainModrah
---
its over already xD tomorrow for sure around 10pm central it be on again!

I was thinking more along the lines of ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a trader, do you want to see my wares?‚Äù
---
You only need unstoppables 1? Lucky! I‚Äôve been farming them forever and have only found issue 2... twice. It‚Äôs a nightmare. I‚Äôm going to post the grand total of my other magazines once I find all the unstoppables. It‚Äôs insane how rare they are.
---
No, I never have. But everyone running a wider resolution than 16:9 has the same issue.
---
I can feel the game breaking down already aaaand it crashed!
---
The moment when a single mole rat is tougher than a sheepsquatsh, a scorchbeast and a bunch of Mr Gutsy, fighting side by side.
---
*Priceless*
---
no solutions to this yet still an instant crash for me. I've just skipped over the quest in that place.
---
*...and then a police uniform wearing Responder knocks on the door...*
---
I saw someone had done that! I wondered what was going on. I didn‚Äôt take the cores though!
---
**Good Evening. Someone called... A STRIPPER?!**
---
Only if it makes the Boop Boop! sound and draws aggro.
---
Reading tonight while drink a coffee in the morning makes me giggle.
---
That's a bold statement.
---
If you think you could do the work that it would take to implement this into the game, I‚Äôm sure the developers could do it too but if not keep dreaming
---
I dont want survival scrapped personally. I like playing it especially with my camp and everything ive accumulated
---
*YOU...SHALL NOT...PASS*
---
Is this kind of a dating ad? lol
---
I built mine next to a Death Claw spawn üò¨
---
I can confirm the red dress works fine. Headwear isn't required but doesn't matter. I had a cowboy hat on with it and got it.
---
Time for a diet wolf lol
---
Same.  I‚Äôm still making them fight naked for them though.
---
Congrats! Good luck with the mag - hope the RNGods are with ya!

Guess the writing is on the whole in more than just one way
---
Yeah, It‚Äôs the Nailer

A Legendary Sacrificial Blade
---
So that‚Äôs where it comes from. Cool thanks for the info
---
If you invest in the Bear Arms perk you can drop the weight of the gatling and .50 MG both by up to 90% and pretty much just carry them both with you all the time. It doesn't reduce weight of them when in stash, only when carried.
---
Highly recommend that, because you'll also eventually want an LMG to add to the boat house because it's a lot of fun too. Oh and a mini gun. Just get all the heavy guns.
---
best example was S'mores...seen it mostly with prices about 1000 or little lower....today boutght 2 recipes for 75 each just to put em on sale for 500 which got bought pretty fast tho its still overpriced as hell.
---
but youre right! some players dont have a feeling for adequite pricing at all...
---
Nope, nothing
---
I played survival once (Australian servers) got a score of 3000 by killing everything in whitespring with power armour and explosives and feeling beast about it, next minute I‚Äôm lagging and I pull my map up to relocate to sell my legendaries... gets 1 tapped by a dude crouching with a rifle wearing nothing but a rabbit mask. I was bummed out to say the least.
---
I‚Äôve never played survival since but I miss the extra 20% experience.
---
made my day bro
---
Good job
---
Honestly all the reviews about this game were wrong due to people not getting what they want! It's cool they "listen to the community" but I like all the games they made before so I'll throw trust into them to make the game fun. If it's glitchy that's a legit compliant but also something I more or less trust them to fix. It hasn't been confirmed so why complain? When and if it is why complain more? I would like to see more helpful addition ideas and speculation on things we all want.
---
Before I did this I was constantly running low on every resource and could barely survive from place to place. Someone in here suggested to just go to places close to my base and take everything possible then scrap it all so I‚Äôd build a bank of resources and food. It really helped as I stopped running out of things so quickly.
---
Reminds me of when The Division launched, with the same limitations:
---

---
Literally got called a queue simulator :P
---
The bags will have actual bugs in them.
---
Survival is in beta so hopefully they can add special rewards or events you can only run in survival! I kinda want to see bigger stronger waves of enemy's at workshops! Like no dogs or rodents and more aggressive ai. Maybe even a scorch beast boss and wave amounts based on levels. Also more locations to farm glowing ones!
---
just a "History" tab in pip boy that shows all rewards/quest/playervending sales and items
---
On the vendors they are set for 250-2500. Which is a bit steep. The resources to build them are plentiful in a nuke zone and as frequently as folks nuke WS, there's no need to even launch a nuke yourself. The raw materials are a bit tedious but the super duper perk let's you win on that proc. The highest selling ones I've seen we're violet due to the abundance in demand for ammo crafting. These are usually at 100 caps bit fluctuate depending on the market. Most I've seen them sell for in the market is 200ea. The rest have varied between 40-100. I rarely see other fluxes above 100ea. This is because the demand is slightly lower and WS has an abundance of the non violet raw flux. The higher level areas seem to have the most violet per nuke surface area, which tends to be a little more risky on collecting materials. This makes them less likely to be nuked. Which is why WS is still the most nuked zone.
---
Lol sad that iv been griefed in adventure and not survival! If they add PvP modes they need to remove the blips off survival and add a bounty system on our personel  computer things. Random encounter are fun but not really being hunted for no reason.
---
Atleast tse was not mentioned üòÇ
---
It's annoying sure, but really you missed out on a lev15 basic legendary.  Unless you're sub-30 it's really no great loss.
---
Personally having the campfire accidentally go out is far worse - pretty much my main focus is tending to is.
---
Thanks!
---
Hey just read your post. What would you want for a lvl50 Fixer? Thx
---
You can‚Äôt see them, but you hear a faint beep. It grows louder. Must be lagging, now i hear 2. Uh oh, its closer, but there are 4. I am surrounded. Survival mode is fun they said. War never changes.
---
How many hours from now ?
---
[Here](https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7Lw6jVvhjzSNzuUMmKZgwn/fallout-76-100-days-roadmap-for-2019) if you Ctrl+F "prestige".
---
LIQUIDDDDDDDDDDDDD
---
It has to have a star, not just 'legendary' in the NPC name.  Hit up the wolf pack event (north west of vault 76) for 3 easy 1-star legendaries.
---
All
---
Yes, it was pretty fun to be thrown away by a deathclaw while wearing power armor!
---
It used to be (I thought it still was?) glitched and would give you the Nailer regardless.
---
I remember getting that as a quest reward after doing the whole thing with a plasma flamer.....
---
You are 100% right. Regarding combat depth, I miss them because in Fallout 76 melee feels like in Minecraft.
---
I think that if you would buy it yourself for the price you are selling it, then you‚Äôre probably pretty good in general.  I maintain the lowest prices I have seen, but that is primarily because I get my 1400 caps every day.  I saw a marine wetsuit, (basic no mods), for 1000 caps today! Lol. I craft treated marine wetsuits and sell each for like 32 caps.  I understand one man‚Äôs Juno is another‚Äôs treasure but 1000 caps for a common skin?
---
Lol not sure if that's true. I never seen a anti PvP post have 100,000 up votes. I think the devs and youtubers kinda read into reddit too much. Its fair to say a lot of people don't want new PvP mode but compared to how many play the game should they scrap it? Lolol
---
Check your bandwidth.
---
In my experience Fallout 76 doesn't have the most uh... let's say _durable_ network features...... other games handle the occasional late/lost packet just fine but in Fallout that seems to be the difference between smooth play and none of the buildings in Watoga loading. O.o
---
Just keep leveling up
---
Good luck dealing with Bethesda support
---
You need to re-read what I wrote.
---
Go to sleep
---
Eat cranberry relish
---
Go toWest tec.  
---
Kill super mutants. 
---
Pick up everything 
---
Sell to vendor
---
Server hop
---
Repeat. 
---
After you get your 1400 caps hit the events
---
It was wood armor, anyway. There's no reason to be upset for losing that. The whole point is the badges.
---
Don't be a troll.
---
I meant like some type of in game thing. Like, oh you had 5 full extractors when the game crashed; we emptied them into your inventory. 
---
And we‚Äôll even try to put you into a server that has an unowned workshop that‚Äôs yours now...or technological miracle, put you back into the same server.
---
I just used insect repellent...
---
Aww, you are welcome to stay at mine :')
---
Insults = no argument.
---
Can you provide an argument other than saying untrue?
---
Lol either they buff god roll armor or buff god roll weapons and I don't want either! That's a good idea to balance the new pure PvP modes!
---
Where is the closest vendor to west tek?
---
Critical bug fixes is not the same as active development.  Next.
---
Ah, I shall be asleep then ;)
---
Still no argument I see.  Thanks for trying.
---
Looks more like a volleyball underhand serve, pretty cool nonetheless.
---
I got the popcorn and beer ready let it roll
---
A ‚Äúrejoin last world‚Äù option would fix most problems. Also a 10min grace period, where you still own the workshops while your not on the server, would be needed too.
---
West Tek, the mutants all drop 3+ caps and are good for a couple hundred xp each, doesn't sound like much but it adds up after a couple thousand runs, well untill the boffins at Bethesda hit it with the nerd hammer like they have done to all the great farm spots.
---
That would mean a lot of players just wouldn't be able to hack. Like the Marsupial mutation lowers your INT by like 4 and everyone and their mother has that mutation.
---
Why are you taking the workshops other than the XP and the plans that they drop?  Farming is so much more efficient and you don't have to worry about crashes.
---
I doubt they would joke about it. Only a few have just started to receive them, and honestly that issue isn't really on the dev side of Bethesda which is what Howard is actually in charge of.
---
Idk much about gear... But if you want to prevent ppl from using vats on you put away your gun and sneak.
---
This make them have to aim and you would be surprised how many ppl just stand there(prob spamming the vats key) then you whip it out!
---
It cant help you once your in combat but it does stop a comando from blasting you before you have a chance.
---
As far as guns i would say AA or exterminator are my fave. Assassin is just 10% buff. Not worth it at all. AA how ever is worth a ton when ppl do have good gear and exterminator 2 shots bloodied builds.
---
This will help you win at lvl 20 let alone anything higher.
---
Lol always being called a horrible player by some guy with a YouTube copied build and bunch of duped meta gear that only plays call of douchbags!
---
I get Prime Receiver plans from Scorchbeasts. I find them worth killing if only for that.
---
And most likely they have some mentats in there inventory. I have marsupial and I get well past 15 intelligence just from herd mentality while in a group. Mentats give a very generous  bonus along with other chems. Will make people that chose to max out these traits more valuable to a team too.
---
The last couple of times that I visited there were also one Legendary Super Mutant outside and one inside.  So it is also possible to get legendary drops as well.
---
I'm high enough that I'm not interested in the XP, I was there for the steel.  With Scrapper you can get about 500 steel from one run.
---
What about that god roll armor you bought lolol
---
never seen that happening to be honest \^\^ only possible via reddit since u wouldnt know where the base is....excepct those lowbob whitespring bases that spoil immersion
---
That also means being able to pick or hack is very situational. I think the perk cards are a lot more versatile for people who don't play in groups or want to play builds that don't require a lot amount variables.
---
Honestly could with without PvP except workshops in adventure mode! The hit system they implemented to prevent trolling makes it easier to troll. They are fixing but still annoying.
---
Having 3* legendary character will be dope
---
Yoink it
---
While I love the idea, I can definitely see assholes trying to wipe them out for the hell of it.
---
Can someone explain all the 76 hate? For (as far as I know) Beth's first take on an Online MMO, they did a helluva job. I think 76 is a fantastic game that you can just kinda sink into.
---
First of by saying they would need hours not weeks to understand the game enough to start shredding you prove to me my thesis is right, and people don't understand this game at all. Not possible. Too much data to process. Take two fucking best FPS player worldwide, gear them up, get them a nice characters, explain them how to play their characters and let them learn. I'll 1v2 them for a week, even if they are better players, because the volume of knowledge gap they'll have to process is simply too big. But they will learn and at some point their superior mechanical efficiency will turn the tides and kick my butt.
---
Then by saying that you must have unobtainable ebay gear to win you're proving you're few months behind the meta. Obtaining items is generally speaking between the most important Fallout skills, but knowing whats actually good is something the vast majority won't ever reach.
---
 Somehow you have specified various important aspects of gameplay, yet kinda determine mindless eye-hand coordination as the only aspect of playing this game that can be called "the skill".  This is not a yet another iteration of CoD and God bless America it will not be. Expecting this to play and feel like CoD because there are crosshairs and your character holds a gun is an error.
---
I actually believe Fallout PvP requires infinitely more skill in much broader spectrum of talents that playing Widowmaker that revolves around one stupid activty could ever require, and requires multiple times the amount of thinking. If Widowmaker is an example of skilled gameplay to you go play Widowwatch, but don't go around insulting people because you can't adapt to given conditions.
---
Brilliant! Nice job!
---
Their only benefit is the "Officer on Deck" mission which I saved quite a bit of time by killing 10 of them. Took less than 3 hours.
---
Not one fight seemed "epic" or even remarkable. 
---
I honestly felt like I should be satisfied with the time I saved.
---
I think you get special perk cards. I seen data mined perks cards like weapon weight and so on!
---
God I hate that holotape, why couldn‚Äôt they have that one end in screaming and limb-rending.
---
Or you should have to make a choice between picking a non-combat perk over a combat one if you want access.
---
You shouldn't have your cake &amp; eat it.
---
It looks so lived in! I really like this a lot!
---
Not anymore situational than it is now. Literally having those cards equipped is dead weight 90% of the time. Also you could just opt to go with class freak.
---
i made a slight concession using punt for a better sounding title. figured close enough
---
Of course it is. Why should everything always have to be nerfed and ruined to suit cry babies.
---
People like you will moan and moan until everything enjoyable about the game is altered.
---
its all good. caught my eye.
---
they've been perm afaik but got nerfed to a temporary version since ppl meant that they are too powerfull (for pvp). so they \*\*\*\*\* pve players over again and they got temp for the same s\*\*\*\*d reasons things in a RPG(!!!!!!) get "balanced".....pvp over pve since ppl cant play a game anymore without competing. this will be sooner or later fallout 76s downfall since RPGs should be a place of exploring and experimenting and not a place of restrictions...  
---
even you find them way more often they're still too hard to find to be an actual part of a players build. 1h (or with the perk double) is laughable. i mean there not worth collectin anymore just for the purpose to show them somewhere.....
---
they were such a huge part in every fallout game....so why not in fo76 too? (again)
---
You do realize this is a video game right? Yes you can have your cake and eat it in a video game. Also if I'm not mistaken wasnt there a similar system in the original fallouts?
---
I personally think there already slot of them available. People just tend to use the same ones..
---
Top of the world station
---
Sadly I think you've got to scrap the whole thing and start again, but I could be wrong.
---
I've had this problem before where an item is placed but it's invisible, takes up budget and blocks anything else from being placed.
---
Yeah I definitely see a lot of the same ones over and over
---
A 1* Bloodied melee weapon called The Nailer.
---
I think beating it up with your bare fists increases the chances of the drop.
---
&gt;If you have something negative to say at least make it constructional. 
---
You want us to build something with out negative comments?
---
Is that when the next big update is coming? Been ootl
---
Ultracite is the worst looking PA lol.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to advertise on r/76raiders or in [the discord](https://discord.gg/A8vcuWH) 
---
might grab some more fella‚Äôs there.
---
Sure. Why have special limits? Why not all stats at 15, merge our inventory &amp; stash together &amp; not have perk cards active so that we can benefit from all combat perks at any time?
---
It's the limitations &amp; choices that makes the game interesting as a, wait for it, survival RPG.
---
Now I have.
---
You just glossed over my statement about this actually being the original format in fallout lol. Wow you are dumb, this change would make it even more of an RPG because you would have to spec into that type of build. Please think before you speak.
---
Not true.   I didn't have most of the perks cards that I now use on a regular basis until about level 100.  And I'm still tweaking things a bit at level 230.  
---
Plus, as you get better weapons your playing style can shift requiring different perk cards or point allocation.  For example, I didn't get the Heavy Gunner perks until after level 170 or so, when I got a Zealot's Explosive .50 cal Machine gun.  It 's a nice weapon for taking on the Queen.
---
A level 100+ has much more flexibility than a level 50 in weapons choice and can select different weapons based on what they want to achieve and optimize them.  Most level 50 players are lucky to be able to optimize on a single weapon.
---
The good ol days of level checks. Not these fancy cards, and the obnoxious interchanging of them.
---
I sell for 100c each and can‚Äôt make enough to keep up..
---
The card system Is good i think, but there is no doubt that some cards are too situational or downright useless.
---
It‚Äôs a great weapon for non-melee builds like mine.. light and powerful enough without needing any boosts from perks. Replaced my nearly weightless sacrificial machete.
---
I think that Whitespring is generally considered a HUB. The main atrium downstairs has all major vendors and a large crafting area with a dozen or so various stations strewn about the place. To me that screams HUB more than anything. Still, it‚Äôs a much later game area and I‚Äôd like it if lower level players had a place to chill out for a little, so Morgantown could work.
---
I agree
---
Tweaked
---
Provided arguments elsewhere. Just mocking you here.
---
My gamertag is the same
---
Be on in like half hr, all my plans are cheap, most are 50c lol
---
And yes, sometimes defences are worth it, depends where you drop your base
---
nope hes not correct! and why would he? if ppl are playin fallout76 for pvp they're definitely not the most intelligent ppl out there. this game is not supposed to be competetive..bethesda just answered the pvp-trolls crying for killing each other since they cant play games anymore without pvp or competing. the pvp character ruins this game and takes away ressources of bethesda that couldve been used to create better pve content on which this game is based. hell, i cant understand why u pvpers are crying that much if you can play other MMOs that are way more focused on pvp (TESO f.e.)
---
Lmao critical and none critical bug fixes and entirely new content is active development. Next.
---
Buy the plan in whitesprings then make a heap of them and decon, you will learn most of them that way, primed plans drop from the queen
---
*sniff* *sniff* ahhhh smells like ol' times. Don't miss them.
---
**Nice pic lol**
---
Love that you ignored the comments of me explaining exactly why you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about so that you could claim I didn‚Äôt explain exactly why you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about
---
it could be a bug try going throught the main enclave door
---
Maybe the intent is you hear that line enough that it all ends in your own screaming and limb rending
---
Yep thats normal, there are much more adventure servers than survival ones and you recognise the best players from your region after a month of gameplay.

Maybe you might try to gather more sticks on all 3 places after the eat/drink/emote phase. Just to stash a bit before the final phase. 
---
Works good for me, also to build a small amount of stash you keep in your inventory after the event for the next.
---
When I played survival to get the Night Light a few weeks back I was server hopping to try and find some stormy weather but I kept coming into the same server. I knew this was the case because I still owned the workshop I had taken before hopping. So maybe you see the same people all the time because get put on the same server alot.
---
My observations are as follows: unyielding is unreliable when it comes to charisma additions and shouldn't be counted if you want sharing to persist.
---
Magnetic Peronality is Meta PvP perk. Cost of two perk points that gives you back more and boosts whole team.
---
Thanks! What‚Äôs in a workshop?
---
"Give in to depravity" is so vague!
---
I do like that the slogan in the Atom shop right now is "Chill out"
---
üòú
---
I swear when you scrap weapons you make you don't get any mods from them? That's what I found anyway. If you can, make sure you get the perks to make them for less resources and scap them for more
---
You need to exit from that spot all 3 exits actually to be able to get back in the bunker
---
You don't get mods, just plans
---
I entered the leaderboard at position 20.
---
you can track challenges so that they appear at the top right of the map sceen, it would be good if we had another tab where we could place the challenges we are following without having scroll past all the others first
---
&gt; No it's a well known fact that the number of players pvping are in the single digit percentile
---
Not a fact, an assumption.
---
You do actually get a few minutes if you drop and manage to join back into the same server
---
Happened several times to me over the last couple months, but cause xbox, I can rejoin via recent players
---
I shall look forward to your poop bag of disaprovel.
---
The Kiloton Rifle from Far Harbour or The Overseer's Guardian* or The Deliverer. 
---
*I realise that the Overseer's is merely a two shot combat rifle, but I have had the equivalent in FO76 and it is nowhere near as powerful, steady, accurate or quick firing.
---
They really should change that to drop the aid version - it's plain stupid to server hop endlessly at two spots to get a receip done.
---
And while they're on it, they could take care of the deathclaw hides too.
---
I never held a workshop for more than 30 minutes before it crashes. I don‚Äôt even bother putting her extractors and things down anymore.
---
He was replying to the wrong thread.
---
Also you can just switch the cards out when you want to hack or pick a lock. Its tedious though and the alternative is handicapping yourself out of a 3 star perk card like rifle man or something like gunsmith. Dont act like this is some foreign concept. You obviously are just some really salty dude that thinks he's accomplished something after playing an hour of any survival game. Take the Forrest  for instance, nobody complained about the addition of a log sled because of "having their cake and eating it" before it was tedious to make so many trips for logs and made quality of life 10√ó better.
---
Its possible to prevent being one shotted but not against melee. Melee is overpowered when it comes to damage because this is range-based game and it could either be powerful or complete joke.
---
To pro players dying from melee is a shameful thing. Just keep far from the spawn at all times.
---
But 65... Is impressing lol - that effort!
---
Plasma Grenade Plans would like to have a chat with you
---
 Alas I don't have very many posting privileges in the discord, as kurayber is the raider faction overboss on the discord :/
---
If you omit the fact that placing anything on a carpet will permanently prevent your camp from being moved somewhere else, or that we can't sink many objects in the ground which makes them look ugly.
---
Tbh, the people on this subreddit are overly optimistic, other than this game being the only game of it's kind, it's a hot heap of trash in the world of game design. It's a spit in the face to 'good game design'. That being said, this E3 may stir up some issues, and well deserved.
---
The game has a million issues, and there's no fixes. I'm just afraid of an item cap increase. That may be the day many of us quit the game, cuz I'll be damned if I gotta get all my stuff again, especially since everything in the game is obtainable because duping occurred before.
---
Lol... Didn't see that coming.
---
Every other shooter that allows you to oneshot an opponent: normal.
---
Fallout 76 allows you one shooting opponents: Reeeeeee, broken, can't play.
---
Git gud.
---
Why not just choose your weapon for vats and stick with it, you shouldn't be able to have your cake and eat it too üòÇ
---

This is too good
---
Unfortunately I'm working until 330pm today, I was being proactive and getting adds ready for when i get back so I can get straight on to it :D
---
 I will add and message you when I'm home later then we can arrange a time thats best for both of us :D
---
Workshops are PVP zones. They may be trying to get you in there to be able to kill you.
---
So instead of pressing tab - t - switch three cards we would have press tab - scroll to aid - search for Mentants. 
---
Idk if that‚Äôs the solution
---
If you spec into a build with the stats high enough for it you won't have too.
---
I sell it for 1c
---
you get 5 random cards per pack every 5 levels after level 10, you don't lose any cards they get placed in holding under the special perk so you will find lockpicking under Intelligence (there are 3 lockpicking cards to get which when used together let you pick level 3 locks)
---
Any tips? Good locations? Tried Gulpers Lagoon for days but haven't had any luck.
---
As the holos and note stated it's pointing to a deathmatch/last man standing experiment in vault 51. Also the volleyball field in front maybe point to something competitive imh.
---
My guess is that it was a ZAX overseer system that controlled the vault, drive nuts and the last survivor we hear managed to escape after killing all/some fellow dwellers and looking for help to end the madness at Vault 76.
---
It doesn't sound like they did anything wrong, or outside of the allowable behaviour for this game. You're still choosing to publicly call out someone in front of a community of their peers for what seems like a situation you instigated: "I was at this one dude's searching for junk he may have"
---
Good thibg Ive got radicool and specced for bloodied!
---
His camp was public cause of the vender machine that's what I was there for and tbh to me that seems not right that's like going in and out of passive mode in gta just to kill someone
---
My pipe revolver degrades quite quickly with gunsmith, so I've been considering licensed plumber. I'd go for that personally.
---
Okay I have a small tip. When you arrive and the camp loads in just run! I can avoidit buy doing that often.
---
Think it was mentioned when talking about roadmap, the dlc that comes after nuclear winter.
---
I use tweaked for the crit damage.
---
I use auto as I run a bloodied build with max adrenalin perk most enemy's go down in 2-3 shots.
---
what platform are you playing on if you are on ps4 i can have a look if i have one of these
---
Would have gladly helped.
---
But congrats - Happy snapping!
---
The same way people were getting angry that Wild Appalachia was just a survival mode dlc...
---
I figured lmao
---
How about "Armor" actually being for armor, not someone's collection of hats and swimwear...
---
Do you mean it was a trap? If it was that is a really cowardly way of getting junk on their part
---
Who needs the new skyrim when you have that really
---
Thx for that, but this is what i always do! It's just that it doesn't work too often and still end up getting stuck. Yes, soemtimes works, but makes it even more frustrating when it doesn't :/
---
However, as said, thanks dude.
---
Then reddit will be there to comment on it.
---
Too many big fucking R-tardios want to talk shit about it being broken or whatever. 
---
Why are they browsing this sub?????????????????
---
maybe thats a dumb suggestion but you have to activate the handscanner every time you want to enter the bunker
---
Exactly and that's why I'm so salty like it'd be different if they didn't have the vending machine and I probably wouldn't be so salty if they wouldn't have blocked me so I couldn't even try to get my stuff back
---
All my plans are free now, even the rare weapon mods. They still don't sell, so that gives you an idea of their worth...
---
I got five pieces of legendary scout armor (which is what I was hoping for) the *first* time I visited the purveyor.
---
Nothing since.
---
I wonder how you manage AP costs more than anything.
---
I am on PS4 :)
---
Check online for level range of the regions and stay as long in a Region doing quest/events/dailies till your gear and basics are good to take you to your next destination.
---
Most important - take your time, have fun and stay eager for adventures (as long as you didn't take a arrow to the knee of course)

You‚Äôre the real colony collapse disorder
---
Not broken, just not finished.
---
This really is annoying and needs a fix quickly. Spawning inside someone‚Äôs locked building, with the vending machine outside, is also pretty infuriating.
---
well i have a look as soon as im online if i have one you can have it for free üëçüèº
---
Nope, it will likely be extended for each big DLC coming up.
---
Also I really hope you wanted to nerf tse when they came out because you must agree that being able to one shot everything takes away from the survival element right?
---
It was literally a crap shoot.  I don‚Äôt even know how to explain it.  Found 1 in the forest, 1 in the mire and 1 in the bog.  All over the place.
---
No not really? None that I know of at least.
---
I'm not. I try to keep my expectations low. That way I'm less disappointed if I don't like what I see and more thrilled if I do.
---
yes, another thing i forgot. yes, happens also often! thx for adding this. i'll edit the post to implement it.
---
Yeah, thanks for proving my point - there are no numbers on active daily players.
---
Could have it not add to carry weight but instead allow access to map-wide voice chat between others wearing it. *
---
* disclaimer: ive put zero effort into thinking about the ramifications of this.
---
*Consultation hours Mo - Fr 8.15 am to 8.30* 
---
Fingers crossed for you! May the RNGods bless you soon.
---
Check for chem boxes they usually have healing items in them. If you have the perk to "search" for more chems you can press a button while in the inventory of a chem box and loot more chems.
---
I see. It's a problem. I think it's time for Bethesda to bring us camp fast travel rugs.
---
Blessings be to RNGesus
---
This needs to happen
---
i've already posted about bringing back the rug earlier and was downvoted often. i'd love to see that still. but right now i'd already be happy to fast travel and spawn without ending up in ridiculous spots, where you can't get out.
---
imgur attacks everything because they think they are something more than just a hosting site.
---
Someone tag all of the Bethesda CMs. They need this asap. Hell this kind of survey should be on the title screen.
---
I try to set my prices to something fairly reasonable if not cheap.  Just about every plan I have with a few exceptions are 20 caps or less.  ALL ammo is 1 cap a piece.  More than likely if you send me a message about the price of a weapon or piece of armor I'd lower it.    I have seen some vendor camps with ridiculous prices for things.  So I usually jump around to a few vendors before I buy anything.
---
Did somebody say STRIPPERS
---
Yeah, I did that once and ran straight off a cliff into instant death. Lmao.
---
I use the 2 loctions south of 76 "moonshiner shack/lumber yard" for ticks to make stims. Then watoga hospital or w/e it for just stims. Then use the perk for double craft/cems or w/e it is to dilute for extra heals. Also check player shops u can find stims/diluted for cheap
---
Some people construct themselves on other destruction, it' s pity. 
---
Don't give them too much credits: They create nothing and they are nothing.
---
Worse they are making money over other people work, this have a name: Parasites.
---
interesting, thanks for getting back to me!
---
Im not accustomed with this addon. What was it?
---
Not sure I agree...with a proper build I can roll through just about any mob with a combat rifle nerfed to .38 and the Ar is superior to that...not as much pure damage but faster firing and less recoil inherantly seems like a far trade-off. Maxing is necessary to be completely viable.
---
i been away for a while. what people mad about now?
---
Someone put their shop behind a locked door today and it had 28 apparel and 10 weapons. I wanted to see what it had. So I broke in to check out the shop. It was mostly 1\* junk and outfits. Then the owner of the house killed me. Well played Sir, you have earned your 10 caps from my bounty.
---
Great job! This should definitely get more attention.
---
It's quite obvious, what the community want and what they don't. A good company would take that into account.
---
People still play this game?
---
oh wow cool
---
did it get revealed?
---
good idea
---
The mods of this subreddit are very hands off regarding megathreads, don't keep your hopes up A weekly megathread allowing us to discuss a "topic of the week" would be really cool instead of getting 100 separate posts.
---
I have never glitched my weight like this. My biggest problems now are that some of my CAMP walls can't be replaced because they are slightly intersecting things. 
---
Leave the sub and stop playing the game if all you can find are flaws.
---
Yep, since its so much easier to wipe an enemy out as opposed to help a community, you can garuntee that there would be people wiping out the settlement, jump server, wipe thst settlement, jump server, wipe...... Ect...
---
Yes. A house. With a porch. Maybe a shed in the backyard or something. Ever hear of a fence? Better build a fence.
---
Any limb hit cripples any other kills.  You have about 60 pounds of weight to work with and you still gotta drink and feed.
---
It is really fun for those into it.
---
This sub is just as bad about beating a dead horse as the YouTubers
---
Be careful and choose which perk cards to use wisely. There are some perk cards that you will never need to use. Do not waste the points. Search reddit for "perk card builds"
---
I hope bethesda adds a server master list of items or some consolidated auction-house or if not that then just give us the ability to preview peoples camp vendors without fast traveling to 20 different places.
---
The only argument against that is probably from people who try to sell useless crap but want people to look at their camp. Those of us who sell good items usually have better looking camps as well (unless it's a lvl 1 mule lol) so it wouldn't be anything like stopping people from seeing your camp, as long as you aren't selling useless shit like outfits or random ass troubleshooter's crap weapons.
---
The problem is that it offers no benefit over the Handmade or Combat rifles. The Combat Rifle allows you to use varying ammo types as well as being cheaper in VATS than the Handmade and Assault Rifle. The Handmade is just the strongest perform in most scenarios. 
---
Simply the Assault Rifle just has no benefit to it to make up for its lower damage. That said, from playing with the gun it feels like its strengths are in its Stability/Recoil with scopes. Other than that it felt inferior to a Handmade in all ways.
---
In a very horrible way, that would be hilarious to see.
---
Got it from there. Takes around 10 minutes, easy going.
---
Only two more to catch :)
---
Honestly this is an amazing weapon to get simply just to sell. The average price seems to be about 3000 caps right now, I expect that to rise after the week ends. I'm about to give my level 2 mule account the supplies required to finish the weekly simply to get a second Unstoppable Monster to sell later.
---
lol\^\^
---
To be fair I put a "you've been insulted" note in my vendor for 1k as a joke and a kind soul pitied my lvl 30 ass and bought it lel

---
Cautiously pessimistic if I'm to be frank. Not all "Oh BGS sux and they're going to ruin 76 with BR RAGH!" but also not all that hyped for the new content and features announcement.
---
I'm sure we'll here some things that are interesting or even exciting. However, given the game's track record, reinforced with a broken commitment to the Atom Store being cosmetic only and Todd Howard ok with things being real bad out of the game because it's "what the game becomes" that matters, it doesn't instil a lot of confidence that they'll be able to deliver.
---
Just go back to the previous E3 with 76. All of the humans you encounter are real people, as if it was a mind blowing idea. The tension of potential PvP when you run into other humans. All those amazing amounts of detail and content! 16 times the detail dude! 16! 
---
So yeah, not that optimistic but who knows. Going to keep an open mind about it.
---
Is it dick?  I'm betting it's dick!
---
Ahhh yes my best one yet was between 2 generators and a wall
---
Agreed. Although personally, as much as I like the game in its current state, there are reasons why the game got so much hate in the first place.
---
people are hilarious sometimes ive seen people selling steel for 10caps each or unlegendary assault rifles for thousands of caps its funny sometimes i always wonder if these guys ever sell anything
---
You get the mod plans, took me about 400-500 handmade rifles to learn them all. Super duper is a must have perk for this route tho, saves a ton of resources
---
Something a little like the call of duty zombies where its like a defense wave gamemode?
---
paahhh, that's the most common one^^ the best one to me was beneath the floor, where i had a beautiful view on the camps owners underpanties haha^^
---
It's honestly annoying I'm taking longer breaks from the game now for these reasons
---
Bloody mess, tank killer, adrenaline. Concentrated fire and gun fu if you use vats.
---
I have an AAE lever action that does 354 at 20% health, but once adrenaline kicks in it shoots up. 
---
Bloodied was the only way for me to get good damage, and I can one shot, but get one shot haha.
---
I'd like to human NPCs as an outside force that entered in from a surrounding region.
---
It's not like we're an island of civilisation surrounded by nothingness. There would be survivors (and raiders no doubt) from other states.

I can already hear the random music, dogs barking, and vacuum cleaners!
---
Battle Royale mode is the controversy de jour.
---
Indeed it is, but I'm not patting myself on the back about it lol.
---
i love this game. but yes, this is just frustrating crap. not to mention the million other bugs that one does experience daily. again, love this game, so i hope even more that beth fixes issues like that.
---
Agreed
---
Adrenal reaction mutation. Radicool perk for melee, nerd rage is a must too. Combine those with a bloodied weapon and you'll one shot/hit most enemies depending on your build.
---
You will need the Luck/Serendipity perk Card, without it you will die too fast.
---
Some of it depends on whether your'e doing melee or rifle/heavy etc...but some of the basic ones that work with any weapon are below.
---
Bolstering or Unyielding armor will work well with low health.
---
You'll want adrenal reaction mutation, for extra weapon damage
---
Nerd Rage perk card, extra DR and weapon dmg.
---
I actually like it. Destroying somebody's base serves no purpose because you don't gain anything, i was afraid to go to survival because i don't want my camp destroyed.
---
And also you cant even abuse this, because if you do any damage to other players the invulnerability is turned off, also your turrets will shoot anyone and that also removes the invulnerability so passive camps don't get destroyed.
---
What are the downsides? Coz i cant figure otu
---
‚ÄúI‚Äôm taking mad rads lads‚Äù
---
Not safe to log out at the Whitesprings
---
Theres a boxcar in the trainyard by watoga, the downed vertibot in watoga, the surface to air bases in the east side of the map are the spots where i think i found mine. Can easily do a loop between the surface to air base south of watoga, the train yard and the vertibot and then server hope. Camp venture has a set also sometimes, as does the Surface to air base southwest I think. Another idea is you can type fallout 76 interactive map into google and theres a map that you can use to look for just about any type of location in the game, including power armor spawn points. All of the ones on the east side of the map especially the southern portion tend to spawn max level.
---
I am waiting for Todd in his badass leather jacket to walk into action and give us the spicy nuclear winter news.
---
At lvl 30!
---
tenderizer can help with multiple shots as well.
---
What the hell, it‚Äôs nowhere to be found in the luck tab???
---
Thanks for reading bud, I do think the people that spend time reading and conversating about this game are generally the most knowledgeable regarding the game's systems and what 76 has to offer. However it is important to remember the participants make up a small minority of the total player base so the results shouldn't be taken 100% to heart.
---
This game lacks a HUB, yes. I'd love to see one. Where, wouldn't matter to me. Also agree with the other dude here that WS might be one (somehow). But to me, would prefer an official one. And also one that isn't in danger of having nukes fall down on your head lol
---
Oh I see... thank you üëç
---
Wear excavator power armor and go to lucky hole mine southeast on map. Go in mine and pick up lead ore. You need to farm acid to make gunpowder. Gunpowder, lead, steel to craft ammo. Gatling gun 5mm is my favourite. 50 cal and light machine gun burns through ammo too quickly. I use 1900 50 cal ammo to kill scorched beast queen and scorched earth event.
---
Np :)
---
Please do! Let me know what you think.
---
The perk is pharma farma, its the first one i take on every new character i make. 40% chance for extra chems at level 1 perk card. Well worth it.
---
Follow the water between the Overseers Camp and Flatwoods. Pick up all the goodies and then just go to the chem. Workbench in the church. You‚Äôll be able to easily craft 10 healing salves.
---
14 hours and 48 minutes from now.
---
It doesn't really seem to be opting in to something that's already in the game if a mod needs to be downloaded that isn't clearly outlined in Bethesda's policies :-p Good to hear it's working out, though
---
That's a really good point, I have all 5 running with 2 between 50-100 and my main at nearly 200. I took it as what's your highest levelled character, and should have written the question as so.
---
I love this idea!
---
I‚Äôll be glad to use an in game chat!!!
---
damn.
---
A majority of the 'Other' answers for that question referred to various specific dates throughout 2019 as well as Christmas 2018 so I can confidently say at least 10% of responders bought 76 post-launch, which bearing in mind this was mainly just posted across the Reddit pages (where you'll find the more 'hardcore' players as the other commenter said) I think this amount was fairly good.
---
2 on 1 only highlights a lack of skill and cowardice.  Nice try though.  Golf clap for you. üëèüèª üëèüèª üëèüèª
---
Yeah that little bit at the end was more of an advert for it. It changes the game completely. It requires a little bit of effort to install mods, so anyone that is using it actively wants to chat about the game. It's great.
---
Cheers appreciate it!
---
No probs thank you for reading!

I'll always remember you as the Dweller who threw their poo around when they couldn't afford something

Yes, that spawn is always a deathclaw

The same exact thing happened to me in Fort Defiance as well. Level 20 or 21 glowing mole rat that obliterated me time and time again without hope.  I submitted a ticket cause it has to be a big right? Sooooo frustrating to be taken down by a creature so beneath your level üòí
---
i think unyielding or one that starts with a b is the legendary that has more defense when your health is low definitely recommend that

That works.

Personally, I would like an Enclave backpack,  although I do have the Corvega one, which could be repurposed for the Enclave.

You are too late.  The unstoppable monster can solo the SBQ.  You will never get this weapon.
---
It took about 20 mins to get it was so ez.
---
Vacant downvote your comment all they want, but it doesn't make it not true.
---
Anything short of announcing mod support for this game, will make zero difference in the population.
---
I don't know about you, but I'm not looking to play with the same fallout zealots that have made excuses for this game from day one.
---
I'll wait for the modding community to work its magic.
---
I would gave gotten Bloody Mess.
---
Yep, even if this game launched in a perfect state with no bugs. Or hell, if it took another 6 months and launched in the state that it's in right now, content included, there would still be outrage on Youtube/social medias.
---
&gt; works on any level with

We do not want battle royale. Battle royale sucks and is for autistic 12 year olds. Battle royale like survival is a waste of resources. Do not shill for it.

---
thats what i would go with also i would suggest getting makeshift warrior so you have access to higher level mods but just swap it in and out when needed
---
all in all its pretty solid 
---
with melee you cant really do wrong the suggestion i made is by no means the best melee build available or anything but its solid and should leave you with no problems exept for the worst of opponents :)
---
There would be less though I imagine.
---
It‚Äôs actually always surprised me there was never an in-game text chat.
---
Same :(
---
What are you talking about me never getting this weapon? I've already got it you dumbass
---
Ah okay
---
I'm guessing the Atom store and other sales related activities that would not work on the steam platform. BGS can advertise and push micro transactions effectively through the Bethesda launcher for all the games in their library all in one place. Makes sense really.
---
I‚Äôd just server hop.
---
I would say chameleon is better for PvP but unyielding is in general better!
---
Always put on PA before logging out at The Whitespring...
---
But be careful not to trample the flowers!
---
I guess... Chameleon armor makes you invisible in PVP but in fights against mobs unyielding armor doesn't make you invisible, which means enemies are gonna detect you easier than if you were to have chameleon
---
Plasters and a nurse..
---
I usually run four pieces of unyielding with 1 piece of chameleon.
---
What about firing a flare in the air give a temporary map marker for a short period of time for anyone within a certain radius that can be seen on both the map and compass if you're nearby?
---
I like the idea of making the flare useful in the way you've described. Just not so much server-wide. Flares for me make more sense if its within visible range. Maybe a one-time use radio beacon for server-wide stuff?
---
Fallout 76 may not be the best game right now, but at least Bethesda is actually TRYING to make it better
---
Oh, I see
---
I had this issue with my C.A.M.P. and ended up having to rebuild with concrete blocks as the floor instead of the wooden platform like ones to stop it. At least now people won't get stuck on my base anymore.
---
What bloodied build are you doing?
---
Agree with this guy. Whitesprings seems geared to be the de facto player hub given all the faction vendor bots have been moved into there.
---
Nah, it got hate as soon as the rumours of it being online started circulating. It was always going to get hate because Fallout "fans" were opposed to an online game.
---
I'm talking about in Survival mode, Einstein.
---
It would be interesting to learn more about Wastelanders, the summer updates seem to be mostly end game content to keep existing players, but those coming in the fall are what have been suggested to make the major changes. BE3 looks like a good time to showcase them so that more people become interested in the game.
---
That works well.  
---
Personally, I would like an Enclave backpack,  although I do have the Corvega one, which could be repurposed for the Enclave.  
---
Just add the Enclave logo and maybe change the colour to a suitable colour scheme for the Enclave.
---
You knew. You love that plausible deniability though. Just like all of the cryptofascists irl.
---
Chameleon armor does not work on mobs for this is the sneak perk card.
---
Ha bloodied gat.... worst weapon avail.  You failed to get a legacy lazer gat explosive which is no longer available but still in game.  Just give up guy.  There are like 30 dupers handing these explosive lazers out but if you don't have one by now ur fucked haha.
---
GL dumbass.
---
LEGACY u dont have it.  It's too late.
---
I‚Äôd like for someone from the some other place like the Commonwealth arrive, see the Scorched, and be like ‚Äúand we thought we had it bad‚Äù like if it weren‚Äôt for us all of America would probably be Scorched
---
Was this in survival? Did you pick a lock?
---
K
---
It was in the regular version and I didn't pick anything I just showed up looking to buy junk
---
I kill them
---
.........or a junk jet maybe lol
---
Yeah it confuses me. Just bought an instigating, faster fire rate, +1 perception handmade for 1K. The same vendor had janky 1 stars for 2K+ 
---
Not complaining though lol
---
Sure. Haven‚Äôt played the game in a while but ok
---
World of Warcraft is not on steam either, but they are OK with that...
---
Y'know, That Gun.
---
Player vending was the favorite addition? Seriously? That was probably the most useless thing, considering how active the trading subs are, along with other places like console communities and Discord.
---
It also fucked up prices for a lot of things.
---
That implies the word yes lol
---
I just meant that's good to know i'm not alone with my thoughts.
---
I hope that, if they finally go with a Battle Royale mod, they also announce a complete rebalance of PvP.
---
But they won't, so I'm just expecting the next DLC announcement and a bunch of new items for the Atom Shop.
---
Would love to see the Anti-Materiel Rifle again, would kill for a new sniper
---
Let's not pretend that Steam's 30% cut to all revenue isn't greedy either. It's partly the reason why an objectively inferior platform like Epic can make so much traction.
---
Has Valve done anything to even remotely try to compete with Epic?
---
The game is coming to Steam. Let's not shit on Bethesda quite yet while they're working out whatever business and logistics they need to sort out for making it available on the platform.
---
Okay cool. Thanks for replying man. I will burry the bones In my backyard
---
Because I dont want to discourage people from playing by creating an environment like Rust.
---
Vault tec is so 2077 lol
---
Well I won't be needing this anymore goodbye head.
---
Won't be the next skyrim :(
---
The abortion of ESOL is still a thing.
---
WoW classic will defeat anything this company does for about 2 years.
---
My boy, tiss I, the man that hasn‚Äôt played in months. Let‚Äôs wreck some shit
---
I rather enjoy being stuck in foundations, because I haven‚Äôt figured out the need to move quickly once I spawn in. Life is hard, even harder when you‚Äôre stupid........
---
thx in advance if one of the guys don't get stuck anymore on it might be me one day\^\^
---
I had the same problem with my "responder" character. I cut off the power to my vending machines, now higher level players never come to my camp because its not on the map. Lower level players can still find it though as its in a well traveled area. Not the best solution but its worked for me somewhat.
---
Did you read the post or nah?
---
Yes
---
It's honestly funny how adamantly anti-PvP people are.
---
You're playing an online game, for crying out loud. Maybe be more open? Everyone's so anti-social and anti-competition, it reaches a point that just makes me cringe.
---
I'd like to see a text chat but implementation matters. If it's like the text chat PC mod, no thanks.
---
Many people have said that they want text chat to have their character talk to another one but with my experience with the mod, that rarely happens. It's pretty much a glorified in-game Discord with a lot of inane chatter, even if you turn off all the global options.
---
But it makes me look fat
---
Yeah, there would be less, but there would still be plenty of people making videos about the lack of human NPC's/dialogue and multiplayer.
---
Whatever, i also enjoy the game for what it is and kind of glad Bethesda tried something different.
---
Nuke them.
---
One of the mods already said that they were going to make a megathread.
---
Why does an item cap increases scares you ? Do you quit a game every time a game raises its level cap?
---
 I Don't get the concern, older gear duped or not will be made obsolete and everyone will be on an equal playing field this time for farming on cap gear.
---
I‚Äôm super disappointed about the possibility of future disappointment.......
---
Hating PvP is NOT toxic. Fuck PvP.
---
Yes it's very annoying I have had to fast travel to another location then walk back to there camp. 
---
    I had a very nice guy trying to help me set the spawn location at my camp as it would trap ppl behind my vending machines so with his help I was at least able to get it to spawn them to my generator room behind my camp. 
---
    Best it would do after 10 tries but it has a door so guess it's better then ppl getting stuck. 
---
   They just walk out and around to my vending.
---
Well like I let some cat out of the bag.  This game kinda stale now.  You go on being you though.
---
I was looking forward to something bright.  Unlike this games dismal everything.
---
do you know what outfit you‚Äôre wearing in this pic?
---
I feel like that's a reference to that Simpsons episode
---
Im not saying an item cap lvl increase is horrible. Just saying a lot of ppl will quit if it happens. Some of us are completely set on items, the best of everything. Took countless hours of time. To have that all taken away kills the game for some of us. Sometimes you gotta know when to quit. We aint gonna play Fo76 forever lol
---
Yes, it works just perfectly when spawning at a spot, where the building didn't even load and you can't see where you're running at. And maybe, just maybe, end up run into the stuck point, instead of run out of it. 
---
Also. Might seem to be a good solution to someone of your likes. But 30.000 years after human history, and being in the year 2019 with our technology today, you'd be surprised how issues can be solved nowadays.
---
Lmao. Yes, you're truly "intelligent" hahaha\^\^
---
However, reported.
---
Cool story, bro.
---
It's weird to stick around a sub of a game you don't care about, but hey, you do you.
---
Just remember do not to pick up the **Wet** Kindling.
---
Depends on how you play but if you're looking to work it as a sniper, covert operative give 2.5x sneak attack damage. Scales well with Instigating legendary effect.
---
Bloody Mess is a flat 5/10/15% more on top. Tank Killer makes damage more effective for high armoured targets.
---
After that it really depends on how you play. There are a handful of other perk cards that can help out too.
---
At first I was pissed. Then I just laughed. My friend that owned the camp seen the whole thing and could hear him crying because he was laughing so hard.
---
i'm sure they'd deserve it haha^^
---
Drop a nuke.
---
It would be nice when if you helped them enough you could have maybe 3-4 of them stay at your base and defend it just think it would be a nice idea
---
yes. also get help sometimes by the camps owners and it's cool...as long as they are around :D
---
xD
---
Keep hassling Bethesda for those welcome mats so that we can determine our fast travel spawn location.
---
Apparently they‚Äôll be adding legendary mod plans in the Atom shop.
---
thank you !

I use the trading subs but I still find it often easier to sell smaller things like ammo and crafting materials in the VMs, and have enjoyed slowly completing my magazine collection and picking up some pretty crazy bargains. It's a little more immersive doing it all in-game and I don't have to message back and fourth nearly as much. Obviously though if you're after something specific the internet will be your friend. 
---
I've also seen camps become more hub like with higher player counts (especially at WS) and gotten to see some amazing builds, and like I said earlier to someone else the world feels so much more alive now. Whilst it needs polish I highly rate being able to fast travel to other camps.
---
Not trying to sound arsey at all mate you're 100% entitled to your opinion and I can see where you're coming from, just offering my thoughts as to why it topped the list. I thought the Deluxe Camera was much more useless imho.
---
Hulk was Angry, not all supermutants are.

Plus, I've never seen the Hulk (not Bruce Banner) afraid of a sheep...

Search twich ... zero.
---
Search youtube... 1 person and it is over a month old.
---
Ya got nothin kiddo.
---
Dead game.
---
Enjoy E3 enthusiasm for nothing.
---
Oh and Bro and generic insult.
---
Clear witchhunting post but this has been up for 2 hours? Mods, you like, wanna step in an enforce your own rules?
---
awesome!
---
Got your point. You are right aswell 
---
for sure, no doubt. But still a different mode doesn't affect the other modes. It's just another option for folks to find sort of a "home" or bring new players to the game. Thats not bad because there is still a possibility that they came for a survival/battle royal mode but stay for adventure. The more players - the more you can expect they keep it going.
---
If some one don't like a mode - then ignore it, as far as i think its even for free as wild appalachia , and pick the mode which suits better. 
---
Sort of - there is a super market shelf with meat, cheese and salad - if your Vegan then Grab the salad but let others enjoy their meat if they like it.
---
What i simply don't get it is why some can't stay chill till it drops as it drops and then discuss it.
---
Nevertheless, again your right about your point made.
---
Still happening to me.
---
One person build their own little village and posted here recently. It was quite quaint.
---
Hi, can you do it [here](https://nukesdragons.com/) for me and post your link to take a look at?
---
Whatever you used was... very clunky to look at
---
Repeat after me: 
---
I will Not Turn Off Pacifist Mode and then complain about dying.
---
Okay so can you have every single one of them active at a time for 1-2 hours?
---
I meant that you reach your maximum stats at level 50. Okay, let's make it 65 if it pleases you. You mean that while i start taking your workshop, you go on the menu and switch all your perk cards to switch from rifle build to heavy guns ? What happens if i take cover and you can't reach me? You change all your perk cards back to sniper build?
---
Getting the weapon in game is really rare. You're best off farming the materials and crafting your own to learn the mods.
---
If you insist on doing it in-game, treasures and some event rewards are the only ways I've seen it happen. I can't think of a single creature that drops one.
---
No they aren‚Äôt üôÑ
---
That‚Äôs so strange, how did he kill you if you didn‚Äôt initiate PvP or become wanted from picking a lock at his camp?
---
I'm somehow not surprised, but still disappointed. How can they not see that's obvious pay to win?
---
Todd told me, personally.
---
Okay bro, you keep crying.
---
Let me know when you are done so I can bring you a tissue.
---
i did already, but there seems to be ppl that don't like it, as my post was downvoted before a lot. Right now i'd be just happy if i'd be at least able to spawn properly w/o getting stuck :)
---
Scrap
---
It's not my favourite thing in the game but I do love a bit of PvP. Once your build is perfected, your armor is god tier and your guns TSE the only real challenge is your fellow man, which funnily enough I think sounds *very* Fallout.
---
PvE is fun but defeating a flawed algorithm vs defeating another live human being... The satisfaction levels are incomparable in my eyes. But everyone to their own. I for one am extremely excited for the Nuclear Winter mode, I'm dying for at least some deathmatch stuff.
---
You can still get killed in pacifist mode
---
Because he could?
---
You know what people are?  Bastards. Bastard coated bastards with bastard flavored filling.
---
Tru
---
I could do without a Bethesda presentation filled with lies and memes.
---
It also depends on what you post. Some periods of the day/night are brutal with down votes. Perfectly reasonable posts get downvoted to hell.
---
Anyhow, I meant more we need to keep making posts like this to remind Bethesda that we're not letting this one go.
---
I just bought it last week. New player, avid gamer, and I've been playing nothing but Fo76 since I bought it. I obviously can't comment on how it was when first released, but as of now it's stable and every enjoyable.
---
This exchange was painful to read. Sorry OP.
---
But muh convenience /s absolute thoughtless tools I swear
---
ive already tried that they flash green but the lasers are still red
---
Never have I seen 100% of the playerbase fill out a community made survey. That's impressive, well done.
---
I‚Äôll look at Bloody Mess and Tank Killer as I don‚Äôt have them

Obviously console would benefit from text chat as well. Duh.
---
I‚Äôll see if I got one of the perk cards i think I do
---
Constantly!
---
It is so f** annoying.
---
But actually first time I heard that CHR buffs may be responsible, will look into it
---
I‚Äôll DM Todd now with this pertinent information.
---
Both of the receivers he is talking about are autos, my dude
---
God seeing this huge map getting filled with people (other then us) would be so awesome to see
---
Maybe I‚Äôll look into Bloodied but I don‚Äôt like the thought of having Low Health :p
---
Glad to see an old school Fallout fan is finding fun in this game too. This community is one of the best gaming ones I've seen for quite a while.
---
Spoiler alert.... not all Hulks are angry either my dude.
---
Looking at the way the base story is built, it would be almost impossible to do this without making areas of the game instanced for characters that had advanced far enough in the plot, which as much as I love Fallout seems like it would be beyond modern Bethesda. They can't even make sure I can pick up a rare yet vital quest item from it's dedicated spawn if another play has visited the random area and nabbed it to scrap. The way the world is set out, and why it's basically dead, is so deeply tied to all the quests, holotapes and even area design that it would be basically rebuilding the game from scratch, or like making New Vegas on the assets of Fallout 3.
---
Most likely, using reason along with the datamined expanded worldmap, the lands of West Virginia aren't quite so abandoned as the 'core' we are playing in right now, if NPCs are actually being added. And there is always a chance the 'Wastelanders' is just refering to us and some new guild and guild-settlement/town system. We sadly won't know until they show their cards. I'm hoping for NPCs but I can't be disappointed (or at least as much) if I expect nothing.
---
I wouldnt mind FO3 remaster
---
Ok was this survival mode? If it was adventure then you have only yourself to blame if you went to someone‚Äôs camp and did something that allowed pvp. Even in survival just assume you‚Äôre gonna get killed because of the ‚ÄúiM a RAiDeR‚Äù types.
---
I played it at release and for a bit after and don‚Äôt think I can ever go back. Have fun tho
---
1. Anti-material rifle
---
2. Colt .45
---
3. grease gun 
---
4. M1 garand
---
I‚Äôm just a sucker for these 4
---
You absolutely know that your Environment can kill you ( exploding Car) but a Player can't.
---
Stop complaining people. Turn on your Pacifist.
---
How?
---
TIL
---
THANK YOU
---
This is still happening, got a wood three star that turned in to a ONE star and an assaultron head that went from three to two, all in one visit. :&lt;
---
Good thing that combat update is coming. 
---
Obviously more work needs to be done but it's a start.
---
Are you impaired?
---
It's a great fallout game and will only get better with age

It‚Äôd be hilarious if there is no br mode coming and this sub feels all the shame possible lmao

I believe this is what i had.

---
A ton of people wouldn't mind that either. Only if Todd got over his thing about not liking remasters.
---
Except you do. I can swap the perks in at literally any moment. It‚Äôs annoying.
---
That‚Äôs a cool idea like have ghoul senators show up lol to run the place
---
Wait... what? Not liking remasters? You're joking right?
---
the only entrance i can use to exit and leave is the main door wih the vault door
---
You'll get bored soon enough. Enjoy it whilst you can and take your time.
---
r/rimjob_steve
---
Sadly no.
---
You got downvoted because they don‚Äôt like that you pointed out a fatal flaw in their argument. Enjoy your cake I guess
---
Umm... skyrim?
---
A fucking rehaul of pricing on the atom shop. I did not expect (somewhat did) that they would go with the typical overpriced shit that all stores have in games. Even after the shitshow release, they still have the cheek to price a lamp at 5 quid etc. It's a massive joke.
---
It needs a whole new engine if pvp wants to be a real thing and not just people stacking number up on one another.
---
I wasn't going to mention it but 'that ass' O.o
---
The logic isn't lost on me dude.
---
My explosive scatter tesla hits the pvp damage cap just fine.  And one shot lands 5.  So 5 damage capped shots when I only need two to land to kill you scrubs is just about alright in my book.
---
Of course these weapons are no longer attainable but they do still exist.  That must cause a bit of frustration for you idealists.  Just take comfort in the fact that I cannot sell my dupes beyond 25k. And try not to be so bitter.
---
Bye then, unless you're trolling in which case see you in the wastes.
---
I'm not trying to be a dick I just dont understand. I am the one who is lost.
---
you guys get to message each other via whatever platform you're on. Other than voice chat we have literally no form of communication.
---
yes, thanks for that. but sure, couldn't agree more and would welcome any post regarding this issue to get a much-needed fix on an issue like that, that is so frustrating and annoying like this here.
---
Just do it. And i guarantee you, you already have your first upvote! I'd love to see more of it, if it helps to get Bethesda actually do something about it. And what would even be better. Have them actually put some testing into stuff, before releasing it broken as [censored^^].
---
I know you're not. I'm just saying it makes not sense to me (and I'm sure a lot of other people either).
---
It is what it is.
---
__I like how reddit etiquette forces you to clarify you're not being a dick, when simply asking a question__
---
People are selling flux for 2500 each? I need fucking therapy now great
---
Since you'd need PA and Stabilized perk to get max dmg, you could consider Weightless/Unyielding armor with Ultra-Light mods to mainly minimize std armors' weight.
---
If you prefer playing in std armor as bloodied heavy gunner, Unyield/Bolstering + AP refresh + Sentinel/Weap Weight should be good choices. Uny/Bolst have synergy with Bloodied. You wont be moving as much with heavy guns as melee do, so Sentinel is viable ability. Weap Weight -20%s can make Bear Arms perk redundant, giving room for other perk cards.
---
That‚Äôs not at all convenient and definitely not as useful or fast as just typing to area chat ‚Äúlegendary over here‚Äù etc. don‚Äôt get defensive.
---
What makes no sense??? I'm so confused right now.
---
Lol.
---
ive had this bug since launch have you found a fix to it?
---
Not being a dick.
---
Todd's reason for being against remasters. He like the old school feel of the era that it's from and doesn't want to take away from that.
---
It baffles me that they didn‚Äôt make Survival mode legendary free from the outset. I would be so up for that.
---
I didnt know he was known for being against them.
---
Thank you for explaining one of the issues with PvP: one-shots. Not a single competitive PvP game out there does that. You are playing in the kid's pool.
---
And tell that to my 300lbs of weight in legacies I got from the last dupe wave.
---
Yes, the combat update is a good start.
---
Thank you, random Internet user.
---
Sad but true.
---
All me and the gf are asking for is Fallout 3's Chinese Assault Rifle. The handmade is close but just not the same.
---
A syringer ammo woule be an excellent answer to this
---
If you just 1 shot punch them you get 49 credits per weapon.  So you can clear westek once and get 2 and a half days of credits.
---
That is you can sell the weapons for 1400 per day.  
---
Clearing Westek once yields 3500 credits.  If you sell and sit at the vendor for a day.
---
Then you buy the 3 star crap off the tryhards.
---
Doesn't matter.  Even if you are #1 on a survival server the odds of anyone hitting you or even interested in a fight are laughable.
---
Nobody can find anyone.  And when they can they are still pve'rs that don't want confrontation.
---
There are alone five power armor spots IN Watoga and several around. Just keep server hopping and do the circle
---
Nah, don‚Äôt join the race to the bottom. Your stuff will sell at (reasonable) higher prices, you just have to be patient.
---
Those guys are parasites, don't give them too much credits.
---
Yes please. At the moment the buff seems so momentary that I don't even bother to use them and just sell all I find.
---
oh yes, the work of... largely what they did in literally all their other games? sorry, suggestions should never be considered because they possibly consume dev hours! bethesda has never asked for suggestions for this game!
---
For me it didn't replace it - I was simply an herbivore according to the stats screen, with carnivore active. I (but this may have not been nessessary) removed herbivore and re-carnivored myself once that was clear.
---
Your edit needs an edit lol
---
Ah, yes. I mentioned that above before seeing this. The ammo can even require tough materials to source. It would give us something else rewarding to do.
---
I got the vertibot by going to Poseidon powerplant, claiming it, or if it already claimed, go to the helipad and rebuild the vertibot.  Snap your pix, profit.
---
yeet!
---
Stop complaining. Turn on Pacifist. Live in peace.
---
Fallout BR? I‚Äôll redownload and give it a go. Might be fun. Might not. Only one way to know!
---
I price mine at 800 because these camps with cheap serums are running a net cap loss. 
---
With all the bonuses I can sell one serum for almost 600 (565 last I checked).
---
If someone is selling them at 300 a pop I'm still looking at a 75% profit for flipping them to the vendor bots. 800 is low enough to be reachable to most players, but high enough to prevent vendor flipping.
---
&gt; we all are playing and enjoying it. 
---
I won't disagree that I'm getting my (on a heavily reduced cd-key) money's worth, mostly due to the friends I've made and the parts of the game that would be tenfold better in a 'traditional' Bethesda release, but while I'm having my fun I can't help but deeply resent the game it \*could\* have been while doing so. (I mean, have you \*looked\* at the attention to detail in the Snallygaster model and texture? It puts anything, ANYTHING, in Fallout2, NV, and 4 to utter shame, and whoever thought up that particular FEV beastie and it's looks should be instantly put on creature design for Starfield and TES6, along with the guy who actually made and animated the model. &gt;!And whoever wrote the MoM storyline. I've never wanted to brutally murder an already dead character more than I did in that particular story!&lt;.)
---
Imagine the map, creatures, and main quest of Fallout 76 if you could interact and fight alongside even a tenth of the corpses that are barely cooling (such as the Brotherhood remnants) and recieve your missions from the Overseer in person while using charisma/speech checks to boost her spirit and dig out some of the oversharing she does in her tapes, training under a Mistress in the MoM questline and for certain events to be revealed in real time and how much harder that final reveal would have hit if you couldn't see it coming a mile away due to the nature of the game (that you know going in, or after a few hours, that you will never meet a living human who isn't a player), and that some of the more colorful characters were companions who would carry your burdens and offer some semblence of comradrie that isn't smack talking with your friends while you teabag a bloated ghoul.
---
I think part of the reason so many were so upset is the glacial development times/cycles that Bethesda has. They aren't one of the developers that will spin out a stable and engrossing story based RPG in between 2-3 years and sticking to one series. Between Starfield, TES6, and then finally Fallout 5, I'm going to be in my early forties by the time we get the next 'traditional' Fallout. It's going to be near on a decade, and if not, only a little less, since Fallout 4.
---
Plus, I have no doubt 76 is bleeding players constantly due to frustration. Just today I've been trapped in several bases and had to waste caps getting in/out, I've had my sniper rifle kill enemies and then their health bar spring back, I've had a scorch beast I helped kill in the Cranberry Bog follow my fast travel and fall into my base onto by stash box making me unable to interact with anything but it's corpse, and I've heard several of my friends grumble over Discord over issues (such as bodies with legendaries in it just disappearing into the ground and other players one-shotting all the mobs in an area before less well-geared and elvelled characters can so much as tag them) and trying to laugh the frustration away with "Ain't that just Bethesda for ya" jokes. We need a stable and fully enjoyable game, that will be able to maintain a playerbase large enough to warrent the resources expansions and such will require, before getting excited over new features or 'something different'.
---
Honestly pvp or not like still... thank Christ... and I‚Äôm a fuckin atheist lol
---
Hulk was never one-shotted ever.
---
That‚Äôs not an engine problem those are design choices... wtf...
---
Pretty sure they said the main reason they remastered Skyrim was because they wanted to test the engine, ended up with a full remaster and released it because it was just there.
---
Something along the lines of that.
---
I guess that could happen with FO3, but yeah. I would reaaally like a remaster of FO3, especially because of the PC problems.
---

I don't think they stack do they? I recently looked this up and it was indicated they do not stack
---
Anyone can take it, but high levels check it less often at least. The mailboxes are probably even better, but there is always the chance they get overlooked.
---
Man, I wish we could have mail boxes at our camps where people could leave gifts that only the camp-owner could chose to pick up or scrap.
---
Ha, I feel ya. The other day I was nuking prime and I missed by a mile because I was chatting with someone in discord. Glad yours worked out for you though!
---
There are holotapes that describe nonferal ghouls calling their friends-from-previous-life to stop the madness as they aren't feral.
---
Thanos put him in to sleep pretty fast.
---
Then where are they????
---
It's amazing how highly praised fairly minor updates are when you're starved for fixed/improved game mechanics.
---
I run full unyielding shrouded wood armor. Sitting on 37 agility while sneaking means things will basically push past you to find what's shooting them.
---
Just wait till the wastelanders dlc
---
Oh so these are rare! That explains why they are the only remaining grenade I need to craft.
---
Is Ash Heap the primary place to find for event rewards?
---
I suspect you don't have any of these weapons.  Data mine it kiddo.  They are no longer in the drop pool.  I understand you are upset but HAHA.
---
Does your left or right peck hold that 300 lbs?  I bet you got Kylie Jenner and Taylor Swift just ready to see action.
---
I'm afraid where other NPCs are. Dead. The holotapes even describe who killed them - their friends-from-previous-lifes.
---
Friend and I used to have it working by forming in the main menu aswell, but yesterday it was just impossible for us :( 
---
We are on different networks, but thanks a lot for trying to help out!

If you want to stop spawns from happening, build a quiet little room lined with punji boards to boost your defense. I haven't had a single camp attack in the last two characters using this method.

Fallout 3 Remaster.

Atom Shop prices lowered.

In-depth info about Nuclear Winter. Like the reveal of the road map as we got for Wild Appalachia

Fallout Shelter Cross-Save. I have an awesome Vault on my Phone from Day1, I stopped playing that and built another one on PS4, now I got the Switch as well, but I don't feel like starting from scratch again.
---
Nothing more really, what can we expect, they have very few IPs. Im down to listen to anything Fallout.
---
That's not lore friendly either. Ferals dont attack normal ghouls.
---
they were all killed off by health humans.
---
People should be happy to pay $60 and get a working game 'eventually'
---
Such entitled people
---
That's kind of a stretch as well. Every single human killed every single non feral ghoul and then every single human died of something else. C'mon....
---
I am a PvP beast and this is my sneaky sniper:

https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/imprezobus/
---
The answer is maximum one chameleon and at least two unyieldings, but the build descriptions contain detailed information as well as some insights into meta.
---
They were killed by humans, not other ghouls.
---
That's fine, I don't have to prove anything to a random Reddit user. Check my posts if you want to.
---
You don't know how duping works, do you? Inform yourself and then come back, kiddo.
---
New players don‚Äôt need any help, as the game is already easy. Let them enjoy that period where they actively have to hunt for better weapons, mods, and resources; it‚Äôs genuinely the best part of FO76.
---
if you have an aoe mutation you will always (fail) the optional.
---
This is definitely the issue. Gotta get more charmin', kid.
---
How dare they didn't leave the game to die in the state we oh so loved to tear apart instead of coming up with constructive criticism!!!
---
So every single non feral was killed by humans and then every single human was killed by something else... c'mon man, my suspension of disbelief cant handle that even in a game about the apocalypse.
---

---
I would go for something like this. You have way too many weight reduction perks, that are not going to help you in combat. If you get over encumbered and need to fast travel back to your base you can always swap them in. I would also add some more defensive perks in order to make you less squishy.I also assume that you are going for a non-bloody build, and will be working with others in the group.
---
You're aware raids and five star gear is coming, right? Maybe quit now if something that basic is all it takes.
---
And a shrubbery.
---
I've been looking for the stupid doughnut recipe and it's so frustrating
---
You guys are way too hostile. Yikes lol.
---
Nah gonna pvp for now and then quit in a month or so
---
if you hold another event, post a flyer. :)
---
Have another
---
Thanks to all of you for the help!
---
How so? I've been purposfully avoiding the MQ until I'm high enough that I can wander through any area at my leisure without being gangbanged by a rowdy buch of 60+ Bloated Ferals, as I experianced countless times while exploring. That said, the few I listened to in the BETA were engaging. I know the rough spoilers of her story, and I think she is potentially a misled corperate loyalist to Vault Tech, but a generally well meaning one. It almost sounds like the Vault Dwellers became her surrogate childen, in her heart, after events I won't mention due to spoilers.
---
sure is.
---
Magnetic personality and a boss with empath and you've got 3 monsters on a leash.
---
&gt;I could be wrong though.
---
You're very wrong. 
---
There's more than 0 NPCs. A crap ton more than 0. You know, like Grahm, Rose, Biv, The Purveyor, MODUS, all the vendor bots and Whitesprings staff, just to name some.
---
Even after the game has been out for so long, people STILL perpetuate the myth that there are no NPCs.
---
There are no --&gt; HUMAN &lt;-- NPCs.
---
I've bought stuff like that if someone has good prices or a neat setup but nothing I was actually looking for. See it as a good way to tip the person running the shop.
---
Also blocking a player only makes you invisible to them on the map. If I block you then you shoot me and I shoot you back then PvP is initiated again and I can be killed by you.
---
Not hostile, just not so vehemently opposed to change it would make me quit because I *momentarily* didn't have the very best or most optimal gear. So lame. You go PvP dude, sounds like your gear is doing all the heavy lifting.
---
Hopefully finished, too, because in a live-service game there are never guarantees that resources will be spared for resolving pesky things like cliffhangers when a game stops being profitable. If Wastelanders fails to bring in a new/fresh audience, and the oldguard go the way of all veteran players of online games with no genuine endgame, I doubt we'll see another full-sized expansion.
---
Way to argue semantics dude. Everyone knows what is meant when we say NPCs, everyone knows that there are non human characters, and no one is upset or "perpetuating myths".
---
Aight

Means you can change the card out as you please
---
Think you‚Äôll be better off with 2 stars to barb as that is 1 point per STR, but the damage card is +5%
---
Also, highly recommend fist weapons, as they have higher base damage and only one three star card is required. Will free you up for your utilities like pack mule or traveling pharmacy
---
Any questions, please ask, there will be quite a delay though as I am going to bed
---
800 still seems realistic to me because I'm not honestly sure how much they cost to make haven't managed to get a recipe yet. Thousand is out there though
---
You learn through one of the Free States side quests that people were very hostile to non feral ghouls, killing many of them. 
---
You also find notes pinned to some house doors that explain how many of them have joined up and left the area, heading to a friendly community in the DC ruins.
---
Dozens I tell you!
---
You‚Äôre welcome.
---
Every human (and many other living thing) has become a scorched. We don‚Äôt know the extent of non-feral ghouls, but there might not have been as many due to the fact West Virginia wasn‚Äôt hit as hard during the bombings. The few non feral ghouls we know about were killed or went to D.C.
---
&gt; Way to argue semantics dude. 
---
LOL!
---
Says the person that equates ghouls as being the same as humans. Are you going to say that the Super Mutants are human too?
---
Thank for the chuckle. Made my night :)
---
I wish they would tell how many legendaries were in a vendor when we looked at it on a map, would save a lot of fast traveling.

Ghouls are literally humans. They just have burnt up irradiated skin.
---
Lmao. Guess we know who doesn‚Äôt have good gear. ‚ÄúSounds like your gear is doing all the heavy lifting‚Äù. Sounds like you don‚Äôt know that perks and gear mean basically everything.
---
Also; yes i will enjoy PvP.
---
If you had the arsenal some of us high-end players had, you‚Äôd understand that it‚Äôs not worth regaining the max lvl items, especially since there‚Äôd need to be another duping crisis to have a chance at getting the once glorious weps we had at lv50.
---
You sound like a child who‚Äôs mad that I stated my opinion.
---
All the people who downvoted me can enjoy playing soggy biscuit and turning a blind eye to the truth, enjoy your game lol
---
Again?  So it‚Äôs E3 last year all over again

Grats. I was out of luck, I just couldn't find a crossbow (and didn't have Weaponsmith 2 to craft one), nor a camera, until I made a group of friends who directed me to the later and made me one of the former, and helped me with the revival goals. After all was said and done the challenges (Archery, Athletics, and Swimming) took only a few hours. I can see what Bethesda were getting at with them, but it's cruel and punishing to primarily solo players, and shared world loot is a joke that was never funny. It was bad enough when quest items fell through the world in single-player titles, or explosions sent keys or notes flying into the unknown, but at least you could reload or use the console. I can't make MrKnickersFace2018 not loot the item I needed for a quest ten minutes before I knew I needed it.
---
 Honestly for end game players they're dirt cheap to make, a couple flux, plus some other base crafting materials, boom done. For recipes, the queen, standard scorchbeasts, and treasure maps
---
And Super Mutants are just humans afflicted with FEV and Robobrains are just humans without a body.
---
Nice one! Ah, you're do adorable!
---
Also, the level cap increasing would shake the economy. Every item would lower in market value. One small one-day duping crisis costed me about 250k in caps/trades.
---
This makes most of us broke lol
---
This is a game, not a business. When we hit rock bottom, we decide its time to find a new game. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Shhhhh... it's ok. I know you're just a troll now. Nothing you say has any value to me. Shhhhhh........
---
Fallout 76 on Switch with Cross-Save
---
"Fallout: server hop" is how this game could be called. Sometimes it is hardcordly frustrating. I am happy you did get backpack and camera too.
---
I'm not too sure actually. Anti-Armour doesn't work properly on energy weapons, and I believe the Gamma gun is energy classed, so I don't think so. I have an AA Gamma gun in my stash, but it does less damage than my Executioners, plus the nerf with cavaliers and sentinel made it easier to kill these unkillable people.
---
I grab the queen every time its up, never done a treasure map maybe I'll start. Thanks!
---
Sell mine for 125$. Sold every one I have ever got since vendor machine started. You can always lower your price if it don‚Äôt sale  but it will
---
Why you here then?
---
Check [Ragechornicles](https://www.youtube.com/user/RageChronicles) on youtube.  It is the ONLY FO76 lifeline out there.  That tryhard is struggling.  This game is just trash sir.
---
I wish there were more but this is the only dude out there.  He went form BS invincible to crying about bloody builds.  This game is trash.  There are no others sir.  Reddit... is more entertaining than FO76.
---
Okay. ^okay
---
You want that tissue now?
---
I hope to learn more about Wastelanders.
---
There's a lot of misinformation about the damage level of this thing. The RifleGaming video showing 500+ damage failed to mention you need a Bloodied build to get that, even though it's not a bloodied weapon. I'm level 132. The Unstoppable Monster was base damage of 122 for me and only the addition of Talons mutation really made any difference. If you have a full Unyielding set of armor, radicool and adrenaline perks and drop yourself to less than 20% health, sure...
---
If you're running a more conventional build it may not be the death stick people make out.
---
I suggested this awhile ago, it is a great idea.
---
Do 'Feed the People' a few times, and keep and only use the tins of stew for the xp bonus. Sleep every two hours until Well Rested. Take 'Inspirational' to rank 3 and whenever around other players who seem like they know what they are doing use the Team Up emote and/or politely ask over Area voice if anyone would be kind enough to invite you. Put together a set of power armor, no matter how patchwork, at level 30, and use it purely to enter nuke zones; climb onto fences or locations enemies can't melee you, and stay at least thirty or forty 'feet' from the high-levels as they will be drawing all the heavy fire and Scorch beast/queen sonic-rad attacks, and tag anything you can see and anything you can't with VATS (making sure to get a new hits on the beast/queen) so you get xp from every kill. Attend any and every nuke site you see, especially on Whitesprings (bloated ghouls and lots of things to stand on out of the way, lure them out by blowing up cars), and even the scorched Queen, because you can survive and profit from it in massive xp and even Legendaries if you do it right. You'll also likely get adopted if you talk over mic and are friendly, because there are some good people in the game, they are just wary of griefers or already part of established groups. If you just turn up and disappear like the Mysterious Stranger they will never realise you might be able to use a hand. I hit 50 just yesterday, and I'm already scraping/scripping/selling more Legendaries per day than I can use, and would be happy to throw many of the more useful ones at a newbies feet, and \*I'm\* pretty new myself, so Imagine how veterans feel.
---
Lol.  What makes you want to be "that guy"?
---
 I've been playing mmo's for about 2 decades now.  In that time reading the forums of each game there's always been one moron that no matter how well the game is doing always comes in saying "the game's dead bro".
---
 Are you feelings hurt that you were one of the sheeple that listened to all the kiddy youtubers give bad reviews so you never bought the game?  Now you see all the wonderful improvements they're doing and how well the game is actually doing now.  Butt hurt much?
---
 You be you though.  Keep on being a miserable hater if that's what you like to do.  I'm going to keep on playing fallout 76 for years to come and I will chuckle every time someone like you makes a post like this.
---
Chopped wood for four hours to get junkies pokie stick a couple weeks back.  Get on my level.
---
Swearing after getting legendaries for scrip: 44,907,400
---
Oh no, you've mistaken me entirely dude.
---
I genuinely find you to be adorable and hilarious. Mainly due to being so self-unaware in the face of logic. 
---
You literally made my night. No sarcasm.
---
Honestly any game from any company could have taken FO76/Bethesda role at the time, 2017-18 was a tension build up a minor things being made into huge blowouts by clickbaiting youtubers adding fuel to a fire that really didn't need it.  
---
Anytime any transaction or earn able reward was in a game they were saying it's pay to win, or a game is made grindy to force you to buy shit but they never had proof just hearsay.  
---
A good example is AssCreed:O where they were saying that if you don't get the EXP boosters you were forced to do literally every side quest to complete the main story as it was time gated.  
---
Yet streamers proved that wasn't the case, barely touching side stories and they were always at level for the main story.  
---
I got the game for free so I decided to grab the EXP boosters, and I was always overlevelled for the content making it too easy.  
---
At somepoint the outrage was needed, but since then it's just gotten worse and worse and every little thing that is harmless is the worst thing since Hitler to the people that thrive off of outrage culture.
---
Nah nah. It's ok. I looked through your comment history. I get it. You're a huge troll with a superiority complex. It's all good, carry on oh mighty internet God.
---
I got my legacy weapons.  Legit of course.  Im good.
---
If you are badass... top mr rage is all I ask bc honest to god... this game needs it.
---
We're here to help others have a good time
---
The annoying thing is we already have welcome mats for workshops (spawn points)
---
But they're not available for camps.
---
Hell I see serums for 100-200 caps frequently enough.
---
THEN... 
---
Then, when you have found the shrubbery, you must place it here, beside this shrubbery, only slightly higher, so we get the two-level effect with a little path running down the middle.
---
The survey that represents less than 1% of total players (as the OP states.) Even if 100% of the respondents stated they hated PvP that doesn‚Äôt in any way mean that the other 99.9% of players feel the same. People forget that this subreddit is not at all representational of the player base. It is a tiny fraction of a tiny fraction of the people who play the game. It skews heavily in certain directions because of the type of people who participate in a fo76 subreddit.
---
Like any company, Bethesda has exactly one goal: make money. They will add the content and modes that their market research and player stats suggest will make them the most money. They make money by selling new copies of the game and (likely primarily) selling atoms. Right now there is a huge market for cosmetic items in PvP games so of course they put their some of their focus on the PvP content.
---
I‚Äôm a player who doesn‚Äôt spend any money at all in game and I have no interest in PvP. I also love this game. If adding more PvP content means they make more money then I am happy, even if I will never touch that content. As long as they are making money they will continue to support this game and that‚Äôs really all I want.
---
Your loss.  Trying not to come off so whiny next time.
---
Usual Commando perks for smg really
---
I like this idea.  And it could reset when you log out/server hop.  I've gone through my inventory at the end of a session many times and said, "Where did all this come from?" And have even seen unlearned plans or recipes in my pip boy and no idea where they came from. 
---
Good suggestion OP.
---
Anything else you wanted to say?
---
Alright I don't really pay attention to perk cards anymore but I'll use that
---
I have had LARs from SBs and from high level area bosses. Don't waste your time trying to farm this way... buy the plan and create the lowest level rifle you can (use super duper perk) scrap them... it took me about 300 to learn them all... or at least the ones that I want.
---
An item cap increase, no matter how unwanted it may be, is still the best way to leave all the old duped items behind. They will be at the old cap, while new items comes along with better stats at a higher level.
---
true. didn't thought about it. and yes, now it seems to makes even more sense to get those at our camps.
---
i'm pretty sure bethesda shouldn't have a problem to implement it. it's just we have to get them to do so. maybe take care of the game also a bit from time to time, rather than spending all devotion only onto their atom-shop. seems sometimes they just forget that there's also something around it, a bit game, outside of the atom-shop.
---
Best one was between two foundations and next to acid extractor. The acid pool kept damaging me, so I couldn't fast travel out.
---
Theres a certain spawn in harpers ferry, on the roof of a salon in the northern section. It has a Green storefront sign. Sits on a shelf. I check it every time I log in ^.^ 7/10 times I'll get one.
---
That sucks
---
He'd probably hit someone in the face first shot, break their nose and break the canon, also, the bag would be covered in blood and useless after.
---
It seems to spawn visitors next to the original spot of your C.A.M.P. machine. So it doesn't matter where you move it. Your own spawn point is affected by the new location of your C.A.M.P.
---
If it‚Äôs explosive then Alain demolition expert and grenadier and possibly fireproof too. The only thing to remember with an explosive smg is that without a long barrel, the range is too short so you‚Äôll injure yourself with the explosives, especially with the high rate of fire.
---
me to was wondering because it said i had a problem with my dns settings or something among those lines
---
It's got a suppressor so I found out the hard way quick lol

I mark flux up to 199 caps each and have no problem selling it all on Xbox.
---
pro tip #5..... DO NOT build c.a.m.p near enemy strongholds. I have been in the same place since November not one time have I had any part of my camp destroyed by a mob or any person all with 2 turrets. You need to move and stop bitching it's the games fault.
---
A lot of people are way high in those machines. Nah I'll go find it, thanks. 
---
If they have camp and thier bed is accessable you better believe you're getting a bag of shit vegetables and fruit.
---
Love the slow "what the..." turn üòÅ
---
they got scorched
---
Good point on power user I'm going to have to check that. I can guarantee critical savvy all the other crit perks don't help power usage on your fusion core.
---
What?
---
2 beds huh.. trouble at home? Ha...
---
That has more to do with the weapon and the mod on the weapon. 10 mm with reflex sightis super cheap. Also 4clover, crit savvy ect....
---
Yea this west tek area that everyone recommended is really good I‚Äôm leveling up for perks for a bloodied build I‚Äôm 116 rn and I just put my camp near west tek and grind the super mutants for XP and caps and also idk if I was lucky but every run I would get like 2 legendaries so I have loads rn but can‚Äôt scrap them for the legendary vendor as I have already got the max legendary scrap points I can or whatever it‚Äôs called
---
imo it will be the opposite:
---
-new game mode (enhanced pve)
---
-vault raids (one of those will be a battle royale arena)
---
-new features
---
\^\^
---
Good to hear. I submitted a support ticket on help.bethesda.net since there‚Äôs no downtime reflected on their status page or Twitter.
---
How is there always a fanboy that comments this haha
---
If I want caps for Serums I sell serums to the NPC vendors, if a players need them I give them for free. After all, I get all the ingredients for free and I got all the recipes for free, never was a cost for me that I need to get back.
---
Its working for me, got an error when logging in but after that works fine
---
Me too same situation !
---
I always wonder if they are like dude GTFO you high level fool I want to kill these guys!
---
I usually always help the lower levels in fights regardless tho. I remember that start, died a lot because I'm like hey let's go to the cranberry bog at level 12.. yay!
---
i really hope this problem is solved quickly doesnt seem like maintenance either
---
really glad you posted this i honestly thought it was a problem with my internet probider :D

Okay. 
---
Anything else, bud?
---
You don't need to do a bloody build to get high DPS.
---
 I can get my TSE lever action rifle close to 400 damage.
---
 I don't like low health either so I will never do a bloodied build.
---
I was getting that too fifteen minutes ago, but it just let me in.
---
Glad you're enjoying it.
---
That's about how I feel. I don't even carry junk when I go in there.  I felt weak in the wasteland and I didn't like it.
---
It has become more of an opportunity for 2 supporters to circle jerk than it is a critic of what is.
---
Reddit has always been open to their blind sheep.
---
Fact is everyone knows Bethesda has nothing.  This game is trash.  They know it.  Much like D3 and the all mighty GABEN.  That ended in a CONSUMER victory and GABEN begging not to get a real job.
---
This is a client not his baby.  So it is even lower on the pos ladder.  They are using E3 as a skyrime online u morons.  A deadder game than yours. lol holy shit how can you be this blind.
---
Bethesda is now underground for 4 years.  They havent even developed their next game.  This was the same game engine as FO3 for shit sake.  They have nothing.  Maybe a zombie click n smash for the iphone 12.
---
Works fine for me, got an error when first logging in but after that no issues
---
This is Fallout. Any NPC that drops loot when it dies will eventually (who am I kidding, *immediately*) get wiped out.

It's a "military cap" renamed to the superior beret, BEHOLD.

80% of the time a do a workshop I get a set up then the server crashes I get nothing. happened just yesterday needed many acid total BS.
---
Two shot Teslas are broken at the moment. They display the same damage as a regular one.
---
update:
---
i tried to log in a few times and now it worked for me!
---
Good idea, and probably how they will introduce NPCs into the region.   
---
Only problem with your idea is that it would require them to redesign how the servers work. Right now we really don't have dynamic servers. They're static. The game world does not react to the players or change as it resets frequently. They probably did this to make the servers more manageable and stable.   
---
But they could have the vaults open in one update, creating small areas where the vault dwellers have setup camps near the entrances of their vaults. Then in another update months later, move them out to new areas.   
---
The big issue would be, from a story perspective, eliminating the scorched. In the main questline, your character get's the vaccine for the virus, but the carriers are still spreading the plague everywhere. So there'd need to be a server-wide adjustment of the questlines that reflected some change, like the scorchqueen being killed or the vaccine being delivered to the vault dwellers.
---
Yeah, 76 is the first FO game where I feel my character living in the wasteland
---
Not an option currently, only alternative is to move to a location far away from a spawn point which tends to be boring/bland.
---
Did you put the DNA in the machine next to the terminal first?
---
Turrets seem like the only option, here, aside from using concrete barriers to block them off. Unfortunately, random visits from unfriendly neighbors are a consequence of building near pre-existing structures. Just be glad it's not super mutants or Scorched taking pot shots at your base from 2.7 miles away. They literally shoot at your base from beyond the draw limit.
---
I am still hoping they will add Factions, and if they do they could use the Whitesprings rooms as instanced apartments for Enclave loyalists that choose to move into Whitesprings.
---
Morgantown could be rebuilt by the  Responders factions.
---
One of the abandoned bunkers could become a Freestates community.
---
Top of the World could become slowly retaken by Raiders.
---
BoS could set up a military camp in the Bog.
---
I see. Still trying to sell it. Lol.
---
The main thing missing is any incentive from the developers to make it a player hub. Like making fast travel to it free. That would be a quick and simple fix that would change a LOT.
---
It should have been in the game in the first place
---
Everytime I fast travel to a camp, as soon as I spawn, I start hauling ass in any direction. Most of the time the camp hasn‚Äôt loaded in yet after I spawn and I can run through their home before it‚Äôs loaded completely.
---
I still cant log in ( PS4 EU)
---
Nobody will pay for that.
---
I duped so many Explosive Scatter beam Teslas.  Those hit all targets half a dozen times instantly.  The damage is at the pvp cap so if 2 of those land.. mind you this is one click of the mouse..  it kills even the most hardcore pvper.
---
Your gun im sorry is shit.
---
Don't buy armour if you know whats good for you.  1 Scatter explosive tesla is all you need.  But ... it doesnt drop anymore.  Still in game.  And 25k credits wont get you one.
---
Best of luck.
---
you realise that we don't know that it's gonna be a battle royale either? going from the name alone, my guess has always been that it'll be a kind of ultra-hard mode, where you have to keep warm in a brutally dificult new mode. besides, I think battle royale would work really well in fallout 76! it already has most of the stuff it needs, and I at least think it would be fun. and, as OP said, nuclear winter wont be the only thing being added in that update.
---
Stable is pure I think...
---
I can see that. I mean we get free fast travel to Vault 76 with no real value to it. May as well make it useful, right?
---
There was plenty of stuff in the base game. A complete game you might say.
---
400+ hours in game, dozens upon dozens of SBQ's, hundreds of treasure maps and uncounted number of normal Scorchbeasts. Number of Mutation recipes found = 0
---
Bullshit, how delusional are you?
---
I am pretty sure they do. Back in the days before Two-shot and Explosive legendary traits was brought to balance I had a shotgun with these stats. It was exceptionally easy to kill oneself with this weapon, and when I equipped Grenadier I started killing myself with even greater ease. I have no nifty videos or anything to back this up, but all my anecdotal experience says yes.

Waaaaahh, muh doc is free and they are executing on their content update plan.

https://www.falloutbuilds.com/builds/thebuildguide/
---
When I started making my build this is the guide I used and it still seems relevant today.  Other than reading that I suggest looking at all the cards and deciding a play style you want.  Maybe even get an idea from some other builds. It looks like you're going one handed so you already have that.  After that is do you want to go stealth, vats, stealth and vats and do you want to use power armor.  Also look at some of the legendary effects for armor and weapons that you will want.
---
sweet. thanks. Now I just need to Nuke someplace lol

"I don't really pay attention to perk cards" - why this post was necessary

How the fuck are you 300 hours in and you haven‚Äôt completed a third of the quests? You‚Äôre either lying or not even playing the game.

It basically forces all game makers with text chat options to provide a service of text-to-speech. That's... not easy to do *accurately enough* to satisfy the law in the USA (not to mention other parts of the world with their own take).
---
It's easier just to not do it in the first place. Hence the silly little emotes we get instead.
---
this works sometimes, yes. but as i've told someone before, it's even more frustrating if it doesn't. and sometimes, depending on the location, does also not work fine, as when spawn at a cliff f.e., you might run into a direction just to end up being stuck because of it. however, thx for this. but these are just workarounds and in no way the solution needed. as i just hope for a fix, where i don't have to bother with pathetic crap like that. stuff that would have been fixed the same week by a hotfix by any dev team on any other game. as it's typical bethesda. where every bug needs its own patch, released to fix half years later, to end up, brake something other then lol
---
as said, i just hope this gets the fix it needs. but as said, thx. and your add is a workaround for sure. but think it needs more than that.
---
Well, as you say, they have the hard data on PvP and Survival-mode. And when they looked at the data on how many plays Survival they decided to add another PvP-mode. So most likely the data does not say what you think it does.
---
Not a PvPer myself, but I don't mind trying it out if it is kept separately from the rest. Which it is. Good times.
---
I explore and do events.
---
I decided to find every map location before I finished up.
---
I desperately hope they add Npcs in some form, the world just feels so empty sometimes
---
Yeah I find that hard to believe, how do you even know how many hours you have?
---
R/unexpecteditcrowd
---
The way I judge that it's fully loaded is when the radio starts playing, it typically takes about a minute or two for mine to fully loaded.
---
Ehm... thanks caring bot, but I am fine. This was actually a nice feature on reddit I did not know existed. Since I work with suicide prevention as part of my regular work, this was a feature that made me happy.
---
Perhaps it doesn't. But when I get placed in the same servers with just another 10 guys over and over again... yeah, not looking good.
---
The decision of a BR mode (*if* that's what it is) doesn't come from the Survival data, but from the success of other games. And somehow, someone at Bethesda has convinced the rest that in Fallout 76 it will work too and they will swim in dollars. But it isn't, and they won't.
---
Pretty much. Vault 76 is a travel HUB, but without any real benefit. You can't go back in, there's nothing useful near it, and no reason to go back there. So other then saving on the price of a trip across the map, there's no reason to go to it. 
---
Make a central location like Whitesprings the HUB and suddenly everyone uses it for socializing and vending. It already is a HUB of sorts just because of it's location and the convenience of that train-station next to it. 
---
Make it free (which it should be if you've joined the enclave) and suddenly everyone will use it. 
---
Hell, if the designers had put any thought into quest design and rewards, (don't tell me they thought this shit out. Kill and loot a scorchbeast and tell me they gave any thought to the loot/reward system) they'd make factions actually joinable and turn their bases into HUBs.
---
The way it should work is that instead of just joining a faction for main quest reasons, there are additional side quests you can do for the faction.  Reach a high enough rank in the faction and get tangible rewards. Like their base become a free fast travel location. If you want to limit it, make it so they can only do this for one faction at a time.
---
Suddenly you have people who are happily members of one faction or another. And suddenly you have player HUBs and communities around faction bases.
---
There is an achievement to get 7600 hours in game that tracks your time in world.
---
That you didn't know that is laughable
---
Stay positive and believe all those lies Todd and Bethesda are going to tell you. Bethesda will deliver only broken games with minimum content. Remember to pre-order all garbage they offer and you will get cheap china products that won't be anything like you really believed. Stay still positive and forget facts and keep down voting all negative comments even they are truth.
---
I tell you, the biggest problem with being a lone wanderer is doing the multi people stuff...
---
I never understood the no living NPC outrage.  Of all the things wrong with the game this one is on the very very very bottom.
---
What, a challenge in the game or an actual achievement? I‚Äôve played the game enough, gave it many chances since release and gotten up to the nuke stage but you‚Äôre straight up lying if you think the game was shipped complete

Same here on EU

I totally don‚Äôt remember seeing that when I first read it, thank you! Now I‚Äôm even more excited for the new stuff lol
---
I know I won't be the only one to say this, but,  
---
Welcome Mat, fully functioning one that's is. The current one is a joke.

Answer: It is coming

I camp near one of the ws entrances to I always got sentry bots and assaultron story help defend
---
When you spawn if you just run in one direction for a moment, you can almost always outpace the loading of the camp.  But also if you you do get stuck you can fast travel to the same camp for free without going anywhere else, and it loads almost instantly that time, putting you in a different place on the camp that is ok since you are in the area which has now already loaded.  Many people may know this and still find it frustrating, but for those that don‚Äôt just wanted to point that out as I didn‚Äôt realize you could fast travel to the same spot twice and second time would modify the space/time of your arrival.
---
It seems to mostly happen when foundations are quite high off the ground, if people built them closer to the ground you‚Äôd just pop up on to them, so if you see people appearing in your base underground, there‚Äôs something you can do to fix it for now
---
"garuntee"? Do you even spell check? Sorry for my OCD humour. Offence not meant (probably!)
---
* Caps: I came up with this [caps stash run for Morgantown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XbvJPfitVhE) around the time brewing came out. All the stashes still show up, but the Highschool one's a bit iffy sometimes.
---
* EXP: I still run to the golf club at Whitespring every so often for the ghoul horde there for XP and a few legendaries to scrip.
---
Make them invulnerable. Case closed.
---
Except there is a Fallout Version of an Nazeem type npc. Then give him instant respawn to let the frustration flow.
---
Should be available at lvl 30 if for you to pick:

100% agree. It works great if the camp isn‚Äôt on rough terrain and outside of my load distance. I don‚Äôt know if I have Bethesda Stockholm syndrome (been playing since FO3) or what but I‚Äôm kinda used to Bethesda games having issues like this and not being fixed, then I just keep dealing with it. But like I said, I agree. It‚Äôs a quality of life problem that should be fixed. Only downside to welcome mats is it could be used for griefing. Like, spawn next to a spike board that can launch you off a cliff, trap you in a flamer pit, etc.
---
totally agree
---
It can be tricky solo, 1st solo nuke run I did I blew myself up twice trying to back away from pulse mines due to tripping over some dead robot bodies lol, but if you didn‚Äôt want to launch a nuke you could msg someone who‚Äôs selling serums in their vending machines and ask them if they have any spare stable flux they could sell you, chances are if they regularly craft mutation serums they prob have spare flux
---
I bought a bunch of one type of serum for 100 from someones vendor and resold them for 1000 each.  When the sales slowed down I put them at 900.  They now sit at 750.  I will drop them down to 500 soon... my point is.  I can not help that people buy them and I would be foolish to sell them for lower than what they sell at.
---
They have no problem running text chat in ESO.
---
Youtube asshats make their living by criticizing the creations of others....
---
Bottom dwelling gutter trash. Its easy to criticize, its hard to create. They should try creating original content and see how they like hearing it ripped to shreds with no balance on the good side.
---
I stopped fast traveling to camps because of this. It gets old fast, especially when you're willing and have spent money in the Atom Store. This can't be a difficult bug to fix given the functionality we've had previously.
---
for me it isn't possible to travel to the same spot again. it just doesn't give me the option. however, i'm aware of a few workarounds. but to me simply no acceptable solutions. as i just want to see it fixed. it's not asking a lot to have a functional spawn system on camps, where it just not happens that you have to deal with pathetic crap like that.
---
no offense and see how you're out to help by offering solutions. but at the end, again, it's just workarounds and to me, it needs a lot more than that. still, thx!
---
Poor Ned :(
---
Thanks it makes sense now
---
I overcharge on purpose for one thing. And it sits there for a long time but eventually some one buys it (faschnat plans).   
---
As for something like a level 10 pistol? I wouldn't even bother selling. No one is going to buy it and it will just sit there and take space. Honestly, if something doesn't sell for a while I reduce the price cause honestly I don't need that shit taking space. And if it sells for much less than I'm willing to get for it then I stop bothering selling it (rather stuff that sells and if it is a pain to get so that it's only worth selling if I can get x amount of money, then I'm not going to bother getting more of it if it won't sell for x amount of money).
---
Yeah, the text mod is great. The developers have stated in a recent interview (PC gamer I think it was) that they are tracking the top mods used to see what features players most want added. So hopefully we get Perk Manager tools, better inventory, text chat and similar to the game in the not too far future.
---
Yea I think I was killing non star legendaries
---
Fully Agreed.
---
Never saw so much folks you can debate and laugh at the same time with, mocking and mock back without bad blood, which help each other out when help is needed.
---
Like a good nukashine
---
They need for fix the bugged out exploding beam splitter lasers, nerf stealthboys, and teslas for there to be any chance of balanced pvp
---
I will check into that. thanks
---
May the fun in Appalachia never end for ya mate!
---
Garantay, grant-e, gah-runty.  
---
Non taken my dude
---
Another person who wants people to play like them.....
---
Sounds like a commie that needs bashing.
---
true. but the main reason for how to set spawns is where you have your thingy (don't know how called in english lol) first, when you build your camp. however, i just would like to see a fix on something that on any other game out there, would have been patched by a hotfix the same week, when accured.
---
if bethesda would actually spend a bit of time, just a few minutes, as this is all it would take to see this issue, rather then devote all time into the atom-shop, then we wouldn't have to deal with wimpy, pathetic nooby bugs like this.
---
don't want to be that dude. but sometimes just smh over the bugs i experience in this game. as it feels like it's not bethesda, but their apprentices programming the game.
---
Lmao that bot. Made my day. Thanks for your opinion. waiting for some more
---
Mutation serums for 500+. Plans sold at face value.
---
I think they will probably add them as like, placeable objects with barks and then proclaim "we did it! we added NPCs!" and ignore that what people actually wanted was a game with characters and a story or something
---
I was on survival yesterday, did some jumping back and forth with 3 different characters to get the Unstoppable Monster. Did not end up on the same server once. Each time the top people I tracked and which workshops that were already claimed and by whom was completely different. 
---
Also, I think you have it wrong:   
---
It is not added so BR fans can play Fallout 76.   
---
It is added so Fallout 76 fans to play BR with each other.
---
Yea there are a lot of bugs, people say they spawn where you first put down the CAMP, but I‚Äôve seen people spawn in multiple different locations so I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs quite right. 
---
They should put in a fast travel mat, however I imagine they haven‚Äôt yet because people would grief with it (put it in a trap or off a cliff), cos Bethesda knows some people are assholes and will ruin other people‚Äôs fun
---
If that's the case, I stand corrected.
---
Well played, sir. Well played :)
---
Had anyone found a specific spawn spot for the hide so I can just stay in that spot and lobby hop till I get them all?
---
Thanks man. Tried to log in twice and started to get worried. Came straight here. 
---
Appreciate it!
---
i've already had a post asking for said mat and ppl downvoted as i think the griefing can become an issue (although was aware of it and also asked for ideas on a solution for it on my op)...however, i'd welcome it, as still better than this crap. right now i just want to see a fix on this frustrating issue.
---
fully agree
---
Fear Teddy is one of those special items found in the wasteland and 25000 caps is giving it away, I'd pay three time that.
---
You and me both, man.
---
Pic or it didn't happen. My personal experience tells me that's bull.
---
Have you taken a look at the sub since the rumors started? The vast majority of F76 fans aren't interested in a BR mode, at all. This is Bethesda trying to cash in on a trend, just like everyone else.
---
I love this game so much that to be honest I would strugle now to play any other single player fallout game. Weird isnt? üòõ
---
I can appreciate vendors who have a ‚Äújoke‚Äù in their machine, but I‚Äôve seen people pricing every one star weapon for 3000 and crappy 3 stars for 10000, it‚Äôs rediculous.
---
There are a few notes scattered around the world from a ghoul named William Keller about a small community of people leaving WV, they might return to set up a society after a few months (or years even.)
---
Salt 25k... load of maps and magazines for 1 cap each. 
---
Perfectly preserved pie from 100c to 25k
---
Essentially, yes.
---
How is it there is always a moron, that goes out of his way to crap on a game that they "don't care about". Like, why expend the effort? I disslike fortnite and anthem, but i do not go on subs that are for fans, just to shit all over the gane they do like. Just unsubscribe from this buddy... not that hard is it?
---
I've sold quite a few marsupial serums for 1000 caps before. Not sure why the 2-3 people even bought it, it's just been set like that since player vending came out. 
---
Shoot I typically buy serums from other people for 100-200 caps and then just resell to the vendors.
---
You have been insulted: 25,000 Caps... though that was probably meant as a joke
---
Sadly, I fully admit that site is not for me ;).
---
But honestly I don't care if they add a PVP mode as long as, 1: it's a seperate mode (I'd be shocked if it wasn't). 2. They also introduce plenty of stuff I'm interested in as well (if all of Nuclear Winter is just aimed at this new mode, yes I'd be pissed. If it eventually adds a lot of stuff also that I like, it's like survival, I'm not interested but I can't expect all updates to be for me).
---
yes. bethesda games ever had problems and although made me mad, with a modding community and more important, it being a solo player game one could live with it. but it's just unacceptable to bother with wimpy problems like this on a multiplayer game. there ppl have a bit more demands and want a lot more quality.
---
and yes, agree about the mats. however, it shouldn't be a problem for a developer that size and selling full price to find solutions on problems like that. but still, thx for your add buddy!
---
Seen the ‚Äúyou‚Äôve been insulted‚Äù note for 25000
---
Death usually lol. Griefers use them to take peoples junk.
---
If you exit build mode and go back in, still nothing?
---
There‚Äôs a charisma perk that helps that. 30% of fast travel costs.
---
Nah, August is when I go back to school, and then I get to see all of my friends again, I miss them
---
Yonnnng yeah here again lookz like buhthesduh has done it again
---
I'll respectfully disagree as I much prefer the questing of the single players as you had various ways to complete tasks as well as actual dialogue options. I appreciate the comment though as it's an uncommon opinion.
---
However multiplayer does make camp building and outfits feel a lot more significant though as others will also see it for themselves, and PvP offers a much higher challenge compared to anything offered in prior iterations of Fallout. Having new content drop every couple of weeks a massive blessing also, it was painful completing Nuka World and thinking I wouldn't have any new stuff for possibly a decade.
---
Send a ticket to Bethesda's Support. If you paid for it, they surely have a record of it and perhaps they can do something.
---
"You Have Been Insulted"-note for 25.000 caps, that really was an insult. But a fun one.
---
I was close to capping my caps, so I bought a travelling leather coat for roughly 20k caps, not sure it it was a rip of or a deal, but I needed to get rid of caps and had precious few things I can spend on these days. Realised I was happy with my existing outfit, so I put it on my low level alt, she now constantly gets offered shitty offers by high levels who think she is a newbie who got lucky and got as a reward and they now try to rip her of by offering peanuts for it. 
---
Bought a Vampires Explosive 90% reduced weight minigun for 600 caps, that was a good deal.
---
People selling regular ammo for anything more than 1 cap per pop is a bad deal. Ammo costing 5+ caps per pop is a horrible deal.
---
Honestly, EA is being EA. I could swear one of the reasons people hate them is they throw studios to the wind. Make them create stuff and if it fails just close the studio down. While this is just one game it fits the same MO... the game came out, it failed, they don't bother with putting any resources in it to try to save it.
---
Interesting that most people tended to like the new content that encouraged or benefited from multiplayer (fasnacht parade and player vending) yet people claim that want more single player content and quests.
---
Not sure what this means, just pointing it out.
---
Sadly I'm on the Xbox side of this river. Good luck my mentally unstable junkie fellas
---
Nice all the need now is a rejoin last server option and thy would be a huge QOL improvement
---
some hairstyles are male/female only .. which I learned the hard way .. down in the fine print once you view the hairstyle in the shop it'll say Male Only/Female Only
---
Yeah I can‚Äôt be bothered with all the negativity. I‚Äôve had so many hours of fun with this game, and I only spent 15 on the game and another 20 on atoms, which gives you around 2 hours of ‚Äúreal life‚Äù fun in a bar or so, so I‚Äôm not complaining ;)
---
I‚Äôve seen this as well. Got a pretty decent level 50 *** fire ax, for a few hundred caps from a higher level player. But the same guy had stuff like combat rifles for 1000+ caps.
---
I totally get it.  I think the suggestion to just have you spawn on the very border of of the camp, (as in where it would be red/green in build mode), would be the easiest solution.
---
Heck no, it has numerous set spawn-locations in the world and I could go and get a bunch anytime I want. Not rare, not hard to get. Has no value.
---
that's even better. we need to keep doing that, to have them finally fix it. keep it up man and have a great day!
---
Good catch man that's a very interesting correlation. I think it's probably due to Lying Lowe being the most significant single player oriented content released and imo it was pretty thin, took me a similar amount of time as the Burrows.
---
Anything between 50 and 150 feels fair to me. I‚Äôll only spend 150 if I really need it though.
---
No that's actually fact based on polls. It just lacks bethesda's confirmation. My guess at that exact percentage is of course an assumption/educated guess as stated.
---
Ah damn it... You're right
---
This is just ridiculous. I mean you can wear the female swim suit and dresses as a male character so why the hell can't you use a hairstyle on both genders? Thank you though...
---
I was having this problem but when I exited build mode then went back in it would allow me to make them.
---
I sell my very 1st (from this and fo4)  perfectly preserved pie for 10,000. Only as a joke and a way to show it off. Nobody would every buy it at that price so everyone who shops can see my triumph!
---
Hell... what they did to sim city is what inspired me to never buy their games (which I still hold to this day). That was a bad enough debacle they lost at least one customer for all their games for.
---
Sell the bulk
---
1k?  I sold mine for 2k until I found out I needed 5 to scrap.
---
There is Sooo much bulk though.
---
BR? Isn't that just a rumor?
---
I don't need to provide a pic, because I don't need to win the argument. Bethesda is doing it for me. They see enough PvP to add an extra PvP mode. What more do I need. 
---
People do PvP. Obviously.
---
Ha! Funny about the jacket.  If you did buy something in someone‚Äôs camp for 25,000, (which would undoubtedly exceed their cap limit), does that mean you can‚Äôt buy anything more, or you pay and they don‚Äôt receive the caps? Or is everything else just free? Lol
---
It's literally on the game's official roadmap, on the official fallout 76 homepage. I can't imagine how you'd be struggling to find that.
---
I chuckled when I saw that.
---
Es ist normal das das camp in einzelne Blaupausen aufgeteilt wir diese musst du einzeln aneinander plazieren was ziemlich kompliziert werden kann weil es sich beschwert das manche sachen in der luft schweben oder dergleichen und deswegen nicht plaziert werden kann.
---
Me too build mode has been weird for me lately
---
Yes, it's something Bethesda should adress but for now what make me sick, is people no fixing their camp in order to let the spawn point clear...
---
Well mine is on sale for 15 caps lol
---
I literally moved my structure 10m down the road so that people stopped spawning in my crafting room and they now spawn just outside my front door, and it was massive pain in the butt! I've noticed that recently, I've been spawning in slightly different locations in my own camp, and sometimes get caught in my own water purifiers.
---
Spawn mats like in Fallout 4 would be spectacular. Considering the loading time associated with fast travel, I'm sure Bethesda could prioritise their system to look for a mat's location within a range, and place the player on it, then load the structures etc. I'm not a programmer, and it's probably way harder than that, but I'm sure the big brains at Bethesda will find a solution.
---
Ugh... I was kinda hoping this was there will be a battle royale mode but it will be like survival, it's an added mode but not the entire focus of all of Nuclear Winter. Count me on the bandwagon as upset if this is the primary focus of Nuclear Winter.   
---
Oh well, NMS is coming out with VR and I'd like to get back into my VR games so maybe this will give me the break I need from FO76.
---
Okay, that's fine.
---
If they actually do a BR mode, let's see how it ~~dies~~ goes.
---
Oh boy... we got a slow one on here today.
---
Glad to see im not the only one experiencing issues, are there any sort of updates as to when this will be resolved?
---
I had the same problem last week and got stuck in the same spot. Apparently you need to pick up a holo tape at fort defiance for it to work.
---
Yup, also, my experience is from about 6+ patches back, so it could have changed no matter what.
---
I could see that, sort of consistently reiterates the scarcity/value.
---
Well, and I still haven't managed to complete that.   Went to do it a second time and the game crashed like 3/4 the way through.  
---
3rd time was going to be it,  I was at the end.  It was working.  I was playing it safe and protecting the one by hiding in the room and respawning him as needed.  
---
Then a team of like 4 super-high level people (200+) came running in near the end with a lower level person (50+) ... I was all 'Hey, helpers, this is awesome!' ...    We wiped up the remaining folks.   I was excited I'd finally have this finished.  
---
Then the 50+ person went and started filling out the nuke code thing instead of me.  "Whatever I thought.  I'm sure it counts for everyone"....  
---
Nope --- none of the 'launch a nuke' things actually count except for the one person who fills out the thing.     
---
\#ugh ... Gotta try again now
---
Because you said Bots and not Vending Machines I was given false hope, smh.
---
This game help you through your parents divorce or what?
---
To be fair, there is a scaling system in place. You can argue for or against its effectiveness, but it's not uncommon for high levels to get oneshotted while low levels are absolute tanks, with the downside of not dealing much damage.
---
Past level 50 the only upgrades aside from equipment you ever see are in the form of perks. A well optimized level 60 build can absolutely destroy level 400 players. If anything, you should be concerned about the items high level players (as in, having had ages to farm this equipment) might be using, as the right combination can basically make you practically immortal.
---
Offense* practice what you preach friend
---
Walk away from camp, go back and try again? Orrr server hop? It should do the trick. Camp budget not exceeded btw?
---
40 Stable Violet Flux, damn. I don't blame you for stealing it, everyone would've done the same. Atleast I would've taken the Flux...
---
Shit, a few times I took the workshop from some one (they weren't at the workshop) and so far none have bothered to come try to defend it from me (I only do this if it is one needed for the weekly and I'm just set on getting it right then rather than waiting for whatever reason and I fully intend to run away if they do come to defend it).
---
I haven't seen anything so far. It's Sony, so either they fix it very quickly, or take a whole month...
---
Lmao, I'm like your opposite
---
Everything in the Fallout universe is a stretch.
---
And 120 bulk gears
---
Yeah, I‚Äôm an odd case, but really I just miss seeing friends
---
Pretty much this.
---
There are a few I understand being priced higher, but yeah, those are pretty common and easy to make once you do the quest. The lowest I‚Äôve seen was 50/serum. The highest was 2k/serum.
---
Nobody wants your purified water at 40 caps per...
---
Absolutely nobody...
---
TODD HOWARD IS AN EVIL THUMB MAN WHO SWINDLED ALL OF US. BETHESDA=EA?
---
I don't mind if it is just one mode they are introducing (like they did with survival). But it sounds like this is going to be the major focus of nuclear winter and that I do mind. And when it seems most the playerbase doesn't like pvp (judging by the recent poll), it seems like a bad idea to focus the whole season on it and definitely going to get some uproar from people.
---
From my experience just now, it's the other way around, the daughter crawled over to the mother's body and hugged her as she bled out.
---
Any reason for not using mutations?
---
I am pretty sure this is an actual attack on our morale and economy by the Mole Miners, disguised as a nice old lady offering a service. I came in to her shop early one morning and she hastily removed a red star pin from her clothing, commie scum. It is a sham, a con! 
---
(Please, Mama Murmghr, just one decent heavy gun, I have given you thousands of scrip... just one.)
---
That and stealth boys was not working for me this morning. I‚Äôm not sure if it was the server I was on or it was something more global. I guess I‚Äôll find out after I get back from breakfast. :/
---
Haha awesome story ... üëç , sadly reflects my circumstances too
---
I plan to, just was in a hurry making the builds I forgot to add some in lol
---
it just works
---
I was not aware of an existing scaling system as I was one-shot by mini gun fire in every single instance of this encounter and felt cheap to an extend.
---
I‚Äôm not entirely knowledgable about the game yet, but the system past level 50 makes sense as to not give more advantages to those that started earlier or play more but, I was referring specially to interactions between low level players (49 and below) and high level ones.
---
And yet in all of these dystopian settings it‚Äôs like part and parcel of the accepted story, ‚Äú...first the honeybees died off...‚Äù.  No man...no...they got swole!
---
There's a raider corpse right outside Brody's room , at the other door in the room that is locked but you unlock with the key. I assumed that was Brody, and shot it in the face, then put some plasma mines down, chucked a grenade and closed the door.
---
Seems to be a PS+ issue, my problems continued when I tried other games too. But it goes away with restarts and patience.
---
I just run away as I spawn in
---
Knowing him he will just talk about how his nylon bag is better than a canvas bag and say it has 4x the detail.
---
ESO does it right. You can wipe out a town but you pay a huge price. If you can survive being killed by the town guards you'll be wanted and all NPCs will be hostile till the bounty is paid or you're dead. All while the NPCs you killed simply respawn back in after death within a few minutes. It just makes things not worth the trouble.
---
I saw one with 2000 5mm ammo - for 500/each...
---
Wouldn't buy nor recommend it.
---
My sentiments exactly. Held off until it was in a more stable state. Having an absolute blast and the community in game has been great.
---
I know what you mean about the gun placement, but this isn't that.  The enemy doesn't have to be clipping into the gun.  They could be somewhere between short and medium range and you'll still get this effect.
---
Can't blame you for this at all. If I bothered with the PVP aspect of the game at all and saw someone who looked AFK I wouldn't have given them 15 minutes.  I would've given maybe 5 and attacked them. I feel if you're going to go AFK in a game with PVP and you're doing it in an area that opens you up for PVP you shouldn't go AFK and if you do then that's all on you.
---
Yeah i guess they coukd use the boubty system already in place, maybe make raider towns that are hostile to people without bounties and friendly towns hostile to people with bounties
---
This happens to me all the time so if I FT to someone‚Äôs camp I have like .000097 seconds to fucking RUN in a different direction and pray I don‚Äôt get stuck. Rahhh!!!
---
Poor bastard. But hey, congratz!
---
Free stuff!
---
A level 15 pipe pistol for 20000 worst
---
Best was a marsupial serum recipe for 100
---
UPVOTE !
---
Im stumped man I just want to play
---
Wtf you on about idiot? Seriously, just unsubscribe.
---
I don't think you should expect much aside from a few small number changes in the scaling changing any time soon though. There have been weapons such as Explosive Shotguns that reward players with potato aim shooting in any given directions and oneshotting anything hit by a single pellet, pretty much regardless of level and the majority of legendary effects. When real issues like that are considered unessential to balance, I think giving lower level players an advantage in PvP, when they can opt out of it, is pretty low on the priority list, for better or worse.
---
I forgot to mention the heavy build will use the sentinal Assassins set
---
For English being your third language, it is well formatted and to the point. Also yes that pisses me off more than griefers.
---
Ah, then keep in mind that you will need atleast 2 points for Starched Genes so you won't lose your mutations and 3 more for Class Freak, besides the negatives aren't affecting you too much
---
said that before, when replied to others, but, that's what i do everytime! it's just that it doesn't work everytime and when it doesn't, frustrates even more. sometimes you can't see anything of the building, and many of them are very big, having 1000 water purifiers outside of the building, thjat sometimes when you run, you just run straight into a stuck point, rather than run away from it.
---
so even when it works, it would be still a crappy solution and nothing more than a workaround. but what is needed, is a serious fix, rather than halfa**ed workarounds.
---
thx dude, i understand your point. but the point here is to get a fix so ppl don't have to bother with a pi** poor coding bethesda just did.
---
Did you have pacifist on?
---
I got a legendary drop yesterday. Quad double barrel, +50% limb damage, +1 perception
---
Keeping it and working on getting the shotgun related perk cards.
---
I'm not claiming "no one" wants to pvp, I'm sure hundreds maybe even thousands do. But when those players make up only several percent of the overall playerbase? It's wasted effort. You don't make a RTS game then when 3% of the people playing the game say they want it to be a first person RPG go and change the game to appease a handful of people and piss of literally everyone else.
---
\*Sighs\* I suppose there is no point in arguing this, Bethesda has a track record of REALLY REALLY stupid decisions, the stuff of legend now. So they will keep doing stupid things till management gets fired and replaced some day. So I suppose this will sort itself out eventually.
---
When i fast travel to my camp, 9 times out of 10 i end up stuck in a cliff and have to fast travel back out.
---
No, but maybe I‚Äôm gona put it on now
---
Yeah, I swear it's psychological warfare for killing others of her kin. They are wickedly crafty and evil
---
It should be a name like:
---
Beret of Infinite Sorrow
---
Sentinel Beret of the King

Zealous Beret of Delusions
---
I guess that‚Äôs just part of the wasteland fun
---
Thank you. Had a friend tell me they couldn't log in to F76 and were getting some "error with a number code". I was just about to log in and check myself but looked here first.
---
That's how I feel. My wife and I have a group of 4 friends who spend several hours a day just messing around doing quests and looting. We have fun. That's all that matters. Yea occasionally one of us will says something like "it'd be cool if _______" but we all just keep playing.
---
The only problem is that they would have to make a certain spawn point for every camp and store it on the servers, ultimately slowing down the servers even further
---
There is a ps update (console). Force a check and it fixes it
---
yes, they hopefully do find a solution. as this is what is needed. and no workarounds. thx for your add dude!
---
They are definitely a waste of ammo, but getting all the ingredients for a mixed scorchbeast stew can be worth it (has some nice bonuses when consumed).
---
I would suggest to remove damage resistance perks.
---
With bloodied build if you are hit by a player you are dead anyways.  
---
Go all damage. Respec into Luck and crits
---
If you don‚Äôt like the game why are you on this sub?
---
Can it be a topiary? Preferably a topiary of Todd Howard.
---
I really dislike that dumpling
---
Exactly. The key is to make it as inconvenient as possible for daring players to even consider attacking those NPCs. How many times have you walking into the White Springs bunker and saw every robot killed? Good luck trying to retrieve your junk after triggering those things.
---
My friend, i am very thankful for this generous offer but it is the only Outfit i could find on the wiki that really interests me and call me old fashioned but i prefer to achieve it on my own.
---
I was more hoping for some advice on how to get it. Maybe the wiki is wrong and there is some spot i can farm for the outfit directly or a better spot to farm technical data?
---
The game was not ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù in the slightest on release. The bug list read like a script, server stability was trash, there was no endgame, quests remained broken for weeks after release, there were bugs that could literally delete your character, melee was overpowered, there were gigantic exploits led to duper‚Äôs selling OP weapons for cash some of which are STILL in the possession of high level players, most of the quests were ‚Äúexplore this place and listen to some guy who is rotting somewhere talk on a holotape‚Äù or fetch quests, and many weapons were unusable or downright broken. 76 was NOT worth the price tag in the slightest, and despite that, they STILL pushed the atom shop in everyone‚Äôs face without shame. If you want to go explore a dead world and spend 18$ on a power armor skin, go ahead, but don‚Äôt act like this game is worth 60 bucks
---
yes, that is what happens. as you see zero, as by the time the building needs to load you can take a nap, drink coffeee, dress your hair and have dinner, you run just into a stuck point, rather than away from it. especially when it's one of the huge buildings with 10000s of water purifiers around it\^\^
---
yes, run and pray pretty much nails it perfectly xD thx for that\^\^
---
If they do it exactly as Fortnite/Epic Games did, then they'll end up focusing entirely on BR and stop caring about the PvE mode.
---
Sorry, I'm a salty ex-STW player.
---
Oh, it's true that EA earned its reputation for being a vile company because they'd acquire great studios and smash them like an infant.  There's no way around that.  While I would say it amazes me that people even give them the time of day, I'm constantly reminded that the memory of people is fleeting these days.
---
As far as the games-as-a-service model goes, I don't agree that their success inspired others.  Every company needs a reliable cash cow, yes, so even Bethesda needs its Fallout Shelter.  But Bethesda also did a plethora of single player games in the last few years - the very games EA insists cannot make it in the modern market anymore.  EA wouldn't have made Doom.  They certainly wouldn't have made Prey.  Or The Evil Within.  Or Wolfenstein.
---
But there *was* an EA that did that.  Which made Dead Space, Titanfall 2, Mirror's Edge, etc.  That EA has since shriveled up, and now when I look at the company's roster, all I see is a regurgitated list of the same tired franchises year after year, especially Star Wars.  When you actually have a ton of original IP under your belt, it's a pathetic state of affairs if you have to rely on someone else's property to make money.
---
What system you on? PS4 I will buy a bunch of shit...start a mule and transfer it all And start selling from that character....endless caps whenever needed
---
The real mvp
---
Lol. Xbox my dude.
---
Just got that error like 5 times before it let me go in main menu.
---
This sub is as bad as r/GOT when it comes to kneeling.
---
thank you dude, that's kind :\_) although there's still a lot room for improvement :D but appreciate it and happy that people understand what i'm talking about. as i'm often not by myself\^\^ and yes, it is indeed very annoying and to me also more than griefers, as this seem to be happening a lot more often. truly hope for a fix. and again, thx dude ;)
---
I sell a ton at my camp in the forest.  Most recipes are 10-30. Most plans are 10-300.  They do very well particularly the rarer recipes like s‚Äômores.
---
I sold mine for 100 caps, pretty fast.
---
Still great find my dude! Make them caps
---
Which are mainly informed by the limitations of the engine they are working with.
---
Put it this way its the difference between a single player rpg and a multiplayer tactical shooter. But with fallout, they tried to bridge the gap, and it's fun but not exactly what can be called a technical powerhouse now is it.
---
She is one cold hearted biatch, that for sure. Hope your find your loot soon
---
Sooo inconvenient. Not as much as losing it all though I bet.
---
I‚Äôll do what I always do, wait and see.
---
my handmade has a drum mag with 85 bullets....so even there the handmade beats the assault
---
i see. wasn't aware of it :/ still hope they can manage fixing it somehow...however, thx for this insight dude
---
That‚Äôs too much for most plans. I sell most plans at 10-30 unless they are very rare.  I think Im listing my ripper plans at 200.
---
Could not agree more.  So excited for all that I haven‚Äôt seen/done yet and equally anticipating whatever they come up with next!
---
yes, happens way too often :/
---
Yeah, you were downvoted to oblivion because you come off like a "soggy biscuit." Go quit the game already because you didn't have the very best gear for a moment in time. Nobody will miss you.
---
would be one i'd be already very happy about.
---
This is a bit old! I have an anti armor with swing speed now so all I‚Äôm looking for is a bloody shovel these days but thank you~
---
The note in fort defiance is crucial. I did the same thing and got confused AF. 
---
Don‚Äôt worry tho it seems like it doesn‚Äôt matter when you pick up the note. But that will give you the password I believe
---
Booze recipes from BIV do really well if you keep the price reasonable.
---
Idk if this will be the case for everyone on PS4, but check for a system software update. I had one in queue, installed it, and was able to get in
---
Because ESO was released before the rules became enforcable and so got a 'waiver'. FO76 was after and does not.
---
some dataminers found some fragments of supposed text chat in the files long ago (can't find the thread atm) but currently these fragments don't connect to any services
---
You are correct. By my math, this game is worth about $400 bucks. (Power Armor pre-order, and $200 on Atoms since launch.)
---
Worth every penny. (I'm at something like 50 cents per hour of game play here.)
---
Iidiots!](https://youtu.be/yWNvBIcKD1E)
---
Thanks for the info!
---
Well if they do that PvE players will complain that you have to go into this PvP area to get these special rewards. Look to Division 2
---
I‚Äôm not insecure. I can get the best gear again. Issue is, increasing the lvl of items from 50 to say 60, is needless. It just makes for annoyances. It just makes everything under it worthless ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
I love playing this game, but i hate you people who are the type to be so overly optimistic. You‚Äôre diseased and delusional. You paid money and deserve the best. Have fun regrinding for stuff for the same game lol
---
Best: loads of bobbleheads for 10 caps per person had 3 to 7 of each and I bought them all lol
---
Worst: zeolots wood left arm for 10k wasnt even m√°x lvl lol
---
*Juicehead*
---
Yeah it's fun. I've struggled with multiple problems since launch but still, it's kept my interest for 360 levels...
---
Did that say he was level 244? If so, he should know better than to carry all that crap in a workshop in the first place, let alone go afk while doing it. This is entirely on him. Congrats on the loot pi√±ata jackpot.
---
Its definitly hos own fault but I still feel bad.
---
This is a scam. I lot of these weapons are easy to get for people at those levels for free.
---
10mm SMGs can be gotten in Morgantown.
---
Combat Shotgun and Combat Rifle just fall off the Scorched at Wavy Willards Water Park up north.
---
Charging Laser Sniper Rifles from super mutants outside the Forest more often than not.
---
That's just a few off the top of my head. I'm sure the others are just as easily and readily available as the examples listed.
---
I still like The Sims, but Fallout 76 actually scratches that same itch (building a house, having a "job" being a wasteland trader, doing kind things) with the addition of the natural randomness that other players bring.
---
Titanfall 2 also had one of the most clever and excellent single player campaigns, and it's unfortunate that no one at EA thought it could sell, because they put virtually no marketing behind it.
---
Cool, more free fertilizer. I also collect snarky notes, so please drop those too. Might raise my prices if it means I get free stuff, thanks for the heads up!
---
No, but seriously, this is a waste of time. If someone doesn‚Äôt have what you want for the price you want to pay, just move on. If someone doesn‚Äôt realize their prices are too high, they will realize when nobody buys their stuff. If they‚Äôre intentionally pricing things super high, they‚Äôre not going to care about what you think. 
---
If you‚Äôre just having a laugh, by all means. Crap all over their house. But actually getting upset is pointless and stupid.
---
Or you could just make your camp with that in mind. People spawn perfectly at mine.
---
Anyone calling you names needs to look in the mirror. You earned it fair and square.
---
imagine being this angry over a fucking gamemode
---
I tested the armor on the person I bought the Sentinel Assassin from and he took a lot less damage from my two shot handmade, he had nerd rage but said it didn‚Äôt have the other DR perks, while I could take them off my sniper build because I don‚Äôt plan on getting hit and killing them from afar which is why I‚Äôm not using bits/Crits, 
---
But, the DR is needed on the heavy build as it greatly reduces the damage I being able to just stand there getting tickles if you will lol
---
That is really good on that serum!
---
You seriously equate new content and better gear with... Diseased and delusional...
---
Yeah, you're totally not insecure, sure. Did you pay real money for your gear or something? That's what it sounds like. Go bother somebody else, crazyface.
---
Anger! Outrage! Pitchforks! RAAAWWRRRRR!
---
There is a scaling system in place, and it works pretty well until legendary gear comes into play. Making legendary effects not apply to PvP interactions would solve the problem.
---
I see the same people over and over in survival.
---
Lol this made me laugh so hard, especially when it‚Äôs sold right by unlocked water purifiers.
---
And make it so you have to place the welcome mat outside the build area within a small distance from it to prevent this issue
---
In my shop I sell everything at a steep discount, less than half price most of the time cuz I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm the dollar store in the mountains.
---
This made me laugh so hard...especially when the vending machine is flanked by unlocked water purifiers.
---
I've been on servers with 3 nukes launched and never lagged out. Might be a problem on your end.
---
This sounds like a bit of a scam for newbies, these weapons can be found very easily,
---
I had to reconfigure my camp because of this problem. I live on a junk extractor between 2 trees, so getting foundations right is a huge pain. It took hours to find something I liked that worked with the guest fast travel spot. 
---
It would have been way easier to add a fast travel mat or like you said with fast traveling next to said camp.
---
But that's what survival is! A scary place where anyone can hunt you at any time. You better always watch your back because you don't know who could be watching.
---
you might want to read my post again, as it seems you lack reading comprehension. especially the part where i mention my own camp could be indeed very interesting for you.
---
I hate this as well. When I appear at a camp I run from it so I don‚Äôt get stuck.  But I don‚Äôt always make it.  üò®
---
def would appreciate them adding text chat.. dont want to use mods...
---
That guy was a moron. Who carries that much valuable junk around with them?
---
It's a bit scummy but it's a valid part of the game. Hope the guy learns a life lesson from this.
---
Lol
---
Another reply in the thread said this. No player wants more PvP. So if no PvE player wants it. It would just split the Survival population.
---
...You're on a subreddit literally dedicated to the game
---
Some people bitch if their coffee is too hot or their ice cream is too cold. If you don‚Äôt like the game, don‚Äôt play it. Simple right!!
---
This post gave me a headache
---
Most expensive mini-gun rampage ever!
---
Don‚Äôt mind me, just gonna borrow this for PC...
---
Or it could have interchangeable barrels like the syringer.  "Starburst" barrel for world notification.  Other barrels for just the flare effect, but add different color options.
---
Dude...everyone is lookin‚Äô for that zealots wood left arm tho‚Äô!  Right arms are so easy to come by...
---
It‚Äôs mostly for lols. Chill.
---
I agree. This needs to be fixed right now. Give us a spawn location welcome mat like you did in the older fallouts.
---
The queen doesn't drop serums anymore and I don't think regular scorchbeasts and treasure maps drop them either.
---
Correct
---
The unmarked vault (no marker on the map), which I think is vault 56 (feel free to correct me on the number, but the vault is there and has been for some time, if not since release), in the top left of the map is related to what information we have from the datamining. The voice lines also associated with it mention being the last player or group standing, leveling up your overseer rank, playing area is reduced via fire, "x number of people are left", several other announcement voicelines during this battle royal mode, etc. The shtick behind vault 56 is basically survival of the fittest, and poking the fire between different factions/groups to instigate fighting amongst them (in our case battle royal) and see who comes out on top, and who comes out on top will "be fit to be overseer". Vault 56's purpose is entirely based around pvp (unless they throw in a pve way of obtaining rewards). I also don't think battle royal will be the only new pvp mode, but it wouldn't say so for sure. 
---
The 2 vaults that have been set for pve endgame raid content have already been stated to be **4 player raids**. So pvp has nothing to do with those vaults.
---
Flamer Fuel and Steel Scraps for 350+ a piece.
---
While I agree about prioritise certain elements of the game I don‚Äôt think low level players should not be taken into account if Beth wants the game to survive. My suggestion implied just adjusting damage or health between levels as to give at least some common ground. High level players will always have an advantage in the form of better equipment and perks but at least would not be able to one-shot lowbies.
---
Also, I was claiming the mining facility in Mount Blair and unfortunately there is a PVP element to it which I cannot avoid. In the current system, low level players are discouraged from this kind of events.
---
Maybe allowing us to choose different servers with level restrictions could help this situation?
---
Lol, no you people who don‚Äôt see the downsides of a lvl increase, and who downvote ANY criticism this game has. There are two groups this game has. There are absolutely mindless zombies who hate the game and it‚Äôs obvious they never played it much, and then there‚Äôs the lowest of the low, the people who downvote logical criticism and are overly optimistic. I saw someone comment that ppl should be thankful that they even get to get more free content, which is absurd.
---
We paid money, this is what we should have gotten.
---
The fact you didn‚Äôt see the downsides of a level cap increase shows you‚Äôre not in an experienced enough position to speak on the topic. Want a lvl increase? Fine. But getting hostile? You‚Äôre a bum lol
---
Frustratingly, server hop is the only solution that works. Lots of room in the budget.
---
Right, and like I said, if it‚Äôs just for laughs then it‚Äôs all good. 
---
But you‚Äôre not the only person who thought of this idea. And some of those people are legitimately mad. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm talking about. Chill.
---
Whaaaaaaaaat
---
While I have the same frustration, I found it helpful to just walk outside the CAMP spawn. They don't load that quick. Don't just stand where you are.
---
Exiting doesn‚Äôt work. I‚Äôve even tried going in a mission and coming back. Nothing. Only solution that works is server hopping which is less than ideal to say the least.
---
If you like the game, why don‚Äôt you go play it?
---
it's not working everytime. and personally, i prefer serious fixes, rather than workarounds. when i hit my knee, i go to a doctor. i'm not jumping around on one foot, to avoid the pain.
---
People were spawning inside my house and not where the vending was. They weren't getting stuck but it was hard for them to find where the vending machines were. So I tore everything down and rebuilt around the spawn point.
---
It seems to me that you spawn very near where the camp is first placed. You can move it later but they'll still spawn where it was originally. I think as long as you build around the center of your camp, you should be fine.
---
Atm, people are guessing late June for a big update, or early next month.
---
Why does it bother you so much, Todd?
---
You guys have me in tears!
---
yes. could be one solution. just hope bethesda does whatever, to have this crap not happening anymore.
---
Pro tip: Aim up.
---
As mentioned before I was not aware of an existing scaling system as I was one-shot by mini-gun fire. Thanks for the input, I guess I will just suck it up and continue levelling until I can get a better build.
---
If you took a single look at my post history you'd know I'm far from overly optimistic. But maybe don't bother creeping since I don't care for another inbox. I'm not going to be addressing any of your points because that would just indulge you in thinking you have any kind of interesting opinion on this. Nobody cares. It's so far from being hostile, complete apathy. I do not care about your opinion on something we've all known was coming from the first time we saw a possible 5 stars on gear. Goodbye now.
---
VATs in PA is crazy expensive. Always has been.
---
Out of copper? Sorry have disqualify everything.
---
Exactly.  I'm not sure how they progress the story without spoiling early game story for new players. Maybe they have new servers where people who completed the main quest can choose to log in at? I don't know.
---
im always shy on technical data and dont want to farm it either buddy sorry i cant give good advise here
---
Indeed. Made with finest scorched guano instead of normal fertilizer obviously lol
---
The data does say what OP thinks it does. The desirability survey. Less than 1% to 1% wanted more PvP. As a PvPer myself, I can tell you Survival is dead. I would support the BR Mode, but it would only split the PvP playerbase more.
---
If he's wanted, your turrets will attack him and then that lets him PvP you.
---
What the?!?! Like, do you think it is mostly as a joke?
---
I have found 2 in the last few days one in a locked metal box at west tek the other was in a locker at whitesprings golf club
---
That fire axe is dead weight at 45 tbh. You might as well break it down or sell it
---
Literally most of, if not all, of your comments are complaining about this game. If you don't like it move on, let the people who enjoy it, enjoy it. You're really sad just shit posting hating a game.
---
I don't think vault 51 was there until the big wild Appalachia download last winter. I'm thinking the whole nuclear winter will be a variety of events and additions similar to Wild Appalachia was.
---
Sorry for not specifying 
---
- I was suggesting to remove DR from the Sniper build )
---
That‚Äôs why I suggested something harmless, like dropping a bag of shit. It‚Äôd just be a sign to shoppers in the know, that this shop has nothing of value or is overpriced. And it‚Äôs win-win. If you aren‚Äôt making money, and you see a bag of shit.... then drop your prices. Profit!
---
YEET
---
Im not talking about the stars. By weapon level i mean the actual lvl of weapons. It‚Äôs been lv50 all along, i think its dumb for them to raise that level. Stars aren‚Äôt levels man. Reread everything I said, you‚Äôre heated over my opinion, which u completely misread.
---
Oh, yeah. I was thinking the same thing when I was building it lol
---
8.5 hours from this comment.
---
I was server hopping at Camp Adams for the 2 footlockers. But thats great to hear about lockers.
---
im running a sort of glass cannon build   
---
cha perks swap out for teamplay sqad maneuvers2 and suppressor2  
---
i also run a mix of unyeilding an bolstering gear  
---
i like moving target i might swap it for dodgy after seeing your build

---
Damn that‚Äôs a sneaky one right there, thanks for clearing that up for me, appreciate it.
---
It was complete at launch basically bug free after 3 patches with new dlc appearing right after that adding more content for early, middle and end game. New creautures and mechanics.
---
Exploits addressed rapidly with item removal and bans applied as necessary.
---
Pretty much like any other mmorpg.
---
But $60 for n years worth of content is a pretty good deal regardless of the first 6-8 weeks. They stood by it and have consistently made it better.
---
This really deserved more upvotes! XD
---
I‚Äôve gotten them from junk piles
---
That's the best way of looking at things. People often have trouble properly monitizing thier fun. Even at full release price of 80$(can) that's only like one night at a bar, or 4 movies at a theater, maybe about 3-5 days of weed at best. Considering I've thrown 800+hours at this game, money well spent.
---
Modders literally fix this game for Bethesda /s
---
Haha nowai
---
Yes it was The Nailer. Immediately went into my shop for 100 caps.
---
"Poor man"?! Why the hell was he carrying all that stuff? And then leave the pc/console...? Nope. Can't feel sorry there.
---
Radios man, solves nearly every problem.  Use the hams to talk to NPCs, overhear them asking for help on the radio when you pass by them.
---
Radios and robots.
---
you actually do spawn where you first had your thingy, idk how called in english, this little thing you put down, spawn where you put it when you start build. yes, to destroy and rebuild is possible. but an incredible crappy solution to me, and yet another workaround. not to mention many don't know or just don't want to rebuild a house they did put a LOT of time into to get it where they want it to be. destroying to fix, when it's bethesda's pi** poor coding and lack of even the slightest testing (as it needs just a few minutes to realize, just smh), being the problem on it.
---
no. it's bethesda that has to fix this poor excuse of a broken spawning and where other devs would have fixed issues like that the same week, it's already insulting one has to beg bethesda, that seems to be more busy by put all work into the atom-shop, rather than doing some serious needed fixes in the game, without having to wait months for them.
---
don't want to sound like that dude. but to me just hard to understand why stuff like that is even happening to begin with (a test would have brought it to light by just a few tries), and even more, why needs sooo long to be fixed.
---
Are you trying to place a roof on top of the half walls? It wouldn't let me do that the other day, I had to put a half wall at the bottom then a full wall before it would let me put the roof on, so frustrating.
---
Ummm Well..... NopeüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ glad you enjoy them thoüòâ
---
as i said often before, doesn't work always. and is just a poor workaround, rather than a solution. and not the fix needed.
---
I understand fine. Level 55 gear and you'll riot. Nobody cares.
---
I was just wondering since you said Crit 3/4 times = dead core
---
Power user will work though
---
It‚Äôs win-win in the sense that you‚Äôre giving them free fertilizer. But like I said, they‚Äôll realize their prices suck when they don‚Äôt sell. Poop in a bag isn‚Äôt going to change that. Most people won‚Äôt even put 2 and 2 together and realize that it‚Äôs supposed to be an insult, let alone that it has anything to do with prices.
---
I mean, you should totally still do it. But do it cuz it makes you laugh, not because you actually want to send a message.
---
Drop some at random camps on your slow trudge to a vendor
---
Lol awesomeness! See ya in a bit!
---
I agree with you
---
Lol im not gonna riot. But say goodbye to many people. I don‚Äôt care if u don‚Äôt care or not. I just commented, just like how everyone else commented. As I said before. You‚Äôre a bum :)
---
Why are you here then if bethesda only delivers lies and the game is horrible? I forsure wouldnt waste my time being this butthurt on the sub of a game I ‚Äúhate‚Äù
---
Found one today in a small green container under the counter at Philipi Cementary. 
---
At least i got one up to now.
---
RTO's are known to be walking targets, because the enemy isn't stupid. Pretty sure the beeping and flashing red light are a reference to how that radio draws all sorts of unwanted attention. 
---
In that vein, I'd love to see a backpack variant that gave you some kind of perk, but drew the attention of any unfriendly in the vicinity.
---
Goodbye then!
---
I have something negative to say. The BR mode will split the already small PvP playerbase. I'm not trying to see even more of the same players over and over in survival. Survival is dead and no one wants more PvP, we know this from the desirability survey. We also know this from the amount of people that play survival (don't actually know specific statistic just speaking from a mainly pvper experience).
---
I LOVE BRAND!
---
&gt;  basically bug free after 3 patches 
---
***HA***
---
Yes - tell 'er Lord!
---
Juicehead incoming
---
Somehow I lucked in to this legendary bromance with another player. I can't get enough of them. It makes this game so much better...it's all about who you play with or how good your immersion game is if you play solo...
---
I wonder how hard it would be to make one like that. Easiest way to launch them would be to still use compressed air (with a backpack to hold the air). But it'd be even cooler if it was a legit catapult style launch system like in the game..maybe a crossbow style winch system to crank back the "sling" which launches the canvas bags (packed tightly into tubes)?
---
I mean, I know it's not a great solution. I'm just saying that's what I did. It sucked because I loved my house but it turned out better in the long run.  
---
It wouldnt have been so bad if I could have just picked up my entire house and moved it a couple feet like we could in fo4.
---
Man you gotta admit, it was touch and go for a while there. There was this audible pause from Beth after release. We didn't know for sure if they were going to pull the plug or plow forward. It was a buggy glitchy unoptimized unstable mess, still is, but thank goodness they decided to keep plowing forward
---
Yes, it was an Atomic shop item at some point. Don't think its available anymore.
---
I think it's unreasonable to say \*no\* player wants more PVP. And I don't think it'd split survival, I think it would mostly kill it. People who want PvP will have a full-on PvP experience to flock to instead of the watered down experience they have now, and PvE will stay right where it has been this whole time.
---
I don't believe survival servers are sustainable. People are apparently getting bored and coming to adventure to stir up shit.
---
&gt; Too much work
---
Not much work at all. They just have to copy whatever they use to make travel to Vault 76 and your camp free. Heck, it might be as easy as ticking a box in their developer tools.
---
My suspicion is that there are easily foreseeable side effects of making fast travel to the middle of the map free. For instance, the optimal thing to do when traveling from one side of the map to the other would be to first fast travel to Whitesprings - and then potentially fast travel away from it immediately to get to your final destination. That throws off the balancing of cap travel costs. People fast traveling a lot more perhaps also detracts from server stability.
---
Good rhymes, but you ruined it with the "Might be fun. Might not."
---
Sentinel/Assassin/Powered BOS LA and RA. 250 caps each. I about * myself

I played Fallout 3, Fallout 4, and New Vegas and enjoyed parts or all of them.  Fallout 4 was my favorite. I played Fallout 76 when it first came out for about a month and then for whatever reason abandoned it. I recently came back to it a month ago and I'm obsessed.  It's an amazing game that doesn't deserve the online hate it gets.  I hope it goes strong for 10 years!
---
My theory is that it‚Äôll introduce human NPCs back into Appalachia and that‚Äôll include raiders, other vault dwellers, maybe BoS (??) and other factions. 
---
We also might see significant change in some of the regions, maybe signs of ‚Äúcleaner‚Äù towns and them being populated by said wastelanders.
---
Really it should be a copy of Skyrim: SE and a check addressed to todd howard for $40 with the name of the payer left blank for you.
---
What KILLS me is the people saying the game is basically bug free and stable now. No, no it's not anywhere near that. KUDOS to you if you don't have problems but HOLY SHIT we spend approx. 10 minutes TRYING to play or team up for every hour we actually do play
---
Ahh, okay. Deliberate scavenge runs. Yeah, I dig it. I have a few places I go to for specifics, but I generally just steal everything I can get a hold on and toss it in the blender :)
---
That's kinda what I don't want. I don't want BR to kill survival. I don't want BR, but find survival fun. No matter how many times I get one-shot. Might be the resilience dark souls taught me.
---
I was thinking about human NPCs last night and how cool it would be if they added a new quest line and you spent all this time getting to the bottom of some mystery or some cave to finally approach a living human NPC.  Even better, the Overseer!
---
I am very curious to see what starfield is like, would love to see a gameplay trailer. Right now I just can't help but imagine that classic bethesda woodenness transposed into a sci-fi setting
---
Since my build didn‚Äôt use vats I figured dodge would come in handy Incase i do get shot, and then maybe getting actionboy to revenants 45% faster, but may not be too effective.
---
You still have to ‚Äúfind‚Äù the perk card. It doesn‚Äôt just appear
---
My machines are almost emptied daily sometimes twice in one play session I price it low and it sells fast, my standpoint is that if I'm selling it I dont need it so anything's better than nothing. I would rather be emptying that stuff out of my stash and gaining space to sell more stuff fast than holding it in my machines at a higher price hoping for that one player who's going to spend serious caps. I also leave all the common plans and less popular ammo in a bag at the side for players to help themselves, on occasion I have come back to the same bag being filled with useful items such as stims, fusion cores and other ammo.
---
yes, and believe me, didn't meant to be offensive. it's just that yes, one can do that and as said, sometimes works. but is even more frustrating when it doesn't. something like this needs a fix. a serious fix. and it shouldn't be always the players have to become creative and do workarounds in a game sold at full price. it should be fixed. same as every other devs do out there. and not like bethesda, ignoring these issues and leave their players alone with it. let them find their own fixes. with selling a product comes a bit responsibility. which includes to sell a functioning game, w/o a 1000 wtf moments daily.
---
Awe damn, just such a frustrating system. Well hopefully one day. Thanks for the answer.
---
I think it's mostly the second one. Although honestly the canvas version they used in the promotional material actually did look pretty good and like it could be a genuinely useful bag for some people.
---
People have found them in random drop containers. But they are rare
---
Well if English is ur 3rd language u doin awesome bro. It's my first and I'm usually harder to understand :P. And even though my o.g. post got loads of hate and was widely dismissed as "Untrue" or "Blatant lies" by people for reasons beyond my understanding.
---
  I'll say this: In atleast 99% of locations, visiting players will spawn as close to center of camp as possible at ground level when fast travelling. Players should be taking this into consideration when building a new camp. I've tested this and 100% of people who fast travel to my camp will not be lodged in floors when taking this into consideration. Center of buildable area can be determined by where you FIRST place your C.A.M.P. module.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt think to do this before and just tried to pick up things as I needed them but I just ran out of basics constantly. Drove me mad!
---
Your comment is getting downvoted because it's incredibly condescending. Don't wonder why, you've been told. Embrace the downvotes.
---
Honestly, I think there will be limited negative press. Sure I am optimistic but assuming they show off the details to wastelanders, I don't think people will complain about the BR.
---
There are plenty of builds that can solo the SQB, not that you ever have to. You don't need a Legacy weapon to do damage.
---
I wish I had the patience for biv quests and making those drinks.
---
R6 siege lol

ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è with casual gameplay, I had it in a week. Don‚Äôt know what all the fuss is about.
---
Blessings be to RNGESUS
---
It has upticks for sure. And it isn't the actual firing ... the turning on if vats takes a noticable slice right there.
---
Where can I find a mini gun?
---
Wait there is VATS in this game? I am 30 hours in and had no idea VATS existed.
---
I can imagine him shouting at deathclaws you shall not pass, or escorting newbies from the vault to fissure prime

You don‚Äôt deserve my goodbye, you mutant

I'm still using my furious explosive, just wish it were a wee bit better.
---
you on xbox?
---
Sometimes it's a simple as luck. I however was farming deathclaws thinking it would drop from them. Lol
---
her\*
---
Hahaha I imagined her saying "It's "LeviOsa", not "LeviosAAA".
---
The sub was filled with angry posts about how we \*needed\* a real PvP mode and how slap damage was bullshit. I think a BR mode, as much as it disinterests me, might actually give PvP players what they want, which is actual PvP instead of watered down "okay, this mode has no slap damage."
---
Kinda curious, what survey? Only one I am aware of is the unofficial one on this sub.
---
Also, look at Mr. Sandman (Agility) and Better Criticals (Luck) which will get you up to 3.5x sneak attack at night (if you use a silencer on your lever action). Better Criticals will get your crits another 30% increase, I believe. 
---
So with all that, at night, you‚Äôll get your sneak attacks past 600 and up to 800+ for crits. 
---
However, if you‚Äôre doing all that, I‚Äôd recommend looking for a TSE or AAE lever action rifle.
---
Oh gosh! Stop being so hostile! Wahhh. :)
---
Fast travel mats? Where are they at?
---
True, but then it wouldn't be hard to redo it either.
---
I jumped on a bunk bed and he ran off lol.  Such a punk move but i cant stomach death by mole rat.  Even if its immortal
---
sadly, No.. I'm on PS4
---
they replied to me. Basically, go to a place and strip it clean. Apparently that was not normal gameplay for them before.
---
Double building budget at camps effective on the next update!
---
u/wheeldog, most of your posts consist of joking about how bad Fallout 76 is. Actually, no, not even joking. Just spreading literal anti-76 propaganda. Heck, probably not propaganda, you seem very fucking dedicated to hate on 76. A flair doesn't mean you're a big boy, neither. You also *most likely* downvoted u/wsollers because he called the game bug-free after 3 patches. Very mature comments from you. You're either a very dedicated troll or very dedicated anti-76 boy.
---
How many people hating on 76 for no reason are congregating here today, because of the E3?
---
If you sell ammo ant one cap you lose money from the "tax". Two is the minimum you should sell but few of them are worth that.

Lol, it's written like a personals ad on Craigslist. What time zone you in? I'm a 35 yr old guy.
---
Are you high or just delusional? My friend was consistently crashing for a month after launch, and within a couple weeks we all quit because the game was so goddamn boring, except I came back to see if the game actually got better and sure, it did, but not nearly enough. The new content they added lasts about 3 hours with bugs of their own, and there were stil exploits months after launch. Were you even paying attention or were you too busy sucking Bethesda‚Äôs dick? Some people payed 200 fucking dollars for this game to get their address leaked and a nylon bag. Lasers weapons were only fixed like a month ago, plasma weapons even later. Just stop blindly defending the game and go pay 5$ for a single weapon paint job or something.
---
Ammo over 1 cap. Why do people sell cryo cells at 5 or 10? So easy to make. Same guys often have fuel at 1, which I snag always.
---
Agree on plans.
---
When you arrive, just start running. You'll make it out of their building in time
---
You on PC?
---
I posted a while ago about something like this. My problem was that when I was FT'ing back to my camp, I always spawned in the lake next to it, so waterborne diseases quite often. Someone mentioned moving the actual C.A.M.P. device (like the thing you place at first). And it actually helped, I placed mine down a bit further away on the border of my zone, instead of keeping it like a weird decoration inside the house. And from that point, no more spawning in the lake. I see alot of players doing this, incorporating the C.A.M.P. device inside or underneath the house.
---
I have a few items I don't want to sell or have destroyed while building set at 10000 caps. Like my collection of teddy bears. No one will pay that and I don't accidentally destroy them if I run out of cloth or leather!
---
The "hit box" on the dna analyzer is not nessarly where you think it is. Just scan arround it it till you find it.

Dude that's 5 scrip

I'm a huge fan of the game. You don't know me. I play every day. You are not reading ALL my 76 posts. I have done everything in my power to bring people to this game. I mess up sometimes and have made a few enemies in this game. I apologized publicly for such. But I play every day. I will always hold Bethesda's feet to the fire for the buggy nasty mess they released after taking my 60 bucks. 
---
and nothing I say is PROPOGANDA. I have documented every bug and glitch I talk about. I have video, and pictures. Wanna see ? It will take you a while to get through it all.
---
Then we'll have a sub full of folks who will conveniently forget the amount of hate and outrage they carried over this moment whenever it's mentioned as a counter to their latest hate and outrage moment.
---
I have a ton of booze on me.  99% of the time I don‚Äôt need to make it as the whole ‚Äúfresh‚Äù thing just means not vintage.  If you need to drink fresh beer and you have one you found at beta it still counts. The quests are easy money/xp.
---
oh, well then i suggest server hopping til you find a nuked server or find help and nuke it yourself. go to where the ppl are in the map and do the let's nuke emote or msg some high lv players.
---
good luck!
---
If they can give you an alert that your camp can‚Äôt be placed I don‚Äôt understand why they can‚Äôt do it for a radiation zone.

Yeah, censor a big part of the community, sounds amazing

Imagine of he came out and said. " were finally gunna unban the whole half of our fanbase we banned for merely playijg the broken game we set on fire and force fed you all then took away
---
I didn‚Äôt want to stomach it...yet I did lol
---
Holy shit if that didnt say paper bag i would have thought you were just accidentally looting your own stash, thats SO MUCH loot.   I sincerely hope you manage to get to a stash to store it all, you struck gold friend
---
i know all of that, but again, not everyone does...there's a million of players out there and the majority doesn't even visit forums to get an idea of how to set spawn points, so i can't see how it can be fixed. also, those that know now how to build to avoid it, might not want to destroy and rebuild a camp they like as it is, spend hours, days, to have it the way it is...
---
this is just not the solution...the only solution there has to be is bethesda simply fixing it! fixing a bug and an issue that is simply unacceptable to have in game. or ask players to do steps mentioned above to avoid. for bethesda it was often the community, especially modders, fixing their wimpy broken a** excuse of a game, fixing missions that were uncompletable by implementing mods, but this also is just not their or our job.
---
i've paid full price for this game, so i demand a bit of quality. demand of stuff in game being functional. and if not, i want to see the company find solutions and not wait for me, the paying customer to find them. as this is a multiplayer game that doesn't even allow mods on ps4 (f.e.), it's only on them to do something. and i want them to do it. or, at some point i call this game a crappy broken product and it was the last time i pay for a wimpy excuse like that. as there's a lot of games out there that respect my time, where i don't have to fight 30 minutes to kill a boss just to see the body disappear before i loot. or the game server dc's and i lose said loot. nor where i have to bother with ghouls attacking you in sleep pose lol...
---
we, as not only players, but also paying customers, as this is business, and good business goes both ways, should demand on bugs getting fixed, rather than ignored...the more when i see atom-shop being sunshine and unicorns, while this little thing around it, the game, is flooded by bugs.
---
just mho and no offense. but i just want to see something happening on all these issues, instead wasting my time to find workarounds that might help. but spend the time on having fun.
---
however, thx dude, and take care
---
How does this not also work the other way?  Not everyone can hear/speak, and text chat is their way to communicate.
---
Wahhh I‚Äôm a crybaby. Can you gimme some breastmilk?
---
Yes brothers and sisters, she is clearly great at spreading misfortune and dispair, but can thwarted. Put your faith in RNGesus (or Looticifer) b4 you give way to the Purveyors temptations. See what the true gods decree your world to be worthy of, and if they say it is good, then this foul witch's wares shall be forced to reflect such glory, atleast within some degree.

First time I returned to the game to check out Player Vending and I traveled to what seemed like a decently stocked shop and fast traveled into their large water purifier, was stuck and ended up blowing caps traveling around the map trying to reach this guys camp, ended up getting killed a few times (he was in a high level area) then gave up and logged off :-( haven't gone back since but I think  ill try again today maybe lol
---
I have noticed where I spawn and where visitors spawn are two differnt locations (I am NE of CAMP machine, the seem to be closer and more NW)
---
Definitely would like this. Half the time I emote to someone at an event and miss out on what I was given. Then I'm walking around with a 10 pound chest piece I don't want.
---
May be time to revisit my prices then. I‚Äôm not looking to or going to get rich with what I‚Äôm selling. Just want some walk around money. Thanks for your input!
---
Thanks for stopping by!
---
In the Mire south west of Harpers ferry there is a spot with a bridge over water.  follow the river upstream just a bit and there is a shack  that looks like a small airplane hanger. 5-8 ticks always spawn here. Bloody mess/super duper will get you all the stimpacks you could ever want. 
---
I set up my camp here and sell the Stims cheap to stay in a constant supply of caps.
---
yeah i dont get why i can fast travel to my own camp and never get stuck inside a foundation or wall but when i fast travel to someone else's camp i'm almost guaranteed to spawn somewhere i'll get stuck.  seems like it would be simple to at least spawn everyone at the " camp owner" spot.
---
I also moved my CAMP machine and spawn at a different place than visitors.  I wonder if they spawn at the original place, and we spawn relative to the moved CAMP?
---
Lies...Juicehead is only one who did not turn on BGS...the only one...

I've done three to Star ranged rolls every day since she came online (and probably a dozen the first day.) As a rifle user the only thing I've gotten worth keeping for my character has quad explosive lever action (which I do love.) However, I also got two high end energy weapons that I sold for about 25k caps total so at least I've got plenty of caps to buy stuff also.
---
I hear ya, and for sure they should fix it. I'm just offering a "in the mean time" type of solution. They really should reinstate the welcome mats from Fo4 tho.
---
I have been stuck in concrete before, so not sure that is a fix.  My fix is to have an elevated camp.  Made it look like a bug with staircase legs.
---
had you previously turned off the ‚Äústop invasion of (any workshop)‚Äù quest in your pip boy? i‚Äôve found that if you do that for any quest pertaining to any workshop, it gets turned off for all workshops. 
---
so like if you get a quest to take (workshop), and you turn it off, no more ‚Äútake (workshop)‚Äù quests will activate, regardless of the workshop. 
---
they‚Äôll still be in your pip boy, just inactive
---
i hope that makes sense ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
it's full already tho?
---
No legendary weapons and armor would completely change the playing field.  Bethesda did right by nerfing spam stimpaks, so just using vanilla weapons would give more of the casual players a real shot at PVP.  That and no teams.  If someone provokes a fight with me, I don‚Äôt want some joker in hiding one shoting me when things go south for his buddy.
---
green footlockers

That may be the case thank you

no problem!!
---
I had that issue with my heavy weapons build. I found that I have to let off the button and let the damage soak in before I "kill" it or it'll just regen.
---
I‚Äôm sure hoping we get an E3 megathread a few hours before the show, not the next morning.  Preventive action!

this is good....could also be used in survival mode to lure players.

Love that quote so much I've considered getting it tattooed on me.

I found one last night in a metal box on the roof of a building near the protest March in Grafton.
---
lol^^ now imagine what a simple spawn fix could do. yes, it's just crap where you sometimes end up by only being out to check someones vending machine.
---
soot flowers and bloodleaf. 
---
around the alpine river cabins there's a lot too
---
Don't drop it, place it. Pay attention to the button prompts when looking at it in your inventory.
---
For the mean time. As soon as you can control your player jump and move away
---
 Until the camp loads and go back in again. It worked for me at least.
---
How freaking cool could that be, that‚Äôs all I want!  
---
Make a camp and then make an object that calls in the local bad-guy, you and others run around your camp protecting it
---
That power armour chassis was the ultracite armour.
---
Unfortunatly if you get power armour as a quest reward it just shows as a chassis until you place it down
---
Got the Nuka Dark recipe again yesterday. I don‚Äôt remember mountain honey.
---
I don't think they're rare, just one of many options you can get based purely on RNG. It took me forever to get the last two recipes I needed from Biv. Mine were both moonshines, cranberry and mountain honey.
---
yes, moving can help. but the thousands of players that used the environment around or had to do so, to build their camp so it fit the surrounding will have problems by "simply moving" it. you're right, it can help. but unfortunately is a terrible solution for a lot of players that spend days to get their camp to where it is now and look like it does now.
---
I run them every day, my experience has been similar with those two recipes, I hardly ever get them.
---
I remember when the game was announced everyone thought that there was going to be a big problem w grieving. I made a post about how it‚Äôs not going to be like that at all because fallouts fan base I very mature. Glad to see I was right! Enjoy brother!
---
Would buy it 11/10.
---
You have such a great idea with the Brewery! Thanks for letting us know!
---
Some are probably female as well, enjoy if that's your thing üòâ
---
PSA: The location of the deployable CAMP structure influences the spawn point. I'm talking about the green thingy that expands when you move your camp.   
---
Once placed down, you can freely move it within the buildable boundaries in your camp. A helpful tip is to move it where you want players to spawn when fast traveling to your camp. For example, in my camp there's a certain flow I'd like players to follow with a main entrance. I moved the CAMP structure to the very edge of the boundary where the main entrance is. Ever since, everyone fast traveling to my CAMP spawns in the same place in front of the main entrance.
---
i refer you to read some replies. there's many of them showing how this doesn't always help nor work. i know it. but as said, doesn't work always and is also nothing, but a poor workaround, rather than fixing a serious issue.
---
Today I got lvl 50 pipe bolt-action pistol on lvl 2 using this method by having 50+ lvl char in the train station. So lvl 1 weapons work the same as well.
---
I have one. No clue how I got it either lol.
---
I sent you a friends request. If you see me on playing hit me up. I am looking for some friends to play with 76 as well!
---
Came to say the same, I've watched tons of Rust on Youtube but have zero interest in joining in
---
yes. and there's also forums, especially for them.
---
Not a deal breaker, but this would be nice to have.
---
Not those gosh darn youtubers! They are the ones that are behind all the bad things in the game. /s
---
waiting lol
---
I play everyday. I have community in it. I'm invested. Having said that, we have an awful lot of work-arounds we have to employ to stay in the game and stay on a team or finish quests etc sometimes. But still, it's fun.
---
I don't think anyone wants to see r/fo76 turn into a subreddit like r/fallout. If people want to complain about the game and the future of it, go to r/fallout
---
You're a C-NET fan aren't you?
---
I can't wait to see what Bethesda have in store for 76.
---
if you ever join us nobility (PC) lemme know, I can show you some 'things' \*wink\* \*wink\*
---
Xbox dammm. :/
---
Sorry. Lol. I didnt know craigslist had personal ads. Sounds scary. Lol. I'm in central time zone. How about you?
---
yes, true. and can help all those that havent already spent days on building their camp to have it the way they wanted it to be. however, true, before building. but i hope for a fix for all those of us, that already did build after.
---
I too have been rolling every day and only got one item I use.  I have found two items my friend wanted.  And several items I have sold for decent caps.
---
Radium...insanely hard
---
I'm about level 180, when should I expect to start feeling bored?
---
If you still have it, place it, don‚Äôt drop it. Never ever drop your power armor. That‚Äôs a really good way to lose it. 
---
You can also read an entry on Taggerdy‚Äôs terminal that gives you the plans for the Ultracite Armor.
---
I once spawned inside someone's locked house. Thankfully he was home because he had to open the door to let me out. He was nice about it at least.
---
Welcome mats to determine spawn location would be ideal. Even my camp that's on the side of a cliff sometimes I spawn over the cliff when the game starts...
---
HaHAAA! You'll never find it!
---
I have PC as well but been playing Sony since day one so I feel more connected with playstation on a mental level. Lol we complete each other.
---
yes, sometimes works and already doing it. but it's just not working everytime and only a workaround. this issue still needs a more serious fix. however, thx dude.
---
Yeah it's inconveniently convenient
---
This entire thread should not have to happen.
---
Gamma gun as well.
---
I have xbox as well just dont have fallout 76 for it.
---
Yup that shits the worst
---
Okay. I'll add ya!
---
yes, i understand that. workaround help is definitely appreciated and a good thing. but i just hope for some serious fix. however, thx and take care dude
---
Ah no prob there - i'm fairly sure there will always something else to have an outrage on lmao
---
If it's not BR or something else then it just settle for canvasgate as usual lol
---
Didn't even let leather or metal cross my mind in the comparisons. Many thanks for the insight on that one. :) I do have the grounded mutation already.
---
I see, thanks
---
Obviously we are all just corporate shills for enjoying this obvious cash grab /s
---
Expires. It's why you see spoiled meat in machine frequently.
---
I am working on backpack mods currently. Interesting thought process for the metal pieces based on the below reply. Many thanks!
---
Yes, they will spoil in your vending machine at the same rate they spoil in your stash.
---
Since im dead, u want my head?

Np
---
Yeah man, I also love FO76.  I approve of this message and it's a nice surprise to see an old-skool fan enjoying it!
---
Yeah I usually do the pioneer scouts daily
---
These are the guys who didn't quite cut it for Survival.
---
They will bait you with a low level, and some higher level will be hidden nearby to kill you.
---
That's just it...  I don't think they will say much, if anything.  Note it was not one of the games you can play for a bonus tonight.
---
I think they are going for positive press and are going to avoid talking about the black sheepsquatch of the family.
---
Hope I am wrong, but that absence is ominious.

yes, happens to me too. just with the difference that most time no one is around^^ and agree, mats would be a good thing and would love to see those.
---
Interesting.  I had a feeling.
---
This is what we really need. An object that determines where people spawn in. Make it FREE. It would solve so many problems!
---
Shoot, I should try Survival before it dies or gets killed then...  or not. Probably not...
---
u/valseek heyyo, i didnt know if this has been seen by bethesda  
---
ive noticed it too, anytime since months ago and even today

I hope they do it someday, I honestly don't think it would be that hard of a task aside from voice acting.

[ Vault 63 has a tunnel to a mine shaft hidden behind it, it's entirely possible the inhabitants managed to get out before whatever was attacking them killed them, oddly there's only about 1 skeleton in the whole vault. This comes from unfinished clipping so I can't be too sure about what might be going on.](datamining spoilers)

Well damn, I'm in Italy. Lol, maybe I'll see you around on the weekends.

But there isn't many mods for gamma gun. Just one dish, one grip, electric and repeater. The same goes for Tesla - just one reflex sight and three barrels to learn. Handmades, Radium rifles and lever action rifles are also rare but have much more mods to learn so it should take longer.

translation:  It is normal that the camp is divided into individual blueprints, you have to place them together, which can be quite complicated because it complains that some things float in the air or the like and therefore can not be placed.  
---
Edit: I can not just say whether it is normal or not that it is stored under and not under blueprints and as I said you have to place the individual parts under stored.
---
Dragons.
---
Seriously, they put a reticle on the paddleball paddle, but not a rifle? Sure, it would only survive the first shot due to vibration...but c'mon man!
---
Theyll be in for a shock the first timr they try it.  Then theyll really think they slammed a Daddy-O
---
I can relate. My game still freezes about everyday I play, I can‚Äôt invite my buddy to teams as it will say he‚Äôs at the main menu, etc

I'm on the quest for  **Tick blood tequila margarita**  where you need Corpse Seed (spawned from only one event) to make Corpse Seed Juice that makes the Tick Blood Tequila Margarita
---
wtffffffffffffffff
---
Useless as it seems, as many perks are.
---
I do Biv missions daily, have never gotten the nuka dark
---
This. I feel like a vast majority of fallout/elder scrolls players have that moment when they decide to commit genocide.
---
Yep that happened to my wife was trying to do a trade with vendor low lvl kept shooting her in the face she turned and hit him and he stopped and stood still with sentile and then lvl 200 came through the door and one shot her. Don't fall for the bait.
---
I said "actually no" at the propaganda part for a reason. 
---
Now, you're bragging about being a good boy with not even one citation. In fact, I would wish to see the citations that you claim to have.
---
If we have to:
---
do you seriously put edit: in your posts? 
---
And another thing, how does the age of my account matter? Just how? Your account is 9 years old, and I'm surprised you didn't humblebrag about that.
---
Look at your comment, too. It seems to be a little contradictory. Yeah, just saying.
---
They don't care. Half of the players just wait until one of the people that actually do something dies so they could steal their loot. Atleast that's my experience, it could be that I'm just kind of unlucky with other players.
---
Good to know.
---
you would probably wake up from that dream when your alarm clock went off in the morning.. lol
---
Even just making it so we spawn in at their C.A.M.P machine would sort things out.
---
I refuse to buy armour until that's fixed, but I have got the salvaged assaultron head 4 times already...
---
Like that guy on YouTube who bemoans the fact that he can't pvp players and their bases anymore. But knows he'll get his arsed whipped on survival. Hehe wimps.
---
My buddy and I play a lot. We‚Äôre 30 and 40‚Äôs, and keep it pretty chill. Also we don‚Äôt partake in any PVP activities. Feel free to add and join us! psn: kevo0788

Male, 42 years old, seeking working relationship in Appalachia. I'm level 170 something but I got there by doing fertile soil 4 times an hour all day every day. I have an exploding gun and sport a Hunters Longcoat when I'm not wearing the clown suit for a challenge. I'm good for meals of Blackberry juice, Carrot soup, and Corn soup.
---
If your looking to sell I'll take that lead off your hands say 2c apiece and if it's bulked 45c apiece
---
Yeah PSN suprobo3 logging in rn.
---
agree
---
That is quite a bit of info. I do greatly appreciate the detail. 
---
The layers are definitely a bit of a trick. The armor type would be the first layer to get the base damage resist up though wouldn't it? 
---
Never have used skeleton or fireproof. I do get staggered here and there, but usually only when I'm careless. Because of my hoarding nature, I generally rock the deep pocket mods all around. Combined, they add up. It gives a good amount of space for junk to be carried and aid items. I know it lacks efficiency, but it is the playstyle I enjoy. 
---
I do run the sneaking one for the covert ops and the 2.5x bonus. I really notice a difference if I switch that out for ammosmith and forget to replace it. 
---
Just waking up, vanguards is the +BR/ER based on health yea? I'm still looking in on that one. The wording in game (that escapes me currently) leads me to believe I'll need a really high END for a large health pool to make it effective. I may be misunderstanding that one though. I like me some AP refresh though for sure. No idea if those stack with multiple pieces though. Saw conflicting info in earlier search.
---
You probably shouldn't assume OP's post is true to begin with.
---
I have completed the Biv quest every day (minus one day the power was out) since debuted. I have received the Nuka Dark Recipe twice and the Mt Honey thrice. You do get them...I didn't get the first Dark Recipe until last week...then got it the second time two days later. They drop, they are just very rare. Keep hoping and trying. That's what I did. Good luck.
---
Lucky you... that quad explosive lever action sounds awesome. I got 2 legendaries with 'godrolls' right after each other during the first week. Unfortunately they are both black powder weapons and pretty much useless for my char  
---
 \- Bloodied, explosive, Reload speed blackpowder pistol  
---
 \- Instigating, explosive, faster movement speed blackpowder rifle.
---
Since then its been nothing but junk fed back into the scrip machine
---
Yeah, private servers is going to open up a fair amount of possibilities, especially if you can set up custom modpacks for the server to use.
---
Certain ones would be... *interesting*, though... (*cough* loverslab)
---
That's what I hoped workshops would be back in November!
---
Check out the Filthy Casuals subreddit here too, loads of lovely friendly folk there that will be happy to help. I would myself but I‚Äôm on Xbox.
---
ok!
---
Good lord...
---
I'd agree but the cap sink in the fast travel system is just there to encourage exploration. But that's not a need in this game as without a ton of quests the main gameplay element IS exploration. 
---
I think they just added it to appease survival fans who've hated fast travel in Bethesda's games for a long time now. Same people who hate ot and demand it be removed because they can't resist using it. Maybe because busy work travel isn't actually fun.
---
Nah fam, that person is a high level player, they know better than to carry that much junk around all the time. Their own fault, your gain. Congrats on all that lovely junk üòç
---
Nah I make them [my followers](https://i.imgur.com/wETjl7Y.png).
---
Im not home rn but you can add me my psn is pappododo im not around your age but i sure pretend i am (im the one and only 13 year old playing this game and using reddit so yea i dont get so many freinds in fallout my age
---
I've posted this before, but my biggest issue with the mod is there's no "Server" chat. You can either chat with everyone using the mod, or players within a ridiculously small range (100m ?).
---
I want to be able to coordinate a silo/nuke run, or find Grahm. Not be spammed by the global chat with more chat than I can reasonably follow and play at the same time.
---
Had 2 level 28 come to the fight the other week. I'm not sure if they tried to help or not.... probably more concerned with saving ammo......but we failed the quest.
---
I made a mental note for the future. If I show up and see more than 1 player below level 50 I'm fast traveling out. I've already gotten most of the plans that she drops and I'm not going to waste that much ammo for a spin at the legendary slot machine.
---
I will say buying a Nuka Dark recipe for 10 caps was pretty sweet
---
Nah ive seen him on survival hes exactly the same.
---
They don't. It's all the same server setup. Beating the scorch and killing the queen changes nothing. Nothing. 
---
That's why you can farm her. 
---
it's worse then wow because at least some of their boss quests actually change the world you see if you beat them.
---
WTH?!?!?!!? he just died just now!!!
---
35 yr old female here! Level 67 PS4. As far as my username.. I *think* it‚Äôs lackluster24, I honestly need to check 
---
Also this works out because I need to revive an ally for my pioneer scout quest!
---
if you have a camp sometimes the rest of the crew will destroy it when you thump the gnat if they arent waiting in the bushes nearby to gank you...
---
I make sure to start mashing the jump button as soon as I spawn into a player camp, so that I won't get stuck under a foundation. Works well if you hit it as soon as the load screen leaves.   
---
If you're own camp has a trapped spawn point, try throwing down a chair where people get stuck - they can climb into the chair to free themselves.  
---
But yes, a huge inconvenience. We need welcome mats!
---
Gonna add you. Need help on my alt level 17
---
Vanguard gives you almost nothing when lowHP and +35 DR when full HP. PvE is kinda easy lategame, ignore the vanguard sentinel set which sucks and join the real fun in PvP. I'll guide you if you want that.
---
üò¢
---
Worst: I saw one person's camp who had just a few outfits up all for 25k. They had one I wanted, so I shot them a message with a far more reasonable price offer, cause I assumed that the prices were a joke. They left a couple of minutes after I sent the message. :(
---
Best: I was able to buy two 3* max level AA tesla rifles for 8k each, and then a QE 3* ultracite laser pistol for 7.5k all in the same server :D had to move some caps over though, obviously lmao
---
So far, I've had one lucky draw for me (ts, 90%wr, vats crit gauss rifle) and multiple items for my squad I run around with. The most fun was the quad explosive vats meter fill revolver. I still havent given up on the trading though.
---
My 25k cap "YOU HAVE BEEN INSULTED!" is the perfect price. :3
---
ok the robot just freakin up and died for no reason
---
This reminds me of the last time I participated in the Encrypted event. I was holding 2 pylons because nobody  else would and when I died some guy in power armor just hovered over me waiting for me to die so he could steal the loot that I stashed before I came to the event. He didn't fire a single shot the whole time he stood there waiting for me to die.
---
There's one at Camp Adams in the gazebo thing with the crafting bench.
---
Well he gave that a fucking wallop
---
Oh man yea, workshops it should just be on steroids, guys coming from every side, your team throwing up walls and turrets while your laying down covering fire.
---
It honestly wouldn't be that hard if they put some effort into it, NPCs in Fallout 4 use one base animation and it's likely already in the games code somewhere. Using human NPCs would be no different from using robot NPCs, just that they'll have to instance them somehow or take the story to a new level where new players will be from outside the vault.
---
is there a difference between lvl 70 and 180?like after lvl 50 it should just depend on your gear right?
---
i get that thats not exactly the point of the post btw im just curious
---
Aha, it is % based like the opposite of bloody then. Good to know. 
---
PvP is the last thing on my mind. I have a ts dragon and an executioner dragon for when someone decides they want to take my workshop though. It can be rather entertaining.
---
Moving quickly doesn‚Äôt always make a difference anyway. It works sometimes but if you spawn into the CAMP at the very same spot that that part of the CAMP is also spawning you can‚Äôt move and get stuck.
---
I never heard of that weapon
---
I main a Bloody Explosive PA Heavy Gunner. Armor is easy, XO 1 with Emergency Protocol. My preference in Guns are BE 50 Cal is all around the best gun if you could only afford one.  BE Gatling is great for ammo conservation when farming( I primed mine which makes it a one shot on 68 super mutants).  Overall DPS king on SBQ will be the BE LMG, very expensive to upkeep ammo wise.  I also play around with a BE Harpoon Gun, not very practical but fun to mess around with.  I don‚Äôt use heavy lasers as I use grounded mutation.
---
Excellent! Let's do this! Its nice to see another lady!
---
So you're going to just stand there and complain, and not do anything? This sub has gone to shit. This IS aworkaround and you will use it while Bethesda fixes the issue.
---
I mean, that's my excuse too, but that doesn't mean I feel exonerated from ever running the Pylons.
---
You bring up an interesting point with Vampire weapons though.  That could be one event where a Vampire Buzz Blade or Ripper could shine.
---
I always spawn on a cliff side when I FT to my C.A.M.P.
---
Thank you!
---
Thats where ive been server hopping.
---
Just wondering if they can be found in any container as it may be quicker to find somewhere with a high volume of containers.
---
Rather than just checking 2 footlockers at camp adams
---
I keep one on hand for bloodied greifers trying to goad me into combat. Just walk up and take us both out. The rage it induces is worth it every single time.
---
I'm jealous. So beautiful there! Maybe I'll see you!
---
Ahhhh..xbox is great though!
---
&gt; g
---
Actually, they get that 30% back after their game has enough sales, but you never hear that.
---
It's almost like Bethesda didn't think that FO76 would have that many sales. Weird.
---
I will add ya!
---
First thing I do is a big jump, than run.
---
What is a citation? Yes I seriously put edit in my posts. People can tell when you edit and some people like to show what changed. This is an accepted pracice across reddit. I've never seen it called out until now.
---
My account IS 9 years old, I'm a charter member. You on the other hand just signed up a month ago so I dont' really have to listen to your guff.
---
I'm a low level and I do this coz I'm bored as hell. Everyone's silent. Noone accepts team invites to go do events. I whack high levels then run away.
---
Uninstall it first, then try to reinstall it.
---
Maybe I am Fallout fan and disappointed how badly designed FO76 is? You ever thought that? Are you saying that I have to ignore all the core problems of the game and just pretend like it is a perfect game? If we pretend it is a good game currently Bethesda won't make it any better in future. They just keep delivering broken games  with just a minimum content.
---
LIKE WOW lol
---
Lol BTW minor typo. It is TheLoneVaultBoy not *loan*
---
One of the great things about this game is you can have a bunch of folks with successful melee characters, all with different builds.
---
Here‚Äôs my two cents:
---
If you‚Äôre not using PA, go unarmed weapons. Power fist, death claw gauntlet, etc, do twice the damage of melee weapons, and can do a lot more.
---
I‚Äôd put at least three points in perception, because at some point you‚Äôll want to be able to pick locks.
---
I like fireproof x 2, because it nullifies scorchbeast attacks.
---
I carry rad resist x 2, because it lets me attack an SBQ, without getting cooked.
---
Also, adamantium skeleton.
---
Nerd rage is a nice intelligence perk, that you can swap for weapons artisan, armorer, fix it good, or makeshift warrior in camp.
---
I know some folks think born survivor is lazy, but I‚Äôve come to rely on it.
---
Yeah, I had that same experience. My role at encrypted is, hold a pylon (or two if I HAVE to), revive downed players and tag the sheepsquatch as I can. Due to my build must be fu$&amp;Ed, I'm not very effective at killing it even at level 94 sadly. So I do my part for the good of the many.  Lol. Same with SBQ.  I dream if being a badass and putting some hurt on some baddies....but alas...I'm just a supporting character.
---
The social menu is the real game killer. You get really excited to play with your buddy and then your buddy is in the main menu. Thank god for discord, but many don't use discord, and think their buddy just fell asleep at the main menu, it's sad. HELL, I woke up the other night, having put my PC to sleep after closing the game out (but I think the launcher may still have been open). I looked at my phone in the middle of the night and it showed me playing Fallout 76 at like 3 am. not sure if that's a 76 thing or a discord thing lol
---
most weapons that can be crafted are tgerefore not hard to mod imo because if its worth the effort and the caps you can fully mod them withing one or two hours of gameplay
---
except for the radium rifle as it gives barely no mods when you scrap it down so you need a shitton of ressources
---
i also never aquires the bayonett mod for the blackpowder weapons
---
ultracite weapons are hard to mod because you have barely no option than to craft them and scrap them down again which chews threw your ultracite ressources really quick
---
other than that the only weapons i found it hard to get mods for were the cultist weapons (ive seen serrated versions of them recently)
---
I'm 34 and level 43, but I'm on PC
---
The 30% premium is only until they sell a certain amount of copies. After they sell that many, the money is returned to them.
---
It's so that Steam can cover their own asses and prevent companies from releasing a shitty game for a quick cash grab, I'd assume.
---
Yeah, I will be interested in server mods, as mods improve so many Bethesda games.  Maybe they can finally fix the way that 3 star enemies can drop a 1 star useless syringer or whatever.
---
You can add me: Duke_Silver13. Mountain time zone.
---
Juicehead is one of the few Youtubers actively making informative Fallout 76 videos without being overly positive nor toxic. He's come a long way IMO
---
This is just another sad example how little Bethesda is interested in repairing problems. Problem is widely known.
---
4 barrel black powder gun.  Good range and damage, but you'd better down the target on the shot since reload time is looooong.  https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/The_Dragon
---
No
---
Took me a lot of scrapping to get the powerful auto for the radium. And the auto for the gamma.
---
i think it's gonna be like eso. pretty despised upon release, but good updates will make people begrudgingly accept that it's decent enough for what it is
---
it's not quite bos levels of selloutness or shittiness
---
I would kill my best friend for that much ballistic fiber.
---
Dirty Tan Suit counts.
---
I mean, I still try to activate the Pylons if noone else does, but then i have to hope that someone else does the damage on the Imposter. If noone does, we're fucked.
---
Yea although I have enjoyed this game since beta I cant deny that my other hardcore fallout fan friends have dropped off since, I guess it wasnt for everyone but I'm looking forward to what it can become.
---
Got it turning an event in the mire or bog if I'm not mistaken
---
Met a girl like that. Lvl 27, I was 34. So I say screw it, and engage, and mopped the forest floor with her. I realized the trap the instant I heard her laughing. Three 150s pop into view, and kill me in .03 of a second.
---
Apparently pvp just means ganking most of the time.
---
Sorry, it was a misteak...
---
That is a stupid mechanic.
---
Maybe go play a different game then?
---
I think I'll sample that beep and start piping it through area chat
---
just some hours ago I died at the SBQ-event shortly after killing her and there were ~5 people standing around me, waiting for me to die so they can get the flux. I mean, I can't blame 'em, but it's god damn annoying.
---
Do you say steak??
---
I will add you. Thank you very much!
---
Other Fallouts: Look at all these poor saps struggling to survive. Sucks to be them.
---
FO76: We‚Äôre all in this together, Jimmy! GIVE ME YOUR DAMN SCREWS.
---
&gt;Everyone knows what is meant when we say NPCs, everyone knows that there are non human characters
---
I know that.  You know that.  We know that.  I don't think the broader gaming populace knows that.
---
Hmm good question.. I mean it's only if they are at full health.. so I'd assume it would but it wouldn't be worth it.. you'd do more damage with an actually attack
---
Have this on PC. Worth noting that when it does freeze, the cpu shoots up to 100% usage for the time it's frozen.
---
i was thinking of selling hard to mod modded weapons
---
I used my dragoon as a first sneak shot on a powerful enemy then swapped to a faster firing rifle.  I since swapped to an instigating black powder, would love an instigating Dragon.
---
I see the same players all the time. If its a group we dont like we get out  buts out. Freakint tree house camps and explosive plasma guns are a nuisance
---
well im sure there is a market for that because people would like the convenience most players dont want to spend time crafting/scrapping stuff to get their mods id say just go for it ! :)
---
There are no humans, so the lack of ghouls doesn't really surprise me.  As others have said, ghoul racism was certainly a thing.  And I'm not sure one could really distinguish whether any random Scorched was a former human or a ghoul.  They'd look more-or-less the same.
---
Post Apocalyptic Gwen Stefani
---
Prime and Hardened Receivers give the same damage increase, but if you hit Scorched enemies with it you'll do even more damage
---
About 3 days ago I managed to get my first Nuka Cola Dark Recipe, so it‚Äôs possible to receive the recipe. üëçüèΩ
---
People like you have a sound argument but fuck do y‚Äôall sound like elitists. It‚Äôs a free country and they can do whatever they want. 
---
Is it annoying? Sure.
---
Are you being petty? Sure.
---
Does any of it matter? No.
---
NO MORE LOCKED DOORS! Come by my camp, buy stuff, grab some water, grab some veggies, top off your ammo with my lead extractor, and cool up some booze. That‚Äôs what a community is for. 
---
Back on topic, my friend has NEVER ONCE not spawned in my floor.
---
If it is a battle royale theve ruined the game
---
It's good to know that there actually is a reason other than laziness. And its to be even lazier lol. I guess we get to hope for more descriptive emotes
---
This is also pissing me off. I see someong with 20 armor. Oh neat, go there bunch of useless junk.  Rarely do i find good things.
---
I add only legendary items or items that could be useful. I try to make it a decent price.
---
It‚Äôs going to be a completely optional game mode, like Survival. You will never, ever have to play it. I‚Äôve never once played Survival and I‚Äôve also managed to never complain about its existence.
---
Incredibly mature from you. You still got a "school mentality" in you. Incredible, indeed.
---
You also dismiss my entire reply just because my account is only a month old. 
---
Personally, I don't like edit:, because it looks incredibly dumb. You do you. Your previous post wasn't that good, and neither is this one. 
---
I can see that this argument is going to devolve into a USA-North Korea name-calling contest in a few responses, so I'll do the good samaritan thing and stop replying. It's simply not worth it. You seem to have quite the inflated ego. You do you, buddy.
---
I know this
---
Thanks! I'm still lacking in plans to give it the proper execution, but this industry is all about controlled growth.
---
Will trade PA for plans
---
lol^^ yes^^ i have a friend who also did put a seat to the spot, where i usually spawn and get stuck^^
---
Huh, never knew that. Well shoot, they are practically useless I suppose, considering hardly anyone does the SBQ anymore. Shame
---
Yep, I usually bring 2, draw them back to back so they are hot keyed for a quick switch.  Sneak, attack, quick switch to #2, then fav wheel to a faster weapon if needed.
---
So many Grafton Monsters met their doom with that weapon....
---
yes of course im using instigating a lot and it works just fine when you play alone and do pve stuff enemies are almost always at full health and of course this is not aimed to be the most viable build this is more of a challenging playstyle i enjoy roleplaying the game is easy enough to make room for such builds if you ignore the SBQ/arktos/imposter
---
Its the most entertaining thing in this game, as long as you can hunt the hunters and are only hunting the hunters. Fighting versus PvErs is not fun and I never attack them, just letting the bros and sis do their things.
---
Thanks that‚Äôs very interesting. Some said AA equals  about 30% boost, after some complex calculations. If that‚Äôs the case then your findings make perfect sense since Executioner is 50% boost.
---
Thanks! I'm still lacking in the plans to give it the proper execution, but this industry is all about controlled growth. (Will trade PA for plans)

Classic fo hoarder =\]
---
I tagged a scorchbeast in a standoff with a group of protectrons near Harper‚Äôs Ferry and kept on running expecting to get xp eventually.  A short while later, the same scorchbeast suddenly fell out of the sky behind me and I was far to the north.  Strange bug.  But...I got xp AND loot, so it worked out in my favor.
---
I just was at scorched earth event with level 28. We failed. Maybe because i was useless, maybe because SBQ is stupid bullet sponges and guys around weren't meta blooodied. 
---
I would go there again, because even when we failed i am level 31 now, with some caps from all those mega sloths and Bloodied limb damage faster reload speed auto granate launcher.
---
Im on pc. Too many buttons man
---
it's even more sad that an issue like that would have been detected by them in no longer than a few minutes, if they would actually test their stuff, before they release it. but that's what a bethesda game player is meant to be for the whole time playing, even for years, a beta game tester. would be np to me, if i would get paid for it, rather than me having to pay them for doing their job.
---
Start a new character. Other than that, no.
---
Welcome matts should be spawn points
---
Damn,.. that ghoul got cake
---
Whitesprings is definitely setup to prevent people from trying to ruin it for others
---
That is absolutely horrifying please take it back.
---
It might not even be BR but it‚Äôs definitely going to be PvP based. Even if it‚Äôs TDM or something, it‚Äôs going to be it‚Äôs own thing and I think ATOMS should be a good selling point as rewards.
---
Oh good I get to have the last word. The thing about your account is: it's only a month old, I have no way of going back in your history to see if you are a troll or not. If you just joined reddit a month ago you  might want to stop misleading people about my posts. You said I was going around hating on Fallout 76 but you didn't mention how many posts I have about the fun stuff. So, yeah. Stop fucking talking to me.
---
I have same issues, those started after last 2 patches.
---
complain? in your eyes it might be whatever. always lies in the eye of the beholder. i hope you won't be sad when telling you that what  you see doesn't interest me by the slightest bit.
---
and btw, i prefer serious fixes done by the company selling their product, rather than beta testing their game. if they pay me for it, instead me paying them, than i would be fine doing their job ,)
---
It‚Äôs lots of clickbait content, and all from reddit.
---
Search "worth" in this thread. There's dozens of other posters asking this with answers.
---
Today i was on uncrypted with my alt, 25lvl at the time. I was conduting two pylons half the time. And we did it. 
---
On SBQ i am useless, but there is extreme amound of XP running around. So i won't gonna pass that.
---
would be cool. then it would be at least m own choice if i want to place those between water purifiers xD jk^^
---
No.  This trick is so old, it is mentioned in the User Guide book as a warning.   People get tired of survival and want something new and that in no way implies they can't cut it in survival. 
---
I don't do it, but I love it when they try  and I ruin their day.
---
totally agree i get those argument but most players arent on reddit the ones that are usually know how to behave in appalachia and the ones that do shitty stuff like this (its the same with people who oneshot legendarys at events) wont stop not caring no matter how good your argument is
---
all in all even in a game with such a great comunity like this you always have some bad boys that dont want to play by your rules
---
Where I am there is never enough wood and when I see it I forget I need it
---
That‚Äôs fair. I play on Xbox so if I invite my old man for instance and he‚Äôll usually join my party and then I‚Äôll find out he‚Äôs actually playing the game not at the main menu
---
Depends on the weapon
---
I would kill myself immediately after because that would break the universe
---
Confirmed. There appears to be five combat helmet color variants tied to combat armor mods in general. I've scrapped hundreds and hundreds of combat armor pieces and believe this is the complete list.
---
Brotherhood of Steel: dark blue
---
Shadowed: black
---
Reinforced: dark red
---
Polymer: white (or really light gray)
---
Fiberglass: beige
---
Probably something that would be of similar help and would be not so hard to find, would to be the person who uses a shotgun and the enforcer perk to cripple the limbs of the SBQ. It effectively works to do the same thing; keep her on the ground. 
---
This is my solution because I have no idea where cryolators spawn lol

it also doesn't work when you see s\*\*\* as not fully load and a building is so huge and has a 1000 water purifiers around it, as you might aswell just run straight into a stuck point\^\^
---
terrible solution and one that needs to be seriously fixed by beths devs.
---
I should make level 300 in the next day or so and this game really tries my patients sometimes.
---
If it pops up on my main I take all pylons I can. Then sprint around, nothing there can really kill you if you keep running. Take shots while sprinting and eating glowing steaks/regular stim when needed. Hopefully a bloodied is there to end it. On my alt, he's bloodied and blows up the robot for the pylon guys. You can solo it but it takes a lot of super stims, not really worth it. Noone seems interested in the imposter outfit anymore. I have sets in my vendor that don't get sold. The fixer plan too, no interest anymore.
---
I mean, if they purchased and played the game they have every right to criticize it don't they?
---
Yep, agreed.
---
You must be able to at least get some caps out of those God rolls, though, right?
---
I'm just looking at it as an additional grind for God tier stuff. Wander around to vendors looking for three start weapons under 600 caps or so, get scrip, try again, repeat.
---
What are your PC specs?

If they have to gank someone to win, it's implied that they can't manage for themselves.

‚ÄúBad boys‚Äù
---
Lol ya, well that‚Äôs life for you, bub. I can‚Äôt go into town for 30 minutes without bumping into a few of them. 
---
A good trick is to ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù get shot by one of these low level boot and then mop the floor with them. 
---
They‚Äôll probably respawn, maybe report you but at least they‚Äôll learn a lesson. Additionally, if you have a mic, turn it on area and actually talk to them. Most are pretty responsive, imo.
---
He doesn't have a beef with you, he's talking to the OP.
---
Right? The things we have to work around to play this game astounds me. But I keep playing because it's fun lol, once you get it working, it's like a cantankerous old TV set you have to wallop sometimes
---
Handmade beats it in everything except for reload speed. Assault rifle is so bad. I just sell them to vendors
---
Had a level 6 at a Scorched Earth event the other day. Admittedly they were getting stuck in, not hiding, but I doubt they did anything that helped. The worst offender I've seen was a level 40 that was hiding in the top bunker thing at Glass Caverns that was right on the blast zone edge. SBQ just hovered over them, spawning a whole hoard on the roof while all the bloodied DCG/ handmade guys stood twiddling their thumbs over by the dropsite, unable to do anything.
---
it‚Äôs a freeloader country and they are free to steal, by the way they play the game you can tell how they make their livings in their real lives.
---
Damn children. Sell them to the circus. Issue resolved.
---
Yea and the fire goes out super quick sometimes so its best to end it as fast as possible.
---
If it makes you feel any better, I‚Äôm also around 800 hours into the game and just discovered the sulfur fountain near the Whitespring golf club yesterday.
---
yeah im pretty nooby too when it comes to the endgame so i just outright ignore it
---
Perk card Endurance: Fireproof. Protects you from scorched beasts fire burps damage. Players should participate but be prepared to use the best weapons that you can in scorched earth event. Obtain a gatling 5mm and 2000 5mm ammo and perk cards Intelligence: Stabilized, Luck: One gun army, and the Strength heavy gunner perk cards. Everyone should have a 5mm gatling by now.
---
If you really want to mod out your Cryo, I'd recommend buying the plan, then creating and destroying them to learn the mods. There's no source in game that will be fast enough for you to do this manually, without really serious luck.
---
Praise be to Lootcifer.

Go to Harper's ferry and follow the yellow highway on the map until it meets the water and bends.
---
This is by far the least toxic community I've yet to see , people are nice and polite, helpfull to new players.
---
Exactly. At this point, it‚Äôs the freezing that‚Äôs making ne not want to play as much. I never know if it‚Äôs going to freeze when I open my pip-boy or whatever
---
It's still really fun. Now, unlike what most people say, it is possible to kill OP players with non-OP stuff. I have friends who use assassin's handmades and kill people using explosive handmades. I will agree with this though, it is a lot easier to kill people with this explosive gear.
---
Are you getting mad that 2 guns is better than one? Seems pretty dumb to me.
---
That'd be epic!
---
Check on top of the roof in Grafton. The one in the middle where you can walk across three buildings by planks. Above the cooking station that is sandwiched between two buildings.
---
people need to move their vendors away from their camp buildings. placement of the vendor units determines the spawn point. dont put them inside or next to buildings.
---
I would love TDM so much more.
---
Problem is, people heard about god roll items and high prices and failed to realize that those were partially a side effect of a small, closed market. Now it's wide open, and they can try to sell their gear... but so can everyone else, and now you can bargain hunt. I've bought a weapon for 5k, but it was well suited to my needs, and even then it was mostly because with the addition of vending I can spare the caps.
---
This could be the cover of a fallout country music album.
---
what BR mode?
---
they announced BR?
---
Yeah I freeze ALL THE TIME. USUALLY when I'm getting out of PA to use a bench. I can still move INSIDE THE PA (I can swing a weapon, and you can see me in there, swinging it, from within the PA) but I can't do anything but swing a melee weapon or shoot a gun but I can't aim it. I tried getting killed in that situation but THEN I am relegated to being a swimmyboi and I swim along the ground after that, freely traveling outside the map, all around the universe. Which is fun and all but I was trying to get back to what my team was doing
---
I have seen somebody very very late at night do it. I'm talking like 3AM lol. But I'm fairly certain they had every workshop claimed on that particular server.
---
This belongs on /r/nosleep

They are hide-ing
---
in various containers. Just not on actual Deathclaws ever, apparently.
---
I'll sell certain ammo (specifically, low use ammo like the gauss ammo) for 2-3c, but anything you need to spam? hell no, 1c each, bro.

I hate being spawned inside someone‚Äôs building and then being locked inside. üòÇ

Thx but 2 of the people i often play with is using shotgun and enforcer
---
I don‚Äôt kill any cow that I see because I would feel bad about it.
---
did you try updating your drivers?
---
This thread just has sexual harassment written all over it.
---
Urghh.
---
Not really, they effect all scorched and bats are everywhere. Also I've seen more SBQ fights since the repair kits became a reward.
---
Huh. That‚Äôs a weird glitch. You describing being relegated to swimmyboi reminds of when your gmod animation bugs out and you‚Äôre swimming on land lol
---
Good bless your soul.
---
Omg is that what this is about?! I‚Äôve been doing anything I can think of to trick this piece into place.
---
Oh okay lol. 
---
If interested, I think there is a cryolator plan. In fact, now that I'm thinking of it, I may be able to craft one. What system are you on?
---
Based on the unofficial survey 7% (i think it was) of players want more pvp.
---
If they would have just left Pain Train as it was in Fallout 4, but remove the knockdown function for PvP, I think it would be viable for a pure PvE character.
---
That's hilarious
---
Ps4
---
Thats why we have the freefolk sub of r/filthycasuals
---
Yeah that happens a LOT with the ghouls at the clubhouse, I have video. It's creepy as fu**. Really weird when it happens to your toon though. You can suddenly go wherever you want and you can shoot but you can't aim. and you can't stand up lol
---
Everything gets downvoted when posted here. Positive. Negative. Suggestions. All get downvoted. Don't take it personally. Some people are salty fuckers about us playing this game.
---
I stupidly turned them back into scrip thinking there were plenty more good drops coming my way... FML
---
I agree with that logic. I bought it release day and considering I'm lvl 120 I'm happy with my playtime
---
Lol, I fell for this once. Turned around and was like, FINE!!, then 3 dudes came outta nowhere from his team and took me out.
---
I am 45 and lvl 136 I think and my PS4 name is Hoyt932. I play chill &amp; relaxed so if anyone wants to add me I would like that.
---
You sound like Pete Hines. Thanks for the suggestion.
---
/s ?
---
I wonder if that‚Äôs a PC specific glitch. I haven‚Äôt experienced or seen it happen, but I wish I would
---
I probably wasted over 20k worth of materials to get the radium mods.  Nothing else was even close to that expensive.

I get them from junk piles

I too am on PS4. My PSN is molehands135 if you want me to build you one.

Best was early on, when so many people sold one-stars for tiny prices next to a scrip grinder. Worst, I've seen a 1 star exterminator's pipe pistol for 8k. I didn't even look at the rest of the camp, just moved along.
---
It is likely why
---
Hopefully he grows a backbone and says you know what I'm tired of the crybabies. This is a apocalypic world and I'm giving it back to the people who run it and make it great. We are turning up the dial to the max. Camp Destruction and slap damage is back! And the ones who run Xbox are like yay, we finanlly some good news.
---
Was the CAMPer atop a mountain?
---
Not downvoting. I assume sarcasm.
---
Yeah its dependent on the weapon. Some see no damage increase, others see a significant increase.  Gauss Rifle is one of those thats sees a significant increase.
---
i've realized that. but still, seems the majority here, unlike other forums i've seen, is still very helpful and supportive :_) there's always a few that just hate to hate or disagree to disagree, but here on reddit it seems common sense is still having the whip hand :D
---
thx for that buddy ;)

I caught one of those once, but I ended up getting back on and letting it launch me to my death. That shit is hilarious

Ah, i haven't had much trouble but i love the slow hunt. I ran a full sniper build. I then geared up with appropriate stealth armor and took pot shots at them from max load distance range. Made about 10k caps week 1 killing those exploding machine gun bastards.
---
I think I saw a youtuber build one
---
it truly would
---
I'm just hoping when I start selling hard to mod modded weapons, I can make a decent buck
---
I am having a good time considering i never planned on spending another dime. It keeps getting better so i feel at lvl 120 its become worth my money.

And it gives no message at all when trying to place

me too\^\^

I bought Fallout76 when it was first released. And I‚Äôve been playing it since then. In my humble opinion, Fallout76 is way better than it was at the beginning. However, things like this or more terrible than this proved to us that there is still a long way ahead.

Ultracite Gatling laser. luckily I got the plans recently so I can create and scrap to put mods to my legendary

I will add you as soon as im online
---
What timezone are u.   I live in sweden
---
They've always been that way unless you can place them in a corner with one side against the wall and the pass through going through the adjacent wall.
---
Prior to the legendary vendor I would have said train stations as people always sold them. There's no way to farm a specific weapon like that but scorchbeasts and area bosses tend to drop non legendary big guns.
---
I did hate this guy at first. But he actually likes the game these days.
---
So let's take this right. Survival, adventure, and BR. Release day: estimate maybe 6% of PvP players play BR and 70% of PvE players play BR. Survival is left with 1% of the playerbase. After release day: 20% of PvE players and 3.5% of PvP players are in BR. Leaves Survival with 3.5% of all players.
---
Yeah. Only place to get them is enclave vendor at 20k a pop.
---
Huh? Yah okay. Not even close.
---
Now you're just milking it
---
Ther terk er jeerrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrbssssss!!!!!
---
&gt;	there are reasons why the game got so much hate in the first place. 
---
Chief among them, the neckbeards from /r/fallout gatekeeping what‚Äôs a ‚Äútrue‚Äù Fallout experience.
---
Just kidding. I‚Äôm 37. I‚Äôll add you and you can teach me enough Italian so I understand what my neighbor says when he yells at the crows in his yard.
---
Yep BUT it's 99% likely to be true.
---
As a shame filled pistol main, I'd love to see That Gun. A 5.56 revolver, yes please.
---
I sort of want to do a poll asking people some things about how they use the purveyor and try to figure out why some have such bad luck and others have good luck. I have had decent luck by using a pair of weapons I want to roll for a day or so and then rolling at the purveyor for two star weapons. I roll till i get two junk rolls and stop for the day (or server hop). If I get anything from enemies I go to the nearest station and scrap it immediately because it seems like if I stash it or use it then I will roll one of those in my next 5 rolls.
---
I also suspect it accounts what region you do events in for the roll also. I don't have enough data to prove it but I noticed trends of certain weapons from playing in certain regions for an extended time before rolling.
---
Don't forget while fending off the 'lurks and 'lurk hunters
---
I was in survival and someone launched a nuke which crashed the server, upon rejoining a new survival server it said some error message like "timed out finding server" or something similar, making me think that was the only Xbox survival server going at that time.
---
Very good point, couldn't agree more.
---
I like lighting them on fire.
---
Good times. Gooooooooooood times.
---
Oh it was the other guys post. 1.9.million died to sheep squatch. If the playerbase is 1% of that (being its a high level, rare event which can kill you multiple times.) Thats at least in the tens of thousands, but realistically there are tons of people who have never done it as well.
---
Only what you are carrying drops
---
Love to know as well
---
What all do I lose?
---
The problem with FO76 is that it is fun in the beginning (early levels, below 50), but it turns very boring after that. There is no content at all in the end game and you can reach that point in 4-5 days if you play intensively. Hoarding more junk or just building own camp isn't a content that can carry interest for game a long. Player vending was fun in the beginning, but it turned to pointless very fast which was just fast traveling to other player camp areas where everyone sell just same garbage items.
---
I'm from Green Bay Wisconsin. I wish I spoke Italian.

What?! I say my age cus I dont want to play with a younger crowd. You're the only one making it that way.

According to the last unofficial poll,  of this is a predominantly PVP update they‚Äôre not catering to the majority of players,  they‚Äôll be catering to a rather tiny portion of the player base while attempting to court new players with a (rumored) mode from a slowly dying game type (battle royal).
---
You shouldn't.  But many people aren't really interested in discussion.  They see something within a post (not even reading the entire thing) and react with a click, and then offer nothing of any value to further the discussion.
---
Your description of the game in this thread is 100% accurate.  And the bits that others have mentioned here is also accurate on how to salvage what is there and make it enjoyable.  The majority of the player base wants for each other to have fun, so they work hard to help.  Not sure what this game would be without that spirit of camaraderie from the player base.  Just avoid the griefers ......
---
I cant do the event when I go in the event starts but it has no markers or objectives.A little help maybe?
---
Where is that at?
---
Junk and aid?
---
The Post Nuke Barbers Union has taken a firm stance on gender hair inequality. The Wasteland Society of Better Style is much more broad minded, and believes regardless of gender, you rock that red dress. Despite recent attempts by the WSBS to create a more equal and diverse apocolypse, the PNBU has been bribing Bethesda to keep the line distinct between the hairstyles for boys and girls.
---
All data mining and the combat improvements blogspot they posted suggests an PVP focused game mode.
---
I got rid of my brahmin because idiots kiil it all the time. It should make players wanted just as if they destroyed your camp which can't happen anymore unless you're already in conflict with them. Thing is the cow IS part of your camp, yet it can still be destroyed by players weather they're hostile or not. Maybe Bethesda should make it so players can't kill it at all.
---
I added ya! That was your name! I'm looking to seeing you on there.
---
I believe so 
---
All junk and some aid
---
A higher level character probably has better armor, weapons and perks than a lower level character. Playing longer means you've collected more legendary drops (presumably) and have most likely perfected your build. It's not necessarily an advantage to be higher level, but they're probably no longer looking for the best gear because they likely already have it.
---
No shit? I‚Äôm in Minneapolis. Go Pack.
---
I agree with everything you said, you get my upvote. it's a long overdue thing that should be fixed. and re-placing our camp should not have to happen to make the game work. I think most people don't want to grief other players. they *want* them to travel into a safe correct spot to shop or hang out and be able to go about their business and leave.
---
I'm hoping they announce the total sales and how many people play a month and how long to see reddit and YouTube shit their pants.
---
We know it sold millions and a million or so players based on previous posts. But we don't really have solid numbers aside what seem like offhand comments.
---
I try to price my stuff to sell. If someone needs it and I can put a few caps in my pocket then we both win.
---
As long as there are 20ish players in survival there will always be at least 1 server full of people you get sent to. Not good, but being a slow hunt gank fest its not the biggest issue imo. People will still go there for their weekly legendary.
---
Nah, I‚Äôve seen the Boomers from L4D.
---
I have the engineer costume (the one you get from submitting technical data, yeah?). I wear it all the time and love it, and am not aware of any problem. Is there something I should be watching out for??
---
Neither does replying without down voting.  In fact, I would argue that down voting is completely unconstructive to healthy dialogue.  It adds nothing.  It contributes nothing.
---
Is it? :(
---
I get this all the time and it drives me bonkers.
---
The only way i get around this is to place the items i want to connect right next to each other, connect them, then move one or both items into place.
---
They really should have let us at least select what KIND of 3* projectile/melee weapon we wanted.
---
Want a gauntlet or handheld?
---
Pistol, Rifle, or inaccurate AOE monster?
---
The fact that you asked about swapping weapons just proves my point.   I don't have to...
---
If I'm tooling around with a legendary double barrel shotgun and come across a boss, say a Legendary SheepSquatch, then I can take it down just as quickly as if I was running around with my legendary 5.56 handmade.  It doesn't matter which weapon I start the day with, I know that they will all do the job because I have the necessary perks.  That only comes with leveling up and getting the perk cards.
---
When you talk about PvP, you are pretty much talking about specialized builds that have been deliberately planned from the start of the character.  In this regard, there wouldn't be much difference after a certain leveling point.  Mostly these are bloodied builds.  If you had specified that you were talking about a specifically built PvP characters in your post, then I would have agreed with you.
---
I don't do PvP because I feel that it's so broken it hurts.  PvP, in my mind, should last, at least, 5 to 10 minutes, no one-shot kills, and both players should be on an equal footing, regardless of level, build, and weapons.  But, that's just my opinion...
---
got ya thanks üëçüèº
---

---
Hell yah! Die hard packer fan! You're not far off eh! Lol. Go Vikings! I'm not a hater even though they took longwell

Ironically that is exactly where I have a base.

By being insulted. Insult bot has some great lines.
---
It's absolutely this.
---
The little PvP fanbois who couldn't actually handle the heat.
---
Really. I didn‚Äôt know he gave me anything
---
They probably wont but i wish they would. People say SC2 is a dead game for years, but you log in and it says 30,000 players in your region. More than enough. Just post some numbers, it won't make me sad unless its under 10k lol
---
I gave up leveling there, when third time some random 100+ lvl found me after i was at scoreboard leading, killed me and took my stuff. Every damn time i drop all stimpaks and radaways (by all i mean 15 out of 15 on one death). Frustrating experience.
---
Yes OK. On your head be it.
---
In between Big Fred's BBQ Shack and the National Isolated Radio Array. 
---
I have a base thats up the hill behind me in the picture, which is how I know of that spot in the picture.
---
that means its definitely BR then I guess.. carry on...
---
To be fair Bethesda‚Äôs games probably aren‚Äôt making near as much money as regurgitated EA stuff. And from what I‚Äôve been reading they aren‚Äôt selling as well as the regurgitated stuff. You just have to see how every developer is dipping their toes into GAAS to see how much more successful that is. The fact that other developers are trying shows you where the money is. Even CDPR is adding a multiplayer to cyberpunk. This was a company that said Witcher 3 was fully single player so they could focus on the best single player experience.
---
I have a spot upstream in the lake.
---
Yes junk and aid. Regenerating armor or healing factor serum will be your best friend!
---
It's people like you that make issues for people who are seriously just looking for new people to MMO with. You're the only one that don't belong on this thread.
---
Except all the vaults in 76 are some kind of dungeons.
---
I believe it was in Fallout 4 that you could set a place mat that acted as the fast travel spawn. That could be really great. 
---
On the flip side someone would totally use it against players and have them spawn in a cage or some bullshit.
---
Or they could just be trying to jump and you're in front of them. It's the same key (on PC anyhow).
---
Worst, and sadly common, Mole Miner gauntlet plans at 750c
---
Best, found a guy selling a full set of carry weight reduction armor at 750c each
---
agree a 100% and thx for the support. i hope it helps to get a fix on this issue, so ppl don't have to bother with it anymore.
---
Thx!
---
Alright buddy, no worries.
---
It seems that the conduit in general just sucks for placing down. So I‚Äôve stuck with wires. But I haven‚Äôt tried messing with the pass through. I just put a wire through a window.

I rather them come from outside west Virginia.

Have a mass migration from like ohio running from a new threat.

Ah, gotcha.  Thats badass.  Im up by vault 51 where there is a small shallow cave and camp.

im sorry if some people have beef with your pets.
---
Kill them all in the goriest way possible

I would love it if Bethesda could figure out a way to slow spoiling for vendor sales of food. I like making the rare recipes and would love to offer them in my vending machine, but they spoil too quickly. I have the refrigerated backpack and it works great, would love a refrigerated stash so I could offer up food for sale. Right now the easiest food to sell is pre-war food that doesn't spoil like Salisbury Steak and Sugar Bombs.
---
I put springboards under my cow so players can make her fly over the whitespring.
---
We'll be at the moon by 2095.
---
Maybe but it happens frequently :)
---
I will add you as well! Thanks for the help!
---
medium rad please
---
But then the new items will just be duped like the others were. Remeber the crashing server rollback dupe is still in the game. So as soon as new items come out they will be duped, just like the legacy weapons and faschnact masks getting duped like crazy.
---
Plot twist: he had 10x that in his stash box.
---
I'm pretty close too, Got a spot downstream next to Site Alpha
---
Out of the 6 3* ranged weapons I have gotten 4 of them were Gatling lasers with vats. The other 2 was an assaultron head and a mutants slayers Assault Rifle....
---
I must admit... one time I was seriously encumbered and walked to the closest camp on the map expecting to use his bench to scrap and his stash to unload it all... only to find that he had everything locked inside, so I killed his brahmin. 
---
Felt quite bad about it, but moral of the story.... leave a bench and a stash if you're gonna put a vendor out.
---
Are you wearing unyeilding armor and a backpack?
---
I'll go find the video and hopefully share it with you
---
legendary affects of armor / pocketed armor affects / backpack 
---
dont work while in powerarmor thats probably why
---
Have you gotten shot for down thumbing or emoting "no" yet?
---
Always fun.  Wave "Hi".  Request trade.  Indicate No.  Get shot.  Common interaction on FO76 .... usually conducted with an explosive weapon.
---
I apologize for laughing so hard while reading this üòÇ
---
I'm usually the one who opens these requests, but I swear, I'm just trying to jump away :)
---
I got 1 weapon Im using in something like 30 tries for 2* or 3* ranged..
---
Im not upset about it.. even though I just turned them in for scrip they were still better than the drops I get from mobs or events..
---
at least im getting 2* and 3* items....
---
Are you running deep pocketed or pocketed mods on your regular armor?
---
Actually I can already tell by the amount you're losing it's a backpack. When you get into PA it nullifies the usage of the backpacks.
---
While this is an awesome idea for us mature people, I could see how this could potentially be exploited to drop people off cliffs or other traps. They really just need to identify a safe block within 2ft of a vendor and drop you there.
---
Agreed. Would gladly pay 300 scrip if i could just choose the subtype
---
it truly is better. when it had gazillion bugs in the beginning, it now has only a million...on a serious note, it is better, but to me, and don't get me wrong,  i ever loved bethesda, it's just still a loooooooooooooooooooooooong way to go to get the game to where it should have been half a year before when sold full price.
---
again, i love bethesda and although frustrated often, i could live with the bugs in their single-player games...the more with modders helping by doing the job bethesda should have done. but in a multiplayer game, and especially one where you can see how much devotion and love is put into their real money atom-shop, while the game itself is still flooded with bugs half year later, it just makes me mad sometimes and hard to accept. i mean, for 2 pa paints alone you can buy a season pass on any other game, and here you still have to deal with bugs like mentioned in the op or with ghouls attacking you in sleep pose...that's just hard to accept.
---
however, thx for your add and hope you can relate to my view.
---
Are they still probing for reactive armor maybe? I thought they patched that so it doesn't initiate pvp but maybe not, or maybe some people still think it does and try it?
---
Either that or they just want to annoy and bait a reaction. More likely that I guess. Usually those assholes goad you over the mic though too. "Oh whats the matter you don't think you can take a low level with your build?" (No buddy, I don't, it's a PVE build for carrying a ton of shit and battling mobs and bosses at range, not for fighting one prick at melee distance who's waving 3000dmg per hit in my face).
---
Heart of the swamp north of the crashed plane site at the bunker Xbox. What happens: Strangler Heart will close and never reopen. Ability to 1 shot kill the heart on the first round causing no enemies to spawn. Also sometimes the mirelurk queen or Grafton monster won't spawn either.
---
I tried, once, and it was a pretty cool day. I couldn't quite pull it off though, with the player attacks and the defend missions popping up.
---
I think a team of two could do this, if they were coordinated.
---
&gt;It should make players wanted...
---
Absolutely not. The plague walker mutation damages brahmin.
---
If you are wearing pocketed/deep pocketed armor and then enter power armor you can take a carry weight hit. 
---
I have all deep pocketed gear and my carry weight is a little over 350. When I get in my PA I'm at only 305.
---
sweet pic! i swear, the lighting is super gorgeous in this game sometimes.
---
Pre FO4 Fallout games seemed to have less realism.
---
The only time I felt any real survival element beyond a typical RPG was FO4 on Survival difficulty.
---
I found that joining a friends session who is playing before opening the home screen gets around it
---
Yes but a game of which majority of its followers being opposed to it being a multiplayer online title (which was still good, but lacking alot of narrative and substance), releases as a major part of its first dlc wave, survival PvP servers and now the second DLC wave will be focused around a battle royal mode.
---
Let's not forget the fact that so many people took advantage of Bethesda's bugs that they were too slow to respond to resulting it huge amounts of people duping and buying up the best of everything in the game.
---
So either the battle royal will allow people to use their own weapons/armor, in which case those who cheated will most likely always be on top.
---
Orrrr
---
We get a classic battle royal mode where you start from nothing, in which all the people with goods weapons and armor will be unhappy, and the rest will be unhappy because the graphics and mechanics will be much worse than even a free to play battle royal like Apex.
---
I use these in my house. Very strange to connect them but they do pass through walls, 2nd floors and roof pieces. Once you get the hang of it you'll appreciate them. You can place the pass through with the electrical conduit on either side of the wall. I like to place the conduit on the outside and let the copper pipes run throughout the house. Saves from having to repair them with the inevitable creature attack. 
---
The trick is to make sure it's as straight as possible. Because when you line your roof or floor with the connectors, they'll be all jacked up if your pass through is crooked. Mostly visual but in the event you want to get some lights on the hanging roof pieces on the outside, it's important to ensure your radiators are close enough.
---
it was in fo4...and yes, some could abuse it. but don't want to believe that there's no way for bethesda to find a way how to do it best. still...even a spawn outside, not too close to a building would already help. and again, to fix this seems to need just a simple fix.
---
Iv been joining since lvl 15 and I don't hide!!! Nor do i give 2 fucks about ammo. (I have over 1k 10mm and im never going to use it) ill grab my best shit and whatever else is im my box. 13 cocktails ok... 5 missiles.. Shoot em then drop the thing... I hotkey psycobuff and rush in to chop the face when it lands.
---
Dont tell me how to live my life! Also i make a point to pick up higher lvls.
---
I have yet to see less then 10 ppl at the queen amd many were happy to take a pic next to the body. I have never seen the queen fail either.... Didnt know that was a thing.
---
No it takes a lot longer to unlock all the best perk cards unless you completely ignore everything but combat perks and know exactly where to put all your special points in the first 50 levels. Most people don't fully polish their perks and special till maybe level 100-140 unless it's their second or third character.
---
Yes. They get annoyed and start smacking me with their power fists. Idiots.
---
thx
---
key word suggests
---
key words pvp focused
---
Is this a quote from south park?
---
Ikr. The amount of irrationality is insane.
---
Dude you're such a bitch.
---
High level enemies sometimes spawn as scorched variants, those are affected by the damage bonus. It destroys scorchbeasts pretty easily. Scorched by themselves appear all around the map. It's not bad, especially for weapons that use a common flux like fluorescent
---
Youre the only person I've seen mention the terrain bug, I'm on xbox and the ground turns bright white at night and the shadows and lighting are constantly screwing up (I'm not sure how to explain it but it's worse in  buildings) there are so many graphical glitches that have been present since the release of the game
---
Since November?
---
Too cool in the kitchen? Join the survival server today!
---
I dont know what to say, Im selling two dozen stimpacks a day, they drop from literally everything I do.
---
It is my opinion and mine onlyüòâ Everybody to there ownüòâ
---
I dipped into survival to get the Unstoppable Monster weekly weapon. I died twice (maybe 3 times I usually don‚Äôt keep count) and my supplies were decimated. I had over 100 stimpacks and purified waters, and lots of healing/alcohol/etc. and when I finally thought to check my inventory I had under 1/4 of my aid items, some completely wiped out. It‚Äôs pretty brutal how much you lose so try to travel light. I‚Äôm not complaining because I got the weapon and can replenish those supplies, but it would have be nice to know just how much you lose beforehand.
---
Sweet, finally found the interesting part of this topic!
---
Sorry. Had too many toxic annoying people in public chats in general to bother with public chat. Even a few annoying ones in fallout though it is less. As well as the person I play with is even much more closed minded than me about it. I‚Äôll do it sometimes when I‚Äôm not playing with him but I find a good chance at best no one talks to i end up remembering why I‚Äôm happier playing silent.
---
Not a mountain, but a small cliff face. He did build his camp a few stories up using staircases.
---
well i knew that but i actually thought that you can be  easily maxed out at lvl 70 thanks though
---
You're in their way.  They are impatient.  They have a game to play, and can't do it with you standing there.
---
I wish there was a way of putting all the jack asses into the same server, so the rest of us didn't have to endure them.  Maybe a reputation point system, where players get progressively limited to the servers they can play on.
---
If you follow the river from the nuka cola plant towards Charleston there's a couple of spots there you could build maybe. It's dried up and quite wide in places. There's even a bridge like this one that connects to a odd structure/trading post thing lol.
---
Theres a spot by the bottom middle of the map, problem is its really close to the fissure site down there. Its a bigger rock arch though
---
Lol i got downvoted ???
---
I am always WAY over encumbered because I am greedy and don‚Äôt want to drop anything. üòÇ
---
Nice pic! I've been doing the same thing, started a new character and am taking a pic of him every ten levels in nice locations and new gear so I can see how much I've progressed in the loading screens
---
No worries, I had to laugh myself. It was so random - I did my shopping (he had some pretty cool plans), and once I signed off of the terminal, WHOOOOSH. It launched my horizontally off the side of his CAMP, which was built up a couple stories on a short cliff face. Luckily it wasn't enough to kill me. Either way, I'd just stored my junk in his stash box so it wouldn't have been a huge loss.
---
I would love to encounter this.
---
Take me hooooooooome......
---
I lose weight too. From the backpack.
---
Make sure your generator is as sealed away as possible. 4 walls and a ceiling if possible. 
---
The less noise, the better. Also gotta make sure you're not on a literal natural spawn point and that you're dealing with CAMP spawn ins, not ambient stuff. 
---
One can he controlled, one is kinda your fault for setting up camp on an ant hill and getting upset when they bite, lol.
---
When I do kill them, I leave spoiled food behind. Go make fertilizer and boom it's back.
---
I thought I did once but the I realised I missed Mt Blaire. As I was travelling I got disconnected. I was doing it to farm plans
---
This is what I do to initiate PvP. Decline their trading requests, wait for the agro, and respond in kind with a vats crit to the noggin from my AAE lever action. 
---
Why are people so persistent when you obviously just want to get on with your business lol.
---
There's a place up around some mountain or cliff or something where there are these really cool traps built that have skeletons on them. These traps can be set off and they'll throw the skeletons off the cliff. It's super cool lol. I just wonder if that's where the CAMP was or if there's actually a way to do that ourselves lol
---
Just wait.  Eventually someone will drop a grenade and fast travel away.
---
Thankfully it is a minority of players that play this way.  Not sure why they even come into Adventure mode and not just stay in Survival .... likely because the Survival servers are largely empty with a few extremely high level players playing God in them.
---
I believe so.
---
Regulators don't have to make sense they just have to regulate enough to justify the existence of their job and to make their boss look good for voters. There's thousands of regulations on the books with unintended (or purposefully ignored) downsides that nobody is bothering to fix because they're appeasing a certain block of voters by keeping it like that.
---
Wow, that was enough to make me vomit lmao
---
True, but sometimes it's super awful too haha.
---
You will get attacked by scorchbeasts. I built there once before. Very cool spot if you can handle the annoyance.
---
Is this also why anything I try to place near my stairs automatically gets placed on the top floor instead?
---
Such a shame... I loved having the lead resource AND a secret cave with acid in it
---
I'm going to start leaving a mine suit breather and piece of fertilizer infront of her kiosk window for every bad item she gives me, cos that is just shit
---
Why does everything need a battle royale now I‚Äôd be happy to see NPCs return though
---
I so goddamn called it lololol
---
Source?
---
Farming the alien?
---
thanks for the reply buddy
---
No reason to re-read. You are not that hard to comprehend. You think because there is no monthly subscription that people don't spend money on the game and they have no income being generated. You couldn't be more wrong.
---
Yeah. I was surprised as hell when a friend popped into the silo and revived me. I wanted to see where I respawned. Probably would have respawned and drowned in the pond while the Yao Guai battered me
---
I found one in the metal box directly in front of the door to bivs tattoo parlour. Saw somebody had one listed for 3k the other day lol.
---
Low levels are the bait guys. This happened to me last night and he was really persistent. I checked the map and there was nobody else around, so I popped a berry mentat and there they were in the woodline lol.
---
Pretty much. That isnt pvp, that's rope a dope.
---
Usually a group of super mutants in the ash heap, bog, or mire areas will carry one. You can also buy plans to build them from some of the vendor bots. Player vendors will have them sometimes too. I sold a set of mini gun plans last week for 99 caps.
---
Why does every game need NPC's? Tetris was good without it.
---
If they gona do PVP mode right, it would definetly help comunity.
---
I‚Äôve been blessed to be able to play on an Xbox One X and 4K tv, so sometimes I literally just stop playing and look at the scenery
---
I'd really like to know myself. He had it perfectly calibrated to fall just enough for crippling limbs, but not enough for major damage. If he was trying to kill players who shopped at his store, I'd be upset about it, but this was more of a "Well, looks like you made it all the way through my base, let me help you get outta here"
---
Why would you even want to do that? There is no incentive at all.
---
Gulpers too. I got 2 from farming them Yesterday
---
He really has. Especially the follow ups are sick burns lol
---
If you are talking about the conduits, the ones that looks like pipes, you might be able to get them closer to the wall.
---
I'm going to talk about floors here, because you can move conduits sitting on a floor piece.  You would also use this method to adjust a ceiling level conduit but you would use the long U shaped conduit to get it to ceiling height once you have the spacing worked out.
---
1. Place your conduit and your connector normally, extend the conduit to an adjoining floor or foundation tile that is directly away from the wall using one of the long pieces.
---
2. Remove the walls, floors, roofs, above and below, where the conduit sticks out.  If the conduit is between two sections, then you need to remove the walls, floors, etc on both sides of it.
---
3. Remove the conduit sections up to the last piece sitting on the floor tile
---
4. You can now manually move the last conduit piece on the floor in a direction that reduces the distance to the wall. 
---
5. Add all of the conduit sections back in then the flooring and then the walls.
---
Shouldn't be too hard to test it. But I definitely remember my instigating crossbow being able to 1 bash enemies that I couldn't with other weapons
---
Same here but sometimes I will part with stuff if it's the lowest value.
---
I have, and it‚Äôs very tiring. The defend workshop seem to be non stop. Surprisingly in the 3+ hours I held them all not one PVP attempt all PVE. I can only assume other players saw it as such a brazen show of power/confidence that no one wanted to risk a challenge. 
---
I really wish I had screenshot it but at the time I did not think anyone would ever think it was a thing.  I did not start off thinking ‚Äúhey I should takeover every workshop‚Äù. It started with the three regular one I would take for plans lakeside cabins, wade airport, Charleston landfill. I took one additional after that and that‚Äôs where the madness started. The crazed drive to own them all was intoxicating. Owning them all felt incredible, however the defend workshop events started to come faster and faster.  But with 22 ( I believe that is all the workshops) what was I expecting. 
---
I might try and do it again just to get the screenshot since this is not the first time I‚Äôve seen it in discussions. I feel like it‚Äôs more of an achievement then I originally thought.
---
Hello Stinger-Lad!!!
---
Bragging rights, plus the resources obviously.
---
They literally are fixing it. That is why there are bug fixes every two weeks. The game has improved a lot since launch. Are you delusional? There have been many online games that have had bad launches that developers have put time and effort in to fix such as final fantasy 14 and elder scrolls online (a game published by bethesda)
---
Yes please add all of the above!
---
Dammit newbies, stop spawning level 28 trash mobs that are killing OP!  And dammit lowbie, stop hiding in the bunker where the trash mobs swarm you!  You should be outside getting hit by slap damage SBQ screams instead of being inside getting your face melted by acid strafes that ignore protection, or the trash mobs that run inside to get you.
---
If I got experience for walking slow I would be lvl 4,000 üòÇ
---
Oof
---
Doesn't seem like a real leak, we already knew all of this except for the battle royale, if this is even true
---
Maybe nvidia, on amd rx gpu here. Tarkov has issues with hyperthreading though [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofE43PjyElQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofE43PjyElQ)
---
Hyperthreading works fine here, but who knows it may help.
---
yeah i tried it with my instigating gauss rifle but wasnt sure at the end as i have low strength and the weapon has no mod to increase bash damage so its hard to tell a difference
---
There have been a few times I just wanna spar with a higher level. We both drop all our junk in stash and Duke it out. Most to lose is 5 caps? I lose more often then I win, and usually send a message asking about gear and perk load out, and of course a GG.
---
I don't like survival. Sometimes I want a low stakes sparring match lol
---
That‚Äôs a nice idea! I wouldn‚Äôt mind seeing a collage or something whenever you end up stopping that
---
No people want it. I made a post a few months back. Had 2000ish upvotes and hit front page. People def want em, they are also afraid of being spawned in a prison
---
It's actually been added to the quest notifications now, but is very far from obvious still. For a start it comes after the notification to go to VTU.
---
I feel like I'm the only one who keeps getting God tier weapons from the purveyor. I use alts to maximize my daily scrip and I have gotten some siiiick drops such as (all 3 star weapons) BE pump action that was level 15, furious explosive Gatling gun, furious explosive mini gun, furious explosive sub machine gun, countless quad explosives. These are just off the top of my head and in the last week.
---
I love the purveyor and she loves me ‚ù§Ô∏è
---
Is it a slap in the face? Come on you wanna say it lol
---
I thought I was the only one. Good on you fellow cowpatriate
---
It's popular right now with a certain player base, that ordinarily wouldn't buy FO76.
---
I just hope its a fad that will eventually go away when people get bored.  It is boring, so I have hope it will happen soon.
---
Actually, they hit the trade emote also. So not necessarily the jump button.
---
you can get the plan as a rare random reward from biv‚Äôs daily quest at the tattoo parlor
---
That‚Äôs too bad ..  Someone is selling fallout 76 for Xbox where I live for 16 bucks lol
---
Gauss maybe?
---
If there‚Äôs no Starfield news, I‚Äôll declare the game literally unplayable. üôÇ
---
Okay see I thought there was a difference. A few of my weapons see a difference but I thought maybe I was recollecting incorrectly. Even some weapons with hardened receivers do more damage with Prime receivers.
---
So it is an issue, imo
---
Ah. Then yes, it's weird :P
---
Landview lighthouse. Camden park. Giant  teapot 
---
. Mila cola plant lobby.uncanny caverns.tyler county fairgrounds.point pleasant mothman museum. Ohio river adventures.phillipi graveyard. Whitesprings.miner monument.palace of the winding path
---
52 players on the Creation Engine? Very unlikely. Definitely fake.
---
Because those morons can‚Äôt survive in survival, when others are sporting the same duper armors and explosive weapons.
---
If true, the NPCs are there to appease the longstanding loyal FO fans, and the backlash that will likely follow an announcement of BR in FO76.
---
Give the loyals something they want, perhaps they will forgive Bethesda for adding something intended completely to expand the player base.
---
&gt;/l Is local and restricted to your server, the range should be the whole server not 100m

---
&gt;Melee is already op. My build is far from perfect and I two-shot or one shot most of the mobs, aside from the cryptids (gulpers, anglers etc) with a not perfect weapon.
---
Maybe you should two-shot or one shot most of the mobs.
---
You get one by doing the quest the first time for free. Afterwards the only way to get it is by purchasing it from a vendor bot.
---
Ugh these puns are soooo radicool
---
Free fast travels across the map.
---
That's a deal!! Holy cow!
---
I think some dataminer said that the lunch boxes were supposed to be free atom shop gifts for christmas that never ended up getting released. That post was from a while ago though, I doubt I could find it again
---
the best spots are super mutant camps and fissure sites.  
---
poopiles and dead deatchclaws at the fissure sites.

meatbags at the camps.

best bang for your buck imo

Mule accounts are actually bad.

Maybe it's on a smaller map as it was filtered some time ago

Reddit in Motion isn't following the karma train and just being direct. Nothing wrong with not trying to whore out for karma and a lot of people dislike pvp so much they made it a separate server, personally I agree with him I shouldn't be forced to praise Bethesda for new content I dislike when it will force me to pvp to get all the content in game(The location for pvp start is similar to Modus and locks rooms till you met certain ranks) especially when I bought Tricentennial edition on pre order.
---
I can't stand walking slow
---
Just kidding mate. Already tryed to shut down your platform complete and start again? Often helps.
---
Best is maybe send a ticket to Beth.
---
It is a fantastic idea, but it seems the creative team has ideas that aren't necessarily in line with what players want. They think something is cool, they work on it and hope the players like it. They aren't doing terribly in this regard tbh
---
Yes but atleast you get something, If i see a player and want to contact him/her i literally have no other way of doing that other then local voice chat.
---
I never understood the brahmin pen thing if you put one down does a brahmin spawn and stick around ?
---
I've done it a few times actually. It's not too difficult, especially if you run with a squad, and it let's you farm loot from the defends, and fast travel across the map at any given time for free, as well as the materials, ammo, food, and other things they make. It's worth the headache, especially if you aren't solo.
---
They did have fast travel mats initially but probably removed it cause people were misusing them to spawn others into traps or other weird spots. Instead they need to just spawn people at a safe spot just outside of the camp
---
 Runs fine on my PC. What have you got?
---
Yep did the same thing. Wouldn't register. I'm finding with several photo challenges, I have to relog the whole game before things will register.
---
I know right I was just as surprised when I saw it . But I already have it soo I don‚Äôt need it lol
---
I think last year, if you dropped the chassis it was gone for good. Nice to see it's in a bag now. I lost the free raider chassis doing that.
---
I returned to F76 after some month and as far as I could remember back then I had my complete layout camp in one piece. That was convenient.
---
Now with my whole camp split into 1x1 tiles is anyoing and I really don't want to put time and effort into build my camp just to reassemble each tiles seperatly after I place my C.A.M.P. This kills my motivation completely make me only build the benches on plain ground...
---
I can't imagine this is intended or has this been introduced with a patch.
---
Momma got junk in that trunk son
---
Not sure if this leak is real, but the increased number of players sounds interesting, perhaps it will eventually also be feasible in the other modes?
---
Thats great thank you.
---
Ill go poop hunting haha
---
I suspect you are right.  They advocate for more and more PvP, and expansions of Survival, but only want to play if they can get easy PvP wins.  Which they can't, because they are morons.  And the cycle goes on.
---
Game was pretty empty on launch actually, can you honestly say you would ask for a vanilla server before all the dlcs like Warcraft. I was done with all the quests within a few weeks and ended grinding all day at  Monster Mash event.
---
Source or gtfo
---
I've just never been one for stories in videogames really, always found them horribly written and cheesy (with a few exceptions), that plus the repetitiveness of the quest made it a groanfest
---
And whenever I dd pay attention enough to catch some of the dialogue it made em roll my eyes , the overseer sounds like an old granny but she's a mary sue, one man armying it through the wasteland
---
I doubt it. One of the Inside the Vault articles spoke about Team Death Match and I believe that's what Nuclear Winter will be. I'm also 100% sure they'll not discuss Wastelanders now. I'm also sure they won't put NPC humans in the game because they'll get killed constantly and making them immortal line speakers is no different from addition of a new robot.
---
Backpacks, pocketed armour... I recommend calibrated shocks and motion assist servos.
---
Ahh good old double standard discrimination.
---
Fuck anyone who is deaf or mute, you don't matter apparently.
---
This has to be the stupidest shit i have read in my life.
---
Pro tip to help cover that spot untill they fix it-  You can cover the hole up with rugs by placing them and stacking them on top of each other
---
76 is a gem
---
Sorry mate, but you're just gonna be told that it was your fault because you dropped it.
---
I have 580 outside of PA and barely 300 in PA it‚Äôs your gear
---
I did point pleasant
---
yeah I figured to be honest. Was hoping someone had a spare they could give me or something.
---
You lie
---
Oh I see all my armor is pocketed and in wearing a backpack. I thought I read the backpack would work in PA
---
I always thought they‚Äôre all female, but a poster told me there are males but their male parts fell off due to radiation ü§Æ
---
I have TSE handmades and gausses, but i dont initiate combat, i just close myself in a lvl 1 locked room and when they open the door, i walk out, close and repeat. Normally get about 20 extra caps üëå
---
Oh there had best be starfield. There. Had. Best.
---
I get better drops from 3\* legendary enemies in the wild than I have at White Springs (Nuke event or not) and the new vendor.
---
For example, I went to New Tek the other day, first time in a long while, for a Super Mutant horde event.  Ran into a 3\* Super Mutant that dropped a really nice 3\* Vanguard Chest piece for me.
---
All of my current legendary weapons have been drops from legandaries in the wild.  
---
Maybe it's just the Devs telling us to go out and explore more and stop farming White Springs....
---
Mark my words. Built in text chat will be cancer, like it is in every single other online RPG with an economy.
---
I've seen gauss plans being sold in watoga
---
Yeah I think it is, I believe the description even says superior damage which isnt obviously true all the time
---
Hard reset the whole pc. After the third time it is working as intended. But what doesnt make sense it was just Fo76. Not Tarkov or Monhun or isaac. Just Fo76.
---
 If i can recreate it ill leave a response here on how it happens
---
I don't know, im here for a new take on post apocalyptic. I want more things to do and rebuild, to try to bring society back, not just kicking over everyone's sandcastles for fun.
---
Thanks all, yeah its pocketed armor and backpack causing the loss.
---
It really is. The glitches keep me in stitches
---
What platform are you on? I can show you how to fix it personally if you on pc. All those damage resistance perks are useless go for damage reduction instead. Especially fireproof
---
LIES.

It's a reward from some weekly challenge:

Its gonna be a while before I'm able to put them together into a collage only level 15 atm lol
---
Hello there purveyor... not falling for this old trick.
---
you still pay.  they get no caps.
---
From the build linked, I would add Bloody Mess (because of how the math works, it's better than it sounds), Makeshift Warrior (Better mods but, more importantly, make the weapon last longer), and if you're going for pure melee, consider swapping a couple points off of one of the sluggers for Full Charge (because running eats the hell out of FC's, so it's this or carry an epic shit ton more of them, but this last one is just my opinion)
---
Yeah there's been nothing but good deeds form the high-level players since I started, met a guy last week who kitted me out with a ton of end game loot and gave me a bunch of serums, told me which perks to stack them with, even gave me an explosive gatling gun
---
Then there was some lvl 400 dude who dropped me like 200 stims and radaway
---
Honestly the community in this game is so wholesome
---
You probably scrapped it by mistake at the Legendary Token machine.
---
 You're much better off learning how to make serums, or even 5.56 ammo if you're after caps.
---
Originally it was going to, but not.
---
Sorry, they‚Äôre asshole griefers and pussies, not badasses just trying something new.
---
Worthy inclusion, I never used the legendary token machine though. That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so bizarre about this situation.
---
Nah, I‚Äôm on Xbox. So I just just stay with the sentinal assassin and unyielding cav sets instead?
---
Bloodied has an overall DPS advantage, especially if you go full on bloodied. Problem is - if a fly hits you in the face you might need a stimpak.
---
I haven't played much with AA though so I can't say a whole lot about that one.
---
Happened to me too. So i deleted all the poles and cables, when i replaced them it was fine
---
Most I have had at same time was 4-5 and the defense events drove me insane lol. Middle of doing one and another crops up
---
I found it on Twitter [here](https://twitter.com/New_WabiSabi), but I do not know if there is another source this is based on.
---
Mama murmrgh gave me less than a handful of usable items out of dozens of trash. By trash I mean stalker‚Äôs RPG with bashing kind of trash. Oh and the assaultron heads turned into no-star with also bashing damage. She‚Äôs really into bashing I can tell.
---
What can you not unlock until 70?
---
&gt;It basically forces all game makers with text chat options to provide a service of text-to-speech. That's... not easy to do accurately enough to satisfy the law in the USA (not to mention other parts of the world with their own take).
---
Microsoft has a text to voice program built into it. It wouldn't be difficult for them to hook into that program and use it for the text to speech.
---
\&gt;12 camps on the map selling the same shit for half of the price
---
"hah, these peasants are simply too poor to afford my wares"
---
that would be something i'd already be happy about
---
It does happen. Especially if there is a high levelled character near you. I would suggest asking someone on here to help escort you through it. Plenty of high levels like myself wouldn't mind. Just make sure you post platform.
---
I leave any server where a player holds more than 2 workshops. Don't feel like playing with greedy people and don't want them having access to my low priced wares. Also i find the more workshops captured on a server the worse it runs.

Ugh, what is this game becoming. At this point it's basically Rust, with an optional PvE mode, and now because Fortnight was a thing they've gotta do that too...... Next thing you'll know, they'll take a page from Activision, and add in pay to win loot boxes with abysmal drop rates like they did in Blades. Bethesda needs to take a serious step back  and think about what they are doing. The recent interview with Todd already makes it look like the leadership there is either completely clueless as to what we want, and what their sales actually look like, or they are utterly disconnected from reality. Chasing trends is a fast way to kill your reputation, and as it stands now, it's already hurting. They need to go back to the good old days, when their games were buggy as fuck but had heart, and soul that made us keep playing them regardless. Back when a Bethesda game was guaranteed to be a game of the year, and when we would cry tears of nerdy joy to hear they would be at E3.
---
Not so good at reading comprehension huh? Stash box is not limited to one player at a time.
---
What's so wrong with mules? Actually, more importantly, what do mules have to do with this suggestion?? I think it would help when one character doesn't even use ammo that another character could use.
---
not gonna lie, i love it
---
as is, i think i'm gonna settle for "bloody organ cooler"
---
It's one of the dumbest implementations of foundational content, and certainly the dumbest of this game.  It should spawn on every players first visit to any of the locations Ansel could be at, so the quest can begin immediately.  The way it is, if it wasn't for doing out of game research or noticing the bazillion camera daily's you could play the game normally and never come across Ansel, ever.
---
FO76 makes server hopping and internet wiki help a mandatory part of their game.  They have normalized server hopping as an expectation.
---
52 on a map? In this engine? With these servers? That is really hard to believe.
---
I have an instigating dragon with +40% bash dmg.
---
And i can confirm
---
That i haven't got a clue.
---
How is it greedy if no one else wants them? If someone does want them they can challenge for it, which is going to pretty easy for someone distracted by 21 other workshops.
---
if so, even better...to me, would like to see it and doubt it should be a problem to make it so that you also spawn safe. but whatever they do, right now all i would like it to not just end up stuck anymore^^
---
You're right. People assume and say, it's definitely like this.
---
No-one at all has posted getting it. And the datamining shows it was connected to a weekly challenge that never seemed to release.
---
That's when you fix that mutation, and still .ake fucking with someone's camp make them wanted.
---
What confounds me is the inconsistency between My CAMP, and Other People's CAMPs for the fast travel location.
---
If I fast travel to someone's CAMP, I will, every time, be spawned in the center of their build circle, regardless of anything is occupying that space already or not and regardless of the CAMP's location on the map/proximity to other map markers.
---
When I fast travel to My CAMP, I'm always spawned at the spawn point for the fast travel marker for Big Fred's BBQ, which is about 50 feet down the road from the *edge* of my build circle.
---
There was a lvl 15 in the bunker for me, afk too. Lured one of the scorched into there.
---
They did this so you buy atoms instead of earning them easily. I'm not even wearing a tin foil hat, I just truly belive that.
---
I have xbox I'd buy it just to have on there too. Lol
---
Just like how br is optional in fortnite, right?
---
It takes Razorgrain, and produces fertilizer.
---
Are these weapons account or character based because I could grind it again on another character
---
Don‚Äôt forget hearing the guy sitting 2 feet from a fan set on high.
---
No it happens... I think I have things all the time I dont have cuz you can see them in the build screen for whatever reason.. just cant build em.. 70% of the wall mounts
---
Now that was a really horrible comment, no one and I mean no one will be asking for Vanilla version of this game like World of Warcraft. Most fans still bought game knowing they would FINISH making the game later and kept grinding for levels after finishing all the quests in 3 weeks.
---
AA on melee is pretty trash, you already get 75% penetration from incisor and then more from some attachments. It's much better to have bloodied or even junkie's, maybe instigating if it's a slower weapon. Hell, even a mutant slayer's or whatever prefix of enemy you fight the most would be more useful than AA...unless for whatever reason you're running a low strength melee build and don't have room for incisor
---
Account based I‚Äôm afraid
---
I have a theory that theres a couple downvote bots running here, leftovers from launch where youtubers were making good money off how bad the game and community was doing.  Like a Liberatir in Appalachia, they're still here fighting a war that's long over.
---
Nooooo
---
Buy a bloodied dcg ?
---
WHERE IS OUR MYSTERY PICK???? is cuz someone made a post with MATH to show the mystery pick would be the best every time then we didnt get it.. WTF mate??
---
I suppose. This one just had the best perks
---
I just find it tough spawning at a camp built over a cliff and falling to my death, or great injury.
---
Me too!  I wonder how they did it
---
Definition of greed. Intense and selfish desire for something, especially wealth, power, food, or workshops.
---
I dont get it either, come to camp check vendor,request trade a million times then act as if im suppose to sell my gear im wearing when I do open trade. How bout a simple msg? Most players that talk with me or ask for what they want do infact get what they want. But alas, it is the wasteland.....guess its the things should be
---
Great! We‚Äôll see you in the wasteland!
---
There's a few of these mystery camp items. Beer kegs, wall mounts, pioneer squirrel banner.
---
We already have NPCs in the game, plenty of them. I don't know what all the crying is about
---
You're welcome. It definitely needs to be fixed.
---
There are dcg with same perks bud
---
I have 5 missle turrets, 1 heavy laser, 1 shotgun turret, and 2 spotlight turrets. It does the job with repairs. I leave my camp running while in Arktos and a lot of times when I come back- with all the traffic been through and it held, no repairs. I did have a couple guys pull into my camp but it was wall repairs nothing major. Lost a vending machine early on but I fixed that re positioning the turrets.
---
The generator gets blown from time to time though, sometimes a random mob doesn't come down and pot shots.. Over time the generator gets it, it's cheap to repair.
---
How is intentionally being spawned in a trap worse than what we have now? If someone has a stupid camp setup, fast travel away and don‚Äôt buy their stuff. 
---
I‚Äôve been to hundreds of camps and haven‚Äôt seen an intentional trap house. I‚Äôve been stuck many times because of bad spawn points though.
---
Some of those mods are acquired by scrapping your Plasma Gatling. I really hated to do that but I did it several times it took about 10 of them. If you're on Xbox I can probably improve it for you, all that's required are the materials.
---
What the hell was that?
---
It's not fun because you are doing it that way
---
Honestly, I hear you and if I followed the 'server hop' mode of camera acquisition, I'd be frustrated as well. That's why I get everything done without this server hopping business.
---
I have three characters and all three got the camera by normal playing. I knew from the first camera I found where some of the spawn points are, I simply played the game and when near a spawn point, a quick check for his/her corpse.
---
Grinding out Tadpole/Possum badges on more than one toon, now that is some real pain!
---
Hey man, you do you. I was never that interested in becoming a merchant so the, comparatively, low turnover doesn't bother me. My standpoint is that whatever I'm selling took some effort/expense to obtain, and the game is easy enough without handouts, so ain't nobody getting nothing for free. The stash space is a fair point, but fortunately not too much of a problem as most of my stuff is plans, stims, and a few of the rarer outfits. Never had much luck with getting decent legendary weapons or armour, alas.
---
Twinking is also bad.
---
I agree.  You are not very good a reading comprehension.  
---
Read the entire post, maybe you will figure out that the opening sarcasm wasn't the main point.   Maybe you will, but I doubt it.
---
Where we droppin' boys?
---
Why is everyone after them at the moment? Lol.
---
Stash box would only hold 1/3 of that. Perks don‚Äôt apply to the stash box.
---
White springs
---
Just try a few server hops. I had the same issue with this quest, specifically with the Super Mutants and later with the Wendigo cave. I was only around level 30, but the enemies spawning in were level 60+
---
It would be nice if all your carry weight stuff still applied in PA, but I guess our characters strip off all their clothes when getting into PA.
---
If you like battle royale try Fortnite, if you like to do it on Fallout you might need to power lvl to build a pvp only build to equip all the new pvp perk cards(check the datamine or wait till later today).
---
Lol. Really. I don‚Äôt need to haul shit around anymore. Just what I need and use.
---
thanks man you helped me out a lot :D
---
I'm so onboard.
---
How about it not expire when it‚Äôs marked for sale? Then continue the timer when someone buys it.
---
Even if it is real, there was a post from some drama queen every 15 minutes about it, don't even bother pretending you had some lone wolf prediction lmao
---
PS4, add MoonlightCowboy
---
If someone who is under level 50 does the challenges do they get the level 50 unstoppable or will it be based around there level
---
There's nothing wrong with shoveling a little shit. All in good pun.
---
White Springs? You got a deathwish, or something, Mal? Everybody's gonna go there.
---
Honestly, how many serums have you sold at that price? I sell mine for 250, and they sell like hot cakes. I don't care about selling them to the vendor as I never have a problem maxing my vendor caps for the day. One run of uranium fever or west tek picking up absolutely everything in sight and I won't even be able to sell it all to the vendor. I always wear a full suit if unyielding when I do my shopping to ensure I gain max caps from vendors.
---
I like the melon juice. A little slow but gets the job done.
---
Question about building and scrapping for mods... Do you have to build and fully modify a gun/ scrap it to get new mods?  Or can you just build and scrap the base gun only?
---
Yea true I can‚Äôt wait for more fallout things lol
---
Last night when i went to a vendor i heard shooting, looked around and seen the final shot from a super mutant into someones beloved cow that was charging at the mutants. Moral of the story, not all cow deaths are player related. 
---
In all seriousness though, get rid of the brahmin pen. Its a waste of a GIANT part of your camp budget and brahmin can easily be found in flatwoods if you ever need milk. I was shocked at how much budget that thing takes up.
---
agree. just another proof we need a fix :_)
---
Just your average day in Appalachia https://imgur.com/gallery/R0C2KuO
---
What about Tilted Vaults?
---
True , but i meant its only a regular dcg with a name, you can one of someone with same perks . Even name it if you want
---
Well, it's certainly better than White Springs.
---
Tis everyone else who has the deathwish.
---
Greasy!
---
Look, you go there if you want, but don't be on my ass once you get gunned down.
---
yes.
---
I think I just found someone who will gift me one
---
Same to OP, I‚Äôm tired of this, Bethesda please fix!!!
---
So, some of us aggro cows just by standing next to them, and then they try to kill us, so we have to kill them first, or we have to run away. IF you want people to buy at your camp, you are going to need to fence in your Brahmin, or when I spawn in, it's going to attack me, due to my mutation, for some reason it bothers the cow. All I have to do is be near it.
---
No offense but no one is buying them for 750. The most I'm willing to pay is 250. I got a connect that sells them to me for 100-150 and I just resell for 250.
---
I mean, whats to say i wont be doing the gunning
---
Ok, that works also
---
Haha, definitely
---
Eh, zI have a ton of TSE, AAE, BE, and FE items that would make me hit the 25k limit if I ever put any of them in my actual vendor.
---
Personally I believe nothing wrong with people being negative about a game when they paid for it so they deserve their opinions to be heard even if they don't want to have content blocked from them since they can't pvp(just a heads up new location is like Modus where you need certain ranks to access certain new areas).
---
Nothing
---
Hmm that must be new since I used it last. Might have to give it another try.
---
Sorry to hear it man, but I think the only thing to blame is your luck. In the last 2 weeks I've gotten a; 3* quad explosive railway, 3* furious faster fire railway and a 3* anti armor explosive Railway. Aswell as other pretty morsels in the past such as a be pipe rifle.
---
I think you need to do some voodoo and wipe away your curse or something.
---
The idea is to limit the stash to only characters on the same account.  None of which I am using as mules at this time.  I just want to be able to use resources/items that I find on one of my characters on another.  It kind of takes away some of the grind and repetition of leveling a new toon to try a new build.
---
A furious faster fire rate, vats crit handmade, and an AAE lever action. 
---
It has to be connected to what is in your stash, as I have at least five of each of those weapon types in there. I wanted a pipe revolver, so I stuffed six in there, and lo and behold......two shot pipe revolver the next time I visited her.
---
i heard about that from a friend and can't believe it. it's just sad, when someone needs to do something like that to make himself feel better or prove a point.
---
You dong like white springs huh
---
10-4! Thanks again!
---
Not very surprising, the one unexpected news is the increased number of players in NW mode. I wonder if this will also be implemented in Adventure and/or others later?
---
You have a better chance of landing a quadruple axel, without any skates might I add, then making it out of White Springs, alive, and solo.
---
The mutation needs to be addressed first.
---
Cool
---
Another game mode I have zero interest in
---
No, because I for one care about my survival.
---
Be glad to, but I'm on PC!
---
Is it legendary?
---
I'm doing it because after leveling this character 85 levels since the camera release I have not stumbled across it. I've given up on farming atoms because of it and have missed out on a bunch of cool atom shop stuff. I just want to get the damn thing and call it a day.
---
I thought it was a good representation of all the cry babies
---
I'm new, pacifist. What's the deal with people incessantly Xbox messaging me to join their party while I'm a train station?
---
I never do it because it seems sketchy, but I thought a vet might be able to tell me what their motivations are.
---
If it's not legendary, I'd really doubt someone is going to buy it. It's not rare or anything.
---
Definitely not dead. 
---
Guys stirring up shit in adventure suck in survival (pvp) so they come to pve.
---
Most if not all of the guys that do that are trash players, and couldn‚Äôt make it in pvp with no restrictions so prefer to mess with guys in pve.
---
I enjoy survival servers, and am in the top 1% of players ranking wise.
---
As I mentioned before, the fact camps are indestructible is bullshit, and you see guys exploiting that fact. It‚Äôs watered down survival servers imho. 
---
There should also be a daily/weekly/monthly reward that is separate from the legendary weapon everyone can get.
---
Currently, there is no reward for staying in the top 3 for an extended period of time (I.e. surviving) except for bragging rights.
---
Plasma caster; wattz lazer rifle; bozar; PPK12 gauss pistol; desert eagle; 14mm pistol. 
---
In particular the pistols, really. As that's a class in desperate need of a buff for the later levels.
---
Okay, yeah I get that.
---
NPC's good. Another watered down, badly implemented PVP shitshow bad.
---
Damn you. You're getting my loot! That Gatling was wished for my me and was given to you in error.
---
Can't agree more!! I find myself running for dear life the second I spawn.  That way I have a chance.  Is their any rhyme or reason now for a spawn point?? I feel like when I spawn to my own camp, it's a whole different point when visitors spawn there.
---
I call her 'Warblegarble' lol.
---
So she finally gave me something awesome. After spending about 3000 scrip so far. I got a 3 star DC gauntlet that is wrecking the shit out of everything. LOVE IT. HELL man I saw the SBQ's health go down as I was meleeing her on the shnozz the other day.
---
I log in and focus on 1) doing what daily quests seem reasonable to me, and 2) working towards the tadpole and eventually opossom badges (PC MrBright01, hit me up and I'll take a dive for you).
---
Rifle wise, outside of bloody or sneak attack builds, rifles can be underwhelming. I actually ended up playing and enjoying a heavy weapons build for a bit, and now I'm running amok with an axe and a desire for murder. For maximizing damage on rifles, all I can reccomend is 1) make sure you have Bloody mess and the rifle armor penetration perk, whatever it is called, and 2) carry something with a better rate of fire for when you can't one shot it with a sniper/long range rifle.
---
Armor wise, that's heavily dependent on gameplay style, and it's all survival focused if you're not going to Bloody Cheese. I roll with an Powered (AP refresh) set, because my rifle character is slowly becoming an autorifle character with a VATS emphasis. Chameleon for stealth (and there is a secondary "better sneak" legendary effect as well, not to mention armor mods for stealth as well). Vanguard can give you better overall armor for the initial hits, useful if you're planning on keeping at range and only need to take one or two shots.
---
Weapon wise, if you want one shot one kill look for Instigating hunting or lever. For non-sniping, Anti-Armor and/or Explosive works well.
---
Thanks everyone for your feedback. Luckily the chassis was not deleted and is in my camp
---
My camps built ontop of the mountains.  Sometimes I'll spawn inside the mountain.  In my opinion it's not really a problem, I'll just fastravel back to my camp and IM at my front step.  It's a small inconvenience to pay to have such a nice camp spot tbh
---
Im confused as to why you dont think white springs is a good drop. Hot drops are great for getting used to things quickly.
---
Still, if you didn't know Ansel should be at one of those spots (need to do internet research to know), you wouldn't go out of your way to look.  Without repeated visits to places that have no reason to go to (some no real quest related reason to go to ever), the RNG could make it extremely unlikely that you ever see him, or interact with him even if you do (no indication you should interact with yet another dead/skeletal body.
---
Personally, I found server hopping to be the least frustrating way or getting started, though 40+round trip jumps to point pleasant/2 other close locations was frustrating enough.
---
The Tadpole/Possum challenges, so long as you know what you are supposed to be doing, and have a camera early, about 90% of the tasks will just happen naturally during game play.  But you need to have the "to do" list early enough to not forget to take the photos of the locations as you get to them, and scrap whatever, make whatever, do whatever while you are there etc.
---
Thank you anyway!
---
If you don't want valuable items to get lost occasionally...
---
Don't play 76. This has been happening since launch and they've shown pretty much zero interest in fixing it.
---
to be fair, i've surprised lvl 100+'s with my lvl 60-70 melee toon and absolutely destroyed them when they decided to attack back. i've only done it to people who took my workshops before i was able to get back in time to catch them flagged. its always funny to watch them panic after the first hit or two lands at full damage when they werent really expecting a hard fight
---
It‚Äôs appalling the state of this game.  I only paid 1/3 new cost and it still is not worth it.
---
Hey, I don't care if you're low level and participate in an event. I just said that most people don't care the experience of others while doing some events. Also, the more people take the Pylons, the better. Thank you :)
---
Oh definitely. Just pretty upset
---
It's meant for players who are between levels 20 and 25, I've only ever found this gun thrice in Appalachia.
---
THEY JUST SHIPPED AN HOUR AGO WHERE THE FUCK IS MY BAG YOU CUCKS!?
---
Yeah, but you're forgetting the fact that:
---
1. Everyone will fucking go there.
---
2. If you aren't one of the first people to land, you aren't gonna get much fucking loot.
---
And 3. We aren't trying to get used to things, we're trying to fucking win.
---
So if I make my coffee so hot it gives you 3rd degree burns upon touch do you not deserve to complain? Also third degree is quite serve its the ones the lady who sued McDonalds got.
---
Watered down, badly implemented?? Have you seen literally anything in the way of gameplay. How on earth an you come up with these assumptions
---
That was nerfed before launch.
---
I am basing my assumption about future PVP modes based on the current PVP mode, which is a badly implemented shitshow.
---
Best deal was the old man winter effigy plan for 100 caps. Worst seen was, well so many lol
---
Look at your hands. The character's skin clips through the gloves constantly. The apron isn't really animated....
---
But the gloves. :'(
---
And that‚Äôs a shame but doesn‚Äôt mean console users wouldn‚Äôt also benefit greatly from the system.
---
I love how some br hating edgelord down voted these comments lmao fucking cucks
---
To be fair game is pretty buggy, most players on xbox can't enter into new dungeon without crash and a lot of players don't wanted to be forced to pvp to unlock all the game content. (New location has doors you can't enter intill you get the right ranks similar to Modus)
---
I've seen the trade emote automatically show when I acidentally started a trade request.
---
I understand that, but it's a very niche market you're trying to appeal to. Good luck
---
Just this week I moved into the acid cave. It‚Äôs only ok. It‚Äôs a lot of effort to build and dancing around the constant scorchbeast. 
---
As for bridging a canyon, I haven‚Äôt been there in months but I feel there is a canyon leading roughly north of  the toxic valley jail towards Grafton dam.
---
So fucking what, stop being a wimp...everyone used to drop school or military island in pubg, does that stop me or others dropping there and winning, no. Hot drops are fun. Apex has them,blackout had them. You sound like the type of dude to land somewhere remote and camp in a room the whole game...
---
&gt;I remember when the game was announced everyone thought that there was going to be a big problem w grieving
---
Huh...freudian slip?? LMAO
---
But seriously,  I've played every fallout as they launched, way back to the original,  and I'm still having fun in FO76...and I've stilled nor explored everywhere,  marked and unmarked,  but I will one of these days!
---
Well, how do you like to play?
---
Are you an assassin, sneaking in to kill the 3* boss and then vanishing again? Then bloodied. But you might die if something sees you or catches you.
---
Are you a tank, impossible to take down, up in everything's face? Then AA, Instigating or Furious.
---
Are you a speed killer, blazing through shit and not stopping until the next group of enemies? Instigating or AA if you play full health, bloodied if you have the build to survive.
---
Do you sit under the SBQs arse dealing sneak attacks until she's dead? Bloodied. You're probably using a meathook and not a 2-h weapon, although this can be done with a SS.
---
With Incisor and armor pen perks, there are few reasons to take AA over bloodied or instigating (for short fights) or furious (for longer fights....I can't think of any but SBQ, and then you're better bloodied).
---
100% my guy
---
This was great. I just read that certain modifiers cap at certain percentages so trying to over power a certain effect could result in wasted effort. I didn't think about that perk card. If I were to do a hardcore melee build I would for sure be using that perk card so that answer my question. thank you.
---
No I mean they‚Äôll do it from a distance.
---
People spawn at one location in my camp while I spawn at another location when traveling to my camp.   So the game is clearly tracking two locations.   Why they can't just have people spawn at the same place that I spawn at is beyond me.
---
Hmm, i was waiting for raids, hopefuly they will be  shown too.
---
Whatever hapens, fallout 76 won't be same game ad it was in beta.
---
Youre better off selling it to a vendor lmao
---
YouTube a guy called CaptainNoob, and he has an OP stealth commando build that doesn't have to rely on being bloodied, but it helps. 
---
Just rinses everything lol.
---
I don't necessarily disagree, but they both need dealt with.
---
Or better yet, remap Q to V where it belongs! üëçüòÇ
---
From my experience of running that daily is that those two are pretty rare. Cranberry booze and that bellini one are pretty rare for me also.
---
If you keep loading back into the game and trying to go up immediately, and then crash. Try waiting outside the area for like 5 minutes before using the elevator. That's how I fix that when I get the repeated crashing problem when entering places.
---
Its alright they forcing regular players who don't want to pvp to pvp if they want to unlock new location like they make you do questline with Enclave to unlock the rooms.
---
Bloodied for low health build. Junkies for high health build. AA on a *proper* 2h melee build will be basically useless- with Incisor, and how much base damage you should be doing, you should be ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù their armor anyway and thus AA won‚Äôt be doing anything.
---
So... we shouldn't do anything about the existing duped items, because duping could happen again in the future? Not really a compelling argument. Item cap increase would clearly clean out much of the old broken legacy stuff that is duped like crazy. Just because something might happen in the future is no reason not to deal with the problem we know we have now. 
---
Raised item cap is a solution, no matter how unwanted it is.
---
Yup
---
I play a Stealth VATS Commando (Bloodied)   
---

---
I totally see that. That‚Äôs one of those situations where a mic comes in handy. Or I keep mine in my stash and advertise on the 76 market.
---
I looj at it like this, adventure carry all you need cause with perks i can carry way more ammo, junk, aid then i could ever store. But it survival, which forces a choice ( and a good one at that) carry very little ( forces us to play different i.e. we go back to "survival" mentality) what risk should I take? Are 10 stims going to last me? Or do i risk losing 20? Well cant keep food/ water on me as much. Guess ill have to keepan eye out for things to kill omw to where im going. Oh crap! Billybob just oneshotted me! Should I fight and risk more? Or head back to base/ another area? These are the things that should concern us in a SURVIVAL mode. Its all about risk vs reward and youve got to understand where your accomplishments come from. If its for awsome drops while risking nothing then adventure is that. If its from facing bigger odds, facing bigger dangers, unfair pvp fights and fair pvp fights all while risking more of your loots. Then i think they got it going in the right direction, its beta dont forget that guys. The only thing id change is NO ONE shows on the map ever.

---
We have plenty of NPCs
---
Uny/Sent is okay for Bloodied Ranged but if you want to mitigate damage, try looking for Bolstering/Sentinel
---
the problem is it could be a lot better, if they can manage to fix most of the things that is actually annoying players.
---
This isn't fucking PUBG, this isn't fucking Apex, this isn't fucking Blackout, this is fucking Fallout 76.
---
Haha dont be sorry. I enjoy battle royale. I understand it doesn't need tobe everywhere but if it makes sense and is implemented well aswell as being fun,im all for it.
---
No thank you, good thing this is already de-confirmed as all the Vaults have had something hugely go wrong with them
---
I sell .45 all the time. Shotgun shells seem to sell pretty well, but that's on the other foot, as I'm buying those lol.
---
Personally I would love pvp if I could easily acquire the right gear but been farming since day one and still can't get any proper gear for pvp. Imagine if we were all able to access the legendaries we want and its a leveled playing field in pvp like fortnite or pubg.
---
would be a good thing. as i assume you are right about the different spawn points.
---
Whats your point dude, its a br mode, like the games mentioned.
---
lol You think this Reddit is safe?
---
Large and in charge, chunky yet funky.
---
&gt;I especially like the way they handle VATS
---
Yeah. FO76 was the first FO game I've played and I went to go play FO4 and I don't like VATS at all.
---
Nope, I usually say "Stay away from me you freak, I have enough rads allready".
---
I honestly hope not, from 470 hours of playing I've observed that most people (like myself) prefer playing alone. The current server size is enough that you can go through most of the game without running into anybody if you don't want to, but can still find somebody to play with for an event. With 50 people running around you'll be finding far more dungeons cleared out by the time you get to them
---
at least you are still being positive lol^^ something that for me becomes a tough task sometimes due to some things i sometimes experience^^
---
Gunna try this next time, thanks :)
---
It kinda seems like just everything gets downvoted. I got down voted the other day for posting that I had the Tourist on a server.
---
yes, some did mention that there might be different spawn points. so it should be even easier to fix, if this is truly fact
---
I've been toying with the idea of making a high-CHA build character with the main purpose of being a wildlife photographer with the help of Animal Friend and Wasteland Whisperer.  Maybe roleplay as Crocodile Dundee or something.  CRIKEY!
---
If the numbers Bethesda have shows them nobody plays PvP they would hardy spend month of development time to make a new PvP mode. It does not seem likely that they hate money that much, they are a company with owners after all.
---
Link to 5 star gear datamine?
---
When people could damage CAMPS, players would invite other to see where their CAMP was to destroy it.
---
Now, *some* people invite you because they have a friend outside of the team; then they will attack each other, what will put you in PvP against that guy as well.
---
If you are playing with him and are on a team, leave the team and engage in pvp with your husband, kill him and he'll lose the wanted level. After that rejoin the team.
---
**Hey, Bethesda!  I'd pay atoms for a beeping backpack that everybody around me can hear.**
---
There.  The deed is done.
---
Why don't you kill him?
---
I'm tired of it also.  It happens at my camp when I'm there and I can't redesign it to prevent people from spawning into my foundation without having to completely rebuild everything.  All I can do is dig people out when I'm there if they spawn into the foundation.
---
Mind you, I do, and that's why we failed the quest: most players were busy fighting the trash instead of the SBQ because we were getting overrun.
---
Good job getting back in my history to find that.
---
Sorry man but you on Fallout 76 reddit where fanboys really dislike the truth, personally I wish they made legendary items easier to obtain for ones we want, this would open the door to easy ways for player to acquire the items they missed when it was duped.
---
I'm with the other posters, why don't you kill him?.\\
---
You got another console and game I can borrow to do it?
---
You'd have gotten better xp anywhere else doing real stuff but hell, I guess it's easier to be a parasite than to learn the game... Wtf.
---
i feel you, as i experience the same. no, rebuild should be never the solution and it's on bethesda to do something
---
Well I have met 2 over lvl 200 players in PA that have kept whacking me, a lvl 30 player. I guess it's true at either you die as a vault dweller or live long enough to become a raider scum.
---
‚ÄûFlorida Woman urges Internet to kill her husband‚Äú
---
Sure, the need to vent was real I must admit.
---
Also, every time I need killed I go to WS Train station and get naked and just wait, someone always comes along and does it.
---
Twinking definition - https://youtu.be/adkqV6B7UfE Yes I had too Google what that meant. I fail to see how giving a low level character all of the 10mm &amp; .38 ammo I don't use on my main character?? By your definition, picking up someone's unwanted ammo at a train station in a paper bag is twinking... but how do you know it wasn't a level 10 dropping .45 or a level 250 dropping .308??? Bruh plz. Everything obtained on my level 50 account is able to be obtained on a level 1 account. High level guns and armor, no for obvious reasons, but my level 5 does have the chance at picking up the exact same legendary as my 103.... so I'm truly not sure what you're on about. Is trading twinking....?ü§î
---
Ok there is so e confusion here I am not playing with him im sitting next to him watching we only have 1 console and 1 fallout76
---
Oh that mask dupe was due to vendor dupe glitch, caught a few people doing it and reported ones duping entire BOS sets. Still kicking my self for not grabbing a set for them when I could of joined in grabbing a set.
---
That and the voice. There's a nice juxtaposition between a calm, automated robot voice and the announcement of impending death
---
They're already in game...
---
I saw a vendor with mole miner gauntlet plans for 450. He had 56 of them.
---
I spawn to the east of my camp well outside the original build circle.   I had moved the camp tool to that side of the building some time ago.   Everyone else spawns inside my camp foundations where I can only guess is the original location of my camp tool.    When vending first started I was so sure that people would spawn where I spawn I put illuminated arrows on that side of the building to show them where to get in.
---
Ok
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
1 have a sweet *** radium rifle gimped by lack of mods. Bought radium  plans, made some, scrapped them, no mods unlocked. Screw inventory was decimated. Rifle is now gathering dust hoping for possible mods to be sold at vendors or become a more common drop in future updates.
---
I do imagine that, and I get the PvP disaster that Division 2 is. What's the point of farming a build, if you're the same as someone else who slapped together random shit?
---
PS4? I have been playing for a long time and have been looking for a decent ranged weapon. And I could always use caps. Lol
---
I stopped reading when you said FO4 was difficult.
---
Are you saying that when you enter your excavator armor your weight that you're carrying increases?
---
Why are you giving away his actual location? We are talking about killing his in-game character right?
---
60 caps for a basic stimpack.  Nah I'm good.  
---
15k or more for 3 star random legendaries.
---
3k or more for 1 star random legendaries.
---
some people like to use those catapults to fly all the way to the top of the highest building in Watoga.
---
There's a sulfur fountain? Lol
---
just go to whitesprings and start asking on the mic. someone will do it because high levels realize why it sucks to be wanted
---
Yeah he is wanted and until someone kills him he cant see other players and stuff
---
Congrats on finishing the game!
---
Vats or no vats? Chameleon will give you a bit more stealth, but Unyielding has crazy benefits, especially if you are a VATS build. Unyielding all the way for VATS.
---
What console do you play on?
---
This game just works! But yea truely disappointed with Bethesda and stopped preordering their games and will wait for sale or not even buy it nowadays.
---
yes, it is important when first build for managing the spawn point, and if you didn't knew, you screwed. i truly hope they fix it asap, as this is just not cool.
---
I don't understand the "fallout 4 is difficult" part
---
I like Survival as is. I'm not OP like everyone else, but it's still fun just to go in there and have a good fight. The damage cap is really good.
---
I saw another crevasse recently.  It was a lot narrower than the one picture and the identifying characteristic is the truck that's been wedged into it as it was driving uphill.  I know it was on the eastern side of the Savage Divide, but I'm fairly sure it was downhill just to the east of Top of the World heading towards Berkley.
---
Xbox1
---
Yes, my carry weight goes up but so does the weight I‚Äôm carrying so it basically makes me heavier.
---
That‚Äôs where I‚Äôm at. Just passed 100 and finally solidifying my build through minor adjustments. Picked up rifles about 15 levels ago, and am finishing out my defensive perks now. After that it‚Äôs just utility stuff, and I‚Äôm more excited about that then the combat stuff...
---
If you want to unload them caps or stims! I'm your man! :)
---
If you're wearing armor that has weight reduction perks you lose those benefits when you enter power armor because you're "wearing" power armor and not your other armor.
---
A scope would make this a viable weapon. It's pretty gimped without one.
---
*States when you join that you lose some on death
---
My heart goes out to all of those folks who haven‚Äôt had the luck I‚Äôve enjoyed.
---
And it needs to automatically flag you for pvp too!
---
I ended up reading at "fallout 4 difficult" lol. That game was uber easy even on survival.
---
Will keep that in mind thanks!
---
sadly that's too often the case. I'm salty AF but it's silly to take it out on people's very valid concerns.
---
Survival could use a few more people to spice things up. Since that mode is supposed to be more "hardcore".
---
If stores on Black Friday operated like this, I'd still stay home. But I would approve.
---
Try Fallout: New Vegas sometime. It's pretty good too.
---
And when it does not work, [scream like Darth Vader while looking at all the stuff you lost](https://i.imgur.com/e6yIBhf.png).
---
This game will not be finished till Fallout 5 comes out in a decade or even later. 
---
Every 2 weeks like clockwork there is more content added, some they planned and some they get from the community.
---
I regularly get really angry, when I build a new base..... And some shit won't fit although there is no reason why it shouldn't. Yust bugging crap!
---
You can feed the fire. Just get more sticks. I usually stock up on kindling during that phase. And it doesn‚Äôt die that fast, there‚Äôs plenty of time to let everyone get a hit in.
---
People used to spawn under my base all the time. I eventually moved my camp location to the far reaches of my base that's not near any structures and it fixed the problem.
---
Thats been around since the beginning
---
I switch it up all the time but right now its a commando/heavy build.
---
If I buy a game do I deserve a voice? Yes but only if its only positive things apparently. To be fair I would of requested a refund if I could but I still play since I bought Tricentennial edition and can't return it so currently lvl200+ and still hoping they make something good out of the game but with the new details why stash box exists was due to making sure this game is a survival game not a fallout game and I'm referring to the fact I have to play inventory management simulator everytime if I want to balance the items I have, I want to explore the world and enjoy the game and not deal with that and heck let me pay a monthly fee for unlimited inventory and I would pay it if its less the 20 bucks a month.
---
I swapped out most aid and all junk for weapons that weigh less on me than in my stash. Got the weapon of the week, didn't even see another person. Just know what you need to do for the challenge before going in.
---
Until Dark Brotherhood DLC. "Oh boy, here I go, killing again."
---
It is wild that a game parsing itself as an mmo-lite and always online service for the PC has zero text chat or systems in place for community coordination. I still can't believe it. Please add text chat to the game.
---
Rolling pins are OP
---
I‚Äôm not sure I ever lost anything in a fissure that was worth going back on for. Lol
---
Not using sturdy frame, but yeah that would be a thing.
---
Absolutly nawh. I got 15xp per mob. There i have 100-300 per mob and there are toooones of mobs.
---
Seems like it's been taken care of.
---
A lot of the times people are inviting you to their team because they are on team chat and they want to talk to you.
---
It depends. Game is buggy and last time I tried I lost about 80 stimpaks, all my magazines, 40 radaway, my nuca cola quantums and some other. I was loaded with healing aids but after death my inventory was almost empty. Thankfully I had left some spoiled meat and vegetables...
---
&gt;salvaged assaultron heads
---
They could be good if they didn't gave you the same amount of Rads no matter the charge.
---
Lmao, all 100+ comments of that guy were hating on the game every other day, its not healthy, move on and play something else. If youre level 200+ you already got value out of the game clearly
---
Come live in the Vault, they said. Rebuild society, they said. They never said anything about having to go poop hunting.
---
This is where they spawn from! :) If you stick around long enough, the three vertibots will come by to pick one up and they will fly off with it.
---
 No they are just good now.  They aren't the only guns worth playing anymore.
---
Flare guns and drills round out the top 3 metas now
---
I got there today. Inaccessable...
---
What does "accessible at later date" even mean here??
---
With the plague walker mutation the Brahim gets damage, then it attacks me and then it eventually gets killed from the electrically charged mutation. O don't actively kill them it just happens.
---
I have a 3 star drill that one shots SBs
---
I‚Äôm leaving again...
---
Well bud I hate to see you go, sound like the type of player 76 needs more of. Ill say this brother, keep your gear and enough caps cause you will be backüòâ this is an mmo and you will always have times when youve reached your benchmarks, and seen what you wanted to see. But with an mmo youll get many changes, patches and new content. Tis more or a see you in a few patches then a farewell. Hope to see you soon brother.
---
Yeah, those are good points.
---
 lmaojustodoit Tbh I agree. PVE is what most people want in the long run
---
Possum badge challenge.
---
No, no. If you're wearing legendary armor that for instance reduces weapon weight, you lose that weapon weight reduction perk when you enter power armor. And if the armor has pocketed or deep pocketed you lose that bonus as well when entering power armor.
---
Just do other mob, genius, nobody forces you to kill radroaches.
---
Hint: take a workshop, then defend it once, then server hop/take another one. Don't defend it from players. That's a few hundred xp for a few minutes of game. You get plans and items. Tadaaaa.
---
yes, but most can't move their camps, as often it's build by especially fit the surrounding. a floating camp wouldnt have a problem and although my own spawn point is ok, if i'd need to move it, i couldn't. as i did build it to match and fit every tree, stone and small rock around it.
---
it's fine you found a fix. but it needs a lot more and a more serious fix to fix it for everyone.
---
That's what I do. Like you, I rarely see people anyway. Especially in the low level parts of the map.
---
*insert forest gump waving meme*
---
I'm not a good writer.I meant that Fallut 4 is what started it all and it's difficult. It feels that F76 is an extension to F4 and it's a difficult but beautiful game.
---
it's sad we have to do this. I live in the mire and often I spawn in and risk disease just because if I do spawn on a camp, it hasn't loaded yet.
---
a fixed spawn point + a temp immunity bubble while stuff loads should just be in game. it's not even about quality of life.  when you spawn at train stations after death don't you have immunity for a small window for load times? why isn't this a thing for everyone all the time when loading?
---
Toodooles
---
Oh I thought you were playing together.
---
Sorry.
---
Yes being lazy morons they are incapable of actual hard work, they can‚Äôt do legendary farming but still want some advantages, so they bought their ebay guns and armors that they thought would make them unkillable. Turned out on those survival servers everyone owns the same ebay items, the playing field is level again so it again becomes hard work in order to win, for which they have zero chance. Hence they are back in Adventure to harass others and hope to make a few quick caps. Garbage losers is what they are.
---
Ive been playing since the beginning and have lost nothing in my inventory.  (PC)
---
Pretty much my thoughts also. What garbage.
---
Yes thank jeebus he has been asking people for over an hour now.. I told him let me make a post on reddit and i guarantee ya someone will be willing and sure enough less than 10mins later..
---
*insert forest gump waving meme
---
After 600hours i know what is fastest way to level with alt.
---
The one I have is .50 machine gun  no stars. If you see a vendor with a good ranged weapon. I can login and purchase it for you then trade it.
---
Thank you. It's been a beautiful trip.
---
If they introduce human NPC's, don't you think it defeats the purpose of all the work they've done to the game?
---
Ok i never noticed it even i played since the B.E.T.A.
---
There's a narrower one sorta between Harper's Ferry and The Delano Range.
---
yeh even worse it seems like since the purveyor was implimented ....every 3 star i kill now drops 1 star garbage....I farm ...a lot... over 1000 hours in the game so far ....I kill about 100 legendaries a day , of those 100.....20 or so will be 3 stars and now every damn 1 of them drops 1 star garbage loot ....bethesda obviously changed the 3 star drop rates to balance for the purveyor but what they really did was suck all the damn fun out of the game....I dont even want to farm legendaries anymore  (only thing to do in the endgame ) its really discouraging and utterly sucks to even play anymore ...
---
Np i do appreciate the info incase we eevr do fi d ourselves able to play together
---
If you need a hand with anything, shoot me a message. I've got toons closer to your level and high levels to muscle your way through more difficult areas.
---
PSN is iJudgement
---
A youtuber made a video of this exact thing.. lol https://youtu.be/9KZdAyBVC78
---
What's your level? + I can't unload everything a little here and there.
---
Agreed. They should have made the rng better after they realized duping was a thing. Nerfs and stuff to combat duping is just.. not working lol
---
K bye
---
That guest is buggy, for starters.  (It will send you back to places you‚Äôve already been to get fragments you already have.)
---
 Yes, it is right - the eastern side of the map is designed for L45+ players.  Most of roses quests will take you to places lower levels should not be.  The main quest will eventually lead you to those places as well.  The western side of the middle of the map (savage divide) will scale enemies to the level of the highest player in the area.  
---
In the 20‚Äôs, you should be in the toxic valley.  In the 30s, work the mysteries quest and the ash heap, working on the excavator quest.
---
I love dropping a level appropriate recon rifle on the fresh meat. Good vibes all around, but giving someone a flower as a thank you is pretty classy.
---
Yup, it happened to me. You need to earn 300 tokens total to get the costume or head. So 450 total to get the whole set and you would need to by the body piece first.
---
I guess I suck at gaming.
---
I think for me, spawning in general is getting too much of a hassle. Logging out at a specific spot then logging back in nowhere near where you logged out is super annoying! ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Apparently not.
---
The game is exactly what I expected.  For better and for worse.
---
Is that the PS3 one? I started it and didn't go through it. I still have it. I might get back to it.
---
Glad you're glad ü§ó
---
Np I appreciate the info in case we are ever able to play together in the future
---
Nah, I think it‚Äôs natural to expect people to come back to West Virginia - especially considering what we know about DC and Pittsburgh.
---
They‚Äôre going to have to introduce instance playing though or it wouldn‚Äôt make sense from a story telling perspective. For instance, only people who have beaten the SBQ can go to the next setting, etc.
---
i couldnt agree more!
---
There‚Äôs limits and regressive benefits. Each SPECIAL is different. Some things are infinite (you always get 5 carry weight per 1 str, as far as I can tell), some things get less useful the more you have (the crit gain you get from luck gets less and less the more luck you have; 34 is the practical limit, I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs possible to get your luck high enough to see a benefit after that), some have a hard cap (although not strictly speaking *SPECIAL* based- you stop getting a boost in buy/sell value at a certain combo of Charisma, hard bargain, and grape mentats. Someone posted the details in here somewhere).
---
From what I‚Äôve heard, although not verified personally, the damage boost from Str is regressive. It‚Äôs 5% per point until a threshold (20?), then 2.5% until the next threshold (30?), then 1.25% after that (maybe a final threshold with no benefit after? Just speculating at this point)
---
Nice to hear that someone is trying to fix it
---
It's just fair to give the same hairstyle to both genders if you can already wear a suit or a dress no matter the sex.
---
Seems oddly specific for a group though
---
Plus, that face is a great loading screen picture.
---
Excellent! Sounds wonderful to me! Thanks a bunch!
---
That's why.  I'm not getting rid of my executioner's dagger. I might get back to it anytime.
---
You might have done him a favor. He was probably stuck there are unable to move until he killed him and took 1800 pounds of his weight. I wonder how much more he was carrying in weapons, armor, and food?
---
Nawh, you just play it your way, nothing bad about that. Just for no-lifers like me, that game was too easy.
---
And that's what it is... What do you not understand?
---
I would sacrifice my level 190 character to God Howard and start fresh if we could get server-wide text chat.
---
That vendor is eating a huge loss.  I can just as easily sell to an NPC vendor for 500 caps, so 400 caps is still an incredibly fair price.
---
"I'm gonna be rich!"
---
I have some mole miner gauntlet plans in my freebie machine, and no one takes them except the jackass 100+ers who take absolutely everything. Except the boiled water, I admit that they leave the boiled water.
---
Well thats 03.30am my time so idk if im gonna be online
---
im already pissed lol , nobody wants this fortnite battle royale bullshit ....90% of the playerbase is PVE ....PVP servers are dead.... but yet they are going to cram it down our throats anyway....
---
It's 28.8% extra damage. But it's trumped by Bloodied (+100% at low health), Instigating (+100% on first hit....most things die), Furious (+45% after 10 hits), Junkie's (+45% with 5 withdrawals).
---
So it doesn't do nothing, exactly, but it does less than most other options.
---
The whole silo launch is all around good fun.  Only wish I could make it to the launch tube in time to see my nuke exit for a picture!
---
I don't use heavy guns, that's the funny part. Nonetheless, I'm happy for any God tier weapons.
---
Ticks drop tick blood and tick blood sacs (which contain antiseptic). You need both to make blood packs, and then with a bit more antiseptic you turn those into stimpaks. Then you dilute the stimpaks, which turns 1 into 4.
---
You‚Äôll want the chemist perk to double chem crafting (takes 1 point), butchers bounty to increase tick blood gains (even just one point makes a big difference), and the super duper perk, which gives you a chance to double whatever you craft (definitely want all three points). 
---
As for finding ticks, someone else posted a good spot. But a good early game area is the shack just south of Vault 76, and then the lumber mill just down the hill from there. Both locations spawn ticks, and you can server hop to respawn them. Quick, easy, and you can do it as soon as you start.
---
One thing to note is that you need to pick up tick blood to get the recipe for blood packs, at least back when I first had this problem. I was pretty confused by this initially.
---
Chinese Assault Rifle
---
Anti-Material Rifle WITH EXPLOSIVE AMMO. It's worthless without explosive ammo.
---
I think electrically charged and unstable isotope mutations can still initiate pvp if the other player has low enough resistance
---
I was going to just give up on his machines but curiosity made me check the rest. Good thing I did, he had 20 treasure maps for 15 caps each.
---
It should start a mission when you are near enough the tourist. Like if you're in the Whitesprings/Uncanny area when the tourist spawned in Miners monument it would give hint that there is something to investigate further nearby. Now you can stand in top of them and if you don't know about it a player might no even notice it's special in any way. People are asking here also if there is an actual camera you can get in game or if people/dailies are talking of photomode.
---
You pick it at level up.
---
It sometimes happens at my camp, I put chairs everywhere so you can use them to escape. And if I catch someone stuck where there aren't any chairs I lay one down real quick.
---
sales are 1/8th of fo4 on playstation the only one that released real numbers ....so no its not doing well , at any given time they run about 100 servers ...with such low player counts on a server ....you do the math .... granted thats only playstation ....but the stats will be very similar on the 2 platforms...
---
I have a big idea that you guys might like to see, what they should do is put some kind of floor in game so that you can spawn on, yet there are a few things I should add to this that should happen to not make it an exploit for players to trap others on it.
---
1. Make it so you can't build walls around it, trapping players till they fast travel out, because then people will use that to try and kill players in survival, or just so people use the vendors. This is also so that people who are fast traveling to bases just so they can get to a location faster.
---
To be continued from the rest of Reddit, if anybody can help this idea out.
---
Reinstall the game
---
2H melees weapons are slower with higher damage.  1H melee are generally faster with lower damage. 
---
However:
---
A fast 1H weapon can hit 3x in the time it takes a slow 2H weapon to make 1 hit.  Ultimately, that may make a lower damage but faster weapon ‚Äúbetter‚Äù.
---
For example, drug/mutation free, a 2H AA Grognak axe (slow) may do about 180 damage.  A serrated vampire switchblade (fast) does 80, but hits 3x in the America‚Äôs span it takes grognak to do one hit.  80x3=240, vs the grognaks 180.  About the same numbers with a supersledge.
---
When your start adding modifiers like Vampire and instigating, or even suppressing, gets even better...
---
I would also suggest getting at least one auto-gun perk.  Will come in handy when you start taking on flying things - SBs in particular.
---
Yeah I get that. I have no problem with that...it's the blatant killing to kill.
---
Deja vu! Lol
---
I've got over 20 kindling, somehow still saved, on my character.  It's by far the most tedious task of the whole 30 minute event.
---
If low level players don't kill the thing in the first 20 seconds of it arriving, the event fails.  
---
After spending 25 minutes getting the event to that point, having a bundle of players show up after every tedious thing is already done so that they can take a reward without work, taking the risk of failure?  
---
NO.  I kill the shit out of the counsellor and take my earned reward.  Couldn't care less about whether or not everyone gets a shot.  I take the crap off the counsellor and immediately drop it all in a brown bag for anyone who didn't get a shot to claim.  Everyone wins.
---
PC, Xbox360, and PS3 all have New Vegas. It's usually pretty cheap nowadays because it's older, too.
---
Did you pick it when you leveled up? You also can‚Äôt ‚Äúsave‚Äù perks to buy higher level cards; the perk system really means ‚Äú30 perks spent before this card shows up‚Äù. If you‚Äôre level 35 but have saved 6 perk cards, the perk system will only show you level 29 cards.
---
No i wish this too. I truly admire someone who put in work on their camp and id love to tell them
---
Oh yeah the rarer stuff I completely agree with I wouldn't dream of selling a longshoreman outfit for 100 caps or anything for example I would sell that sort of item on here. And the harder to obtain items like farming nukes for flux I also would expect to see priced at at least there base values in the machines. I was leaning towards the more basic things like fusion cores, stims and serums, maybe the odd weapon or armor plan, being a merchant always did appeal to me (more because the robot vendors are all pretty much raiders commiting daylight robbery) but not to the point where I let it dominate my gameplay. If its spare and I turn over a few caps extra then that makes me happy and someone else is happy they got what they needed. For example I consistently see fusion cores priced anywhere between 150 to 250 caps each and me myself wouldn't ever pay that so I try to price with what i would be happy to pay in mind.
---
Yeah I've thought about it...but since I farm veggies for food and adhesive, I need the fertilizer.
---
You don't lose anything when you join Survival.  That may not have been your intention, but your wording was vague and could be incorrectly interpreted as such.
---
I think both games are very easy
---
Then yes I have that one.
---
I wasn't stolen.  It was won.
---
Ah fuck this useless head.
---
Oh wowsers, I think 53 or 54 now maybe?
---
all the good shit ive gotten , mainly from raw player trades , people dont put god tier shit in the machines ....and i dont want the shit you want to sell....I want the shit you dont want to sell ...
---
Server hopping fixed it for me
---
Go to Sunnytop Station and follow the tracks south. You will find a section that is between cliffs. I built my base there spanning the gap.
---
I‚Äôve never traded as the stuff on me is what I‚Äôm using. Or does it also link to your stash?
---
Someday came whining after there acid yesterday after getting smoked...you pvo and lose, you pay ..
---
Only by an asshat. The meaning is clear
---
Yeah it would be great to be able to leave compliments for good builds or good prices to let people know when they‚Äôre doing a good :)
---
tbh I would like to have a notebook or something like that, where other people or the owner of the camp can write some stuff in it
---
Oh me too! I get excited like a kid that just entered Disney world for the first time.
---
I get cryolators almost every other transaction from the legendary vendor. I have zero idea why. What effects are you looking for? If on the same platform (PC), I'll keep an eye out. Cryolators are insta-scrap for me otherwise.
---
IIRC, there‚Äôs a consistent drop in Grafton, but you have to kill one of the laser head things to get it.
---
More recently, I‚Äôve gotten a couple as drops from legendary critters
---
Yes, because the objective of the challenge IS to scrap the hides lol.
---
I think it's on  PS4 Pro with PS Now service.
---
Add me to the petition on this one!
---
Well, I hope you have a cheery day too.  :D
---
yes, on my friends house there's also a chair, put down by her just for me lol^^ yes, a cool thing some do, so you are a kind dude^^ but truly hope we get a fix that also helps us on camps where no one is around^^
---
however, thx for this add dude ,)
---
I hear you, if I may make a suggestion: Watch a video on youtube that has the locations, not a guide for it but JUST the locations. Once you visually see where it is in any given set piece, you're golden. For instance, I knew of the ones at Colonel Kelly Monument and the  Philippi Cemetary from a Reddit post, but hadnt seen a pic. After seeing where they were in a  video, every time I was anywhere near there, Id swing by those two very close spots. I probably missed it on previous visits but after seeing it in the video, I didn't even have to slow down as I ran by :)
---
A bonus of this 'method' is that I got to know the spots pretty well - for example, I didn't ever bother with the Mothman quest at the Lighthouse in the Forest. I knew where Ansel was if he was there, so I ended up visiting more frequently, and now I love that quest, easy peasy, I'd have ignored it forever if I hadn't been frequenting the area in my Ansel search.
---
Camera has been a blast, but I have to warn you, once you have it those Atom points continue the frustration almost daily. Bethesda better cut back on those 'Take a pic of a 8' tall female player who is under level 40 wearing a top hat and raider underwear whilst emoting on Top of the World'. Really disappointing when the dailies drop and three of them are specific, team-only pictures :(
---
I‚Äôll sometimes start hitting someone when they are vending in the hopes that they close to see what‚Äôs going on so i can activate the vendor instead of them.
---
At 30? I mean, you get a pack of cards but is that card guaranteed at 30? I honestly don‚Äôt know - thought they were all random
---
I do this too.  Though be aware of the topography of the area.  There has been a few times I spawned on the side of a cliff.
---
I know it's a bit creepy, but I normally drop em a pm telling them they have an awesome camp when I see particularly impressive ones.
---
It isn‚Äôt a solution. It‚Äôs counter productive. It ruins the game for many people. We spent time on getting out gears. Like I said before, the lack of energy focused on fixing bugs is the reason duping still is a thing. Until Bethesda fixes the god damn menus, the next big update will have duping. I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on with Bethesda, maybe they have a plan to combat duping, but there is no happy ending for everyone. If they do what we suspect they might do, it‚Äôs gonna end in many people leaving the game.
---
Sorry, I didn‚Äôt know the gun was loaded
---
it not new every language orther thas english are bugged since projet paradise was added
---
This would be cool, it could be bad too. Lol
---
what system are you on because I have plenty of them on pc.
---
lol yeah same, there‚Äôs a few guys on here that can help you mod it, I gave up on learning mods bc the scrap rate is broken
---
I believe it has to do with where your C.A.M.P. thing actually is. Some were spawning in my foundation, so I moved the Camp itself inside my camp to the edge of my camp area and it solved the problem.
---
I understand everything here man but I still hope you come back in time!
---
I agree with this! It should be put on hold for spoiling when it‚Äôs up for sale. You would think that‚Äôll be more logical! üòÇ I love food and drink buffs stacked with all the perks. I would totally buy different type of food being made by others.
---
Exactly. I always want to thank people for having reasonable prices and great stuff! I'm just a huge lover. ‚ù§ so thank you everyone for helping this noob. Not a Bethesda noob though. Lol.
---
I would too, but the maturity of the internet puts me right off of it.
---
Maybe some preworded notes or somthing
---
Yes! Maybe they can do something like this!
---
I love when people do this, not creepy at all imo.
---
I will read and see what's up. I'll have the game for sometime before I send it to my friend to play it.
---
Heck yah! I wonder if it would be a complicated patch?
---
Hey are you still up to the trade?
---
Pre worded notes is an even better idea. I forget people would use it to flame
---
started with fallout 1 purchased in a shiny old style box (the giant ones that you could have used to stop bullets it was so thick) and I think the big thing is I've accepted fallout isn't so much a succession of games as a universe which tends to make me feel less cranky about changes lols
---
I only have + :(
---
You on xbox? I'd like some caps and stims lol
---
I can't speak for that, I only play survival during quiet hours to get the weapon if the challenges are quick enough. Seems like if it's identical to adventure mode, even a low possibility of running into somebody else should make it interesting for people who enjoy that. There are definitely places you can go where you're more or less likely to find players depending on what you want to do, as well
---
i'm not sure, as i believe it has to do with where you did put it, when you first build the camp. however. it still doesn't help with the millions of camps by players that never visit forums nor have any idea how to set spawn points.
---
no, unfortunately it's on bethesda to give us a fix to end this crap and give us a better solution.
---
however, thx for your add dude. all substancial posts are welcome.
---
Agreed. I'd use it to be nice. Not a jerk. I dont deal well with meanies.
---
Send me your tag on private whenever you're online.
---
Agreed!!
---
It's odd that when I fast travel to my own camp I spawn in one spot outside of the structure,  but when other players ft there, they spawn inside the foundation.
---
Sorry I didn't make a not of that. I'm on PS4. :/
---
Oh I seen some beautiful places. I'd love to show appreciation!
---
Touche watchmefly! I'd only be nice though.
---
Ah crud, no problem!
---
Then could be fixed by making farming resonable, farmed almost every day(excluding last 3 weeks since kinda of quit) the ghouls and never found a TSE 10mm and ended up buying it from someone with 6 of them.
---
Almost certainly, but it would still be damn cool!
---
I am an advocate for Fast Travel mats.
---
I completely understand seeing as how I spawn under my own damn house
---
I had a team try and do this. A level 24 picked my Junk Extractor and got wanted. I noticed a level 125+ around so I decided to feed the troll. I DESTROYED him, 2 VATS shots, one-crit, with my TS Executioners Lever with 50% crit dmg made quick work of his bloodied gauntlet build, on, then he brought friends. I slapped on Gun-Fu and beat his little friends too. One messaged me and accused me of cheating. I just said I was a VATS Crit build and I had a MAJOR advantage over melee, regardless of how much dmg he did ü§£ü§£
---
How do you pm someone? Been playing for months now and didn't know that was a thing.
---
yes, there were already a few that mentioned it, so congrats, as myself didn't realized until i heard it today^^ it seems to be that way, so it should make it even easier for beth to fix, as all they need to do is just have this one good owner spawn spot they can let everyone spawn at.
---
üòà
---
I did this earlier today, I thought I was just lucky lol
---
As soon as I spawn in I run. I haven't been stuck in a foundation or wall in a long while. Easy fix.
---
Make deathclaws as scary as they were in NV.. Also make the anti material rifle with explosive ammo available. I had a blast hunting packs of deathclaws with the A-M rifle.
---
The DLC is in it brought shitload of new quests, a new Cryptid, a lot more decorations.
---
It's fun.
---
Maybe in time they will add something. I'm sure I'll still be playing this game when I enter the nursing home. Lol
---
I could not use that entrance until I made General.
---
And yes, had to hit the hand scanner first.
---
Lmfao, it's still one of the top tiers of effects. If that sucks to you, then I don't think this is the right game for you
---
lol^^ yes^^ that's even worse, when the owner of a camp himself is affected by this crap^^ i also wouldn't mind to have said mats, as i'm pretty sure shouldn't be a problem also to implement by bethesda grief-free
---
üôàüôâüôä
---
Pc is better. Get a gaming pc and plug it into your 4k hdtv and use xbox controller. You lose having 30fps. I WIN AT 60 fps smooth
---
Building in this game is ridiculously frustrating.  "Item is floating." "Intersecting with another item...." etc.   Honestly, how many bloody supports do I need?  I have stairs, walls, and beams everywhere and item is still "floating" and can't be placed?!?!  That or can't build a floor because it's intersecting with another item that is.....NOWHERE TO BE SEEN.  I mean it's a basic wall and floor I'm trying to build with nothing around it. Then I have to start pondering on changes to my building or work-arounds.  Definitely not fun.
---
After 4 or 5 months of not playing and having returned recently (played a few weeks upon release), the game has definitely seen it's fair share of improvements in areas but building a camp is still brutal. And sadly, it is an area I enjoyed in Fallout 4.
---
They are doing it because they make money from the exposure.
---
Yeah thanks, don‚Äôt have any armor with that or deep pockets but I see where your going.  Thanks will continue to investigate.
---
I hate it when people kill the brahmin at flatwoods. They're kind gentle creatures and their milk is great for removing rads. Also in a world full of things that want to kill and eat you, it's refreshing to meet an animal that *doesn't *
---
Wait how do you set a spawn?
---

Nothing like the last time I played. You may be to young to remember when the game first came out sweetie. It‚Äôs ok
---
Thanks and I have no clue why someone downvoted you for that...
---
As a cranky old Sierra adventure game nerd, here's the creed I live by:
---
~~Save~~ Stash good, ~~save~~ stash often.
---
Click on them on the map and there should be a send message button :)
---
Check the roadmap on google or the news section on bethesdas site
---
It‚Äôs not as simple as 28.8% more damage though. Once you hit high levels of damage and the enemy has low armor, you just ignore the armor entirely. Which isn‚Äôt hard to do, between Incisor and a high-strength 2h melee build. I think it‚Äôs when your damage is 6.5x the armor. So against the SBQ, AA may have some value (normal health build, ~400 damage weapon vs 300 armor reduced to 75 by Incisor, you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúbreaking‚Äù yet). But if you are against normal enemies, or even if you step up with a Junkie build (50%, it‚Äôs 10% per addiction afaik), now you‚Äôre pushing 600 damage against 75 armor, that‚Äôs over the 6.5x breakpoint, she might as well not have armor at that point.
---
Aw okay thanks!
---
Oh, boy. That's not really good.
---
Yeah, back when you were playing TSE was hilariously broken. If it's incomprehensible to need more than one shot to kill end-game enemies, then again I don't think this is the right game for you. I would personally suggest warframe as an alternative, there are plenty of ways to make overpowered builds there
---
Yup.... Ol' dick sucking Todd Howard made a promise to make sure that this game sucked as much as he does
---
it is where you first put down your thingy and first start to build. at least this is what i've heard often by friends. as i live on the spot i first did built, still, 211 lvls later still noobie flatwoods area^^ and never had the problem, i can just tell you what i was told w/o personal experience. but i hope there's a few here give you more details on it. but still, i'm pretty sure it's true. as the friend i've heard it from, considering understood right bc of my terrible english can't promise, has his spawn point exactly where he wanted it to be on all his characters houses.
---
In Fallout 4, the welcome mat that you built in your settlements determined the exact location of where you would fast travel to. In Fallout 76 the welcome mats are entirely decorative. They are asking for the Fallout 4 ability to determine where you fast travel to.
---
I can indeed sell them to a vendor bot for 500, but I accumulate enough other random shit like glowing blood and chems that I have no problem maxing them out every day. Selling them to players for cheap is just my way of giving back, and the constant need for different flavors of flux has given me reasons to nuke different places. 
---
Instead of simply nuking WS and mindlessly farming ghouls I drop on Morgantown, or Monongah, or Harper's Ferry, or the Generals Steakhouse, or some other random ass location so I can gather flux.
---
Look for them in toolboxes while you are doing other stuff. They spawn commonly inside them.
---
not a fix. only a workaround. it's a fix i want to get by posting this here.
---
People told me in chat and a few times via voice chat but most recent one "its not against the rules to kill your cow and if it was wrong they(Bethesda) would already have patched it and if you don't like it don't play or pvp me and if you win I leave you alone" long story short I deleted my cow and didn't pvp that guy because last few that did that and pvped me I got wreaked, too bad I chose to play with pve build since this game more pvp related then expected.
---
I think it's kinda crazy to think some pockets in armor and a backpack can hold more than a freaking PA frame. But Game logic, eh.
---
So by getting them to trade with you and allowing you to peer into their inventory, they‚Äôre not going to be able to refuse the incredibly generous offer you make?
---
I sell screws for 5 caps each at my camp. It's the item that sells out quickest. Then 5.56 ammo.
---
Nope.
---
Another fix is to travel to a place next to it and walk over to top of the world .it works with project paradise prolly will here too
---
Thank you I think I found what I wanted.
---
For sure Im with you, that first week I couldnt control my blue tongue as I raged at what a dimwit move by Beth gating so much content on an RNG encounter, totally agree. having agreed, though, the clever player (which is what us internet savvy Redditors are) can work around it. Does this help the average XboX console kid who clearly should have been handed the camera from the get go? Certainly not, but I assume that OP, being in this sub and asking Fallout questions, is capable enough to use this workaround. 
---
Bad design, yes. Doable, yes as well. And once he has the camera, he can join us in the Ivory Tower and decide what camera-less Plebes to assist :)
---
And watching one 15 minute video on youtube with InnoSurvivalist and her amazing accent is a treat, not a punishment or 'work'
---
The card packs are random (not entirely- they never reward damage cards, only utility as far as I can tell) but when you level up you get to pick 1 special point to put in, and 1 perk card of all the perk cards that are unlocked at your level. Although ‚Äúyour level‚Äù in this case means ‚Äúhow many SPECIAL points you‚Äôve spent‚Äù- you can‚Äôt save levelups for high level cards. If you are level 29 but have saved 4 levelups, the levelup window will only show you level 25 and below cards.
---
True, but I get a lot of loot farming SB‚Äôs and the corpses that die around fissures. Even with a recent stash dump at Watoga station, I still amassed a valuable collection. Not to mention the ultracite
---
Well they heard people were unhappy with quests currently and wanted NPCs so they fixed it by making it random start point.
---
Did you check if you downloaded  lately system update?
---
As I understood it, no matter what the armor level of the enemy is, AA always amounted to 28.8%. I'm trying to find the thread....will come back and link if/when I do.
---
Nevertheless, we're agreeing on the main point. AA is rarely worth it compared to the alternatives.
---
This is the better design solution that should have been implemented during testing, for sure.
---
That's alright. When are you normally online?
---
Have you ever been in the one in the river?
---
Read the weekly Inside the Vault. https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/news
---
You seem like a really nice person, I‚Äôm sure people love playing with you.
---
Glorf! It's TrailerPrkSupervisor
---
It's making me anxious just looking at this
---
Since playing as a Day 1 Wastelander, I feel like there is more balance in the builds. TSE was Super OP. It's still really good, but now there are other really good builds, like Instgating, Bloodied, Executioner, etc. 
---
Each build has it's own drawbacks, but all are fun to play. 
---
If you left during TSE's heyday, then you will probably leave again now. But I will say the game is way better than it was back then, not to mention more balanced.
---
Was this north of whitespring, south of the top of the world by a billboard on a cliff?
---
I‚Äôm aware of all that. Lol 
---
I‚Äôm talking about the perk card OP mentioned, ‚ÄúStarched Genes‚Äù which he was under the impression was ‚Äúunlocked‚Äù at level 30 - I simply told him he‚Äôs right but he‚Äôs not guaranteed to get that perk card by simply leveling up to 30. 
---
Are we on the same page, now? üòÖ
---
They don't want to incorporate a mat like this because it would be very simple to grief people using it. 
---
You see a camp on the map selling a ton of weapons or wherever you're looking for, fast travel there and suddenly you've set off a trap, and die and drop your all your junk. 
---
It's not great that we spawn in weird places but it prevents easy griefing like that.
---
So how many people carry extra stuff to sell to random strangers when they have a vending machine. I‚Äôm glad I always say no but do get occasional grief for it. I do say no as polite as I can too but there‚Äôs always one.
---
My bad... I have a thing with randoms who correct strangers.
---
Uncalled for. Im sorryüò¢
---
&gt;relatively small changes
---
Holy shit, mate. Not that I don't like the idea, but the game is built around a pile of reset timers, and there there is the questions like "how long do we keep this dead server running now that everything is done?" and "how do we add content fast enough to keep up with players who have everything?" This would not be a relatively small set of changes, it would be a rewrite of much of the code that makes this game run online, and different server setups (as of last I heard, Fallout 76 runs on rented-as-needed server capacity through amazon, so when people leave a server, it's shut down to save money, and when more log in, a new one is added in. Please, correctly me if you are informed and know more details, it's been a long time since I heard that).
---
Backpacks!!
---
Gear is a hard thing thing to fix. I can't blame them for not having fixed it yet. Either way they fix it, the non-duper players who grinded for the gear are gonna be affected. Perks and builds should be an easy fix. Just give us the option to reroll all our perks and special, like ESO.
---
I can not find this spot
---
I mean... i do...
---
Yeah I just learned about that. That is pretty awesome.
---
Its changed a lot just try it out, make your own opinion
---
I like survival just fine.
---
It's specifically called "Engineer's Uniform?"
---
Funny
---
i love this style, nice work! we need more camp budget!! us hoarders need dat space!
---
To preface, I've been playing since Beta.  Majority of the bugs since then are gone, in my experience. We still have a few here and there, but the generally seem to be worked on as fast as the dev team is able. They've also been very vigilant about finding duping/exploits and patching them out ASAP. I can't say I can think of any bugs that make the game "unplayable" like one might've thought around launch time.  [There are even some combat adjustments and stuff coming soon](https://bethesda.net/article/2CBMPyHAJtkxECtTS9rtBr/fallout-76-inside-the-vault-upcoming-combat-improvements).
---
I want to mention that Bethesda's slot at E3 is in a few hours though, so we'll likely be seeing content announcements and such if you'd like to check that out.
---
There's been a lot happening in the last several months. [Here's a link/guide with links to each of the patch update notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning#wiki_live_patch_notes).
---
Hope this helps!
---
5c? Really? I need to bump my prices up I guess. I‚Äôve got them going for 2c.
---
I think it's the explorers outfit.
---
I'm on your side angry redditor lol. I want travel mats. Just repeating what was posted to me. People made funny glitch kill traps without ftm so i presume this wont help but its a risk i want to take.
---
1 is a spike trap that flung people off cliffs. Very hillarious
---
38 y/o woman here, but on PC. :(
---
i'm  pretty sure it's developers elementary school class skill needed to do it so we won't have to worry about griefers. it only could be a bused if bethesda doesn't do it right. well, like they mostly do lol...however, leaving it broken as it is is definitely not acceptable.
---
The problem with survival is that the same players are fighting each other over and over. That's why just 1 survival server isn't gonna cut it. Survival is sadly already dead, but BR is just gonna make it worse.
---
In 100% agreement
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that :)
---
God I would kill for better respec options.
---
I'm 29 and in UK but I play late, so could potentially be around. I'm new to the game but we could figure it out together. I'll add when I get home from work, if you want
---
Ahh forgot my comma, meant to say no, people want it lol big difference there
---
ty
---
Well you‚Äôre lucky that you weren‚Äôt launched by the superior siege engine, otherwise you would have broken a lot more than your legs.
---
Honestly. I realized how good automatic is in pvp, and now I have to lvl 8 times to fix my build.
---
all good^^
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre getting back into it! And today‚Äôs a good day cause of E3 so we are gonna see some new stuff coming soon!
---
Smart lady! Thank you anyway! üòä
---
Sounds good to me! Thanks mate!
---
Trading is still a thing, even after player vending started. I don‚Äôt like doing it because people always want the exact guns I‚Äôm using. But to be in my camp while I have my machines stocked with everything I want to sell..... it‚Äôs like, c‚Äômon man. Lol
---
I don't mind. Happened to me one time, the other player wanted my Mr. Fuzzy Tokens and 5.56 ammo. I gave him the tokens for free (which I always do because I don't value them) and I sold him 1000 rounds for 1 cap each. The reason I don't put those rounds in my vending machines is because I use a handmade rifle, but if people really want them, I can sell a few.
---
You generally cannot simply do the main quest on its own, because the main quest will outpace your level. So make sure to explore, find side quests and events and daily events, and so on. I generally go Forest up to 15ish, Grafton till low 20's, ash heap till 25+, Savage Divide to mid 40's, mire and cranberry bog from there while leveling.
---
Oh, and capture every unoccupied workshop you can early on, you usually get at least one plan for a camp item for the capture, and then another for defending/retaking it from AI attacks.
---
Hoard the following: Screws, Springs, Ultracite, Black Titanium, Aluminum. You *will* need it.
---
When you hit level 25, look at rails stations for posters featuring a suit of power armor, that starts the quest to make your first suit and unlock the PA crafting station.
---
Don't buy camp plans until you're out of the forest on main and side quests, a lot of the basics like crafting stations come from those early quests.
---
Finally, don't set up a shop until you have an idea on what you can sell and at what prices, otherwise you'll have a pile of overpriced junk just sitting there taking up space. Metaphorical junk, not literal junk, which can sell well.
---
Haven‚Äôt crafted ammo in a while, but Ive noticed that behavior when smelting ore.
---
Enjoy it while it lasts.
---
Bloodied you die a ton, but I think it's super fun. I rock a God Roll Meat Hook (someone was actually selling one!!).
---
Even though you do less damage per hit, you hit super fast, and double dip on 1-Hand bonuses as well as Melee bonuses. I average about 3k-6k per hit, but have gotten over 10k a few times due to Adrenaline. 
---
http://imgur.com/a/VeS39zz
---
Debating trying to find one to join. I run a game out of mine, and it might be amusing for others to see it as part of the town.
---
Had the same problem with Rocket League earlier, everytime I tried to connect it pushed me to the Plus store, even though I have a full 12 months remaining
---
That‚Äôs cool. It‚Äôs just the only things I keep on me are for my use and survival, nothing extra.
---
ESO does player-specific, open world instance where if you are at different stages of quests, some NPCs will not appear to your chars as opposed to other players. It can be really wonky and immersion breaking at times. But as a compromise, it does work.
---
Perfectly valid point but trivial to remedy. Just set a radius around it that excludes the building of traps so you have a safe landing spot.
---
Because what I need is never in the machines!!!!!
---
You seem to be taking this a bit too personally. It's a genuine suggestion, if you were relying on the one-shot meta that TSE provided then you're probably not going to enjoy this game. Most other players don't like it, nobody likes being at an event or dungeon where somebody is running around one-shotting everything, and recent updates have clearly been taking the game away from that direction. You won't find what you're looking for here
---
But I would not trade you what I have on me! Lol..... but I guess people do.
---
The mire photo quest is non descrip. Take photos anywhere in the mire, I literally stood in one place and took 20 pictures and completed the quest.
---
They probably want you to buy some of what they have  
---
that is why I initiate trade at players camps all the time
---
Every online game increases the power level given time. It is standard practice. If it had been linked to killing the games over the last 20 years nobody would be doing it, but everyone is doing it so obviously it is good for game longevity. Here it would also fix a problems with a ton of duped items floating around.
---
Those are Challenges, not quests. But yeah, a lot of them are just totally broken. I've been to every location on the map, and it still says I need quite a few. 
---
I've gotten all the photo ones, though. Surprised those are broken for other people. 
---
Good luck!
---
Well most people would not drink scalding hot coffee. Most would wait a bit til they like the temp of the drink. My point is people complain for the sake of complaining. If you don‚Äôt like the game there is a few more games in the world to play.
---
I agree. And, I would like it if people stop logging off when I go to their camp. I‚Äôm level 205 and sooo many times people see me at their camp then *poof*. I come in peace. I lose so many caps behind this. ‚òπÔ∏è
---
The game is just not optimized. I have a feeling it is the unnecessarily large textures that are causing the stutters. I am planning to compress them and upload the compressed textures on Nexus soon.
---
What platform?
---
It was limited time, and there aren't really any alternatives in the game. The closest you can come would be one of the gas masks
---
The spot with a broken down shack on one cliff?
---
At this point I'd much rather run into a rare trap spawn rather than getting stuck in walls or falling off a cliff every other spawn!
---
This game‚Äôs loot is much more signifcant and valuable than other games‚Äô loot. And as for increasing the item level cap, It‚Äôs not going to fix duping. Menus are still hot garbage and bethesda wont focus on fixing them. Duping will still occur. This fixes nothing. It‚Äôs false security.
---
What platform are you on?
---
Xbox
---
still a bug, tried the other day
---
Since a lot of us don‚Äôt have mics, that kind of thing I hard to convey. If I accept a trade, somebody almost invariably requests my explosive lever gun, my Vamp Swing Speed Sledge or my much needed fusion cores. These are my bread and butter, pal, back off! Lol
---
Agree with pheak - carry at least a couple different weapons, and it wont be long before you are crafting it anyway.
---
Grafton steel is the location you reference.  If they are higher level, then a high level player has been around recently.
---
My first camp was up the cliff across the road - I sniped the outside mutants for XP - L16 was about as high as they got.
---
There‚Äôs actually a lot of 308 around - I picked up every 308 I ran across,  By the time i started using the LMG, I had around 2k rounds)  (Bandoleer perk helps a lot with the weight).
---
They should make it teleport you to the welcome mat like in Fallout 4
---
Yeah.
---
Darn.
---
PC.
---
Looks great!
---
Looks Great! I have a tarp over some benches....
---
What's a game that's difficult for you
---
The spot with a train under a bridge?
---
Or add the fast travel Matt it's literally on the same dying engine as for so it can't be impossible to add
---
Agree! I could use atleast double budget seriously :D.
---
I agree with you.
---
Damn, and I just dropped a stack of caps on the plan for calibrated shocks. What a waste...for now anyway.
---
Me? No. Although I havent seen it yet...Im just trying to find a new place to build. Ive always built on water, wanna try something new.
---
I cant find this spot
---
Yeah.  I ran White Springs the other day during a Nuke event.  Found a paper bag along the pathways.  Lots of bulked junk so I picked it up as I was heading to the train station to turn in crap legendary drops anyways.  It found a good home.
---
Why anyone would be running around White Springs during a Nuke event full of junk that they were probably planning on selling is beyond me...
---
Just incase you didn't know there is also a subreddit for sharing in-game cool things you find, or photograph :)
---
/fo76filthycasual
---
What ever.... you do you
---
Sounds good, I‚Äôll make sure to download that
---
Damn wanted to see this in person :(. Very well done!
---
I used to do a lot of queens, but I don't much anymore.  These losers just ruin it.  
---
The sneakers with their kitten tickle weaps, bag stealers, hiders, stealing a free ride. 
---
I've seen right cunts down there with black powder weaps, little sneaky hiders who can't do shit, little bitches who run like screaming babies from any mob, roof dwellers who prevent her landing, low levels who can't do shit but generate adds for others to kill for them.  Such a joke.
---
My very favorite though are the lvl 51 with the unperked mini and an open mike talking about how he's big dick dps and others should keep him clean, while his tickling/staggering the sbq in the air so she doesn't land, while on a roof.  These are the funniest lot.
---
The game is pure garbage.  I can't believe I still play it.
---
I like it. Wish that shack wasnt there though. There is also a spot up on the rocks more, opposite side of the shack, where its a slight hill down into an oval overlook looking at Harpers Ferry that was pretty sweet too.
---
Fast travel mats for camps please!!!
---
You play on console? I dont have that option when i click someone lol
---
Because thats what heroes do
---
Minecraft sounds like your type of game mate lol
---
Yeah, it's super frustrating.  I have a decent base, but I'd love more budget. I feel like every time I'm almost happy with how everything is laid out, I run out of budget. Then they add more clutter shit to the Atom shop menu, and I can't even place any of it because I've maxed my budget. This is my current build, and I'm fairly happy with it.  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GcInBAj6NA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6GcInBAj6NA) 
---
For me when I get the bug to build something, I just boot up FO4 now.
---
Yeah I do, that's weird though I figured it'd be the same
---
Lol Hey someones raking in hundreds and thousands of weapons, giving us pennies in return and then charging us 3 times what she pays out for a three star wood leg that devalues further the moment you look away.
---
That's capitalism, mate ;D
---
Yep. I was heavily testing the tweak and came to the same conclusion that texture can be insanely demanding on very high setting. I made my peace with mildly jagged texture.  The rest like grass fade, object fades etc don't really make much different  on high.
---
Umm... No. 
---
After $10 million Steam only takes a 25% cut. 30% up to $10m, 25% thereafter.
---
This isn‚Äôt a shotgun bug, this is a every gun bug when you have your weapon OUT and load into a world.
---
Thanks in advance for your service. The performance really gets to me sometimes
---
Pc doesnt have any type chat, i dont think. Mics work though.
---
Yeah, I've thought about building at that spot a few times. Just hate being attacked by shit every time I go home.
---
I would like an enclave helmet to with the mask they have
---
I just dont see how. If anything BR will work as a platform to balance survival. Isn't survival still in Beta, meaning its subject to change. I still think survival needs to be a separate character mode so it requires its own characters and all the playing field is level.
---
Same here! It's so exciting to hear, then look for the blast zone.  I debated using it for a ringtone or an alarm or something, so I did some file digging... If any else is also interested in the files:
---
[https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9l3y7ywpen2v88p/AAAtJoKmPy1DPvaSO2IlrR6ja?dl=0](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9l3y7ywpen2v88p/AAAtJoKmPy1DPvaSO2IlrR6ja?dl=0)
---
(Voice w/ Siren, Siren Only, there are two that are voice only but it is via radio/computer/etc. and has a filter, last one is announcement that blast zone has cleared.)
---
They work
---
Wait, that last bit- WHAAAAT?
---
Ok, thanks for quick answer
---
I love when people do this!
---
I believe they both are!
---
The unofficial one.
---
I don't disagree with what you're saying. It's not that there is no requests for PvP, just PvP is in a considerable minority vs solo/co-op PvE, much like that survey indicates. This goes back to pre-beta pretty consistently in my experience.
---
From what I‚Äôve heard plasma grenade plans are an incredibly rare drop from quests in the ash heap. Never seen proof though.
---
Oh...thats me. I kill your brahmin then steal your razorgrain to respawn more brahmin to kill. If you see a pile of brahmin...thats me.
---
You'll need to have Starched Genes to keep it. Look up on YouTube how to keep your mutations.
---
Yes, it is the BOS Engineer outfit:
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Engineer%27s_uniform
---
Yeah, my base is on a cliff and i spawn halfway down it and take fall dmg. So i built a little platform with stairs up to my base.
---
I‚Äôve played a decent amount (150~) of F76 but have rarely built because A: not looking forward to frustrating bugs B: not willing to move from a perfect location C: too poor to afford plans i want
---
I am completely in the dark when it comes to complex C.A.M.P.ing but hopefully these probably can be hashed out with accompaning new features to get more builders like you, OP to make cool stuff for wastelanders to enjoy
---
Do you know if the people who make ESO have any correlation with the people making 76? I know they're different teams but surely there's some overlapping?
---
I thought Bethesda would allow the backpack while wearing PA . Or maybe I misread about it working with backpack outfits.
---
None of what you posted makes sense to me with my understanding of the game. Gatling plasma is a heavy weapon. I use one occasionally,  it definitely is affected by my HW perks (except Stabilized, sigh).
---
What DO the personal terminals do if not this? Are they just for show?
---
It's my ringtone. I love it. Others get a bit spooked when my phone rings, though, but it's ok.
---
I usually price everything half of the value. Maybe more if I want to get rid of it
---
Camp destruction was removed in one of the recent patches. Even in Survival mode.
---
Good tip! Thanks for sharing!
---
Where did they say 30 will cap benefits? That‚Äôs not true with multiple SPECIAL I can think of off the top of my head.
---
From one pedant to another, I can appreciate the effort but context was with welcome mats that have fast travel functionality like with Fallout 4.
---
Totally agree. Shitty launch but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs the final game. Ever since vending machines it‚Äôs felt like a lot more of a community. I still remember my first steps out of the vault I didn‚Äôt have my pc built until a few months ago and therefore didn‚Äôt want to buy the PS4 version. So by the time I joined everyone was already high level and there was a level 86 in front of the vault and he gave the come here emote and suddenly a little brown bag appeared. I checked inside and was shocked to find around 40 radaways 90ish stimpacks and 35 purified waters. Man did that make the early game a lot more enjoyable because every little fucking thing gets you sick early game.
---
They are for tiny missions I believe.
---
That‚Äôs the case for a number of weapons/mods. More incomplete game stuff. AutoGrenade has a magazine slot. You can even find a mod for it at vendors/in the game world rarely. But it‚Äôs the same base-level mod. 
---
I‚Äôve also got a, I want to say .44 receiver mod that doesn‚Äôt seem to have a plan for it. Unique!
---
Adamantium bones are your friend! :D
---
The recent Inside the vault featured combat improvements.
---
Maybe (probably lol) they fixed combat related freezing too?...
---
Maybe my compass is upside down. Maybe  the canyon is south of the prison.
---
They pass through 2nd floors and roof pieces? Do tell how.
---
Are they max lvk
---
Yeah so the connectors connect the bottom part of one piece to the top part of the other piece. Can be placed and then a floor or roof can be placed.
---
Someone else in the thread mentioned they saw someone do it on YouTube, so you could probably figure it out from there. Just please use it for laughter rather than murder :) .
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure if I got hit by a bullet and lived, I‚Äôd have a good idea of which general direction the bullet came from. And if I had an explosive auto cannon for a vocal box, I‚Äôd scream pretty hard all over that general direction. Which is what they do; if you fire and relocate, you‚Äôll see they spray where you fired from.
---
It‚Äôs actually pretty realistic, imo.
---
While it‚Äôs true it‚Äôs highly unlikely for you to naturally find a dead tourist, the server hopping method just seems like a huge waste of time given the # of possible spawn points. When I finally got tired of not ever seeing one in my travels I just looked up a list of spawn points and checked each one until I found one, took about 30 min and that was while I had a low lvl newbie tagging along asking all sorts of questions about how the game worked and slowing me down some.
---
Well OP just got to lvl 36 sooo, no.
---
Postman ringed only twice and left -  wasn't quick enough out of the shower - damn u BETH!1!!1!
---
16 Times the detail/4 times the size of fallout 4
---
That would be great
---
Well, it seems like it'd be wierd if the toxic cloud your emitting seemed to be able to select what it hurt. Plague walker is garbage anyway, just don't get it.
---
Oh I will. I'd never want to kill anyone. Just break a few limbs. Lol! What a righteous post!
---
1. Nope
---
2. Only mods. You have to buy/find/earn the plans.
---
Look for the plans for the lever rifle, make some low level ones and scrap them. That should work.
---
Guess it is quite formal, wonder if it would work with the Police Uniform too. 
---
Out of interest was it the outfit given at the start of the quest or the one bought from the vending machine?
---
‚ÄúYou really shoulda got bird bones.‚Äù I cackled at that part lol
---
Well, my character was carrying less than 90kg of junk for once, so I definitely would have made it accurately more than 300 meters away
---
The tadpole one, from the start
---
I'm having the same issue on the xbox where I've killed dozens of legendary enemies but am only at 1/5 on the challenge. I would guess I need to track down those 3\* ones.
---
People that don‚Äôt play the game talking to other people that don‚Äôt play the game.
---
Inception at it‚Äôs finest.
---
I got a bloodied explosive sub machine gun with plus 1 perception today from the purveyor
---
Agreed. I love the detail and work they put into the environment. Truly feels like a Fallout world. I wasn‚Äôt expecting crazy OP unique loot like the previous Fallouts as that would be quite hard to balance but I was very disappointed by the lack of immersion in quests. I used to be a quest junkies in TES and previous Fallouts but constantly checking terminals to figure out what has happened really kills the vibe. That being said I do love the core gameplay and the combat mechanics feel more refined that Fallout 4. I get it‚Äôs supposed to be a mmo and super early time wise so much hasn‚Äôt happened yet. But I‚Äôd love for them to slowly make the lore and story more captivating because all the previous Fallouts were just so good at crafting lore but making you feel inclined to be apart of it. I‚Äôm very hopefully though because honestly I haven‚Äôt seen a single bad update yet. It‚Äôs constantly polishing and adding new features.
---
Yes.. I have bought things at lvl 15 and its always max lvl. They said they are aware its not working and will be fixed.
---
For now i dont think its possable to not get max lvl from her
---
Dont believe its south either, lol. Seems to be all grassy downhill.
---
That and planters for indoor crops
---
Don't the defend missions autofail if you don't fast travel there? Like I had 7 unreachable missile turrets and some barricades at a the campground workshop and it got "taken over" by 1 wave of rad toads. Every time I actually show up it's a struggle for me to actually kill anything first.
---
Ouch! Luckily, my guy went with the less lethal route.
---
It is fun one shotting him now.
---
I get the stutters in areas with lots of lights and fog... I hope they optimize this soon.
---
That's cause your just constantly flatulent, it offends ALL of us including the cow. :P
---
This would be huge.
---
It was definitely near the TotW, but I can't remember exactly where. I marked it as a custom destination on my map, so when I get home I can check.
---
üòÇüëçüèº
---
Hope I didn‚Äôt send you on a goose chase. I haven‚Äôt been back there in like 10 weeks or more. When I play later tonight I will see if I can find it and let you know.
---
They have been talking about putting it in the cash shop. Knowing them, it'll cost $15-$20.
---
Looking for red, pink, yellow and Forrest. Can swap for other colours (currently have 5 brown, 3 green and 1 blue) or caps! Thank you x
---
We really need to be able to place the spawn map at camp, like we can in workshops.  I suppose people would create death traps with them of course.
---
Need those spawn setting welcome mats from 4.
---
I do this and still get caught about 50/50.
---
Right now the backpack has a refrigerator mod that does that and it's possible they might add a fridge for the camp.
---
No one expects the Howard.
---
Its all good if you did. Been on a wild goose chase all day lookin for a spot.
---
That would quickly clear the lines of stragglers fighting to put that $6.37 back in their wallet. Also would automatically trigger any time someone pulls out a check book with more than 3 people in line behind them.
---
Bait, they‚Äôre friends are waiting for you to break PvP protection, you‚Äôll be dead in a split second.
---
I got it on my 3rd attempt at the tea pot
---
Welcome mats won't work unless the bases are preloaded before you finish travelling!
---
Mine's not that high, but it's close. I loathe having to climb into PA and lose such a huge portion of my carrying capacity.
---
Ya I hear that, I'm built to take in hordes of monsters and SBQ, not some 1000 dmg bloodied char. It's like "congrats, you read a how to make a bloodied character article, your clearly MLG..."
---
It‚Äôs *supposed* to fell empty. The people released from the vault are literally the only ones alive in the area we have access to. It‚Äôs post apocalypse. The loneliness is the point... and also to incentivize you to start making real, human friends in the wasteland! We rebuild, together.
---
Lay off me I'm starvin!
---
Yeah i know about the backpack but I would be nice to have something for camp
---
I know right!!
---
Well, BE3 is in a few hours anyway. And that is the playground of Todd Himself, where he plain fucks with our hearts and minds for 1 hour straight.
---
Go Pack Go! 
---
35/M/Minneapolis, lvl 92 PSN: H4T3PHUL 
---
It‚Äôs been along time since I‚Äôve posted an A/S/L LOL
---
I‚Äôve got a busy few weeks at work but should be playing normally soon.
---
But didnt they remove deathclaws as tamable a couple patches ago?
---
Ok planters didn't think about that. That would be sick!
---
All cards only unlock after level 50, so you need points for them and also for swaps.
---
You get dropped a short distance from where you first set down your CAMP, visitors get dropped a short distance from where your CAMP currently sits.
---
Hi. I was wondering when you are going to announce the winners.
---
agree!
---
Agreed. My point is we‚Äôre not talking general direction. It‚Äôs pinpoint accurate and immediate. It‚Äôs lose lose because if I stay where I‚Äôm at I get blasted, if I relocate in stealth I‚Äôm not fast enough to avoid it, and if I book it I give myself away anyways. All I‚Äôm saying is pick a lane. Either it knows where I am and we can drop the ‚Äústill hidden‚Äù facade, or it doesn‚Äôt know in which case it should be a little less accurate with the return fire. I‚Äôm happy with either.
---
Hope not that much. I would spend about $5 tho.
---
would be great^^
---
All of this do all of this
---
Exactly! The risk/reward is what makes survival an engaging experience. I love the feeling of needing to play cautiously because you don't know what threats may be lurking.
---
Will we get to build towns together? And will structures persist afterwe leave till we return
---
ty for supporting it so we might get a fix
---
Just makes me think that we could totally use the option to craft parachutes for players who don't always run around in power armor. So much easier to get down from survey towers/cliff edges. I break way too many bones trying to ease my way down off cliffs when I forget my power armor at home.
---
agree^^
---
I imagine Todd Howard being booed off stage at E3 at the current time, given how many life long fans are pissed at him, and Bethesda at this moment.
---
Thank for the tips.  Much appreciated!
---
Yeah, unless I know a CAMP is on level ground, I alway wear my PA when house hopping.
---
This is awesome. Great job!
---
He does love that...
---
yes, exp it too lol^^
---
There's only like 5 spawn points... Just fast travel to them. Took me less than 10 minutes on 1 server.
---
I have one machine with regular legendary stuff, serums and outfits that I sell for anywhere between 9 and 499 caps, and another with really high end, god roll 3\* pieces that are all listed at 25k with a clear sign on the machine stating that they're trade only and to send a friend invite if they want to work out a deal.
---
I have the opposite problem of people wanting to buy an antiarmor/explosive/reload 50cal or weightless/ap/sentinel armor piece and getting mad because they have nothing to trade and think 2000 caps is a fair price.  
---
I don't really want more caps, which is why I sell good one star and less than ideal 3 star gear for a song and a smile.  Trading legendary stuff is much more interesting to me.  If someone isn't demanding, vaguely polite and clearly wants something really badly, I might consider a handful of 1 star pieces and possibly stable flux in trade, even just for some extra scrip and crafting desirable shielded underarmors.
---
Of course my friends get the family discount if they see something they like.  Discount = free.
---
You‚Äô should‚Äôve gone and taken bog town from him. Punk. Lol
---
LOL it's all the PORK &amp; BEANS
---
Get ready to burn through a shit ton of materials. I've probably built and scrapped 50 lever actions and I'm still missing a couple random mods.
---
I don‚Äôt think the general audience even has admission to E3 until the 11th. Isn‚Äôt it just industry people now? And journalists?
---
You're welcome, friend.
---
We basically know all about the main points on the DLCs. 
---
Nuclear Winter- TDM-FFA-CTF etc. With Battle Royale.
---
Wastelanders- NPCs, new main quest etc
---
.
---
I‚Äôd just like to hear more on them, which i‚Äôm certain we will.
---
You're absolutely right, someone posted a link in this thread on how to do it!
---
Well, I‚Äôll be the first to admit stealth is buggy and inconsistent as all fuck in this game. But my stealth VATS sniper doesn‚Äôt *usually* get instantly pinpoint blasted unless somehow I end up in Danger (the Scorched that a SB summon will also run to where you shot from, and if they get close enough they can see you. I‚Äôve ended up with that before when I wasn‚Äôt paying attention and they spawned super close to me).
---
If they couldn't make a text chat this game should never have been made. 
---
If they can't implement text chat it will filter out the majority of players from teamwork required events like arktos. I don't see how they are going to do the player raid type vaults with how empty Arktos always is.
---
Pvp in this game is ass, they really have to implement text chat or die slowly.
---
Now all we need is a superhero cape and we'll be set to fight crime.
---
You're only level 36. You have plenty of time to shift your build to work with either of those good guns.
---
You can always access your stash from their camp's stashbox to pull out some weapons and armor you've been saving, if you're looking to strike up a trade.
---
No, I've tamed level 21 Deathclaws since patch 9.5, you just need to have **both** Animal Friend 3 and Wasteland Whisperer 3; it won't work if you only have one.  I've mostly found them either in the Savage Divide in the woods west of the Converted Munitions Factory, or on the road between Harper's Ferry and Big B's Rest Stop.
---
He‚Äôs going to showcase their newest game Fallout:Skyrim remastered special edition with a solid gold case and it comes in a specially made hemp fiber bag if you buy the Special Ultimate Dovahkiin Power armor edition
---
[Here's a handy dandy button](http://www.nooooooooooooooo.com/) for situations like this.
---
I mentioned above that parachutes would be a cool addition for getting off of survey towers and large cliffs for when power armor isn't an option (too low of a level, left it at home, etc).
---
I will still enjoy adventure mode the way I do today.  I understand my personal disappointment in the time spent on pvp is not everyones perspective.
---
Someone say weed üëÄ
---
Speaking of which, do you have a TSE Gatling Gun with Reduced Weight to trade for my AAE Handmade w/ reduced weight???? :)
---
Yeah I remember asl lol. Been a minute for me too. I just started doing that. Lol. I'll add you! Go vikqeens go! Lol.
---
You have contracted Glowing Pustules
---
Can you get stds from ghouls?....
---
Same problem since day 1. Got used to hit, tried everything...
---
The hilarious part here is that even as your third language, you still managed to convey your point in a more legible manner than most people who exclusively speak the language. So, good job on that one.
---
Not sure, I'm actually avoiding even looking into E3 this year. I'm so tired of being disappointed, so I'm just going to do my own thing until games come out that I care about, instead of letting E3 tell me pretty little lies about what the games won't really be.
---
2 caps a screw? They must sell like hot cakes!
---
Even on the trading forums it's 3 caps each at least.
---
I would like to also see a water tower. And maybe a better looking bathroom ensemble.
---
I guess we have found a new way to gain diseases is 76
---
Where have we heard about those details? Can't recall the battle royale or NPCs stuff
---
Which are you more excited about for DLC - PvE or PvP?
---
Indeed I installed the update, and yes I'm not running into as persistent a problem signing in... instead it's random lag like I have literally never had before.  Although in one case it somehow managed to work in my favor...
---
I suppose if it wasn't one thing it would be something else.
---
Where are you seeing ‚Äúbase AP starts at 105‚Äù? Because that is not true in game. Base starts at 50 (you start at 1 agility) and goes up 10 per agility. So 3 agility gives you 70ap, which is exactly what you are showing.
---
Toggleable text chat would be nice, i dont use the mod or anything but 1 tbing that i really liked from DayZ mod was the text chat
---
People were making traps out of the mats in beta, as I recall. If it's something else, like the first foundation you lay down is the spawn, and must be clear 1x1x1 square, that would be fine. That way you would be hard pressed to make a real trap out of it.
---
Yea, ultimately a lot of mechanics in this game are janky af and me complaining about this one little thing  is like complaining about my car making an annoying noise when it‚Äôs on fire. Just frustrating for a bloody build.
---
Well people only put what they want to sell in a vendor so maybe that's why they dont want to trade their main guns
---
Power armor skins cost around $14, and do Jack shit, so I wouldn't be surprised to see something people will most certainly call ptw, that isn't one time use, costing more.
---
whats the perk and consumable set up you go through to make that happen? im just now starting to hit end game status weapons and stuff and am starting to review my build. It doesn't seem like there is to much penally for dying as long as you keep your good stashed so there doesn't seem to be any point in trying to stack defense perks. maybe just the one to use a stempack before you die since mostly everyone is 1 shooting in PVP anyway and the legendary armor provides DR buffs on its own. I guess maybe a couple on barbarian and the agility one that buff DR. and the rad perk that buffs ST. Power armor also seems kind of over rated with the right build. its to bulky and not very mobile.
---
I will actually throw money at the game just to support it here and there. I paid $15 a month for wow for like 10 years, Ill give Beth some love.
---
That‚Äôs with a maxed strong back with aid I could get well over 600
---
I‚Äôve seen deathclaws at white springs.  I imagine they grabbed it from white spring while nuked
---
My PSN is DBeeking and am currently level 50. Unfortunately, I don‚Äôt fall into your age category for I am 21, but if you need any help with the game (e.g. C.A.M.P. building, help with quests) be sure to shoot me a message or a party invite! I‚Äôm not always online though, but I frequently check my messages.
---
It‚Äôs true. It‚Äôs all bullshit these days. What they say never represents what you get months later. It‚Äôs all just smoke and mirrors
---
Do you have any evidence to support this?
---
big thanks, that's very kind :) i know that there's still room for improvement, but appreciate it^^ ty!
---
I would love a welcome mat so that players would spawn just in front of the stairs.
---
On the flip side I could easily see people making prisons and kill rooms and placing the spawn in there.
---
Whatever way we try to make things better it is inevitable others would find ways to abuse and misuse it.
---
I'd still add you! As long as you know how to play! I usually shoot for older cus then I can relate to other lifes quandaries during small talk. Lol
---
Does anyone else remember the madness surronding the lunchbox speculation that it was going to be some pay2win thing? Or am I just crazy?
---
People are shy. We play games to get rid of interaction with real life people, what are you expecting? :D
---
Same here. But I dont like power armor.
---
didn't know that. and yes, there should be easily wa to implement w/o having to worry about ppl abusing it.
---
Is fucky even a word?
---
If you're hiding a pylon, let alone two or three, you are already doing your share. I can't ask for more than that especially when there are plenty high level folks that refuse to grab even one. 
---
As for the SBQ, you don't have to do big damage to the bitch, just keep the trash off those that are focused solely on her. Especially shoot those #%$#@! Cave crickets. Those damn things cause more death than the mirelurk queens, scorched or other "big" vermin. If you see someone go down go revive them. 
---
I'd never give anybody a hard time at the events if they're at least putting some effort into it. The vast majority of other high levels types i play with tend to feel the same way...
---
How about a nuka fridge for vending?
---
It's definitely rare to hear people in area chat, I usually unplug my head set if I'm not in a party.
---
"Oh, George, not the livestock."
---
&gt; not to mention the issue with loot loading that would never fly in a BR game.
---
...unless it's PUBG where loot loading (and even buildings/walls loading) is a permanent problem
---
never heard that "blast zone cleared" sound before...is it actually used in-game?
---
She gave me this [arm piece](https://imgur.com/7KYQger) and [this gun](https://imgur.com/f47yZ6u) so far....  I'm not mad at her.  
---
You just gotta mumble "hello babcia" and "yes I would like some babka, thanks" instead of charging up to her with a dirty suit of power armor and a machine gun pointed at her face.
---
She only gives you the god rolls when you say "Kocham ciƒô babciu!"
---
I had this happen when I was level 30 something, ran into a house and threw on my power armor and walked outside and crit someone with my shotgun and instadowned him. Chased off the other dude who ended up leaving the server.
---
Not a problem! :D
---
I didn't say it was confirmed, simply that I have heard chatter about it for a month of so. If I had 100% proof, I would have made my own feed about it.
---
no, disagree. there's many ways to implement safe spawns. however, fact is leave it broken is to me no option at all.
---
They actually haven‚Äôt sold at all. I‚Äôve got like 600 of them up in my vending machine. It‚Äôs like a 2 minute walk west of the Top of the World station (can‚Äôt remember the damn name), there‚Äôs always camps around it. Idk what the deal is.
---
Wow, don't think I've ever heard the "nuke over" message in-game.
---
As a Canadian I can confirm fucky is a word.  "I dunno Ricky, this seems all fucky to me right here" - Bubs
---
That is a great idea.
---
I'd like to see this, especially after the release of the vendors stuff, seems a natural next step
---
Neither do I because I run in fear when I see Battle Cattle.
---
If you mess around with your camp module placement you can actually customize your fast travel point
---
You are right, best thing people can do in the future with Bethesda games is to stop pre-ordering them. If people wait that Bethesda will finish their games first then they won't release them so buggy.
---
That's fine by me(just wanted to know if it's a problem on my side), take a look at a photo is it the same for you?
---
 Well i feel that out shouldn't be a atomic store item.  It should be a plan in game.
---
Thank you! This makes this really easy. I've been searching for these damn things forever without much luck and this saves me a ton of server hopping.
---
And an emergency protocol chest. 
---
I still rarely use V weapons as a low-health heavy. I prefer the damage output of bloodied, and between power armor, Emergency Protocols, and a teammate with Empath, healing isn‚Äôt often needed. I do have a V LMG for tanking the sheepsqautch though.
---
In my time about 16.00 to 21.00
---
I‚Äôm really hopping to see NPCs!
---
This.
---
Yeah I didn't think it was possible to get anything but max level from her
---
If I'd really done a good job, I would've found a better quote to snip, like this one:  
---
&gt;You might say "DoctorPrisme, don't go in zones too high for your level, grind a bit before you go there", but that shit happens on the main quest's road.
---
Closer to 15 but I see your point.
---
Has to be a random spawn don't forget...
---
Damn it im on ps4
---
I know...  I'm not looking forward to it. Wish I was able to find more plans/ mods for the lever in the wild, but I'm sure everybody says this regarding their chosen weapon.
---
Same in German.
---
Fast traveling across map without true purpose is really fun, right ;)
---
But I thought it was intended to only drop max level items
---
I get most of my content from Juicehead on Youtube. Nuclear Winter had Loading screen hints leak about a TDM and if there‚Äôs that, there‚Äôs more such as Free for all.
---
Battle Royale leak was from an announcer voice files about ‚Äú closing A ring of fire ‚Äú. All this starting from Vault 51. 
---
Wastelanders is more of a educated guess from the teaser image. (A person not in a Vault suit holding hands with Vault boy, with a town with lights on in the background) I recommend Juicehead for a more comprehensive look. 
---
Also I‚Äôm looking forward to Wastelanders more, as it is more like a traditional fallout game with choice and consequence apparently.
---
[Here‚Äôs the video](https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ)

---
I can agree...i see your a man of culture and sophistication.
---
Yeah he‚Äôs a rare spawn mate normally has a unique outfit on him too
---
Every. Fucking. Time
---
Ha!  You found the Charleston bot.  If he had any outfits I hope you bought them.  Same with the plans.  You can sell them in your vending machine for a lot!
---
Then why post here?
---
I've only heard it one time, and it was only because I was inside the nuke zone when it ended. I've never heard it at any other distance.
---
Ionized meat from nuke zones. Much better fine-control of rad levels. One death takes me from 20 to 30% rads; toxic goo would nuke me back down to like... 10% health. Ionized meat puts me right above 20%, then it‚Äôs just a food item or two and I‚Äôm back on target,
---
I agree.
---
Im there lol!!! But no, I don't use voice chat, I play sometimes with a friend and we use Discord. I also mute people that walk with open mic. Very anoying to hear them speaking or whatever they do
---
I built close to there in the twin ponds where the oil seep is.
---
Imo there are already death traps if you go to a vendor who didn't turn off their turrets üòÇ
---
because I want to know if it‚Äôs changed at all
---
Same. I only use it if I really have to, like in nuke zones where you'll get torn to shreds without it. I like dressing my character in cool outfits, and having to cover that up in a set of power armor just bums me out. There's not nearly as much diversity in power armor as in other outfits.
---
What was the exact name of the plan you learned?
---
Plus double stash too!!!!
---
And he‚Äôs going to sprinkle Fasnacht confetti all over the crowd wearing the diver armor that never came out while singing Country Roads.
---
Yup, that‚Äôs exactly where I found him. Cool.
---
Yeah, I see your point. Still, like someone else said, whatever you're not selling must be good shit, so they can always try.
---
I only have these two on hand at the moment.

---
I'll take that AA/E/W handmade off your hands in a heartbeat.
---
Yeah, it's referred to as the charleston vendor, but it appears by the charleston train station as well as by the ice cream shop further north.  It has a few unique plans like you saw, but it also has two random outfits. They can be regular crap you can find elsewhere, or they can be unique to the vendor (hunter's coat, longshoreman outfit, colored ski outfits, clean straight jackets etc)
---
What weapon are you using? I had to use a grog ax none of my unarmed weapons were giving quest reward.
---
Certainly becomes more prevalent the higher level you become which has forced me to not group with people on my main.
---
What they should do is make a [spawn rug or mat] that you place down in your house so you only have one spawn location for your house and you can put it where it's most convenient.
---
It might be my buddy, with PA with a jet pack you can almost land over by Summerville lol.
---
That's the responder vendor bot. He's been in the game since the start, but he can be extremely elusive!
---
Best place to find him is at Charleston train station, he is one of the random spawns that occur there. However, people often camp there making the spawn harder if not impossible. However he spawns other places too - the road junction south of the Junkyard workshop near Morgantown and down the road from lady Jane's soft serve are 2 other locations he can be found.
---
He always stocks 2 clothing items, including the hunters long coat, although which 2 he has varies. It can take many server hops just to find the guy, let alone hope he has what you are looking for.
---
beautiful lighting!
---
I‚Äôm on PS4 and I‚Äôm literally always singing Hamilton in game chat. I either get shot at or added as a friend, so mixed results.
---
agree. and it shouldnt be too hard to do it griefer-safe.
---
Your comment made it sound like bethesda has talked about it which I don't think is the case. The only chatter I've heard is from youtubers making assumptions based on nothing.
---
I killed a scorched and it worked for me.
---
yes. way too often. and right now we are all here to change that^^
---
You met the travelling vendor bot. You'll generally find them near Charleston station or Lady Janet's ice cream. Limited stock, but where you'll find the Hunters long coat if you're really lucky. For Charleston you need to slide down to 2nd railway bridge then back to station for a chance of seeing the bot. Lady Janet's you need to head to the overturned bus to the west of lady Janet's to try your luck.
---
Its intended to drop near your lvl but most ppl have never had that happen... On the known bugs it has be acknowledged and will be fixed in the future.
---
And then he will announce the addition of Creation Club on top of the Atom Shop cus they gotta make that money for Starfield
---
Hahaha understandably so. I played lots of Fallout 3, 4 and New Vegas and now sometimes play 76 during the week. Be sure to send me a party invite when I‚Äôm online and playing 76 as I usually play alone.
---
Yeah ..becuase that would kinda be play to win in sorts.
---
Ya really, I've been waiting for something like that but it has never came out
---
true, but only by rebuild. terrible solution and surely not an acceptable one.
---
Nice build :) I was going to make a tower bar/hotel inside a pylon but the aforementioned problems stopped me esp the item floating/intersecting bug. And you hit the nail on the head with the settlement budget issue.
---
^^
---
What platform do you play on?
---
Would now be a wrong moment to mention my first 2 guns from her were a 3* TSE Gattling and a 2* Exploding LMG?
---
Everything I got after that was shit though and immediately went back into the legendary exchange machine.
---
No Gatling guns (non energy)  though huh?
---
I killed a super mutant with a knife.
---
Just curious but what platform are you playing? Xbox?
---
Does the lmg count as heavy or comando?
---
And when the crowd starts throwing things at him he‚Äôll pull a wiffle bat out and start hitting mutfruit into the crowd.
---
It's the Fallout equivalent of "You are out of ______ on the shelves, I know you have more in the back - can you go check for me".
---
I was using a power first. I personally would expect that to work.
---
but now it should. as this issue became more terrible by implementing vending machines, as now ppl ft more often to camps :_)
---
I used a sledgehammer on the ghouls at Ohio river adventures and it worked for me, I‚Äôve seen others say unarmed weapons don‚Äôt work for the challenge.
---
Its not tse that sucks it's your build my tse automatic handmade does 160 a shot
---
This, I don't pvp a lot but when I do I keep enough junk to make it worth someone's time.  Simple rule is this, don't ever carry more than you're willing to lose.  If you kill me and I lose a ton of stuff, that's on me not whoever killed me.
---
I agree. Just swap to a one or two handed something and kill one.
---
They want to see what build you‚Äôre working with
---
Then the blizzard devs will come by and ask if we all own phones instead of making a new diablo game for the actual players lol
---
I have never been able to hear voice chat since the first day I played
---
lol. True. Absolutely doable if everybody had a mic. Or an emote that somehow expressed that.
---
I play with my kid. We have the dual TV set up . So I'll add you so you're not alone. Lol
---
A guest book would be a fun camp item,.
---
They're mostly a handy reminder if the "repeatable" missions are ready to go, but I think they realized they're going to run out of logical places for posters as pick up for new content questlines.  Your terminal has an "Alerts" section that's seemingly generated from some AI or something we can't interact with that was part of the Charleston Herald.  When Purveyor arrived it had map coordinates for anyone gutsy enough to investigate some unusual seismic activity, then when Project Paradise opened the new alert was about possible escaped lab animals at Arktos.  Again little misc. objective if you weren't sure which way to go.
---
That‚Äôs cool. Just don‚Äôt start requesting stuff. Lol
---
There are so many possibilities.  I can‚Äôt wait.
---
I always found this a fun quirk of the game.
---
I‚Äôm with you at least they didn‚Äôt have a week long live stream just to fuck with us
---
I reserve trading for swapping materials and stuff with my actual teammates, especially if there are other people around who could swipe it if I were to drop it on the ground for them. I'm not about to put anything I want to give a teammate into the vending machine just in case some rando pops in and swipes it while they are trying to get it.
---
Thank you soo much
---
Hell yah it would! Like a funeral but cooler. Lol.
---
Yup happens to me all the time, and some people dont even have maps locations near there house so you have to travel a distance to get there but then they dont have what you need so it was a huge waste of time, kind of annoying
---
Don't try running in the whitesprings bunker with it equipped...
---
Dumb question but is there somewhere to watch?  YouTube stream?
---
For starters, I use the God Roll Meat Hook. From there, I run a full Unyielding set. I also run all the mutations (because I'm lazy). You don't really need Egghead or Emplath. But you do need anything damage-related (i.e. Talons, Adrenal Reaction). Obviously Marsupial and Bird Bones. I also recommend Carnivore. 
---
For consumables, I try to have these on hand at all times. 
---
Mutant Hound Steaks, Mutton Chops, Yao Guai Ribs, and Glowing Meat Steaks. Each give you 10% melee damage, and they stack. Deathclaw Steaks are nice too.
---
I use Fury for smaller boss fights, and Nukashine for epic fights.
---
Here is my current build. For even more damage, sub out Travelling Pharmacist for Incisor.
---
With those things in place, you will run 2.5k per hit. With Adrenaline, as you kill things, you get a rolling damage buff, which can get you up to about 3.25k - 4k. Then, you have Fury and/or Nukashine, taking you to 6k-8k.
---

---
If your sentinel is active, the DR difference is minimal. PvE or PvP? PvP almost no difference as everyone has a ton of armor piercing anyway, PvE as long as sentinel is active, the dr difference is probably 5% more/less damage taken.
---
"...at your earliest convenience."
---
I‚Äôm in, and Dm you on what platform
---
Power Fist is considered unarmed. Use a bat, sledgehammer, sword, etc
---
they really should have Brahmin immune as part of the camp protection.
---
and please the free range Brahmin too. poor creatures get defended then just murdered after :(
---
It's a heavy. It's fun to use, but it chews through .308 like crazy.
---
The ME isn't really nothing to write home about
---
1 piece of perfect armor is worth less than 1 perfect weapon, imo.
---
yes, this is the biggest problem that comes with it. north, next to the lighthouse there is already a bit lack of ft points, and when one has his camp there, better get some decent walking shoes and go^^
---
Oh man, that would get sooo ugly so fast. The hatespeech and slurs, just overwhelming.
---
Make sure to use the perk blocker and also nerd rage or adrenaline either or is fine and also martial artist to do faster melee hits or gladiator or slugger , barbarian is also a good perk.
---
I use the mic from my ps camera, so I'm usually muted unless I need to talk to someone. But they fixed the "auto" option in the audio settings a few updates ago, I feel like people don't know that so they're usually on area or team instead of auto.
---
Add me! Ign Asully102
---
Some weapons don't have a hardened receiver or a receiver that increases damage at all. The prime receiver is then the only way to mod a higher damage for it.
---
I haven't seen the 91 spawn since they changed how taming works. I believe they are removed but with the rng I can't say for sure.
---
The 91 deathclaw was bugged and would not stop attacking your own camp and did no damage and also reverted to lvl 21 anyway.
---
Agreed. What outfit do you have on now? I have the clown suit on..and matching hat. Lol
---
Wow! That is impressive!
---
.... 0% vats chance doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt hurt her. Hit her without VATS.
---
Does your regular armor add +1 to strength?
---
I haven't, actually. Does it make a difference and if so, how?
---
People just want human interaction, man. These days it's all about automation and efficiency - sure there's a place for that in modern Appalachia, but sometimes you just want to do business face to face, with another person instead of all this clickey-clackey, button pushy, robo-brain style shopping. 
---
AND YES JUST MAYBE they're trying to tack on an HJ as part of the deal, can you blame a wastelander for trying!? It gets lonely out in the hills.
---
They do, you have to use a melee weapon, not an unarmed weapon‚Äîwhich the Power Fist is. 
---
I know, unarmed weapon is an oxymoron. I don‚Äôt make the rules.
---
I just finished this challenge. Took maybe 15 minutes. Definitely need a one or two handed melee. The Unstoppable Monster is awesome so far
---
Np and it needs to happen.
---
Don't let others tell you not have this fixed due to trap rooms. We will have a solution to that if someone makes those.
---
I made a post before they kept talking about trap rooms.
---
Interesting.  I never thought of it that way.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
There are different setups and build layouts for PvE compared to PvP.
---
Added you! Mine is slakr4life365

You bump into a friendly robot. You do damage to it. The entire bunker goes hostile against you. You die üòÇ

You can add me (EST) if you‚Äôd like! I normally only run around doing quests or trying to discover areas I haven‚Äôt been to yet.  Or farming for outfits ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüòÇ

I‚Äôm currently level 106, and don‚Äôt mind helping out!  I‚Äôm not the best at this game but I try lol
---
PSN: jamilla0126
---
I got a deathclaw about a week ago with just 1, don't remember which... 4cha
---
Sorry this is strictly PvE
---
Lol ya... May be in the chest most of its life but just lumbering around in PA dispensing freedom sounds amazing üòÖ
---
Thanks pal, I'll be sure to ask more about this? Would be interesting to find out if they're generally moving in the direction of 'traditional Fallout' as that's what most people seem to want, myself included
---
That's gorgeous. My favorite picture was when my newest teammate was trying to figure out emotes and she ended up vomiting on me while I was giving a thumbs-up. It was perfectly timed.
---
Nice! I just finished playing for a bit, I'll probably be on tomorrow
---
Well people should get booted for bullying. But I do agree jerks would do that.
---
I wish the quest Death from Above didn't pop up so when that siren and voice comes up its genuinely alarming
---
I kind of do that, when I take over a someone's workshop, strip everything down to nothingness and then leave one wall with a generator for a neon sign that says "DO BETTER"
---
This. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a true griefer and I‚Äôm more hours in than I‚Äôd like to admit. The worst I‚Äôve had is a couple folks trashing my vendor base because it was by Charleston train station and they thought I was blocking the vendor bot spawn.
---
I got nerd rage and adrenaline blocker isn‚Äôt maxed and I‚Äôm running an unarmed (DCG) so I just need iron fist right?
---
I like to slap them back without turning my pacifist mode off.  They can't kill me and I can't kill them but it REALLY pisses them off when I slap them back in pacifist.lol
---
trap rooms is just crap. there's many things bethesda can do to avoid that. however, i feel we both agree that leaving it broken as it is is definitely not acceptable^^ cheers dude^^
---
Stealth build is fun, survival is one that makes me jump when peeps stealth kill one shot it's a wtf moment but makes u laugh cuz u just jumped a little off the couch...
---
I‚Äôm a junk addict, so there‚Äôs that, to each his own.
---
Yeah, the rumor is for wastelanders, That it‚Äôs a time jump from killing the scorch beast and People settle in West Virginia after the coast is clear from scorched. Definitely check them juicehead videos Iinked!
---
Even just like 10 pages of the word poo, or "Bethesda is incompetent" that one seems popular with ppl.
---
Jesus, it looks like my sister's living room. 
---
So basically you nailed it.
---
It's not possible yet. 7600 hours is roughly 316 days.

Great to hear brother, and through Reddit üëç
---
To the best of my knowledge it does, in PVE. Chameleon has a 20% increase to stealth rating (whatever that is) per piece. Chameleon mutation has a 100% increase. 
---
Per a data miner I talked to months ago, anyway. 
---
Visually it makes no difference. But the internal stealth-detection mechanics with mobs, yeah, it should matter.
---
Something like the guest book at a wedding, where you can sign your name and leave a short message/memo. That would be awesome. And vice-versa. It'd be great to be able to leave a note like "if that stupid mole rat came back, please beat it to death with your fists. He won't stop eating my corn".
---
I always have enough shit to repair weapons it's ballistic fiber I never have enough of so I can never wear armor anymore. U just have to know where to farm and pick up enemy weapons if u have to in the middle of farming
---
Take an upvote my good man. I am what I call a clean character (no mutations, chems, or alcohol) I don‚Äôt use a lot of legendaries and I try to force the game to be challenging (ie solo everything) I have also run across what amounts to 13 year olds who feel big cus they can read a guide and cuss so ya you‚Äôre right most of these guys just suck see out there in the wastes actually probably not I‚Äôm basically a hermit that stays away I won‚Äôt even go to peoples shops if there are more than 1 person there at a time
---
It takes 316 full days of playing to get to 7600 hours. I dont think its been 316 days since the beginning of november last year.
---
If you open the launched there is a "Verify and Repair" open, I'd run that and it might help, it fixed my FPS issues before. 
---
I'd also check all your drivers are upto date. 
---
Hope this helps :)
---
Naw base model works. Modded May help but I‚Äôve never notice any difference
---
Lol. You meanie! Lol. This is why I dont fart with workshops.
---
I could see that, maybe if I wasn't a grizzled old man I could enjoy pvp. It's just really not my deal these days tho. Halo 4 was my last war.
---
very nice build!!
---
Yes! You have the right idea Mrtorbear! Lol.
---
Yeah, I don't quite get why it's there. You don't gain any rewards from it, and except for the occasional weekly/daily challenge there's no reason to just finish "quests" for the sake of doing so. Only thing I can imagine is that the voice line is tied to the quest, so that somebody who logs into the server while the countdown is going on can still get the notification. But that's an extremely rare situation, and unless you spend all your time in a popular nuke place it will most likely not even affect you. And even then it can take too long for the quest to show up to be of any help.
---
I'm amazed by how many clicks and views people can get by coming out with a BETHESDA LIES PLAYERS REVOLTING title to their videos with misinformation.
---
Okay. The defensive tips I can give you are from experience: 
---
-Use barbarian and blocker indefinitely
---
- I also use evasive and serendipity maxed
---
- Dodgey can used if you don‚Äôt rely on your AP or if you have more than 3 Powered armor pieces 
---
- for pve melees I lean more towards an unyielding sentinel set compared to cavalier because I stand there and swing compared to running all around the enemy
---
I have my camp set up at a place where 3 brahmin always spawn and it's pretty out of the way so I've never looked into a server with the brahmin dead
---
being a heavy weapon build my favourite bug is;
---
Firing any automatic gun and having my Xbox freeze for a second or 2 before anything happens, by the time it's playing again the enemy has moved from where I was firing, I have excellent internet and don't experience this in any other game.
---
Lmao! Too funny!
---
Totally
---
How many atoms you get for that ?!
---
No worries
---
I don't run blocker (not saying anything bad about it). I maxed out Serendipity and Dodgy.
---
Haha glorious. Ugh.
---
Is your carry weight nearly at the hard cap (1600, I think)? If so, it may be rolling legendaries that are so heavy they would take you over that cap so it won't let you have them, so you keep rerolling until you get a knife or something light. 
---
I really hope that's *not* it, because if it is, just think of all the amazing gear she could have rolled for you which has disappeared into the ether!
---
definitely gets my vote. let's hope we get that fix!
---
i agree
---
the voice that announces it is kinda hot, after all
---
Oh and we all know melee is broken, how can someone from Australia and someone from America BOTH be having melee troubles on the same server?Realistically at least one of us should be connecting with the hits but nope.
---
37, bit of a cross between too nice a guy and a cranky SOB.  Mostly only do team with my Wife (We've each got a Solo Main, and an Alt that only gets played when we're planning on attacking a problem together, not just technically being teamed if we're both in a shooting things mood but the various reasons my Solo Main is like 5x hers' level have me concerned I'd cause us to both wipe if we're on the lowbies.  That all said, you're welcome to send me a friend request.  If I'm online a time you are, send me a msg on psn as a heads up, and at the very least I might be able to lend you a hand with gear upgrades.  Crafting and CAMP building are zen for me some times.
---
CloakedStoat on PSN, like most places.  Either way, see you around.
---
Lol, I hear ya, I'm a mutant freak, but that's cause kangaroo legs are just too fun. But otherwise a hermit myself, so you have fun out in the wastes aswell. And if we ever meet, I'm sure we'll just turn around and run in opposite directions, and I will likely be hiding in a tree or something similar. Happy travels.
---
I've found out about it the hard way... üòÇ
---
Give me a rainbow power armor skin
---
More games should split the player base. They are allowing people to get the game type they prefer withing the same universe. It is especially beneficial for separating all of the aggressive players that are all about destruction, from the players who are all about cooperation.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt dodgy hurt your AP though? I supposed better to lose AP Than to die
---
Oh! Paint is a great idea too.
---
Eh, you quit. Why come back?

It's unlikely you'll be happy with it regardless of any improvements.
---
The amount of squatter's in my camping spot.
---
Fellow queer here, and...hadn't even considered it. That would be incredible, but I'll admit being a bit pessimistic on...anything at all. There are certain markets where it would harm their sales.
---
This happened to me the other day someone was shopping and I came to find a rad rat trapped in the floorboard half in half out just sitting there...
---
There's this super peaceful/relaxing game called "Farm Together" that has a guest book just like that. You can basically visit anyone's farm and help tend to their crops/animals, then leave a little note in their guest book. That's where the idea came from.
---
Make laser weapons shoot rainbows.
---
Only 20
---
5mm?? But even at 1 cap it's a terrible deal! That's strange. I'm on PC, what are you playing on? Maybe that's making a difference.
---
That's what I've been doing myself. Farming bog quests maybe I'll hit the mire
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ.. 20 atoms !! For real! That‚Äôs a troll üòÇüòÇ
---
Only a measly 80; I feel like anyone that actually manages to complete that challenge should get something more like 1000 or even 2000 atoms.
---
IGN is same as reddit name. More than welcome to add me
---
Always in a PS party but will go to voice chat if I see someone trying to talk to me.
---
I take 1 rank of barbarian as it maxes at 40 and with unyeilding boosting strength more than lvl 1 barbarian seems a waste to me, I don‚Äôt bother with ironclad as I‚Äôve only 4 points in endurance and I use radicool and lead belly 3 (to micro manage those rads lol). To stay alive as much as possible I use the lead lined backpack and rad x diluted when fighting ghouls to keep from getting too many rads, and the armour plated backpack (which is 90 damage resistance) when fighting everything else. I also have lvl 1 of blocker and having faster swing speed on your melee weapon of choice definitely helps with slicing through mobs but if you don‚Äôt have swing speed the perk martial artist helps. Oh and mutations, I have grounded for energy weapon resistance, scaley skin for damage resistance, and when all else fails I jump about with marsupial in an effort to dodge damage while hitting items on my fav wheel to recuperate or avoid further damage. Finally if you don‚Äôt already use them nerd rage, serendipity and born survivor 1 are a must to cut down on avoidable deaths.
---
Ill be playing later on today, add me Super_POG.
---
I heard the bog. I'll do some ash heap farming.
---
I tend to get my encounter at the Mothman museum if that helps.
---
Thanks! it took a while to find the right color scheme to give a nice glow. Its amazing during the night.
---
Well I just got either 1 or 2 ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. On my Pip-Boy it shows I have 2, but when I go to the possum dispenser it shows I have 3. Either way I finally got one!
---
Nice! I've currently got on the Explorer outfit and aviator sunglasses. I really dig it because it looks like something I'd wear out and about in real life.
---
Pc as well. 
---
Yeah some dude bought all 3500 rounds of 5mm at 1c each. Idk if he was trying to clear his cap bank or what, but I‚Äôm happy with it haha.
---
As evidenced by the downvotes, I guess you‚Äôre right.
---
Level 360 wow!!!!
---
I‚Äôm at 185 and I still like the challenges and finding new places. What I like to do when I run into level 2 to level 5 is make a 10 mm pistol drop it with 50 rounds, 1 stim, 1 disease cure, 1 radaway, 1 radx, 5 purified water, 5 nuka quantums.  Wait til they grab it and then,
---
Poof!!!
---
Yes, i forgot to mention that as well, iron fist is super good for punches.
---
Yes and yes. With Serendipity, you only get hit 55% of the time, and with Dodgy you take 30% less damage. Yes at a cost, but even though my health stays low, I try not to die more than I have to. 
---
As they say, your DPS is 0 when you're dead. And honestly I only really Power Hit on the first hit when I'm in stealth, like when I'm 1-Shotting a Sheepsquatch. So AP isn't as important during combat.
---
If you do get to ask a question, I would forsure steer away from spoiler type of questions that they most likely will give you some PR answer for, id def ask a question regarding a specific aspect of mechanic in the game
---
Choo choo!!! 
---
The nuke train is a comin!!!!
---
As a Heavy Weapon user; Yes!
---
I'm getting in fine currently and in the last 5 minutes.
---
This game is impossible to balance as-is. The damage output and survivability you can reach with a proper perk, mutation, and legendary build is so vastly beyond what a new player with random gear and a nocturnal double-barreled shotgun can achieve is ridiculous. It‚Äôs like expecting a new level 60 in classic WoW to be able to tank Onyxia, except potentially far worse, since every level up in WoW gives you combat-oriented skills. You can reach 50 in 76 without taking ANY combat perks. 
---
For example. My 1star bloodied primed 50cal on my main does around 300 damage a shot. If I got my hands on a bloodied explosive version, it‚Äôd be closer to 400 damage a shot. That‚Äôs ignoring Adrenaline build-up or any chem buffs.
---
Baseline, no perks, no mods, 50cal, is what, 45 damage a shot? That‚Äôs about a 9x improvement over baseline. 
---
That‚Äôs the difference between an informed player who has been able to get top-tier gear, vs a new player who just dinged 50.
---
Which was fine in WoW, because there was a clear line of progression to get to that point. There isn‚Äôt one in 76. There‚Äôs very little warning before the queen fights, or the Imposter, or even Arkatos, that these are ‚Äúhard‚Äù enemies. And those are the *only* enemies that are even remotely hard (and the end boss in Arkatos for my main is still a cakewalk. About 10 seconds of fire takes it down, I just have to avoid getting hit and protect the friendly)
---
You HAVE a "Welcome Mat"... it's literally the exact position of your "CAMP" when you first place it.  ALL visitors to your camp (that aren't you) will spawn there consistently.  Does it suck to have to re-design your camp around this... yeah... but until a better solution presents itself just make a new/better camp with that position in mind.  
---
As well... expect that people will move from that position as your camp materializes... so don't build it in a way that walking a few steps in any direction will cause them to get stuck.  Leave your doors unlocked (or at least provide a way out).  
---
Bottom line... if you aren't selling anything, then build whatever camp you like... but if your machine is powered up and you are actively encouraging players to come to your camp to shop... then do the basic required updates to your camp so that they can actually do that.  
---
I have a policy, where if I get stuck in a camp wall (that wasn't my fault), if everything is locked, if I have to spend 5 minutes trying to find your vending machines, if I step on a fucking pungi board, if your prices are rediculous, etc... at a bare minimum your cow is going to die and/or I'm going to shit on your bed.  The other day we came across a camp that did ALL of the above... and I've never been a "griefer", but we turned Pacifist off, picked the locks, lobbed a ton of grenades (for kicks), and when the owner arrived and tried to claim his bounty we put him down hard.  I even took his junk.  If you choose to "welcome" players to your place... make it welcoming.
---
That sounds cool. I wear a clown outfit in real life all the time. Lol. Jk. I'd get beat up.
---
I would accept it if it had the exact same limitations as the voice chat. Serverwide text chat would be rancid shit.
---
Rainbow gatling plasma sounds awesome!!
---
Sounds like a awesome game to me!
---
Did just have some pretty strong storms roll through. Might be an issue with the interwebs.
---
Definitely and good luck to you.
---
I agree!
---
&gt; Fact of the matter is, being a bloodied character is super easy, and as we all know 
---
Well, I'd invite you to trade places with me in front of the Scorchbeast Queen without Power Armor.
---
Bugged game mechanics REEEE. /s
---
Wait till they grab it then, poof what? You leave? Or you dissapear them lol
---
I can't get near low levels, they run like the wind when they see me coming. I went to some guy's camp yesterday and he logged soon as he saw my level. It makes me sad
---
5 points to the first person to make a meme of the Lucky Charms mascot w/ a gatling laser that fires rainbows
---
If you can‚Äôt fast travel within a blast zone, you shouldn‚Äôt be able to load in at one.
---
Got a bloodied explosive gatling 2* and sold it for 17k caps. Then got a 3* AAE FR Handmade and traded for a Bloodied VATs Crit FR lever +5k caps. Happy with both trades
---
That's American English, I'm not American (thankfully) the correct English (British) spelling of offence, is exactly as I used it, so  I do practice what I preach. The definition is below for your edification;  
---
 \- There is no difference in meaning between **offence** and **offense**. They're exactly the same in all their definitions. The difference is that **offense** is the preferred spelling in American English, while **offence** is preferred in British, Indian, Canadian, and Australian English.
---
It's funny. I no sooner said this then got stuck shortly after. I got served karma for something I guess.
---
Yup. Is it more of an issue on the XBO?
---
Leveling to 188 is meaningless and a waste of time and your stats are the same as they were at 72.
---
Are you selling for cheaper than vendor s buy it?
---
r/unexpectedtrebuchet
---
It is a ton of fun. Great to just veg out and relax with no worries about time limits, enemies, or anything negative. You just drive your little tractor around and harvest crops and feed super cute animals to unlock cooler crops and cuter animals. The co-op aspect of it makes it great for friends to just drop in and say hi without any formal invites or parties.
---
Mods and private servers.
---
I‚Äôm around 1600..
---
The general rule of thumb is that you want to go for things that offer flat damage reduction, not DR/ER.  The workhorses are going to be perks like Serendipity, Lone Wanderer, and Dodgy.  Blocker and Suppressor can also help.  And then, there's Sentinel and Cavalier armor (any armor with the 75% chance to reduce incoming damage when standing still/sprinting).
---
In my experience, I have a lot more luck with Sentinel than Cavalier.  I mean, you can *always* stand still, but it takes actual AP to maintain a sprint.
---
Sound awesome on paper, but it'll be an easy way for griefer to salt more the Wastelands :/
---
We should have infinate renames so we could do this to everything
---
I guess, I‚Äôm not having any issues applying mods or crafting upgrades on PS4 so I was just curious. 
---
That sucks man
---
I‚Äôm so goddamn excited for this!
---
They haven't really done any seasonal events other than Fasnacht. I guess I could see some rainbow flags or somesuch in the Atomic Shop.
---
Having failed at the manufacturing plant, I will say that the map provided by Mapallachia here:
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY](https://imgur.com/a/4Js8sCY) 
---
Got me what I needed. Thanks Mapallachia!
---
but until better solution...
---
when? will they do it by theirselves? will bethesda fix it? 
---
NO!
---
that's why i posted this here, to just get that. and it seems there's a lot of ppl want to see a fix too. you don't get anything, if you don't do anything.
---
however, to me it's absolutely not acceptable to bother with an issue like that and do workarounds in a game paid full price, but demand a bit of quality on something so simple as a spawn point.
---
and also, again, destroy and rebuild is also absolutely not acceptable and if bethesda would offer me a solution like this the last thing they would see by me would be a middlefinger in the air and my back.
---
Lots of people are saying gamma guns/radiation, and I just want to add that so far, nothing I‚Äôve tested has increased the RADIATION damage at all. But a gamma gun with automatic mods (and I want to say deep dish mod? Does like 125 rads with a fire rate of 91, so you don‚Äôt really NEED anything else. That‚Äôs a lot of rads, really fast, on someone who would probably die to about 200 rads worth of damage. 
---
The problem with the gamma gun is it‚Äôs not hitscan, and it‚Äôs very noisy and visible, so you have to be fairly close, and it‚Äôs not at all stealthy.
---
Plus the ammo is rare. Not sure how expensive crafting it is.
---
I have almost your system but 32 g of ram and a gtx 970 (before i upgraded to rtx 2070), my 970 was able to run ultra no problem with no lag or anything.  Might be your internet connection.
---
Maybe they want you to see what they have and work out a deal
---
Many events are spawned by players.
---
Things like Campfire and Arkos  (even Encryptid) are avoided, so they don't spawn as much anymore.
---
You can spawn Campfire and Arkos and other location specific events by just by going to them.  And then hope that others join you, or hope they don't depending on the event.
---
Durkur Duur
---
The only thing I've found that helps so far is to immediately start jumping away from the camp as its loading. Doesn't always work but its better than becoming a C.A.M.P decoration.
---
I didn't think it was that surprising, tbh. It's a bit of a weird value given that the 3-point perk adds 30% on one hit, but they probably didn't want it to stack much past 50% together with the legendary ability.
---
Tenderizer also stacks to 40%, which is higher than I expected, but not as exploitable.
---
I was just thinking about how the Enclave route in FO76 feels way more end game than the BOD route.
---
I sell bulk aluminum and screws and they're gone as soon as I put them in.
---
I don't get the plastic, watoga high and fort defiance floors 3+4 will yield 150 plastic total.
---
Why? Those aren‚Äôt the definition of legacy. Legacy means unobtainable now.
---
Sunrise field. It has a couple mirelurk spawns, usually 2 kings and 3 normals with a guaranteed queen. There's a decent chance of a 3* legendary there, and a consistent magazine spawn upstairs in the farmhouse. The rooftops are great for sniping the mirelurks, even though the queen and kings can still hit you up there, but you get a lot of cover because the roof is sloped
---
Like I was telling another person, too bad there‚Äôs no emote for that.
---
Or all the Broadsiders you just avoided picking up.
---
Manta man outfit has a cape.
---
I don't think that's plausible.  The downtime on Tuesdays is planned, but whenever an individual server decides that it needs to shut down, it's because some kind of destabilizing problem has been detected.  Usually, it's reflected in the game itself too - hits not registering, laggy movement, etc..  You don't *want* to stay on that server any longer than you have to.  Yes, it sucks when you're in the middle of a silo or a nuke, but there's nothing you can do about spontaneous maintenance.
---
Having friends to let you rejoin a server, though, that's pretty essential if you want to run silos.
---
This isn't happening at my camp.   Regardless of where I move my camp tool people are spawning at the same spot every time.   I have moved the tool hoping it would change where people spawn in, it doesn't.   It does change where I spawn in.
---
Guy walks out of the room, ‚Äúson I can‚Äôt pause this game, you can walk around but just don‚Äôt do anything or shoot anyone ok?‚Äù
---
Well, I think they will follow on the same path as every online game for the last 20 years have taken, you don't based on you thinking they wont fix things (even though they are constanstly fixing things).
---
We are going to have to a disagree with each other!
---
I like the top of the mountain by the Observatory, which is why I built my CAMP there. I also like the area with all of the rivers and lakes in the far south.
---
and we both know for what it was^^ jk^^ at least you might see now that it needs a better fix than just run^^
---
Yeah it does
---
It took months but I randomly came across the dude at that one monument near the cemetary.
---
Then after that I continously find him or his wife in all these random spots I've been to before, but now that I found him once he wants to keep popping up lmao
---
Maybe he (she?) was waiting to revive someone for the possum badge
---
i agree, it's indeed better. but i think best is a serious fix^^ however, at least it didn't made you lose humor^^
---
Mosstown. I love it and wish there was more of a story there.
---
not bad idea... atoms laser skin laser rainbows edition XD.
---
Gotcha. I‚Äôve been hunting for Cavalier but as you said I‚Äôve not had much luck with it.
---
More like 250+ together if untouched, IIRC, but usually on PC they're cleared out. Too well known. Personally I find plenty of plastic in lesser locations, but I'd need more if I was crafting shotgun shells.
---
You‚Äôre amazing and my Stealth Commando level 50 loves you
---
I think my point here, is that it's working as intended (whether you like it or not).  This is NOT a bug that needs to be "Fixed".  This is the way it works... feel free to either build around this or politely ask for something better, but know that when someone spawn inside your foundation (without moving) it is 100% your fault because you built the camp that way and invited people.
---
Guess I learned something new then
---
...
---
These are stacking debuffs? Are you joking with me right now? How‚Äôd you learn this?
---
I‚Äôd say if that‚Äôs true for tenderizer, that‚Äôs insanely exploitable. 2 seconds is a long time on a gun with a fire rate of 90. And the implication of the perk card is it increases EVERYONE‚ÄôS damage to that target. 40% more damage to the queen from everyone, if one guy has an automatic weapon and is running Tenderizer? That‚Äôs massive.
---
That... might actually explain something that‚Äôs been puzzling me. I run a low health HW build, primed bloodied 1star 50cal, and while I know I do a lot of damage, I‚Äôve been feeling lately like a 1man army- on big boss fights, with groups of randoms, I‚Äôve really been feeling like everyone else wasn‚Äôt doing shit for damage- when I change targets to clean up trash mobs or whatever, and then go back to hitting the boss, I feel like their HP had barely moved. Then I open up and suddenly it starts noticeably dropping. I didn‚Äôt imagine I should be making THAT big an impact on my own. 
---
But, I run 3star tenderizer. If me firing on target is also making everyone do 40% more damage? Yeah, that starts to make sense. Holy fuck that‚Äôs OP for boss fights if true.
---
so stuck inside walls, beneath floors is working as intended??
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Sry^^ this made my day hahahaha^^
---
I can never keep enough rolling pins in stock...I‚Äôll go on a good long run for rolling pins, come back and it‚Äôs like, is there anything people won‚Äôt pay for a rolling pin?

---
I think it‚Äôs just a clever way of keeping track of how long you‚Äôve been playing.
---
It's not possible because the game was released in November 2018.
---
Seems to increase area of splash damage but against any decent enemies, that damage is almost negligable compared to the enemy who gets shot
---
Itll be right after the straight pride items!  I wish people would quit caring about who they screwed in their bedroom.  This game has nothing to do with straights or gays, quit trying to make it like that please....jeez
---
I think they should get to have the atomic shop in their camp for a day.
---
Ammo for me.   It might take a few days but when it is bought it goes for large chunks all at once, it just takes the right person to come along to buy it all.
---
Shame, trying to a 3*Hunters on PC specially for the queen.
---
Thanks for your comment. Always happy to help.
---
Mine ZFlameWolf I'll be on in a couple of hours also join the fallout discord there a leg and lots of people post daily to find people to play with
---
Did you find someone? If not, I can hop on really quick.
---
I clearly need to learn more about PVP.  Because that‚Äôs the kind of build I would like.  Would you mind explaining more about your build?
---
Yeah a dude did that to me the other day.
---
I invite random people when there's a non-aanounced event like herding the cows if no one else is joining me.
---
I've been trying since she launched to get a decent AA gatling gun. I roll only 3* ranged. while I've pulled a few things that were okay-ish; two days ago it rolled an AAE with faster reload handmade. I took a damn picture of that "once in a lifetime" moment.
---
I only do this when I find people selling non-legendary level 10 items and power armor pieces to bait people to their camp... Maybe it's you
---
TS executioners doesn‚Äôt exist. Do you mean explosive?
---
One of the silos, you can. But I forget which one. soon as you can, run down the hall and go up the porta-potty elevator and then peer over the lip of the low hill ... on one of  them you will see the missle coming out
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind that either.
---
Oh derp, yes üòÖ
---
I have both of those and so far it‚Äôs never initiated pvp.
---
Gotta remember a lot of players dont use reddit. I'd never have known about those places without coming here.
---
I'm sorry I can't help but bat my eyes when I see a big guy in Power Armor waving his Fatman around...
---
Ive had a few people request a good chunk of my weapons, including one guy requesting weapons he was 20+ levels away from being able to use.
---
Backed out of another trade, guy took offense and started smacking me around.  PAcifist is on, so I ignored him and went on about my merry way.
---
Also stories of ‚Äúrole playing as a raider‚Äù types who check your entire inventory to decide if they want to 1 shot you for whatever you happen to be carrying.
---
But yea, it does happen.
---
I‚Äôm the same way.
---
What about the CAMP system in general? We seriously need Place Anywhere. The system is so ridiculously bad. Heck, I tried building underground in the broken Cranberry Bog highway and couldn't do anything. The system is SO goddamn infuriating. When mods come out, making a mod like Place Anywhere compatible for 100% public sessions can't harm too much, just make it part of the goddamn vanilla.
---
Yes, the system is making me that mad. It's awful.
---
Damn
---
I guess.
---
Im just angry about the way they disrespected us through all this.
---
The fact that 3* Wood armor bug is still around is offensive.
---
Bots or r/fallout edgelords. 2 options, 2 predictions as to who or what is downvoting here.
---
Game a paradise because I turn voice chat off tbh.
---
Get bird bones mutation or whatever its called.  Boom, no worries
---
So no one can trash your camp even in survival?
---
Okie doke. I'll try to figure out a time when I can make one for ya.
---
I was thinking of going both! I've had it before but lost it.. was seriously gutted, but you cant do massive jumps even with it
---
It's not a TRUE PvP build, but it does surprisingly well in PvP, I don't have any assaisn/sentinal armor and such but VATS really good in PvP. I'll PM you my build in a bit, if you want it's a VATS Crit Riflemen.
---
it should catapult you into a pungee pit
---
Whoah. The intent was to celebrate what the rest of the country is celebrating right now; inclusion for all. I‚Äôll grant you that maybe the fallout universe doesn‚Äôt at first seem like it would matter, but given that it‚Äôs post-apocalyptic America, I think it‚Äôs relevant. And given your reaction, it seems more prudent than ever to find ways to celebrate all our fellow brethren.
---
Stacking power armor is OP. I‚Äôve built towers into the sky by stacking (I had a lot of sets) 
---
They don‚Äôt have gravity physics when placed, so they don‚Äôt fall, but they have collision physics, so you can jump on them and stack them.
---
I sell a bunch of fusion cores and fusion cell ammo. I make cells and cell the excess ones and then I generate fusion cores at my workshop and sell some of them. People buy my stuff but I might move because I‚Äôm next to Huntersville and I don‚Äôt think people travel there too often.
---
Lol.  Well done!  Unique concept that you‚Äôre obviously having fun with.
---
I had to help someone do this who lost their bag too far in to normally get to. 2 power armors ftw!
---
The ammo? Vendors don't buy ammo.
---
I have marsupial, bird bones, grounded and speed demon.  I was bored so i ran and jumped off a high cliff.  Got badly damaged but didnt die, i was happy lol.  (No, grounded has nothing to do with falling or jumping)
---
there is a few problems, but can't speak about placeable spots. i live in flatwoods since day 1 and never did move so far^^
---
There's probably 2,000-3,000 caps there, definetly enough to get murdered by a raider
---
Thanks. I got tons of those, gonna try that.
---
I have not yet
---
I found it within 10 minutes playing as I normally do.  I don't play the game that often and wasn't even looking for it, I knew it was around but cbf whether I had one or not.  Since then I have seen a camera in  plenty of locations and I only play about 4 hours a week.
---
I love reading happy Fallout stories! I‚Äôll take noobs under my wing around a Whitesprings run or something like that, and I‚Äôll drop them some cranberry stuff for extra XP and instruct them to get a potshot or two into every enemy and legendary before I kill them so that they get XP too. Helps them level up a bit quicker. Being low level in any Fallout game was always reeeeally tough, so I try to help out lil noobies so that they‚Äôll stay and keep playing :)
---
What they need to do is make a craftable welcome mat spawn location. So you can craft one to change the fast travel location/spawn point of your CAMP.
---
Paying for convenience of not farming, I guess.
---
My post was going to simply state how there are plenty of examples why letting the community decide the outcome of a game's story is a horrible idea but your post perfectly reflects this concern: "people are assholes if they dont do what I, ME, MYSELF, want"
---
I just learned about those places!
---
Why cheat? Man up and do it properly
---
I'm not saying I agree with their decision, just explaining why they've done things this way. I would love for people to fast travel at the right place at my camp.
---
Uh. This is a joke right? Lol
---
I‚Äôll be on and add you in a few minutes
---
WE can't do that on PC
---
How‚Äôs it cheating? Because I don‚Äôt give two fucks about the pvp side of it unlike you apparently.
---
Yeah, someone would use it to mess things up first five minutes.
---
What‚Äôs that? I hear Hamilton boys, let‚Äôs get him!
---
Any type of ammo? I'm specifically selling 5mm and .50 rn.
---
You know, this would work, if we could report them for hate speech if they said something nasty.
---
Some cunt has a bunch in my session. It‚Äôs annoying as fuck and their is no reason for it.
---
Iv never got anything at my lvl... Wonder how long it ups the drop. Iv been there 3 times now and 2 times no one was anywhere close,still got max lvl gear.
---
That's  why before I rebuilt my camp I made sure to fast travel to the spot so I would know where to not build they should just give you the option to set a spawn point for your camp using the build menu.
---
That's cheating to get a trophy
---
The other day i went to someone's camp to vend and when I spawned in.  I dropped off the cliff..  Fortunately I was in Power Armor.
---
I have a mike but I don‚Äôt really hear to much of anyone. I don‚Äôt really talk much either though.
---
Well fair enuff on that, however it also leads me to another thought. We should all respect each others differences because in some circumstances we need each others help. When I said it's easy to be bloodied, I was referring more so to pvp. It is probably harder when dealing with SBQ and I'de imagine Sheepsquatch imposter.
---
I've found that I had better chances of getting mods the more decked out the weapon was when scrapping. Just my perception of course, nothing factual.
---
No, i just class sexuality with religion and politics.  Everyone has different opinions and sometimes its best to keep them at home.  Im all for everyone able to do want they want but it shouldnt be forced onto other people.  There are people out there with opposing viewpoints, you proved it when you messaged someone else about down votes.
---
No, my carry weight was about 120/245.
---
Well there is a reason for it
---
And to be fair, after I spend caps coming to check out the TONS of stuff it says you're selling, and it's all trash marked up to ridiculous prices, like 10000 caps for non legendary guns, 15000 for plans, or your shops are littered with punji boards around them, I'm gonna try to fight you on principle.
---
How consistent is your data, were you able to replicate on demand?
---
I've heard different theories on this. The other one says it's depends on weapons in your inventory. If you have level 50 weapon in inventory, you get level 50 from purveyor. Low weapon, you get low level weapon... etc...
---
Yes....some of the weekly survival awards are legacy too
---
Nah I'm 218, super non hostile. Just wanna live my waster life. Pvp is last thing on my mind.
---
Lorde knows we need virtue signaling even in a post apocalypse!
---
Cheating would be either A a hack, B a ‚Äúcode‚Äù or C a mod. None of those are in place. I‚Äôll be doing EXACTLY what the trophies requests, kill a player 20 times and revive a player 20 times. Look go bitch on someone else‚Äôs thread about how your daddy touches you late at night when he thinks your asleep. Get the fuck out of here with your crying shit
---
That's odd, I waited till I'd tested it multiple times to make this post. Has been consistent as I said  for me.
---
Haha nice job. Do you use berserkers Weapons?
---
Huh?
---
They totally did Easter themed stuff, too, with the daily painted deathclaw eggs. Seasonal events are not out of the realm of possibilities.
---
Possibly bloodied characters who wanna show off.
---
That's strange. I usually get replies pretty quick, promptly explaining that they cannot help. Usually the replies are within a few business days.
---
Stop making foundations too high. foundations usually spawn around the time a player fors to get stuck
---
Who‚Äôs forcing what? You feel sexualized now?
---
I have loads of weapons in my inventory, I've done this 7 times now. And 3 of those times have been just after a high level player used the vendor and I got high level. Other times I was alone and got level 15. Would be quite a coincidence if this was random.
---
You just watched the Cyberpunk trailer, huh?
---
Don't you have to do something in Adventure to initiate PvP?
---
Lol just saying the amount of duped things is probably huge. Could be guns outfits masks armor ect .
---
Only by you
---
100 a day?! How is that possible? I haven't seen a legendary in almost 20 levels until I got "lucky" yesterday and picked up a one-star piece of garbage.
---
I'm talking actual in game events. Easter and Christmas just had Atom Shop stuff.
---
For those that are wondering, when you level up you can actually do pretty damn well naked if you use the right perks and items. I have the max level of Barbarian, Adamanteum Skeleton, Iron Clad, Rad Resistant, Lone Wanderer, and Junk Shield, and this combination give you some pretty damn good damage resistance. On top of that, I run all the max levels of shotgun perks including Enforcer, and I use a Two Shot Pump with 50% extra limb damage and +50 DR while aiming, so these days in combat really the only thing to worry about is rads, I can soak up damage as if I was in power armor. Plus, the Enforcer perk and legendary shotgun make it so that one or two shells will cripple just about anything, blowing the legs off charred ghouls and deathclaws. Robots are fun, Assaultrons are a breeze because one hit will usually blow off all their limbs and head, leaving those stupid, sexy things flopping around on the ground.
---
Yeah it‚Äôs getting pretty ridiculous
---
SJW's in the house!
---
Oh please. Forced joy in celebrating the worth of all Americans?  I‚Äôm sure you feel the same way on Independence Day.  Celebrating the basic decent treatment of others doesn‚Äôt hurt you at all.
---
I love that voice! That sultry nuclear technician assaultron.
---
Keanu overshadowed anything our Lord and savior Todd has to say later ü§£ I don‚Äôt even want to know what‚Äôs coming anymore.  Haha
---
Well 3 is a small sample size.. Maybe someone just FT out of there... Or a camp near by so it looks like no one is there. 
---
Also also sneaky boys dont show on the map so idk.
---
Its cool this time as i am getting close but when i was 15 i just wanted something i could useüò¢
---
I really just love the scenery and atmosphere in the Mire
---
And that's great.  But we're worried they're spending/spent time on a battle royal system that could have been better developed as PVE content.  Now if Nuclear Winter just has that PVP system as a very tiny fraction of it, then I'm fine, but if the majority of development was for battle royal?  Well, fuck then, we're going to be waiting a lot longer for actual content.
---
I'd be so full of tears if they said something nasty.
---
Meh,  mostly, technically a lvl 50 and a lvl 200 with the exact same gear, stats n perks are essentially the same strength. Just takes longer to lvl up the higher you are.
---
So this weekend I have been on a quest to get my BOS legs for my melee build char. I have spent all weekend server hopping to player camps looking for them. I counted out of 112 hops I did to player camps, there were 64 times that I spawned into a building piece that required me to then have to quick travel again to get free. That cost me an additional 162 caps to do. Now for those of you that are maxed caps or have 20K caps its down in the noise, but to my now level 51 char who only has 2K or so, it is a huge deal! This really does need to be fixed!
---
The Burrows. As a dungeon it was disappointing, but as a location, it‚Äôs awesome. Honestly, I just want to live down there.
---
Which makes them prime rib.
---
Have you played the game at all in the last few months? Other players are completely unable to damage you or your camp if you don't fight back. If someone is pelting you with bullets, just ignore them and they'll get bored enough to leave.
---
Im going to enjoy the unpopular guy and say I agree.
---
Theres not enough people alive in the post apocalypse to have "minority-focused" pride months.  It would be pure virtue signaling which is annoying.
---
Never saw anything from him except the first Matrix movie, honestly. And that's because it was mandatory back in highschool.
---
I hope they use a mechanic from fallout 4, where when you fast travel, you spawn on a player placed welcome mat.
---
Reducing shadow distance and shadow quality does a lot. Google for .ini settings.
---
Unless you're in an event.
---
Official response from Purveyor Murmrgh:
---
*MMUAUAGSHWUDHDIJDJWIEUJDWIUHAUHSIUDHXHDIUHHEIWJED,MMGGEHJJGGHGH*
---
I'm üíØ will you on that. People spawn where the camp was first placed, &amp; most players don't seem to realize it. If I get stuck &amp; the camp owner is there, I try to explain the issue so they can fix it (if they want to bother)
---
I try to jump away from a camp when loading in hopes that I won't get stuck, but it still happens constantly.
---
Now, the only people who get stuck in my camp are the ones who try to loot my resource collector.
---
Ive gotten 4 explosive harpoons including a 3* IE, an AAE gatling and a mutants exosive lever. Also an AA double vats lever and a few other half decent things.
---
You just gotta show up and make her feel wanted. Every day I greet her "What up Murmrgh, you sexy ass mole bitch, whatchu got for me"
---
Your complaint sounds a bit unbelievable unless the last time you played was a long time ago. Almost all forms of pvp except workshops and mutually agreed fights are removed from adventure.
---
A camp can't be destroyed without firing back/hitting the player that attacked you. Workshops are an pvp area because it would be unfair if one player can basically own it as long as he/she stays in the server.
---
So your friends house can't be destroyed unless he is a trigger happy guy that instantly shoots back without passive mode.
---
The Morgantown highschool has a boatload of plastic in the gymnasium also.
---
If you need lead, site Alpha has barbells and lead weights usually about 80 in total. My camp is there drop by and visit the 1 brahmin petting zoo- free with any purchase.
---
Now if I could just find a reliable source of screws.
---
Ps4. They're not transferable I read though
---
would be best. and doing it safe should also be np for beth.
---
Why, oh why..... _don't you Just turn Pacifist on_ ???
---
Turn Pacifist on.
---
Enjoy a quit life.
---
The down votes are usually for things seen all the time.  I would not downvote those post but some do.
---
How do people build these? When I do so, it barely moves me anywhere
---
Between myself &amp; a few friends, we've tested the theory, it's been almost exactly on the original camp placement every single time
---
yes, it definitely needs to be fixed for a lot of reasons. ty for adding this dude!
---
Probably in a world with scorched and super mutants no one would give a shit, except that they actually need to repopulate the earth... which you wouldnt be helping.
---
Welcome to the post apocalyptic wasteland. What do you expect? Cordial interaction?
---
1k caps for a nice patio set... You know hes got a fat man below the counter to protect his taco stand!
---
Then I do the puke emote.
---
Been there
---
They are such losers! It‚Äôs pathetic that they have to come back to adventure mode to try to bully people... Fools
---
Sure, but the TSE weapons were the primary dupe target.
---
Grafton Steel Mill
---
With all the super mutants it a good place to farm metals, scrap and a few other things
---
You could have a podium with a book on it and whenever someone's house by your camp they could write something in the book.
---
It seems to have fixed it for me. I used to get a lot of people underneath my foundation (myself included) and haven't had a single one since I changed the floor.
---
If you've got lone wanderer, a couple points in action boy, and 1 or 2 pieces of AP refresh armor it doesn't matter. Your AP bar refills so fast it's ridiculous.
---
It‚Äôs funny when I wasn‚Äôt looking for it, there it was. First try right next to the car... There he was,after I had finally given up. Now I Can‚Äôt complete the dammed back pack quest line because I cant find someone to revive....
---
OK m talking recently so guessing they are duping aae be and ie and legacy weapons
---
One brahmin petting zoo, but two heads to pet.
---
Well I'm going to be doing it with that mule everyday for a while yet so will report back with more tests.
---
There is a huge difference though.  The 4th of July celebrates the independence of America which affects all Americans.  Pride month affects like what 4% of the population?  The two are not relatable.
---
That‚Äôs unlikely. They had Christmas and Easter stuff. Likely some number of humans with pride stuff survived too.
---
I struggled with vending till I started selling serums.  I saved up and purchased the adreanal recupe and made 50.  They sold out so fast it cap maxed me and then I purchased the marsupial recipie and made 50 of those.  Now I only keep my vending machines on about 2 days a week due to being cap maxed.  I am trying to buy speed demon next.
---
I don‚Äôt get why a power fist is an unarmed weapon but gets damage from gladiator perks as if it‚Äôs a one-handed.
---
(I also like how me answering someone‚Äôs question got me downvoted, lol. I love reddit.)
---
Wow... I feel sorry for you. Bill and Ted. Go watch.
---
So .. minorities shouldn‚Äôt be celebrated in America?
---
556 goes quick
---
I'll sell it to you when I'm on.
---
Bravo for this! The vendor hop spawn lockup / foundation inspector has been an absolute HUGE frustration indeed. Excellent post. üëçüèº
---
I got a three star Bone Club the other day.
---
I'm not sure what to think or do about that.
---
Unless it's something unplayable now. In an interview he justifies no morrowind remaster because it has backwards compatability with newer systems. So anything that's still playable on current Gen won't see new versions allegedly.
---
you'd have to play for 6 hours a day, every day for three years
---
I think I'm able to drop it on the ground am I not? Unless they're destroyed automatically once dropped.
---
Someone posted a thread earlier today saying that it was a global PSN  issue and not directly related to 76.
---
Yeah, serums seem to be the big ticket item. I can see making a lot of money off Marsupial alone.
---
Yea xmas and easter predate Christianity and most people celebrate them in America even the non religious.
---
Pride month I never heard of until this year, amd gay people wouldnt be celebrated in a severely UNDERpopulated world.  But, that doesnt mean Bethesda wont do it... its sort of the new corporate thing to do.
---
... and they would. They always do.
---
Usually there was a tamable scorched version ,but this picture seems pretty legit.
---
I have no clue how he managed to find one like that since it never showed in any of the spots i farm.
---
That would be nice.  It would give me a place to start.
---
Did you ever find a map for this? Similair problem here
---
you will have to run your own power connectors to the fusion core processor. Or, if you can build the 100 power fusion genorator, you can just build it next to any fusion core generator to power it up, after you have capped the workshop
---
They should be, just not in a video game in which people of different creeds, colors, backgrounds and religions play.
---
Interesting point.
---
As a Side note you could Safe yourself some pain and turn Pacifist on.
---
Enjoy a quit Life.
---
Don't feel sorry. While you were watching Bill and Ted, I was being productive.
---
The irony.
---
You don't NEED to server hop for the fucking thing.  There are broken cameras all over the place, in the week after the camera was released I'd accidentally picked up almost a dozen of them out of containers thinking they were the junk one.  All actually finding a tourist gets you in is the quest that rewards the zoom lens.  I'm about 99% sure that at least one of the two tourists is ALWAYS present on a given server, instead of randomly hopping and hoping one falls at your feet stay on the same server and actually LOOK for them.
---
Maybe 500 caps.
---
There is none
---
It's like buy one pet get the second free. Gotta rework my sign, thanks for the idea.
---
What did mr super mutant give ya?
---
Only if it's a pre-war Riot Gear version with no ties to the NCR.
---
Otherwise it'd be taking a COLOSSAL dump on the lore since during the time Fallout 76 takes place Shady Sands (NCR's birthplace) wasn't even founded yet.
---
I don‚Äôt like power armor, either! My favorite is the Pioneer Scout uniform and backpack with the vault girl devil head. I was wearing the Garb of Mysteries for a long time because it includes some protection. I also like having extra carry weight without armor.
---
HAHA, I've tried charming her and I've tried asking politely, she just does the same mumbled grunt she always does and she gives me more junk... I refuse to beg so that leaves only one choice, distance. Lets see how she does for a couple of weeks without me giving her any scrip. No new breathers, no treatments to make her glow or drinks with her gal pals
---
(YES I know I'm going to pay for that, but I'm not getting any anyway)
---
Here! https://m.imgur.com/SCKegzb

Gotcha. That makes sense, thanks!
---
I can clear a silo in twenty minutes solo. It just takes practice is all
---
If only there was something called resilience where I didn't have to police the speech of 13 years olds in order to function in the world.
---
Until then let's just make it illegal to be mean.
---
Im definitely gonna use this as pasta
---
I feel that. I just switched to a rifle build.
---
What's your main focus PvE or PvP?
---
Yea nothing official but something similar would do that actually was some of the best Armor in the game
---
Np. 20,000 caps.
---
PvE
---
I have a couple of pieces that are unyeailding so there is that but the loss of 1-3 strength isn‚Äôt an increase of almost 200 pounds. Normally with all the weight reduction perks maxed out and in my weight will drop to the 500s from 800s not increase to 1100.  Anyway it‚Äôs made the game impossible to play working another character for now. So frustrated can‚Äôt really go anywhere when you can‚Äôt get the weight down. So no events till I figure it out.  Thanks though.
---
Thx for the quick reply, been looking ingame for hours
---
A good way of implementing this would be to add a functioning chalkboard
---
My singular salt for 10,000 caps smiled
---
Bessie bull rushed me when I was trying to pick a crop. She fought bravely and dies smoldering.
---
Have you tried sending her unsolicited pictures of your weiner?
---
You haven't moved locations, that's the problem. I can't find the perfect spot. An underground one with water, a junk or nuclear waste pile would just be too convenient. Somewhere underground where it's completely goddamn buildable (floors, walls and all) would be very convenient, too. But no, they don't exist.
---
One. Here's what each one does:
---
* Armor plated: +90 damage resistance. -30 carry weight.
---
* Lead lined: +90 radiation resistance. -30 carry weight.
---
* Insulated: +90 energy resistance. -30 carry weight.
---
* High capacity:  +60 carry weight (stacks with the pre-existing bonus for a total carry wight bonus of +120). -60 to both energy and radiation resistance.
---
* Refrigerated: Slows down the degradation of perishable items in your inventory by 60% (doesn't stack with Good With Salt perk so it's a waste to have both active at the same time). -30 carry weight.
---
1
---
If you're sprinting and jumping so much that you don't have AP when you enter combat, then Dodgy cannot do it's thing. You don't need to sneak that often, but spend AP with care.
---
Lower level doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean weak. As a level 70-80 I kicked so many asses to players double my level when they claimed my workshops or were griefing me. If someone is PvP focused from the start (like me) they wouldn‚Äôt have any problem engaging and beating a level 200.
---
I love the text chat mod and the community. It'd be great for Bethesda to provide as a standard feature, but I'm a bit weary of the "timbre" of chat from the General Gamer Audience. It'd need some kind of moderation I think or at least some ways to block/mute stuff.
---
Thats said, as much as I enjoy fo76, the rose colored glasses are off and I understand complexity and thorough design isn't strictly BGS' forte.
---
Yeah I get triggered by stuff in this game all the time. I can't help it. I have to keep my mic off if my sidekick isn't around to buffer. Otherwise it's WW3 up in here
---
I think since most Fallout players are used to standalone single player games the chat thing is odd.  I will turn mine on if I am trying to trade or playing with people on a specific task, but mostly I dont use mine.
---
What platform are you on? You could come fire a few cows yourself
---
Its a Furious, Explosive, 25% less VATS AP cost pump-action shotgun. It's not too overpowered at least and I get to join that explosive fun club all the cool people are in
---
I'm rocking the explorer outfit with sunglasses too until I can find the hunter's outfit on the responder bot. I found it in a player's vendor but no way am I paying 7,000 caps for it.
---

---
Build a setup like this but place a brahmin feeder where the player would stand, kill the cow and FIREEEEEEEE!!!!!!
---
Awesome thanks! Looks like I'm going with high capacity then!q
---
The one near the farm workshop didn‚Äôt let me build on it.  Just a heads up.  I could place a workshop there but couldn‚Äôt place the extractor.
---
Shotgun primarily.   Plastic to make it and low yield per craft so it is a nuisance to make so it must be a royal pain for shotgun users to keep in supply but I am guessing because I don't use shotguns.
---
Usually 2-5 a week
---
I have it happen here and the mezzanine for top of the world so far.... It's really really irritating.
---
I remember someones camp that had a plank you could walk that would launch in a fissure... he would put warnings there but me and my dumbass didnt think is through
---
A guestbook would be fun to have. Maybe a static camera for people to leave photos behind as well
---
Just a heads up - the one by the farm workshop in the mire doesn‚Äôt let you place the extractor even though you can place your CAMP there.
---
Still gives me goosebumps.
---
but they do exist i think. although myself have no experience, as as said didnt moved often,  i was once at a guys camp for the vending machine and he did build in a whole. actually was at the dam, close or at the crevasse dam (hope it's the same called in english^^). i just think you're right that you can't do it everywhere. what truly could be cool^^
---
It‚Äôs random , I‚Äôve done it like 20 times with my 4 alts all under lvl 7 and I‚Äôve gotten mostly max level with the occasional lvl 1 to 35 pieces but I only go for 3* ranger weapons.. I can‚Äôt say anything for all the other options of stuff to buy
---
Ok, I'll PM you the build link soon.
---
Xbone
---
If you really want lead then the Lucky Hole mine is the spot.   Collect all the lead ore and smelt it down.   With Super Duper you should end up with 700-800 lead scrap each and every time.    The catch to this is you will need the acid to do all the smelting and that much lead puts a serious hit on your stash space.
---
I had this the other day. Had to log on to another server to fix. My carry weight was way below the max.
---
I want a motorcycle.  I can build a mechanical suit of armour that will withstand nuclear fallout, but I can't repair one the motorcycles I see laying around all over the place.  Oh how I crave the wind in my hair and bugs on my teeth.
---
Ask Yukon Cornelius about the silver and gold.
---
My crafted clothing items sell well: Halloween costumes, robot helmets, and such but I don't charge much for them.
---
I charge 1 cap for all ammo so that all moves except really common ammo (I give that away to new players) and gamma rounds.
---
On the other hand, I overcharge a little on legendary items but they still move. I only sell the good ones and the 1 stars tend to move quicker than the 3.
---
Thats a shame, just follow this guide and replace players with cows and you'lll be firing them in no time at all.
---
Lol why was your comment downvoted? Your the only one who had the correct answer. üòÇüòÇüòÇ

not per say

Here you go friendos

I wonder if the first person who gets this achievement will get a canvas bag?
---
Or one of the desert suits the marines used in the Gobi campaign!
---
Nah, she'd probably find some way to use it against me. Still think withholding scrip is the way to go. Lets see how she likes the drought
---
How about a lifetime membership to the petting zoo and a couple of rolling pins?
---
Just found one. I don't have an imgur account to post proof, but it shows up for me as value -1 and when I have it highlighted a rock seems to be floating around me. I'm assuming this is the rock that behemoths throw.
---
yes, it's hard trying to explain to ppl or even try fixing it by it^^ thx for supporting it :_) but as it seems that trap those trying to loot your resource collector is a good thing, we might should ask bethesda to fix it, but make an exception for just these few players lol^^
---
Not at all. Spend 2 points on Fireproof and get a dense mod for your chest piece. That'll eliminate 95% of the splash damage.
---
ty for supporting it dude!
---
Hahaha what a whiney little child. Bloodied is far from easy. I die all the time and I'm sure I'm not the only one.
---
Moving it after only changes the owner's spawn... in an inconsistent manner that seems to vary depending on the direction the character is looking when fast travelling.
---
To change the spawn for teammates and customers, you have to do "move camp" from pip and rebuild your camp from scratch. That's unsatisfactory to say the least. Currently at best, those of us with large houses get a partial blueprint of our structure to get us started. It's maybe 25% of any house I have and would be useless just about anywhere else I place my camp.
---
As a dungeon it is disappointing, feels like a lot of open area with nothing there. But I think it was a step in the right direction, I'm looking forward to future dungeons. There is one sewer under/near Watoga that you can place your C.A.M.P. in. Not sure how it would hold up for building though.
---
Beth really needs to do some work with the fences.  The gate is basically impossible to place and doesn't play in the same league as the regular sections.
---
Try making a simple rectangle with a gate with the hopes of making it into an outdoor mutfruit garden.  Hairs will turn grey and fall out as a result.
---
Careful, your prejudice, bias and hate is showing...
---
Well if you're interested you can list what legendary effects and mods your armor has so we can figure it out.
---
Battlefield V and Gillette are perfect marketing examples of why political/social/religious issues should be separated from the product. People play games to be entertained not be lectured. 
---
I always supported LGBT rights and I will keep doing so for the rest of my life but companies should keep their ‚Äúwanna be morally superior‚Äù bullshit for themselves. 
---
Fallout should represent a post apocalyptic cruel and savage world, not a ‚Äúlet‚Äôs form a circle and hold hands together‚Äù. But considering what they sell in the atomic shop they might as well just do it at this point.
---
I'm on Xbox and my weapon repairs go to 200%.

Its a reference to a yt vid

The slingshot vendor!
---
There's a large gap between your feelings and the truth.
---
I'll have to check it out. I visited it when I was going after pioneer scout objectives but haven't been there since. A decent location for steel would be nice, I seem to run out of it constantly.
---
. . . . . Periods are your friend.
---
We need a point and laugh emote
---
Functional mats are already in FO76. Claim a workshop, build one, and see for yourself. Additionally, people that built one during BETA or a short time after and have never gotten rid of it still have functional mats. They were disabled after the game's launch but only for new ones built at our camps.
---
I enjoy run on sentences I find them relaxing and fun and if I must say quite easy to do in the long run
---
Every other video game manages it
---
Someone did that to my cow.  I followed him around the map for like 30 minutes talking to him, asking him to be my friend.  He finally server hopped out of annoyance.   
---
I was not talking about the perk card packs if that‚Äôs what you mean. I was under the impression starched genes was available to purchase when you reach 30. So I saved my ‚Äúlevel up points‚Äù from 28 and 29 to max it out when I reached 30. As someone pointed out, I had to actually spend a perk point at level 30 on another card in order for starched genes to appear. I did just that and appear it did but I had to wait till level 31 to max it out. Either here nor there, I maxed thee perk out and ran into a small lake obtaining Healing Fact on the first try. Then I ran back to my camp and injected the marsupial and birdbones serums I was saving. My second character is set for now üëçüëçüëç
---
Oh really? I am trying to write out a new character respec for my old character. I was trying to decide between that, or photosynthetic to replace with fire proof.
---
Exactly and when you do sell things often times there's almost a 95% mark down because the system assumes everyone farms places like they mentioned which for some of us is just not that interesting or immersive.
---
NTA
---
I mean the lore already had a giant dump taken on it, plus it would be atom shop, wouldn't matter
---
Yeah. I personally use Ammosmith and Super Duper when crafting ammo.
---
It‚Äôs clearly a feral ghouls wtf

Oh was not aware. That might be useful on alts for now...

Remember, I'm from the generation that shoved hundreds of dollars into arcade machines for a rate of something like $1 = 3 minutes of game play.   
---
I personally put over $1,000 into an Area 51 arcade shooter in my early twenties. At $1 per play, and average playtime per of 5-10 minutes.   
---
Compared to that entertainment minute/dollar rate FO76 is fucking STEAL.
---
Please no.  Leave the virtue signaling to other companies.  Nothing is more annoying when a company begins to pander.
---
Might be platform issue, or specific to X01.  I Applied a non armor specific targeting HUD mod (was named targeting hud, not armor type Targeting hud) on excavator couple days ago. 
---
No problem on PS4
---
Scorched work. Try this: go over to vault 76 grab the machete from that corpse and use it to kill one of the Scorched at the farm just south of there. That did it for me.
---
Height traps are no longer a thing now. Bethesda fixed that. You just go on a ride and don't take damage when you land if you were thrown by a spike trap or got up from a chair on an edge.
---
Steel always sells for me
---
In the meantime you can try using the jukebox or building near an existing radio cuz they seem to always start ON.
---
Yeah I found out that it doesn't change it significantly, just give us fast travel mats! I'm tired of spawning inside my buddies wall lol
---
I can't even kill a rabbit, cat, squirrel, opposum, fox or any of the other lil critters that are just living their life as long as they don't aggro on me.  I hated myself doing the Scout quests where you had to hurt the little fuzzbutts. :(
---
The Mire is stunning, really shows that nature isn't completely destroyed. I think there will be a major boss in that area soon. Something like a giant Gulper would give the area more of a threat. There is a lot of open space for building which is nice
---
But it's my fren.
---
No thank you, I have nothing wrong with homo people. But I'm tired of video games shoving political and sjw shit down my throat.
---
I'm a hometown cafe and sell booze and food. Just found rad ant lager.
---
I might go with the juke box instead. It's sad that I posted this awhile back and it's not biting that much. The radio is a keep component to a good home.
---
It sounds like my base, just south of whitespring station. You walk out a door that says more loot on it and trip a laser sensor setting off the traps directly in front of the vending machine. The door is one way as well using a pressure plate.
---
He could be cosplaying as a Protectron.
---
&gt; Good on you fellow cowpatriate.
---
That sounds like something a cowmmunist would say.
---
You've found the wandering vendor bot of Charleston, a sign that you have been blessed by the orangey fairies. Test your Luck on some events now and get some godroll legendaries.
---
Pretty sure you can't end main quest level 28. Well tried
---
 May I suggest that you find friends and things to fill your life instead of this?
---
Fertilizer it produces is handy for replanting crops that are damaged and explosive creation.

BSG need to figure this out.  PVP sucks in Adventure big time (everywhere at the moment, really).  Most people in Adventure don't want it, and those that do, have to harass others and try trick them into PVP.  Who wants to play an adventure game where an asshat shows up in duped OP gear and regularly tries to bait anyone they see into PVP by doing asshat stuff like killing pets, etc.  -- essentially personifying the bad elements of the game many hope to avoid.  All the scamming and murder makes me not really want to deal with strangers in the Adventure server or at least treat everyone new as a potential scammer or homicidal PVP washout. 
---
Survival exists for PVP.  All the PVP you could want is supposed to happen in Survival.  It's even in BETA for you to make the perfect PVP murder world.  BSG wants you to do depraved, unholy, decrepit, deceitful, nasty, vulgar, and just plain asshat stuff like killing innocent people's pet cows in Survival.  Worship Satan and Stalin in your hovel while planning the next one-shot kill with your OP duped gear.  Make it the boodbath griefer heaven you so deperately want!
---
It's a decent workshop for lead, steal and steal.  It heavily guarded though, 30 or SMs
---
I just want to say, that last sentence took a second for me to interpret correctly, as my brain immediately went dirty.
---
&gt; unlike other forums i've seen
---
You should see the cesspool that is /r/AnthemTheGame, I had to actually quit even *reading* the sub a month or so ago because it had deteriorated into little more than a Bioware/EA hate group and was just depressing.
---
Haha, I had a mirelurk show up as a radroach. Dropped radroach meat too. üòÜ
---
Its 1500lbs+ the stash hasnt helped. I'm just overencoumbered and trying get my life together.
---
Lol. That and the insane amount of flux.
---
It's easy to beat up a dead man.
---
I don't mind the sometimes weird spawn locations. What it means to me is, well I'm not buying anything here and off I go.
---
Well if I must. I do enjoy the English language to an abnormally high degree. However, I do find a need to express a small dosage of anarchical language to free the mind a bit. All this structure is bad for you if you adhere too long.
---
It‚Äôs built into the side of the mountain and it‚Äôs manually activated by the user, it has skeletons on it by default. It probably resets with each logon. I forget exactly where it was but I thought it was neat too. There‚Äôs a cave at the bottom of the cliff with acid you can
---
Build a resource excavator on.
---
I think they might add more of a story there, maybe if they expand upon the burrows it will get a bit more love. I could see a quest if anything appearing saying " find out what happened to the residents of Mosstown". They came from The Burrows so they had to go somewhere after that.
---
That is too funny, and I doubt I could even be mad at either. Just being flung like a cartoon character would have me busting a gut for a long time. Just ask my partner who watches me laugh like a hyena whenever I get ragdolled into the upper atmosphere.
---
It's been a while since any woman has let me store my junk in their stash box
---
The gold and silver.
---
Would you do 3k
---
This is extremely impressive to me. You have inspired me. Well done sir.
---
I‚Äôve never been able to get my mic to work, and I‚Äôve only had one person talk to me in all the months I‚Äôve been playing.
---
I'm personally relived to see a high level step in if I'm struggling, and even if i were handling it fine on my own, i still enioy the idea of teamwork and it's so much more satisfying and fun to wave each other after a fight than to take on enemies on my own.
---
When were you playing? Because leveling up is slower than when the game first came out and you'd level up 3 times just wandering around a nuke zone.
---
What repair materials were you having a hard time finding? You can mark materials you need so the items with them are marked when you come across them. Look at the component view.
---
Well I have found it out when I needed to craft some ammo. I dont really want to exploit this. But looks seriously broken if lead and steel do not decrease.
---
There is a quest/event/thingy in the game files that is enclave related but I haven't manage to trigger it yet.
---
The closest I have gotten was MODUS complaining about my performance and how it was difficult to get competent help even though AFAIK I had not even started the event yet.
---
All I know is that is about a black box and choosing whether to deliver it to MODUS or to someone else and something about 'enemy agents' getting the quest to hunt you down.
---
Found this thread because I just did this. BRB jumping off nearest cliff ü§£
---
Yeah that‚Äôs where I keep most of my camps - there‚Äôs so many beautiful places to build and I really love taking pictures out there
---
Havent been to the Observatory but it seems very cool. Just watch out that you don't get any visitors from space coming to say hey.
---
It is now!
---
We need more people with this mindset in online games!
---
Thank you for the info! :)
---
I was still undecided about my build, but I guess I better not hang onto it then. Thanks!
---
Could just be Desert Rangers?  The armor was theirs before the unification treaty and they existed since before the war.
---
Be sure to make a fresh post regarding any trivial glitch you find.
---
Feel free to let us know how the MMORPG you developed is doing.
---
Can't hit what you can't see. A decent farming spot for legendaries is what everyone needs, I think I'll add it to my route since I usually travel past it anyways.
---
Selling a pride flag in the Atom Shop would be okay by you or not?
---
There's always bird bones
---
There is a way to turn off the voice chat completely. I have my mic on and hear everybody, though occasionally they don't hear me... A bug?
---
My friend chats with me through discord and he doesn't speak to or hear anyone in the game.
---
That should be on a t-shirt
---
I loved the view from on top of Seneca Rocks.  That was my first camp that I put effort in, and me and my friends had fun messing around up there.
---
No the point I was making is dupes are still around and active. So using the excuse of "countering dupes" doesn't hold water.
---
The ol prison pocket
---
From your wording I can‚Äôt tell if you‚Äôve acquired the collector stuff since start the quest or we‚Äôre trying to use things you already had. I‚Äôm pretty sure it has to all be new. I tried dropping something and picking it up and it didn‚Äôt count. Not sure about selling it and buying it back, but that‚Äôs not possible for everything. 
---
Deathclaw hides are out there but apparently only in containers, which is idiotic. I‚Äôve found several but of course I scrapped them before getting the quest so now I have to find four more.
---
This is why I console. Sure it still crashes and has occasional lag, but atleast it's reliably stable most of the time, without needing an in depth knowledge of electronics or constant upgrading.
---
√à da settimane che √® cos√¨...stiamo aspettando un fix da tantissimo ma non arriva, per√≤ hey, marketing gratis per loro ahahahahaha
---
Thank you! I hope to grow flowers in my camp so I can gift one to everyone I see. The community has been nothing but kind and helping, I can't help spreading the love and positivity I've been getting so far!
---
I'd buy that I/E blackpowder rifle for 5000 caps easy, just to get the 76 scorched kills challenge done easily (instigating effects still apply on bashes, and get much better with a bayonet.) and beat up scorchbeasts and bosses with a better crits carded VATS initial headshot "welcome" when they pop up.  I can cut a lvl 50 scorchbeast's health in half with a torso crit off an instigating/+10%aim hunting rifle.  I imagine an I/E blackpowder might be a one shot kill with a head crit.
---
When I said Poof, I meant I disappear so they are on their own. But I don‚Äôt mind helping people start out a little. But, like you I too have low level run away at times. Waving at them
---
to get a starter package doesn‚Äôt always work. üòê
---
It's really not that serious but okay.
---
You don't get the point of anything I said do you? W/e I expected your sort here.
---
You're right. The chems are getting to me.
---
That is an old name for what people now generally call a fist bump.
---
HAHAHAHA I hadn't thought of that. He's headed to SDCC, for sure.
---
Somehow at lvl 218, didn't know this was an option... feel like that would help... also feel a wee bit stupid.
---
Gold and silver are both needed for various serums and underarmor crafting.
---
Every time I fast travel to the hotel outside Flatwoods to check for the weights I make sure to kill the mole rats quick before they can kill the possum next to the office, because he‚Äôs my buddy. 
---
So I pop in and hit VATS and immediately shoot everything that‚Äôs labeled a mole rat. But the possum was labeled a mole rat. I shot my buddy! 
---
And then I made bacon out of him. That‚Äôs what he would‚Äôve wanted.
---
If I'm trying to make smores and a players camp has Brahmin and razorgrain, sometimes I'll collect the razorgrain, milk[or attempt to milk] the cow, kill it, repair/respawn cow, then repeat until I'm out of razorgrain. I always leave enough to keep Bessie alive.
---
 The only time kill him outright is when a vending machine has egregiously bad bad bad prices.
---
Bulk plastic for 200 caps and such
---
My experience has been nothing but extremely pleasant and heartwarming that I just want to level up fast enough so I can help newcomers myself. It's so frustrating that we don't get to hear praises for the community in mainstream media because that alone is a big selling point for me, and if I had known about it, I would've come back sooner for sure!
---
I'm on the same boat. Never kill non-aggressive animals. I feel bad when I have to do it to get an achievement or a quest... :/
---
Chemist: The syringer part is bugged. They are aware and will patch it 'at a later date'.
---
Collector: Not sure it was intended or not but it is a what it is. If you have already found any of the items before the challenge was triggered well... You have to find them again. Moreover they have to be 'fresh picks', buying/trading or pulling from storage does not count.
---
Musician: See 'Chemist'.
---
Leatherworker: Deathclaw Hides are exceedingly rare loot from: Footlockers, Metal Boxes (the black ones), Junk Nodes, Gulpers, Super Mutant Behemoths and possibly Deathclaw Nests. They do not 'drop' from Deathclaws.
---
i can understand that. sure, sometimes stuff can get the better of someone because of frustration. but at the end hate alone doesn't help change anything :_)
---
Ah I found your older thread first. Yeah freezing yourself is a huge problem, but at least suicide is an option.

Was it this one?

The ones that sell best for me are .308, .45, 5.56, and shells at 1 cap each, and plasma cores at 15. I'm primarily melee, and it just accumulates over the course of killing/looting shit, so it's basically free money.
---
Purchased them and found. I also updated the info.
---
I heard about that and it does seem silly.
---
Well, "it's yeet or be yeeted" finally makes sense to me now, sorry it had to be at the expense of your limbs üòÖ

That sounds really cool pal
---
I leave a bag of spoiled meat on their bed if their house is trash, or vendor is overpriced
---
I love/hate it in the same way I love/hate the sounds the big tripod things made in the War of the Worlds remake with Tom Cruise a few years back.
---
Both sounds are equal parts frightening and pleasing to me, and I genuinely can't figure out why.
---
Updated the post and its good to know Bethesda is looking into these issues. Thanks for letting me know.
---
I'm not sure if he's joking, but I buy every rollwing pin I can find for 250 or less. I can't find the plans anywhere (do they even exist?), and I have a bloodied swing speed rolling pin that I'm trying to learn mods for.
---
What platform are you on? If you have the mats ill build you a good few of them so you can scrap them for plans
---
Tested my luck......got the blight.
---
I'm around 1100

What platform are you on my dude? I can make you one for the materials for it

And here I thought I was old!

MTNZ03_Box_Hunter "The Black Box" [QUST:002B13B0]

They should be active but I cannot for the life of me 'trigger' them.
---
My machines have all the good stuff which, doesn't last very long. I carry a no star combat shot gun and a no star handmade. Making quick work of a baddie just doesn't appeal to me
---
&gt; and now is marked as "Improved aim and sh*t".
---
I mean I kind of wish the English version said that too. Maybe their Italian translators are just really fucking about. 
---
It would be nice to be able to switch over to it on the fly to see what you're talking about, and also it would help my Italian.
---
It had a wedding ring also... Before the last patch it had a 1 dr.
---
Yeah I wager that's because of the vendor cap limit. No such limit on other player transactions. Still he may just be helping other people out for minor profit. I do the same thing once both accounts have maxed out script for the day, I'll start selling legendaries (1-2\* with no real usage value) for 50-100 caps each to other players.
---
Bulletin board with 5 notes lol
---
Yes yes yes!!!!
---
Kidding man, im on PC or i would
---
Uh, I actually got something good for my build, a vampire's swing speed shishkebab. It's complete luck in getting anything good, so my advice is to never get your hopes up
---
Sadly that doesn't always work either, but yes it does reduce the occurrence significantly.
---
You are still here trashing the game all those months. Can't you just get a break? Bethesda BAD and so on and so on, you are tiring bro, we know it we don't care, the game is fun for us and it's not for you, we learned our lesson, we are not gonna buy any other Bethesda game at launch and they know some of us will. What are you even trying to accomplish by trashing the game for months and months?
---
No worries sorry you got downvoted. My wife and I laughed at the quick comment!
---
All good, downvotes dont bother me.  Youre lucky your wife lets you play.  Mine just calls me a nerd
---
I can't apply this mod to my armor on PS4 either. Same with some scout armor mods.
---
Lol she plays with me! I am lucky!
---
Cool. I'll have to try it.
---
This isn't gta
---
Or that SLPD lightweight vest! Re name it to what ever police are local... The responders had cops. They absolutely would wear that. And riot gear also...
---
If there's a battle royale game I'm going to get into, it's gonna be a Fallout one.
---
I‚Äôm simply saying that it is considerably easier too nuke a fledgling society into the ground rather than help them.
---
I don‚Äôt care either way. But I believe that individuals who want to wipe out a fledgling society rather than complete fetch quests aren‚Äôt exactly the friendliest of individuals.
---
What do you think we would have to do to start them?
---
The Whitespring area is amazing both for lore and scenery and especially for power leveling alone, just walk in at level two or three and put one round into one of the level 62 ghouls and lead them back to papa sentry bot for free XP.
---
There are groups for that soon Facebook. Look up FO76 Bounties Called Out. I even run a group of bounty hunters called The Law, although since we only hunted griefers, and "raiders" that harassed people, we've not seen much business since the change to adventure mode.
---
I took a picture of the flatwoods monster and it completed the challenge. 
---
There's no other aliens in the game currently. Hints, but no aliens.
---
YoUr CaMP FckeN SuX D00d 
---
P.s i KiLLeD n AtE Yr CoW
---
I have found more people who have done that with the Flatwoods monster and it never worked lol
---
Have you ever been on survival? It basically IS GTA lol. It's a free for all that only dies down when everyone starts hiding.
---
My personal preference is custom fitted. I personally don‚Äôt take much fall damage ever, so custom fitted (which lets you sprint for reduced ap cost) is great. I‚Äôve tried it on and off, it  definitely makes a difference
---
Call me hopeful .....
---
Because social engineering doesn't work on vending machines. Much easier to try to talk you down than bargain with a machine interface menu.
---
There's no other aliens tho. 
---
It's either broken atm, or an oversight on bgs' part
---
Kinda disappointed you dont use berserkers gear.
---
I usually play "the floor is lava" when I load into a players camp.
---
I did the Faschnact event a bunch of times and only with the tighty whities and a pair of fashion sunglasses on. People either loved it or hated on me
---
Oh mr. Pinchy
---
This challenge is really annoying, I've found three aliens in a row now that were all using 65mm lenses. I don't know why they stick to such inferior technology smh
---
I have a sneak build with my perks and almost a whole set of armor with harder to detect. And i cannot explain it to you and i bet nobody can. So.etimes it works perfect and sometimes people see me quick. I dont understand it either and my whole build is based around it
---
&gt; *u cmp so fkn bad red wals &amp;blu floor lmao go kill urslf*
---
I can already imagine it.
---
Educated guess: is a random encounter, a bit how the random encounter triggers can spawn 'Free Range' or 'The Messenger' for instance.
---
Possibly a Gutsy - the dialogue does read 'Gutsy-like' - guarding the black box and tasking you with delivering it somewhere then being given the objective to do that or the optional objective to deliver it to MODUS.
---
I don't really have the relevant knowledge to find accurate answers and those I know with the relevant knowledge well... they will regain interest when private servers are finally 'a thing'.
---
I think I'm correct in writing that in the Fallout 76 World there were plenty of relationships other than hetero ie: Miguel from the Responders had a bf, the Raider leader that became a ghoul was female and she had a gf...
---
So what I'm saying is that in that world being gay doesn't seem like the issue it is in ours, and a "Pride Month" wouldn't be necessary to raise awareness. 
---
Yes?
---
What do they look like? Are you talking about the flat woods monster?
---
And the switch on the brick one dont work... its a aggrivating
---
Also can be someone wanna a free fast travel. People trying harm you are a rare issue, don't be afraid of invites.
---
Yeet the spaghetti
---
Lol big puns intended there eh as I keep typing words to make this a complete long and pointless sentence for all to read **(period goes here)**
---
Survival only sure but keep it out of regular. Last thing we need is people posting bounties on people who just want to mind their own business.
---
i was on my friends team while he was idle i used letters to write on his wall
---
Pretty sure you can.  Also, I'm not the one complaining about the lack of help in a fight that takes place in an online game.  Maybe some of your friends from your fulfilling life can come help you.
---
If this is on xbox I'm pretty sure I saw it yesterday and did the puke emote
---
That's kinda sad man.
---
Do you play with a bluetooth controller or headset? Mine does this when my peripheral batteries are low.
---
I don‚Äôt like cavalier mostly because it require you to sprint, draining your action points which are needed for the above mention perks. Sentinel all the way my friend.
---
In my opinion, I kinda agree that its a cheap way to get a trophy but your swift and merciless nuclear response gets my up vote.
---
I go western sister and sentry bot helmet
---
I would love some kind of black board, where the payment to write on the board is one chalk, or a cork board, where the payment is paper or something
---
Corralling all the salty bullshit into one giant thread isn't censorship, and it's a hell of a lot better than cluttering up the sub with 100 different threads of people complaining about the same shit.
---
The flatwood monsters are the aliens. If you ever come across a bugged out one, you can approach and see the alien model inside its costume. Its half the size of the flatwood monster too, standing on some pedestool
---
Another solution; when you float middle of two storey of someones camp try to move near any  workbench, use and exit from it..
---
I started playing a few days ago and I love it so far. There is some buggy/glitchy stuff but nothing that breaks the game or is anything big (mostly enemies moving around in a weird way, corpses falling through the map etc). Enjoyed every minute ingame so far, hope more people decide to get their own opinion on the game and give it a try.
---
lol^^ yes, sometimes works, but it's just that it is even more frustrating when it actually does not^^
---
Sneaking has many  factors in play during PvP and outside of PvP. for PvP though there are some key features.
---
1.) just because your crouched doesn't mean they can't see you. when your crouched, players do have eyes and can physically see you approach should they face you.
---
2.) Their perception rolls go against your agility roles. the main purpose of stealth is to hide from being spotted...well in PvP, your stealth affects whether or not the other player can "detect" you on his compass and map. you see, when you croutch you will disappear from other players maps entirely based on your distance from them and how good their perception is versus your agility. a player with high perception can see your "player indicator" on the compass and you will reappear on the map when your are very close to him even if your sneaking. 
---
3.) sneaking reduces the players accuracy in vats. they can't hit you well enough cause your a much smaller target then if your standing up.
---
4.) stealthboys negate vats entirely and heavily boosts your roll for stealth against their perception. 1 stealthboy can make a level 1 agility turn into a 9 agility simply due to cloaking. it also renders you invisible (mostly) there is a faint shimmer that can give you away but it's only noticeable against harsh backgrounds. stick the muddy mish mash of neutral colors and foliage. don't think they can't see you shimmer against a yellow wallpaper of a house or standing in the middle of the window where  heavy lighting is.
---
5.) Stealth doesn't always guarantee a critical against players. it depends yet again on their perception alone. a player can be waving at you in stealth and physically see you but if your agility rolls higher than his stealth you can crit him..the opposite is true as well.
---
That's why most bounty pages, and bounty hunter factions require proof that they are being sent after griefers, or asshats, rather than being sent as hitmen, or stream snipers. Back when my crew The Law used to run shop on trouble makers, I would require clips, or screenshots of the targets being griefers or "raiders".
---
I never thought about that. Sadly it's just too much of a high traffic area. Always at least three people running around killing everything. It's a good spot if it's empty though, the lore is very interesting, I just wish I could access all those extra rooms, I wonder if anything will become of them.
---
Im imagining the point and laugh Susie does in deltarune
---
May i introduce ladys and gents... The Wasteland Elon Musk
---
Lol, downvoted for not agreeing that the purveyor sucks. You should just edit your comment to say "I hate the purveyor, fallout 76 should still be in beta, PVP is literally the devil and oh yeah, 'it just works.'"
---
This confusion, or utter lack of understanding, when it comes to people making assumptions on complete stranger's lives based on how they act in a game will always be the greatest folly of the gamer.
---
It's the same logic as screaming "I bet your father raped you" to someone cheating.
---
You somehow want to or have decided people who "kill" imaginary two dimensionally thought out characters in a game must be of low moral stock in the real world.
---
It's why simple choices like Brotherhood or Institute from Fo4 showcase some of the most disgusting examples of human interaction. 
---
The reason why it wouldn't work is because you would be choosing someone else's ending for their story.
---
Ah, brings back memories of Monty Python...Fetchez la vache!
---
If you mean the shelf next to the bunk bed, thats a bone club, it's just a 1-handed, 'Medium' speed version of the bone hammer which is way rarer
---
You keep using "we" and "us"? Whom you represent? Fanatic fans? Bethesda employee?
---
No cuz he wanted let the non sense that has happened at launch
---
I'm playing on PC.
---
Players who are here to share experiences with each other and talk about the game and are tired of your bullshit going on and on for months.
---
I haven't reached 760 yet... I doubt many of us will ever hit this.
---
But wait...isn't it already Oct 2102?!
---
Impressive
---
Hmm good to know, may have to give it a shot! I'm rarely out of my weight cap tho mind lol, I horde far too much!
---
Equipping scrapper and killing super mutants for their weapons is a heck of a lot easier than farming iron ore and smelting it.
---
Yeah it was just a estimate unfortunately, we had to push the moon date back a little.
---
Bessie sprained a teat during a simulation run
---
I noticed that the trespassing signs shares the light budget and limit (of 50) so you probably have allot of lights in your camp and that's why it won't let you build either
---
Beautiful view with plenty around to keep you occupied. I would worry if you put your camp to close to the cliff you'd end up spawn falling. Hopefully they add fast travel mats to help with that problem. Might find some trolls getting use out of it though.
---
Done it at least once just out of boredom (was before Wild Appalachia), and to see if I could get my hands on a few rare camp plans.
---
It's not too much of a hassle if you just ignore the defense event until it changes to the "retake the workshop" event. The reasons for this: 1) You only have to fight off one wave of enemies, 2) You still maintain control of the workshop and can freely fast travel to it, 3) The enemies that spawn for retaking will usually be of the lowest level that can spawn in the area, making it that much easier to retake, 4) You still get the rewards you'd get for doing the defense event.
---
It's not broken, it works with the alien. They even addressed it in the last patch notes
---
But if you go to the challenge where you have to take a picture of everything there's flatwoods monster and an alien one
---
this is the first thing i check, try to find workbench, seat whatever...unfortunately it does work 1 out 100 times with something being close^^
---
I just put them for sale and if anyone of those sells i instantly close the shop and unload the caps to my other account
---
One time I found a thing in the nuke zone that made me get no rats while in it and I think it‚Äôs repeatable possibly
---
And yeah the voice is epic
---
Waited ages for them too :(
---
Which alien?
---
Yes that's tru.. It doesn't always work
---
I had it positioned to where you spawned down on the path up a bit.  I was very happy there, plus vertibots would come for easy keycards
---
Why do we have PVP in adventure anyway?  So this kind of thing can ruin the game?  Is this BSG's grand plan for making FO76 a success?
---
I was playing near the beginning of this year and stopped around level 30
---
Lol well.. if you‚Äôre concerned for me, I could always use a gift?

Oh this is sad too?

Ya I was just bein a dink. But the Fatman is abit under-powered feeling, I get its for balance, bit it's realitivly unimpressive dmg coupled with 6lbs a shot makes them generally useless. Fun as fireworks tho.
---
It's somtimes really hard to hide noise if I hear something out of place I pop a berry mentats and spin to highlight targets
---
Are you using Push to Talk? For whatever reason, voice chat when using PTT is both PTT (push a button) and voice activated. It doesn't transmit unless it detects you speaking no matter how long you hold down the talk button. It didn't used to be this way but they screwed it up in some update.
---
They cant, because they have high dr from all the perks
---
I set it as my ringtone
---
Went to reply to this post, only to see you've basically taken the words out of my mouth. I'd really love to just have the [pre-war Riot Gear version without any "NCR"](https://c-5uwzmx78pmca09x24oiumx78mlqix2ekczamklvx2ekwu.g00.gamepedia.com/g00/3_c-5nittwcb.oiumx78mlqi.kwu_/c-5UWZMXPMCA09x24pbbx78ax3ax2fx2foiumx78mlqi.kczamklv.kwux2fnittwcb_oiumx78mlqix2fkx2fk3x2fZqwb_omiz.x78vox3fdmzaqwvx3d0jmlj4kn3mj5n36m701500lmnmlk2978_$/$/$/$/$?i10c.ua=1&amp;i10c.dv=16) on it, since it doesn't really make sense.
---
No point as he uses perks and thus has high dr
---
You're doing it wrong. Consider:
---
1. The Tourist spawns only once per server.  
---
2. The Tourist only spawns in one of a few possible locations.  
---
3. Server hopping often returns you to the same server.
---
Conclusion: Server hopping and checking one location over an over is an ineffective and inefficient way to acquire the camera quest. Instead, load into a server as normal, then visit every location where the Tourist can spawn. Using this method, you are all but guaranteed to find the Tourist.
---
I tried to server hop for a good hour or so, then decided to use the Scenic Route method instead and got it on my first try.
---
Hardly anyone talks. Even if I have my headset on. So I just stopped using it.
---
I've gotten *really* good stuff out of machines. It's a crapshoot.
---
It completes both with only one cryptid and it's the Flatwoods monster.
---
Awesome!
---
I feel you are blowing this out of proportion.
---
Ultimately it is my opinion and a reflection of my experience with the more toxic aspect of the player base.
---
By no means is this a everyone but me is wrong statement, nor is it implying that someone‚Äôs behaviour in game reflects their conduct in real life. That would be sheer lunacy, as it would mean everyone in Survival mode is a psychopath because they enjoy slaughtering fellow players.
---
I‚Äôm simply stating that there is the distinct possibility that any number of players may choose to wipe out the NPC‚Äôs, simply because they can. However just as you stated that it is wrong for me to make a binding decision based on my opinion affecting the player base, it would also be unfair to other players if the NPCs are wiped out because of the actions of other players. 
---
In all likelihood NPCs will either be essential or respawn within minutes. However once again this is my opinion and mine alone.
---
I don't think any of that is true, or if that'show it's supposed to work then it bugs out constantly.  I have been attacked by turrets immediately upon approaching a base and I've been attacked by players that then ran and hid inside their indestructible base.
---
The thing that makes this the most frustrating is all the players that brag about actually getting good stuff.  Just like everything RNG related in this game.
---
Without a spot of horseshoes in your rolls, you're screwed and frustrated.  Best bet is to stop paying attention to what everyone else has, and believe no one has anything.
---
I'd love to take some pics with you bro. GT: TwEaK354
---
I think sometimes some people think some players hold the best gear for themselves, which I would too. ü§†
---
Yeah I was thinking of just having a small community team of moderators
---
Thanks for the reminder I had a huge difference in my driver version but sadly this only helped very little it made the game more fluent and small stutters a bit less frequent but I still have big fps drops every 10 seconds or so
---
There's supposed to be aliens added so idk how their gonna be implemented
---
How do we know
---
Yeah it's been a good setup. I got a connector sticking out the roof with a conduit attached which connects to my turrets.
---
Then the obvious thing for Bethesda is to make it so players are unable to kill the brahmin unless they're in conflict with you just like they did with every other camp item.
---
That's what I keep saying, we need a Fallout Yelp.
---
Yeah
---
I don‚Äôt recall asking you
---
oMg wHo EveN pLayS tHis aNYmoRe?!?!
---
If you mean PC specs here you go:  
---
 GPU: Geforce GTX 1050 Ti  
---
Motherboard: ASUS M5A97 R2.0   
---
And GPU drivers are up to date (updated them today and tested it made it a bit more fluent and made small stutters less frequent but that's about it I still have huge fps drops every 10 seconds or so)
---
yes...
---
Dog food. Put about 25 cans in machine a day and they are gone every time I come back to base.  I always do a watoga run thru before I quit for the day   Easy to get 3 magazines 3 bobble heads and 20+ dog food
---
I scraped 15 radiums today without learning mod.. i need supresor.. got Q25/less vats and AA vats crit / agi
---
You dare to assume it's species? What if from a young toaster it's dream was to be a feral ghoul?
---
On a side note sometimes bugs can be funny.
---
well I also got used to it but sometimes it's just making me completely insane when I try to play with a friend and we get attacked and I can't help because I am stuck with a frozen screen or similar.  
---
And tbh Bethesda actually did bring out a proper version in the beta in terms of FPS it was all fine back then idk what they changed but it turned out to be worse for me.
---
Hi sorry I didn't accept your invite today, was waiting for vendor refresh as I can't fast travel until I've sold/scrapped some stuff I do still want to team up though if you still do
---
When is my canvas bag being shipped?
---
üëç
---
I've also heard of people finding them in yellow containers and scorched beast poop
---
nope got nothing wireless on my PC
---
Just north of Cobblrton Farm and a wee bit down hill is a cliff, that runs out into a point.  I run a minimalist alfresco camp, so its location within earshot (you can here the hand pump) of the Farm and a stone's throw from a PA rack was nice.  
---
The best part was setting the benches along the cliff edge to work with a view, and put a campfire cooking station, bed, and chair out by the point.  Great view, and on a good day you could scope the entire Toxic Valley from there all the way to the space station.  Great place that I might move back to when I'm rich enough FT across the map.
---
Wait, for real? People eat dog food?
---
Owl helmet and bathrobe
---
Thank you soo much for this information! this cleared a lot of things for me. Would you take a minute and take a look at this youtube video?
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbnvqANUmkw&amp;t=441s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbnvqANUmkw&amp;t=441s) and skip to 06:05? You can see that he is out of stealth because his Chameleon wore off but the guy still can't see him.. Can you verify if sneak has changed since that video?
---
[Dewey defeats Truman!](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Defeats_Truman)
---
Why do you buy them?
---
would you still advice me to go for a sneak pvp build? I read that the "one shot melee" builds are overdue and the "double tap explosive shotguns" are THE way to go.. I still love sneak above Rambo style tho..
---
Oooooh. I see.
---
Just keep thumbing them down while staying as close as you can to them. Eventually the problem will take care of itself.
---
Couldn‚Äôt you hide in the cave?
---

Scorchbeast guano piles
---
Oh. Yeah, I sell it like 2 caps less than the default price.
---
Given your user flair, that‚Äôs perfect
---
That's a steel.
---
Ooooh I have some good ones too I'll share later
---
GT is Jjinsaru same as here, so is 7pm around your usual time to be on? That would be around 1am for me which is when I'm usually on
---
U can jus get 2 armor pieces that have reduce fall dmg by %50 with 2 u take no fall dmg I been useing it for a while it‚Äôs great to jus go to top of mountains an jump off an not die
---
Nice breakdown of what each backpack does. Love the armor plated and the high capacity packs !
---
C‚Äômon... Protectron identifies as a ghoul...lol
---
But, do they actually think that Somebody is just going to spontaneously give up that gear to some guy on a whim. Like, ‚Äúthis is my best gun that‚Äôs gotten me out the deadliest of scrapes time and time again, and I‚Äôll probably never be able to replace it without spending a million caps. But, you know what? It‚Äôs yours, wandering stranger.‚Äù
---
If your not working to get the win its not a "Win" üòâ
---
Eh. What I and many others definitely want: Actual faction roles! Yes! I want to be able to actually be in a commanding position for a Brotherhood of Steel 'faction'/'clan' what have you.
---
I don't care about PvP I just want to roleplay!
---
I'll up vote that...and put one in your brain pan if I see you in the wastes lol.
---
Curse you...now I have Silver and Gold stuck in me noggin.... ;)
---
I think I‚Äôm a little over 300
---
Because they think that they all know everything better üôÑ 
---
At least you know now how it realy works üòÇ
---
Yeah I'm usually on around 1am so 7pm your TZ, what time are you usually on?
---
I found one in a metal bin in the uranium fever area. Think they can be found anywhere it's just rng. But I cant confirm anywhere else accept that one spot.
---
The crashed space station. Seeing a huge thing like it is an amazing sight
---
Found that earlier today lmao
---
This is cool and funny and all but at least wear a hazmat to the queen if you're not doing her with friends who can kill her instantly.  You're making her have more hp by being there and doing zero damage if you're, "basically constantly spamming rad-away while trying to take pot shots at it from medium to long range"
---
You're just making people use more ammo, meds, and repair costs and just a general more difficult time.
---
Raider starts at 15 i believe
---
Why do you believe lower level players need or want help playing a video game?
---
Yeah, but they'll keep talking at you and/or making counteroffers via the trade interface until they've taken advantage of you.
---
It‚Äôs not overpowered there‚Äôs a counter just get good
---
At level 9 focus more on getting established and crafting and scrapping and acquiring weapons and armor and perking yourself out.
---
You can't wear power armor for awhile so don't worry about it yet.
---
Army bases are your friend
---
Green footlockers, I‚Äôve found all of mine in those
---
I see what you mean by him sneaking up very clearly with the stealth combat knife. However, my bet would be that the person in the power armour had either extremely low perception which is why even though the player was clearly visible, he still got a sneak attack. that and the escape artist card isn't some miracle card that makes you invisible to players...all that card does in this game is it gives a 2 second boost to stealth  by 20~ or so roll chance. this way it's almost guaranteed for most non player enemies in the game to loose you. cause your sneak is ridiculously high for a few seconds. it used to role against players way back in the beta and that's why it was a little overpowered. now it no longer affects players all to well and has a cooldown now. previously back in the beta that card could be activated by just spamming the crouch button over and over which basically made you impossible to "detect"
---
I buy them to scrap so I can hopefully unlock the armor piercing mod.
---
If it were a trebuchet you may have it at least 300m
---
It‚Äôs ironic anytime anyone uses the term ‚Äúvirtue signaling‚Äù, because they themselves are doing it too.
---
Well, I built and scrapped 15 lvl25 level rifles.  Got a mod with pretty much every rifle. All duplicates except the last one... Refined receiver.  It's not hardened, but it will do.  Its about a 50 dmg increase over what i had, so I'm happy.   First shot is at 445 dmg.
---
I want to actually do damage though lol, the only options are either explosive(which breaks in about 12 seconds) or be forced into a bloodied build.
---
This is why I never visit a camp if I‚Äôm not in PA.
---
Yeah it seems to be in things that have randomly generated junk. So I guess there's no point in actively looking for them. Just passively
---
Materials mainly.
---
Hey, are you online?
---
Loot everything! üëç
---
I have a friend testing this out, but it's been a week and still no dice
---
For starters, turn the game off, and get some proper sleep. Yes, it's a fun game, but barely sleeping for six days is a no go.
---
Because I can test first hand, that I was in need of help and struggling at first along the way and I‚Äôm not someone that just looks for handouts by any means. Plus the few that I was able to help thanked me numerous times. Plus fallout gets lonely if you play by yourself when you have no friends that play the game in a multiplayer type game. Being able to cooperate with others makes it more tolerable
---
This
---
Hit rank up
---
Select any perk that isn‚Äôt intelligence

Then you can tab over to select a card from a different tree
---
Don't crush his dreams
---
This is caused by mods.
---
I feel like i need all the things i have for sneaking,  wouldnt know what to do with out it.  But no i like my build for the most part
---
You can start the Miner Miracles quest now and I recommend it since you can do everything needed to get the excavator power armor except build it and register it. 
---
Doing so now will produce lower level enemy at the location. 
---
Note: you can‚Äôt get or build the power armor till level 25, however you can start and almost complete the whole quest well before! I‚Äôve done it 3 times on other characters! 
---
Here is a good walkthrough... 
---
 http://dulfy.net/2018/11/15/fallout-76-excavator-power-armor-guide/
---
Hey I've seen you in game! Cheers buddy!
---
Timelines not the same it would create more issues
---
I use mine sometimes for quick commo, once in awhile for atmosphere.  I kind of took on an Elmer Fudd persona while working on some scout badges.  Might try some "take me to your leader" bits when I'm in the hazmat suit next.
---
But really, there aren't that many people on a server, so even bumping into anplayer can be interesting.
---
I bet I'll beat you in every balanced pvp mode, you can't be good if you think a good build defines your personal skill. And it's pretty much op to one shot, that's why they nerfed TSEs in the first place
---
I've only bought two items with scrip, but I got ridiculously lucky on both, my first was a TSE pipe revolver and the second was an explosive railway rifle.
---
Too true. Punch, radaway, punch, radaway, punch, punch..
---
Dead from rads.
---
This and fighting yogis, deathclaws and the like. One way or another the first hit is a killer.
---
Cool guys don‚Äôt look at explosions

Looking down toward watoga from big bend tunnel is so beautiful. The cranberries and the pink trees in broad daylight. Just saw this and really payed attention for the first time. So beautiful

Leveling up occurs in two steps: assigning a SPECIAL point, and then choosing a perk.
---
If you want to choose an Intelligence perk with a maxed out Int stat: first assign a SPECIAL point to any stat that you want, then when you have the option to choose your perk card you are free to navigate to the Int section and choose the perk you want :-D
---
Ah the old, "your making her have more hp" meme. Never gets old lol
---
That's my main reason for not wearing Power Armor all the time too. I wear the Owl mask and the patriotic suit that I got with the Tricentennial edition.
---
Bloodied builds all die easily, it's the trade off for silly damage output that non-bloodied seem to ignore when saying it's op and needs nerfing. As others have mentioned survival perks are more useful than dr increase ones. Personally I find ghoulish a useful perk on mine as it means scorchbeasts and ghouls will heal you as much as hurt you and radaway is easier to come.by than stimpaks.
---
Gotcha
---
The streamer doesn't have mods :P
---
Everyone knows the good stuff is in your personal stash, gotta shoot your shot ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Not in my case. I have never installed a mod for any version of Fallout and I still have issues with FO76 failing to perform a fast travel periodically.
---
Same :-/

You can around 800 steel with Super Duper from doing a run at Hornwright Testing Site #3. Literally takes less than 2 minutes to collect 210ish iron ore once you know where all the nodes are. Killing those 3 Snallygasters makes it so you get about 15 acid every 3-4 (my average time to server hop takes 2 and a half minutes, just takes that long to load). Smelting ore only takes 1 acid in the case of iron ore. Meaning you only have to use 105 acid for every time you smelt that amount. If you also go a little bit out of your way to collect junk that contains acid, it's not too difficult to amass a ton of it in a short time. If you already have the acid, collecting all the ore and smelting it takes less than 10 minutes for 800 steel, which is about the same time it can take to go through an area or 2 of enemies and scrapping everything. It's not really all that different time-wise.
---
That stuff is duplicated
---
How‚Äôs it op that you can one shot a bloodied build, but the bloodied build can‚Äôt 1 shot you. 
---
Stay far away and snipe, make a tank build and take more than 1 shot. It‚Äôs not op your just not good at pvp.
---
But I‚Äôm not selling that stuff. Is there some kind of disconnect here???
---
Maybe, just thought it would be a fun thing to have. Maybe not Diamond City's, but some broadcast you pick up.
---
Doesn‚Äôt hurt to take an offer, to some people everything has a price. It‚Äôs just a game
---
Get The Fixer
---
I guess lol
---
They have to have proper licensing for every song per each title. So any song they want to use from fallout 4 in fo76 would require a brand new license to use it.
---
It shouldn't because it would be the most unfair move Bethesda could made to people that dislike pvp.
---
Nope. You don‚Äôt start running into Raider Armor until level 15, and Excavator becomes a thing at level 25 minimum. Focus on your quests, kills, crafting, and building to gain the XP necessary to then reach these goals.
---
I hope so, but with the introduction of a new mode like battle royal of all things, a good bit of content will likely be made for it specifically, and this will be over a 3 month period. All we know right now for pve is the vault raids and legendary players (basically prestiging with some benefits from what it sounds like, I hope it's more of a new tier though, rather than resetting to zero).
---
I‚Äôve sold 1 star handmade for 20k on offer because people see it in my inventory, people be crazy lol. Didn‚Äôt want to keep it that bad
---
I did it is survival a few weeks ago.  I started on a server with no one else on but me so on a whim I started taking workshops while waiting for a storm to take a picture in. By the time I took the last one other people were actively hunting me, but I was jumping around to the workshops doing defend missions from stealth until I got the last unowned workshop.
---
It was super exhausting, but fun as hell, and no I am never doing it again.
---
What Star was it? At least say AA. Lol
---
I had a similar experience the other day.
---
Trappy camps, not even mad.
---
https://youtu.be/XD3bIumxlp0
---
You can one shot him, if you see him but then theres that perks making you avoid damage, and they can one shot me. I repeat, I'll bet all I got that I'm way better than you. You can only see invisible player after he shot, and that's when it's alread, too late. I never argued about usual bloodied builds, but you can decline your disadvantages with chamaleon armor or mutation which makes this build just too strong in pvp. And you should'nt be forced to take a set build and weapons to be able to compete, that's what balance is for. Did you ever play a proper pvp game? Because we all know 76 is not one of them and is indeed broken in many ways
---
Its not hate or prejudice just because you disagree with someone
---
But the experience sounds like it was invaluable!
---
Thank you for taking the time to watch that part of the video. I was aiming to go for that build he showed there because I love stealthy-builds. But is that still viable in PVP? I read that the "one shot melee" builds are overdue and that "double tap explosive shotguns" are the way to go..
---
Guano pile, now it resides in my vendor
---
Yeah I know it‚Äôs the trade off but I still felt I was dying more easier than I suspect others are. This post ya helped me for sure
---
Butcher‚Äôs Bounty helped me out. And I assumed the recipe requiring three of these was because it‚Äôs a choice piece of meat needed to do this delicacy just right. Most Scorchbeast meat is gamey:)
---
Do you mainly use it for PVE or PVP?
---
I just stopped playing too because something very similar happened to me. I‚Äôm out of ammo. stimpacs and this is the very last thing I needed before I get my backpack. ..  :(
---
I only need two meatballs on my sandwich! 3 is too many!
---
It‚Äôs roughy for sure with how fast stuff rots. Butchers bounty is a must for this challenge. Rank 3 I think is 80% chance to get extra?
---
How can I make a catapult?????
---
That tadpole challenge to make it is optional. I think some recipes are allowed to be difficult in this otherwise easy game. If you‚Äôre using that much ammo to kill a scorchbeast, you‚Äôre doing something wrong
---
For real get some rest.  Treat yo self.
---
Maybe people migrated/fled the Capital Wasteland out north/west into the country, realizing all of rural MD/VA was overrun by folks with the same idea (who are now raiders, downtrodden settlements, etc.), then kept heading west until they hit the bog area. Then we'd get a nice nod to FO3 (albeit quite a bit earlier). Or maybe the Capital Wasteland BOS sends a group westward to figure out what happened to Taggerdy's group or take care of the Scorched problem, only to find a ragtag team of Vault dwellers took care of it. And then we'll have a big conflict between the dwellers-turned-raiders (led by Rose, maybe?), the nuclear-armed SBQ-killing dwellers (led by the Overseer if she survived), and the Brotherhood.
---
Hell, just a point emote, then we can go and point ‚Äúover there‚Äù at the vending machines
---
Honestly it's all personal preference. you just have to build it up and try it. I went melee for a while until I was level 70 and then I switched over to heavy guns because smacking things got a little stale for me. The perk build shown does specialize in a stealthy melee build but for one handed weapons. you can be a stealthy unarmed or even a stealth two handed if you'd like. it's about specialization and yes, it will do just fine but I would recommend taking fireproof and white knight. it helps against TSE weapons and helps with armour repairing because frankly. you'll be breaking armour left and right with a melee build.
---
You won't really be able to invest heavily in stealth perks until, if I recall correctly, level 36 or so. A stealth build however is incredibly viable, and I'd dare say the best build if you're playing solo. An optimized stealth build can easily snipe enemies for 1k+ damage per shot, based on several variables.
---
If you play with others, or plan to, stealth is by default less effective. Sometimes being near another player, whether you're teaming up or even fighting the same enemies or not, stealth just breaks, and you go from being basically invisible to being discovered before you even get anywhere near anything.
---
If you enjoy the stealth approach, it's definetely viable though. In terms of build ideas and general thoughts on stealth, if you're in any way interested, you can search for my reddit handle on youtube, where I shared different variations of my stealth build a few times and talk (arguably way to) in-depth about it.
---
Yea, on the weekends I get one about 7pm.
---
And then Wednesday i play as well.
---
Whoever you are, you've done God's work, son.
---
It's one of those wooden spike traps that swings out and smacks you. There's a few of them in Candem Park.
---
It‚Äôs completely random. I‚Äôve found two in fort defiance though, 3rd floor where you find rare uniforms. They‚Äôd be in foot locker and metal containers.
---
I understand your point but that bloodied build comes with handicaps, lets say after he shot you he leaves the spiders nest and goes to loot you but in doing so get seen by a lv 20 player with a black powder pistol.  Boom oneshotted by a non legendary lv 20 player. How op could he be if that is possible. Just another balancing aspect to look at.
---
Meh...who needs it...
---
Bethesda has my money if they release a very similar esk riot gear clothing outfit. You hear that? COLD HARD CASH.
---
I point with my gun :)
---
As a level 68-69 I have the same question for higher level players
---
Well both really, makes it alot easier fighting anything if whatever it is cant see you well...made quests and things way easier when i was lower level before survival had come out too
---
It hasnt happened yet... Still another hour 20 minutes.

It hasn‚Äôt happened yet. The pre show isn‚Äôt for another hour and a half.

Hate comes in all ways and means... it even rears it's ugly head among those who try to convince the world (and themselves) that it's "just a disagreement" or that it's "just a difference of opinion".

The Bethesda stream IS at 530 today... Pacific time...
---
My sweet summer child...
---
The flatwoods monster. The heat's getting to my head
---
It starts in about an hour and a half. 5:30 PT is 8:30 EST
---
awesome I will do that thanks a lot and ya I tend to play solo. I don't play well with others it seems lol.
---
That's like saying superman is not op because there is cryptonite lol. Also this situation still requires me to auto loose the engagement and someone else to come by. And he doesn't need to loot me while he probably won't run into a lv20 blindfolded.
---
I thought legendary players was coming with Wastelanders dlc? Curious to see how that works.
---
I personally enjoy the journey from low level to high. I‚Äôve always enjoyed leveling up and using different play styles.
---
Perhaps you could use some help. Teaming up to gain more meats would be a good start, go in with teammates knowing you're there for the meats. Also sounds like you might be underpowered to handle scorchbeasts if your meats spoiled before you've only dealt to two and that was too long. Only thing that might be a factor would be if one of them was a queen. That would certainly be a pisser to try and deal with solo. What system are you using? PC, PS4, Xbox?
---
 Personally using TSE automatic handmade to get scorchbeasts to land, then go in with a Vampire knife with swing speed to pull as much health out of her as I can before they get airborne again, repeat.
---
Did you get that egg mask from the Atomic Shop, or was it RNG?
---
So if someone disagrees with your opinion they are prejudice and full of hate.  Got it

Also, if they wanted to include some of Maryland with the expanded area, there's Fort Detrick in Frederick County, where the government IRL biological sciences (weapons, defense, etc.) and it used to be a chemical waste dumping ground until the 70s! It's basically begging to the home of *some* sort of government experiment gone wrong.
---
I just found my last one in my camp junk extractor. Not actually in it. I've noticed once it "restocks" if you look at a yellow barrel and "harvest" it, even tho your extracting you can get full junk items. Saw a deathclaw hide and got my badge. Hope this helps.

---
It will.
---
Nuked White Springs.  I probably got 40-45 legendaries in about a 3 hour period today just farming glowing ghouls.  I started the day at 370 pounds.  I‚Äôm now 950 pounds.
---
Can‚Äôt tell if your joking or not but yep with a perk good doggie I think it is it fills you up. Like the cola nut perk but for dog food
---
Happened to me once, saw a nuke was going to launch while messing around in my camp, quickly made some ammo and grabbed some chems, and got over there.
---
Completely forgot I had been bulking scrap, got back to my stash and went ‚Äúwhere did those bulked cloth and bone and steel I was going to sell go... GOD DAMMIT!
---
Hey man,  thank you!  I just tried this place out (the mine)  and holy shit. . 50cal mo for days!  And I just got a berserker flamer so I'll hit up the acid spot next
---
I‚Äôve been to some camps that are unbelievable. I try to take pics of the camp with the player if they are there. As for notes, it could work but people being people, some would write f you , you suck.... and more interesting expletives.  Just saying ü§†
---
I get where you're coming from, but like I said, such a system is already active, and if anything you could very well argue the numbers should be changed in the opposite direction of what you're suggesting. Doing some PvP earlier at my level 80 character versus a full team, the 50+ players were much less of a threat than the level 35 in the group, who more or less had potato aim.
---
What makes or breaks PvP, regardless of level range, is typically just the gear. Heck, if you can get a full set of optimized level 5-10 gear with the proper effects, it'll still outperform many level 45-50 items because some effects are so vastly superior.
---
As for what I said thought, whether it should be a priority or not is not really the question. They obviously want to try to create the best experience for all of their players, and as such prioritize certain issues, bugs and features above others. Going for workshops however, is literally intended to encourage PvP, by design. If you're having bad experiences with it, maybe try it once you're better equipped, or even just change server. I've often experienced having 10+ people in and out of teams coming for a single workshop in half an hour, while also at other times controlled most workshops on the map with nobody even bothering to try to take them, even though I was level 10-20 at the time.
---
Jug gaming made a tutorial on how to do this. I believe he was one of the first. Check him out he has good tips on building
---
Farming what? I‚Äôm out of steel and my melee sucks. I have no ammo. Needed Grafton for all that steel to make ammo. Guess I could go punch low levels for hunting rifle drops. But then I‚Äôll be over encumbered and I hate walking around like that. 
---
I also like building stuff. It‚Äôs one of my favorite parts of the game. And the game was obviously set up for that or there wouldn‚Äôt be workshops in the first place. With 50% workshop mats cost I can usually put down a Fusion reactor, all the extractors, and at Poseidon 7-8 industrial water so that I can collect all that water and sell for caps on top of everything else. So yeah, it‚Äôd be nice if the game worked the way it was designed to.
---
Sadly some people will do just that. üò®
---
Youd hate my camp it can spawn you in a mountain
---
The reward for this challenge is super low as well.
---
You don‚Äôt need Gramh for the powered doors
---
Well, it can be hard to find people to play with in this game, in my experience. At least consistently. Luckily, both solo and group play make for slightly different experiences in both PvE and PvP.
---
Will definetely recommend a stealth build if you expect to be carving through Appalachia by yourself :)
---
I just want the milk..
---
I've got one point in butcher's bounty, but it still wasn't enough.
---
I would like to recruit you to moderate over at /r/modabuse please pm me!
---
+1 for the mods being proactive!
---
Well superman is not op if you have it. Just like the bloodied build is not if you counter it. Their advantage is surprise and setup.You were just not the guy holding the cryptonite this time. Catch that same guy slipping and different story. Just saying, thats the play style. We face vs them lets not remove it but lets get tha cryptonite
---
Hey
---
When I first came across it I was awestruck, just wondering how it fell and what happened on it. Can't wait to see what they implement onto the space station.
---
People would give the finger I the pic if they could.
---
I don't moderate because that's free labor for Reddit.
---
Checks out.
---
oh I am one of the main reasons is I am sick of meeting every single player that has the same game style.....should change the name to Rambo 76
---
I killed 2 of them by myself.  I didn't have a ton to start with, but those things take a lot of shots to kill.
---
Well this is going to be interesting...I hope in addition to Nuclear Winter, which we mostly know what is due to datamining, they'll reveal something about the Wasteland update and some more events and such.
---
I mean if you spawn into a cage, just fast travel away.
---
Battle royal ftw. &gt;=]
---
This for sure
---
I‚Äôm lowering my expectations considerably in the hopes that I am not disappointed, but I‚Äôm open to any news at this point. I just hope that fo76 doesn‚Äôt die due to new games and whatever else Bethesda has planned for the future. 
---
Also, +1 for the mods being proactive!
---
Hunt with friends and help each other out!
---
Yea some camps are really neat. I'd love to give them a check in or a recorded thumbs up or something. Like a terminal or something.
---
I'm just ready to see what the news is. Speculation aside. All I have heard and seen is expectations so I will stay tuned for the announcements
---
No you don‚Äôt understand. You aren‚Äôt expected to do anything. But I have a feeling you‚Äôll
---
Enjoy the modmails and I‚Äôd love to see more of these kind of replies to some of the people haha but your call
---
The only real downside to a stealthy rifleman build (and this is coming from somebody who rocks a bloodied stealthy rifleman build) is the SBQ fight. Pretty much useless in that fight unless you do what I did and make it to wear you can utilize certain melee weapons effectively as well. Otherwise you'll be useless in the queen fight.
---
I feel ya buddy. I only got the camera a week ago. Every time I played I would visit every location but I never got lucky. I tried server hopping at some of the places several times, but that got pretty boring after about an hour.
---
Then last week I got lucky. I was playing with a friend, helping him scavenge crafting mats and stuff when we decided to both go look for the camera (he already had it, but decided to help me find it). I hit up the places in the Toxic Valley while he was server hopping at Wavy Willards. I server hopped once there myself and lo and behold, after one hop I saw a dead body leaning against the car where there was none the countless other times I visited that spot.
---
Now I know this won't help you find it, but all I'm trying to say is that you'll find it eventually. Also, if you're on PS4 I could add you and if I run into it, I can send you a message.
---
Same with the silent Hill siren.. just sounds cool m
---
Yeah the only time I have killed someone‚Äôs brahmin was when they were selling something I had really wanted (~150 value) for 5k
---
lol this thread
---
She's getting ahead of the next elder scrolls game.
---
This should be resolved but a temporary solution is the second u spawn in, flat out sprint in a direction for 2 seconds
---
Miss Latriiice Royaleee
---
It took my friends and I an hour of server hoping to get the camera and get it over with, and we did it separately at different times. All did it at Wavy Willard's Water Park. Unless you're truly unlucky, it's indeed the least frustrating way of obtaining the camera in a timely manner. I could spend some time watching a movie to get it over with as soon as possible, or hope to get it weeks later by pure chance. I can not understand how some people have yet to get it. I think server hoping multiple locations is more painful than just doing one over and over. Again, just watch or do else something while doing it. Of course you're going to go mad if that's the only thing you're doing.
---
ESO, Legends and Rage 2 get Twitch bonuses but Fallout 76 doesn't. RIP us.
---
There is no such thing as a Perk-reset right? How did you switch from melee to heavy guns? Did you make a new character? I am very cautious where I put my points into because I read there is no reset..
---
Thank you for doing this.  The sub gets so frequently buried in same-posts after almost any news.  Moreover if there is something negative that people can pounce on.
---
For me I was really hyped for FO76 after E3 last year, and although rough to get going I think things are moving in a good direction.
---
Hopefully we will get some news not only about Nuclear Winter, but also about this falls Wastelanders update, and perhaps a tease of what might come after that. Really excited about this!
---
My dream would be detailed news about:  
---
\* Factions  
---
\* NPCs  
---
\* Vault Raids
---
Nice Straw Man... 
---
I never stated that all people who disagree do so out of hate or prejudice or bias... I stated that people who are biased, prejudice and hateful attempt to assuage their hate, bias and/or prejudice by presenting it as "a difference of opinion" or a "disagreement".
---
...every time I read a [news story that shares a new survey that shows an ever increasing percentage of people support gay marriage](https://www.pewforum.org/fact-sheet/changing-attitudes-on-gay-marriage/), comments/viewpoints like yours to remind me of the hate, bias and prejudice that still exists against gay men and women, both overt and subtle...
---
Yea but that's exactly the opposite of balance. There are so many perk cards and even so much funny builds, if all of these get outlined because you can't compete otherwise that makes the game less fun for most people. You also can't really counter it if that guy stays invisible and decides to be patient not risking his death. Like I've previously mentioned I absolutely get your point on bloodied builds on their own, but having the ability to become fully invisible covers most of their disadvantages. You can only kill them if you see them, and you only do that if they shoot, so they only shoot when they know they will insta kill you, and they do so because of that x3 sneak damage and their already op damage output because of the bloodied build. If you're alone they can get your loot and hide again before you can kill them, that's just not balanced in any ways.
---
Super curious about the vault stuff, I'm really hoping we can build our own shelter style and then spawn into them GTA apartment style. I'm really hoping they add in new weapons too as the marketing material seems to suggest, would really love a new set of syringers that are actually useful. What I'm really hoping for though is the quality of life improvements. Things like perk cards effecting stash, fast travel mats, and being able to play Arktos or launch a nuke without the game crashing every time. Idk, really hyped for whatever they do since it's on sale and I'm hoping it brings in some new players.
---
We was looking to have you hit him. Then have his cloaked piece of .... friend one shot you with the gun they bought from some duper or on mommy‚Äôs credit card on ebay. Had the same thing happen to me and I signed off so they both could ..... each other. ü§†
---
I honestly didn't know that was meta.
---
Do those workshops give out special plans? I normally only take over the golf course when I'm in dire need of acid, so besides that I've never really seen an advantage to taking them.
---
Hi in dire need of acid, so besides that i've never really seen an advantage to taking them., I'm dad.
---
And why do you want that?
---
I'm on PC.  I'm only level 60 on this character, and don't have great weapons yet.  It took a while just to get a scorchbeast to spawn.  They were all killed and everyone left the nuke zone already.  I was actually on a different server when I got the first 2 scorchbeast meats, I'm not really sure how much time passed.  It just seems difficult for one person to get 3 scorchbeast meats to make a sandwich.
---
My real fear is spawning into a cage and they have a pet deathclaw there waiting for me.
---
Waiting for Nuclear Winter almost makes you wish to patrol the Mojave.
---
### NUCLEAR WINTER
---
#### RELEASE: SUMMER 2019
---
Summer will bring another series of major updates to Fallout 76, including **Nuclear Winter** \- an entirely new way to play that changes the rules of the wasteland.
---
* **New Game Mode: Nuclear Winter** ‚Äì An entirely new way to play Fallout 76, completely changing the rules of the Wasteland.
---
* **New Vault Raids: Vaults 96 and 94 Opening** ‚Äì For our most seasoned players, test your strength in all new high-level group Vault Raids.
---
* **New Feature: Legendary Players** ‚Äì An all-new prestige system will allow players above level 50 to become Legendary, resetting their characters with all new more powerful abilities.
---
Straight from the roadmap.
---
I usually just play solo.
---
OP is Timetraveler
---
I dont get it :(
---
They don't call it a grinder for nothing.
---
I mean, going by that logic shouldn't we just all quit at level 50 and try another game..
---
One of my biggest hopes is robot crafting in the Wastelanders season. The one gray image in the roadmap shows a robot, so I think there‚Äôs a solid chance!
---
This is what am trying to tell my brother. He loves Fallout as much as I do (although he thought NV was the best one, and I thought it was the worst), but when I told him that I have been playing it, he looked at me like I was stupid. I think I finally convinced him to try it.
---
That is also unless you invest in commando perks as well. Thankfully those are also in perception so it's actually really easy to swap the rifleman perks out for the commando perks of need be.
---
lol if you play on PC i saw your camp yesterday and made a comment about your name to my Group XD small world :)
---
Well, aren't you a useless yet entertaining bot...
---
Maybe a feral ghoul robot mutation! Watch it!
---
You have egg on your face...
---
Wherever strangler pods spawn, got there at night.
---
Its not fair in most cases, I agree but lets be real what makes them op is the stealth. There are many builds that can one shot, 76s health pools are low. To nerf that aspect would nerf many other builds and a core aspect of gameplay. Not trying to argue or insult you brother. Ive been on both side and lost my fair share of them.
---
Thank you. Do you know of any other place than the chemical plant that has strangler pod spawns that's close to a fast travel point?
---
If you take off fireproof nubs like me will get the pvp kill! Ill throw a nuka mine in your face and take us both out!
---
Haha gotcha. I'm not embarrassed by asking a question. I legit thought it was 2 hours ago. I've only got internet at work if I'm up on the roof, haha. I've been isolated all day and I'm goin nuts
---
There is no hard reset. However once you reach level 50 you will then be able to swap one point from a category into another. say you have 10 str. and 12 endurance but you want 11 str. you can take a point from endurance making it twelve and add that point to strength. However! if you do this you will not receive a perk card for that level so it's either pick a card or swap a point.
---
There are none, it only spawns in the one area
---
Honestly, that's the only one I can think of.
---
Nice! I‚Äôve wanted an explosive shotgun, particularly a pump, for a LONG time. I‚Äôve only ever dropped one explosive and I‚Äôm level 98...
---
Depends on what survey you are reading, no way itd be biased and in no way did you explain your last post
---
DOOM Eternal's release date and Nuclear Winter's content's all I need to see
---
I know!! I have a camp on the mt. To the left of the ammo factory. I spawn 9/10 times INSIDE the mt. An have to jump around an find the clipped spot. Some times i have to server hop to get back up top. Hell many times Ive spawned in for my camp to only show my camp structure thing. An my generator. Im talkin, walking around the map an coming back an still only seeing that. Still love the game but thats a major headache
---
Yea but I prefer nerfing it down or keeping it to pve rather than having a single possible build that you can only counter in few cases and only with the right build. Bloodied builds as itself are more than perfectly balanced theirself
---
My camp is on that river, up from the behemoth....I even built a patio on the pond side because I love the view so much.
---
Please explain Twitch bonuses for me?
---
Hah.  It's all good.  I'm looking forward to it too!
---
It will if the person sparking the mutation by hitting you is wanted, just a little insight on how it works
---
I want that too. The games free from here on out so i am in no hurry.
---
It gives me chills ngl
---
56 Player Battle Royal incoming!
---
I'm very much looking forward to Bethesda having another band on stage. While the crowd last year didn't seem too enthusiastic about it, the lady and I watching that on stream was priceless. 
---
"When did we teleport back to the 80s? Who's this guy?" 
---
Probably my favorite quote of us while watching. 
---
Mainly, I'm hoping also for more of the road map for 76 though. More details on the legendary player that has been teased. So far, the e3 stream that has been playing today has been very positive.  
---
Enjoy the show all! May you all find joy amongst the confusion!
---
I go through spurts where nothing sells, then someone will come and grab all of my bobbleheads or magazines....I had a ton of mini nukes, but they weren't selling at all
---
Try accidentally scrapping the camera and spending 15+ hours looting toolboxes hoping to find one...
---
I still don't. 
---
I just want my GD Backpack
---
Most of the time, it means "Link your Twitch account to X Account" (in this case, your Bethesda account I guess) and they give you in-game bonuses of some kind.  I usually lurk on Warframe's streams cause they give out a ton of in-game goodies just for watching.
---
I thought there were welcome mats, they just don‚Äôt work... like really? But not being dropped into a wall whenever you go to your or someone else‚Äôs CAMP would be great. My character‚Äôs bit it several times falling through while trying to get to my CAMP, plus the bag drops in the wall where it is unattainable.
---
I am very disappointed in the current trend of uncompletable challenges (daily, weekly, and others). Some where you complete the task dont count, while others require things not yet released to complete.
---
I would love to see or hear some sort of reason why this still continues to be an issue.
---
Not sure about others but I‚Äôm only missing unstoppables 3. So it‚Äôs just luck to find it.
---
Fast travel mats would be an amazing addition. I hate where I spawn in, and my guests spawn into the second floor of my house. Better than inside the foundation, I suppose!
---
The number one thing I want is QOL changes. 
---
Please for the love of God a perk system change would satisfy me more than a raid at this point.
---
Inside the white spring bunker downstairs from the command center there is usually always technical data inside one of the desks. I reliably farm there.
---
A little closer to camp venture is the Robco research building which reliably has technical data in it. I can usually walk from Robco to venture a couple times per server.
---
I feel personally attacked! My girlfried asked what we were doing this weekend... Im at work shhh.
---
Have you?? Which camp did I have going?
---
Xbox 1 :)
---
pretty friggin' excited
---
Ah. I see these types of bonuses listed on Discord as well. I would like to see this as well.
---
Once I spawned into a base at Seneca rocks. I barely survived and got stuck on the side of a cliff
---
But the text says "while starving"
---
Argh
---
Wait, battle royale? Wtf would a fallout battle royale even look like
---
I half expect them to announce a community use for Vault 51 which means I'll get evicted pretty soon.
---
Thanks bud. I knew I had read that somewhere. Hopefully they talk about it tonight. üëçüëç
---
I couldnt find the plans anywhere else
---
Yup this almost happened to me. I signed off to piss these..... off!!!   ü§†
---
Worked just fine using a fire axe. Did 3 maybe 4 parts in Fairgrounds and the Tyler Racetrack
---
I have messaged someone in PSN messages to tel them how cool their camp was, I‚Äôm not sure if Xbox has the same function. I just typed their in-game name to find them.
---
I always make a point to leave an eviction notice for the people that still insist on building a camp next to the Charleston station or any other bad location.  I try to tell them why it's a bad spot if they are there, otherwise they come back to a nice paper bag telling them to get out lol
---
I read 52 player, but regardless the Battle Royale seems pretty definite
---
I'm gonna appologise ahead of time for posting this here if it was unwanted, but the feedback thread was archived and not a lot of people helped with the initial post I made, so I wanted to make a direct approach.
---
I want to address an issue that is starting to plague the xbox version of Fallout 76. Me \[XBGT: LTurmoil47\] and a friend of mine \[XBGT: Nisban489\] have been playing for a couple of months now and he just ran into a major interruption about 14 to 15 days ago.
---
When the recent update for the Arktos Pharma event released, it seems to have broke a lot of peoples games. We loaded into a world, we decided to go to Arktos Pharma for the new event, but when he tried taking the elevator down, his game immediately froze, and crashed to the xbox dashboard.
---
Upon questioning it on Reddit others are experiencing it either in specific areas, Arktos, the nuke Silo's, or in every building in the game. My friend's issue is the latter, and it even started to affect me by refusing access to Arktos Pharma's labs half the time.
---
We have both reinstalled the game and cleared our save data to see if that would rectify the issue, which to our displeasure didn't happen. I bring this up in the hopes that this will be fixed within the next hotfix, or sometime soon, cause we are now locked out of most of the game that resides past a loading screen leading indoors.
---
I do it for the junk and anger
---
... holes ü§†
---
I'll be honest, I love Fallout but I've been gone from the game so long, I didn't know anything about the green camps. I kind of figured it out because of this place but some people just don't know. Some people just don't know so they go back to the old way.
---
Please have pity on the foolish, we can only be a fool as long as we are never shown the way.
---
Does 76 really need a br mode?
---
Low lifes
---
Once and only once I found one outside the hotel with boomer. Usually I go to the chem plant and find them there.
---
Not at the moment, I will about an hour
---
That's what I do. Plus if you're the only guy who brought an endangerol syringer to the fight, you're doing as much or more than anyone.
---
Will definitely try this
---
So excited. Give me that new 76 shit!!!
---
76 doesn't lend itself to good streaming material. I try to watch streams but it's utterly boring. Half the streams are spent in menus, and the other half is spent walking around taking pictures or hanging around at someone's camp. It's fun playing, but watching someone play it is the worst.
---
So you start .... because your bored??
---
My friend built a great base literally there
---
Nope, you can't even use power armor until 15. Raider power armor plans are either ridiculously rare or not in the game, so you'll be relying on random stuff you scavenge for a while anyway. You won't really be using power armor until ~20. At I think 25 you can start building excavator armor, which can help in terms of both defense and hoarding
---
You two on Xbox? I'm gonna be busy all week, but if you are, I'll be free on the 12th, and can show y'all around, teach you some tricks, and the like.
---
It is honestly very nice, I'm thinking of going further up the river to see if it's a better layout. Every time I leave the area to build I new camp I always find myself going back.
---
220
---
It's a setup.  If they can't get you to retaliate it doesn't work.  
---
Had a 2 man team take my workshop by having 1 distract me right at the end of the defend event while the other snuck over, initated taking over the shop they used anti- armor to 2 shot me.
---
Then taunted me about taking my loot.
---
Some people's kids...
---
Green locker a Wavy Willards.
---
(Found in the course of server hopping trying to find the tourist.  
---
If the tourist wasn‚Äôt there, took out my frustration on the scorched inside the park.)
---
I sing along with the radio. Had one guy tell me to stop cause I wasn‚Äôt good. Told him he could just mute me. He didn‚Äôt like that!
---
Dude I would love to do that, like let them know that they had the one thing you've been looking for
---
So instead of waiting, you hit someone to get their attention. Have you tried this in real life, and if so, what happened?????ü§†
---
https://twitter.com/New_WabiSabi/status/1137842769966186496
---
BR amd NPCs incoming.  Side note, the game is currently $18 on amazon.
---
The bathrobe lightly lifting up as you fell made this into slapstick gold.
---
Bounties are there to be taken.
---
"Your tears sustain me"
---
Keep me going
---
Idk why but this was funny to me
---
Hella frustrating.
---
Been wanted a few times for this.
---
I have also unfortunately had to completely redesign my camp, which I have spend a great deal of time perfecting, to stop others having the same issue due to my door locks. 
---
It‚Äôs an RPG, Bethesda need to give us the option of controlling spawn in as some redditors headcannon isn‚Äôt playing nice with a randomer spawning in their locked bedrooms completely naked (sorry for that by the way ü•¥üòÇ).
---
I do that and/or jump in place immediately and it seems to work.
---
Great stuff with the mega thread - Thx for that!
---
I expect nothing but would like to see a tiny canvas joke to embrace the meme.
---
And of course being a bit curious what will presented as far it concern Fo76
---
Here's a few tricks, the scorchbeasts usually spawn when you're near a fissure site, you don't always have to be in a nuke zone to find them. There is a definite scorchbeast spawn for the Line in the sand event at Fort Defiance.  A good high damage weapon to get them on the ground is a must. Explosives will be a good addition too, be they grenades or TSE weapons. A perk on your Luck called Good with Salt increases the storage time. Worst comes to worse, put a request here for scorchbeast meats...
---
"Please wasteland daddy i didnt mean to this time honest"
---
SBQ fight. Use butchers bounty. Got it first try
---
Also yes. This weapon is fantastic for sneaking
---
If I get a bounty, I immediately go dump my junk at home then go find someone to kill me.
---
Ok. Thx.
---
LOL
---
Oh man, just realized my shitty computer terminal here at work can't handle watching live streams. My information cortex is in your hands, my fellow Wastelanders. Please provide as detailed information as you can as it all goes on, for the livestream is dark and full of terrors.
---
There is a spot north of the bed and breakfast, a bit to the south of vantage or lookout point. 
---
Fast travel, then face north. Go past all the white steps and make your way up the hill to the east. You'll pass a shack on the left with a small pond, right after that is the spot. It is also a random event spawn location, so if you see something odd (Mr messenger, baby sloths etc) you know it's the right place.
---
I‚Äôm hoping for at least a glimpse of Starfield and some FO76 news.
---
Crazy idea. Turn on mic and see what they want.
---
Now you have me curious if you haven‚Äôt been eating it or selling it what did you do with any dog food you picked up during playing??
---
I take bou nties from anyone whos wanted, no big deal
---
You can change it to Chefs (metal instead of wood) and add blades.  
---
Change to chefs I think you can do with makeshift warrior2.  the blades are a mod.
---
Both will increase the damage.
---
I don‚Äôt have a mic. A lot of players don‚Äôt.
---
Upvote for bad play on words.
---
They‚Äôd opt for 76 players.
---
try using a glowing blood pack and radx diluted..i do this and dont have a problem meleeing the queen out of pa in sneak
---
Kill the Behemoth near Whitespring and server hop , I killed him around  100 times to get the 5 hides and You learn a lot of plans from scraping the armor and weapons He drops .
---
I'll admit I have killed a few cows, but only when people built there camps on a spawn point I've been server hopping for hours, and I was frustrated. (Charleston robot vendor is the worst!!)
---
While everyone else is correct that level 15 is the lowest power armor you'll find, it's worth grabbing yourself a PA frame. It'll boost your strength beyond what you've probably got at level 9, and it makes you immune to fall damage.
---
Never realized Summersville would be so good for it.  Thanks for posting it!
---
Look at that map lmao
---
Thanks.  The main problem is I'm going to need 3 scorchbeasts (I don't even think scorchbeast meat is a guaranteed drop from them).  The only really good ranged weapon I have right now is a two shot dragon, but that takes too long to reload.
---
Need? No
---
Could it be fun as a possible side-activity now and then? Hell yes!

Story of my first character, started back in beta. Didn't know what I was doing and maxed out intelligence because I wanted those Gun Smith and Makeshift Warrior perks. Had maybe 6 strength. 10 in endurance and perception. The other 8 was scattered amongst the rest. Got to level 84 before I switched to a new character. 1 week later they announced the ability to swap perks instead of unlocking a card. New main is lvl 202. Regular melee build but I still have 10 in intelligence. 5* Makeshift 2* gunsmith 3*demolition

Oh I think it will definitely be fun, just think they should focus on other things but thats just me.

Make sure you're carrying your backpack also lol. But in order to be successful in the bloodied/rifleman department, you're gonna have to have lower strength. Mine is 8 and with my build the way it is right now I get 361 carry weight. But I don't carry a ton of guns with me. I also only have three unyeilding pieces so if I had more pieces I'd probably have over 400 carry weight.

I like it but it poses a certain risk when in survival, it would have to be disabled for that game mode.

Its a live stream, there are addition images on the stream not in his game...

Hell yeah the Mire is where it‚Äôs at!

I'll have to wait for the next SBQ fight I see.  Right now I've only got 1 star in butchers bounty, and 2 in perception.  It just doesn't feel like it's worth putting too many points into, until I'm at a higher level and have all the perks I need.  By that point the game gets a little too easy.  That's why I started a 2nd character.

Owner happened to be home - when I started laughing, he turned on the mic.

Told him I had heard about it on Reddit.

I wonder what the FALLOUT will be from the presentation!!!

You summed up playing it.

Sorry it has grown so monotonous for you but fallout and skyrim has always been about the fun what you can make with it, it caters to a few crowds but you can figure things out if you got a buddy to play it with, now im going to ask mine to fight a Deathclaw with a paddleball in honor of you.

In the PC gamer interview the other day the Devs mentioned that they are tracking what mods people are using to see what kind of features they should add in. I think the Perk Loadout Manager mod is the second most downloaded mod, only beat by the Improved Inventory Management mod. So it looks good for the future if they indeed will implement QoL features based on mods in use.
