I do the same to players with the vox syringer. Everyone must belong to the purple and the alien overlord
---
---
---
And?
---
That's what you are suggesting, not me. My suggestion is play, not grind mats and plans to make armor. I have 5 fully geared characters and never once crafted a weapon or armor other than the very first set of leather armor at the beginning of the story. It's not necessary at all. It's just a waste of time. You can find legendary gear from level 5 up. One piece of gear with vanguard, bolstering, or even mutants will be much better than any piece of crafted armor. Just play and loot.

Nuclear Winter is the Battle Royal Mode. You earn levels (Overseer Rank) and [Rewards](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/c0fsuy/list_of_nuclear_winter_rewards_with_images/) for how well you do while playing it. They also have limited time events that reward with limited time items. The Halloween event ended a bit early so they are giving you another chance to earn those [Rewards](https://old.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/dm7y0g/nuclear_winter_paint_unlocks_by_level/). They have a new Christmas Event starting on the 17th that has new Christmas rewards but we dont have all the details for those yet. [Here is the preview](https://i.imgur.com/aIXTI6t.jpg) of some of the items you can unlock by playing Nuclear Winter during that event. NOTE: (NW Christmas Challenge) Only 1 new item will unlock per day for the first 6 days. So it might be beneficial to only play til you unlock the reward for that day then wait for the next day, or wait until all items are unlocked (which should be the 22nd) so you are not putting in more time than is needed to unlock all the new items.
---
Love it!
---
Junkies should be #2
---
I mean I slept with Gilda so... Sure.
---
And furious at #3.
---
It does increase the ammo count? What's the count without the perk compared to the count with the perk? I don't use heavy weapons.
---
In game economy is broken and caps are worthless, so all of the good stuff are almost exclusively being negotiated off the game and all we have are either overpriced crap or dirty cheap crap when we are lucky enough to find a vendor who hit both the stash and scrip limits for the day.
---

---
Bethesda should really at least double the daily scrip limit to 300, so it would be easier to keep moving the crap legendaries from our vendors, because more than often I get myself on max caps but I can't go shopping for gear to scrip because I've already exchanged my 150 for the day, and can't buy it to wait for the next day because my stash is also on its limit, and I can't even spend my scrips on the Purveyor because I'm already over encumbered, so the only thing left for me is to log off and go play another game, and I bet the same is happening to a lot of other players...
---
I think Freddy is from 76 so he should be alive
---
I agree-- the thing is, you are taking the most risk running a berserkers build.
---
When I started playing the game, you would not catch me in a nukezone without PA. Now, I throw on a hazmat suit, equip glow sight, and absolutely wreck anything in my path with my berserkers fixer (on a non rifle build). Its literally some of the most fun Ive had playing.
---
It’s just describing the AP refresh affix on legendary armor
---
Surely Junkies is still quite niche whilst anyone can handle a TS? 🤔
---
Legendary effect. Increases AP refresh speed.
---
Very nice
---
nevermind....
---
You "risk" wanting to have special cards in NW, that your build in Adventure isn't made for, like if you want the frog legs perk, and you only have 4 agi, then you gotta reallocate alot of points in adventure mode.
---
I definetly think you should do NW with a lvl 1 char, and then build your char in adventure, depending on what cards you want to use in NW, with double exp getting (adventure) levels doesn't take that long. 
---
And then there's no risk that you have to mess up your main chars stats
---
How do you unlock mods to upgrade the Legendary armors or weapons, to make the most of them?
---
Do you have an archive of any other photos we can have a look at? 🙂
---
I have a berzerkers explosive 10mm SMG with 25% less vats that I can't wait to prime and runn around naked with...
---
Two months ago it was quite fast to move trash for 20c per scrip, but lately I'm having a hard time even pricing them at 10c per scrip, especially if it is a heavier stuff...
---
It sounds like it's probably one of those rare beneficial bugs. My guess, based on the fact that the perk is named and has a similar image to all of the other Power Armor-exclusive perks, is that Bethesda made the perk modify the consumption rate of fusion cores, which unintentionally modified the consumption rate of Fusion cores in every use case. If that's the case, then since Plasma Cores have no role in Power Armor, they aren't included.
---
How did you find out she was pregnant? I never knew what she did
---
Not all countries in our world are present in the lore, and some of the countries we would recognize may have different flags. I don't k ow if it would worknout lore wise.
---
On a separate note, putting flags of countries in game is not as easy as just making them in the game. There are sometimes licensing and other restrictions for putting a nations flag into a game. Blizzard had a very hard time getting flag icons approved for Overwatch and have had to release only a couple each year when they got approved.
---
Hmmm...So why do some armors with the effect say ‘Powered’ and others also with the effect don’t say ‘Powered’?
---
I think most people just don't understand the legendary effects and how to get the most out of them. 
---
With no armor a bezerkers does 50% above base, add explosive and it's now closer to 70% above base.  
---
Add this to perk based damage bonuses and you've got a great weapon.
---
The problem is every build has trade offs and you're going to need to play accordingly for the most effective use. Bezerkers is for high sneak one shot crit kill characters. Sniper type builds seem to work better than any melee options or a shotgun or heavy weapons build.
---
TS adds I believe 20% damage.  Junkies adds 50%.
---
Could be because some of the weirdos across the pond say Happy Christmas.
---
there are 3 that always spawn on top of the hill above the enclave bunker entrace at whitesprings.
---
Normally the AP Refresh legendary effect is a SECONDARY effect, similar to Poisoners or Safe Cracker (I think that's what it's called). In some cases, there isn't a PRIMARY effect to override the secondary effect's naming convertion.
---
Example Chest Piece - Legendary Effect 1 is Reduce 8% Damage from Players (Assassin) and Effect 2 is Increased AP Refresh (Powered). This armor would be named an Assassin's Chest Piece. If the armor had only the AP Refresh effect, it would be called Powered Chest Piece.
---
Yeah probably I haven't liked it since it came out. But apparently nuclear winter is a playground for hackers
---
I jump as soon as I hit the ground works most of the time
---
[deleted]
---
In a perfect world players level would be available to see when you hover over their camp on the map
---
Yup. 50% is better than 20%,and you don't suffer the accuracy penalty of a TS.
---
I feel like Sentinel and Cavalier should be in the armor mix...
---
Usually if it takes longer than 30 seconds to find a match, i cancel and restart. It usually doesnt take me longer than 15 seconds or so to find a match. 
---
But the aimbot is real. Lol.
---
If they don’t include this line into wastelanders all my time will have been lost
---
I made a vault for wraps me stuff using keypad doors and putting weapons on display and using the free states truck it really looks like a storage room
---
intrepid359 seems to make sense in explaining it. I’m not a big armor guy so hopefully this helps clear some of it up
---
Did you take one of the mentats that make Enimes purple
---
Darn. I wanted to get into natal royals. And fo76 NW kinda sounded like a good place to start
---
Stop don’t get my hopes up
---
To be honest, I'm lowkey glad they delayed the Wastelanders because I really enjoy not having to deal with NPCs and those endless dialog wheels. I'm just not in the mood to play this kind of game right now, I just want to mind my own business, do my things and that's it, that's why I play Fallout 76 and not Fallout 4, The Witcher 3 or The Outer Worlds.
---
Honestly me too! I liked the idea that everyone was dead, I mean it made sense for the lore as well.
---
No hard date yet, what you’ve said is all the info we’ve got :-( maybe this Update on Tuesday might provide us with more!
---
We did consider that but decided to stick to major prefixes otherwise we would have had to go down the old  FFR vs Explosive path again as well....
---
Do you mean Lily the Supertmutant from FONV?
---
I’m a day one player mate.  I play a melee primarily for over a year now.  While I freely admit to using a shotgun these days, I will continue to say ‘try it’.  If it is indeed a placebo, regardless of the ‘code’ you presented..  then it’s an annoyingly almost uncanny commonality.
---
Did you play the beta? Same thing as free trial.,if you started a character during the beta any progress towards trophies don’t count
---
Q1 of 2020
---
Depends on the players build
---
Some wastelanders will be around from the war but I reckon the majority will be from other vaults that have miraculously appeared in the map and probably others yet to be found or opened.
---
Yeah! They’ll be coming in during the first couple months of 2020 with a new quest line/weapons/ and some new enemies :-)))
---
Thanks! Yes I have some posted but need to add more soon. https://www.deviantart.com/justinspired/gallery
---
Right! I don’t care what they hear about the game. It might end my marriage, but like Fallout 4, I’m addicted!
---
The 2 schools have a decent amount.  However, this is not the best way.
---
Most of my plastic comes from scrapping laser rifles from the Super Muties at West Tek.
---
With Scrapper slotted you can get 10 plastic per rifle.
---
I honestly wouldn't have thought Junkies scored more than AA (if you'll pardon the pun)..
---
Not yet :-( just sometime in 2020
---
I mean if you’re on the subreddit I imagine you’ve been able to take some of the abuse Bethesda dealt out in the beginning months, but I know everyone and their grandmother agree that 1st is just ridiculous
---
I've tested berzerkers next to bloodied.....it is about 2/3rds the damage and that isn't logical.  
---
Bloodied Sniper doesn't even come close to bloodied unarmed melee....not even remotely close.
---
My turrets disappeared. Two of my missile launchers are missing?? What is going on!!
---
If it's on a piece of Assassin armor, the Assassin name gets replaced.  The same thing happens with Sentinel and Cavalier.  It's just a quirk.
---
Poisoner is an exception to this.
---
I’m super excited for NPCs. I loved fallout 4 so this will be a nice addition
---
Fair point..
---
Thanks!
---
I’ve never had to wait that long. What system?
---
xD thanks!
---
Damn! I’m 52 and my wife doesn’t understand! Growing up with pong and Atari, this game is a great outlet from stress.
---
Yes this is what I needed ! Thank you !
---
Hell yeah time to get back on and start playing again! That's the thing i missed about this fallout. There is only bots you can react with.  It's great that they made it online but I miss the characters.
---
Indeed, the explosive effect would boost Bloodied just the same.
---
YESSSS. This is the NUMBER ONE thing I want added 😂😂
---
That looked sarcastic but I’m being dead serious. I hate visiting a level 20s camp to only see non legendary weapons in their shop
---
Yet unyielding is #1 for my full health build. I think you used the word "objectively" wrong
---
The asylum worker stuff is boring and tge mr fuzzy dissapears for me :/
---
Meed to find this but i meed a starting point
---
I have been playing this game since the stress test, and it legitamely *was* trash.
---
That being said, this past weekend I was leveling up a character on an xbox one s, the same console I started playing 76 on. Far from perfect, I realized how far the game has come in terms of stability and performance-- it is a night/day difference then to now.
---
Unfortunately, the fix one bug and either introduce or revert 3 other bugs is grating on me. Its pretty clear they have no automated regression testing to ensure nothing breaks.
---
hits hard, this is is amazing.
---
Thanks for sharing this, its the best parts of the game.
---
LMAO!
---
At least it’s only your cow I’m constantly glowing purple.
---
The nukashine frat club have them all. Not very fun :/ maybe played this game too much but i only have 350h in it :/
---
1000000000% this
---
For sure.  Weapons are a bit less subjective if you're just going by dps but I don't see any way to do an overall rank for armor types.
---
Given my VFFR and VE build I think I managed to stay quite objective!
---
Thankyou
---
I think your numbers are off. There's people here who have deeply dug into the math. 
---
At max potency bloodied will do a bit more damage but usually at even more risk to the player than maxed bezerkers. More risk, more reward but the difference isn't huge. It's like 10% more when properly paired with the appropriate min max build. 
---
There's a lot of legendaries that need fine tuning more than bezerkers.
---
So thers actually good terminals late game? I never found my good ones so i ignored the terminals. Also playing with friends ismt "terminal reading friendly".
---
Wire up  construction Lights on Tri-Pods.
---
Make sure you have them pointing at the direction the attackers come.
---
Missile Turrets are better than Gun Turrets.
---
They usually kill outright.
---
Yup, and I like the storytelling structure in place, I'm ok with the holotapes, terminal entries and the bots, I really don't understand why this is a problem for some people, and to be fair, I find interacting with the bots 'more real' and less immersion breaking than to talk to those human NPCs with dead eyes and clunky animations from the past Fallout games.
---
oh no, someone enjoys fallout 76, quick-getem!
---
I disagree.  I've tested them thoroughly.  Bloodied definitely does not carry the same risk as berzerkers.  Think about it for a minute.  Unyielding armor vs. no armour?  My math is real trial an error.
---
Well, that and the newest P2W "features."
---
Your math also has observer bias to try to prove a point you were convinced of before even trying.
---
Go put together a video, full comparison, show the numbers and do the math. Until then I'm going to assume you're doing something else wrong with your build.
---
[removed]
---
Your "trial" also has observer bias to try to prove a point you were convinced of before even trying.
---
Well I guess we’re just flies that want to enjoy ourselves and we like the shit. Do you enjoy eating? Well it’s pay to win ( sorta ) and your like a fly to shit. It’s just the way humans are, we enjoy our own thing and if it doesn’t hurt others than you should fuck right off
---
Dont think the Little Fella expected that ending either :-(
---
One aspect i love in Fallout games are the deep sub-stories.
---
Amazing shot!   Just, wow!
---
Your assumptions are wrong.  I wasn't trying to prove any point when I tested them, there was no hypothesis, just curiousity.  I have more than one build, 4 in fact, over 500 levels in total.  I'm not going to bother with making videos....go ahead and try the builds yourself.  Ok bye.
---
As a subtitle would be acceptable even
---
Ah I'm a Power Armor Player only really made the PA don't know about the Scout Armor, as far as photo frames they're quite underwhelming. Regardless props to you, the raids are a pain in the ass and I don't want to crap on that accomplishment!
---
I will continue respectfully declining your invitation to "try it" because I know for a fact that the "code" I presented was literally pulled directly from the game code. You're free to believe what you like, but please don't spread false information in the face of factual proof.
---
The simple act of throwing explosive bait is probably what aggros them to that exact spot on the ground. If you throw a frag mine, it'll probably land close to that, as well. Try it!
---
I've just been reading lore. I honestly barely read any of the entries when I started this game. Yeah, reading all this isnt team friendly. I do this when I'm going solo when my buddies aren't online.
---
Very generous to give so much information and the link.
---
The ama by the dataminers said that 2pcs stack, no benefits after that, have no personal proof one way or the other.
---
I thinks another contributing factor is the ability to display items.  I see guns on camp walls all the time, and I have to assume they're something special, even though there is nothing about their appearance that gives any indication as to their legendary status.  Once in a while, a player will use metal letters to describe the item or offer a trade.  Still pointless to me; I don't trade.  If it's not in the vending machine, it might as well not exist.
---
Probably means you're addicted.
---
We had the same issue and went by what seemed most in demand on trades..I think even if you take different play styles into account we maybe have the right Top 10s?? (unless there's a secret band of Nocturnal warriors we dont know about..)
---
Means youre an alcoholic
---
That's a fucking great shot!
---
You have access to a development kit or code?  I’ve done my share of coding and do not wish to irritate you with this debate.
---
Simply put, we are talking about code for arguably the buggiest MMO there is.  However ya like, it works.
---
P.S.  crafted 5.  Went to three fissures.  Threw 5, 5 landed.  No guns, just a meat hook and these meat bombs.  You can say. ‘They would have landed anyway.’  Perhaps, it’s rather uncanny
---
Every time I bring up that I play FO76, I get laughs and also comments that “I hear that game is god awful”. 
---
These are always from people who have never played it.
---
Will random holiday scorched appear with the new update or only during the holiday event frame?
---
Hell yeah I hope they bring it back!
---
I agree a lot of the hatred is misplaced. The initial criticism made it so the sub ends up being like 40% irrational dislike for the game even if it’s not valid at all. At the same time there are constant changes to the atom shop and daily challenges while different bugs still exist and many had for months which didn’t help the situation. The 60% of posts that’s left to those of us who do stick around and play still ends up being at least like 20% problems that are valid. There’s still some praise to go around but that being said yes I agree lots of unjust hatred.
---
Random question. Been thinking of getting 76. Does it by chance go on sale around the time of the free weekend? If not ignore me. 
---
And merry Christmas.
---
Recently a friend and I ran One Violent Night on a private server-- we edged the event for the entire 30 minutes and each walked away with 14 legendary drops, which is my personal best.
---
The only things thats new on that front is Scorchbeasts are now more likely to have legendary status.  Farming spots are still pretty much the same.  West tek, whitesprings, watoga area.
---
Just means they logged off
---
I miss that bloodthirsty lil vault boy!
---
Also at times after my turrets are done killing any enemies around my camp they seem to turn on each other and other camp objects. Wth!!!
---
I started using at lvl 35 and never looked back. Yes they greatly improve at higher levels but that made it all the more fun at low levels because you did have to strategize a little because I didn’t have 50k+ rounds then nor did I have any legendary heavies. Farming materials was a chore but since player vending it’s made it easier.
---
At Max lvl it doubles the life in PA or Gatling laser.
---
Fuck this game.
---
Well in endgame they are great haha, but I can see how early on they don't have perks and can use a lot of ammo. I really couldn't tell you when they start getting better, I think lvl 53 is when you can have all the perks unlocked for them
---
Me too dude. I miss it so much! Survival Mode was the best!
---
Can confirm they logged off or disconnected. Most people will seal their stuff off if they don’t want you using it.
---
And, I will try your mine method/theory.  I’ll give honest feedback.  Perhaps the commonality is simply ‘aggro’
---
I’ve been looking for things to keep me interested in the game and I think I might do some of this. You’ve inspired me :)
---
I can count on one hand the amount of side quest series there are... The game is unfinished.
---
I'd say that the two most viable playstyles are heavygunner and sneaky commando.
---
Even if you prefer semi rifles over automatic - just go automatic anyway, shoot them like you would shoot semi - taptaptap - and use VATS when you can.
---
Get yourself a rifle with -25% legendary modifier. As long as it's standard receiver is semi, and you can mod it with aligned barrel, forceful stock, dot sights, any of fast reload magazines and any automatic receiver, you can get VATS cost down to 0. With that, you'll be able to send unlimited critical hits, and this makes your DPS and your general efficiency skyrocket.
---
Get better crits 3, bloody mess 3, four leaf clover (low HP) or critical savvy (full HP) 3, 1 level of adrenaline max, concentrated fire 3, try to sneak in single long shot point and put rest in commando perks.
---
I suggest going low HP - not necessarily all the way, but to safe and sound 29%. Get your protections right, add serendipity, ignore demolition expert, and you'll be able to squeeze points for protection perks such as adamant skeleton or dodgy.
---
There is no cheaper to operate and more efficient all-around playstyle than sneaky commando, and you can also take it to the maximum possible optimization levels, so it's a great bet IMO.
---
I feel like this started happening around the same time scrap kits were introduced... 🤔
---
That sounds like a good idea for sure.  I mean it takes me maybe 2 hours to level up.  Its nice to see they are bringing in more double xp weekends itd be nice to see it as a casual thing maybe monthly even.
---
Beautifully done 👍🏻
---
I had an unarmed character, ended up making him a junkies build after I found a Junkies Power Attack +1 S meathook. I use rifles for SB's and Tank Killer 3 and 1 each of the Commando's have been just fine for me. I wouldn't go 9 point's in rifle damage, but that's just my personal preference. 7 Perception gets you 1 ea commando, tank killer 3 and concentrated fire 1; then you can put the 6 points left over into Endurance for Fireproof and some more Charisma for Lone Wanderer 4, maybe Luck. But since you have other ranged options, I would (and have done) what the other guy suggested, just make a new character, hammer him through the levels during this Double xp weekend coming up and make him a Junkies Commando. It's a lot of fun and you can take advantage of Vanguards armor rather than PA.
---
Gaming news media is a giant heap of negativity and often outright lies.  If you actually play the game, you know these “journalists” have no first hand experience and typically use the most outrageous Reddit/YouTube rants as source material.
---
I swear that their pupils dilate when any AAA publisher makes the tiniest mistake.  There’s a strange undercurrent of glee when they report on blunders.  Not just BGS.  It happens with everyone.  The larger and more successful the studio, the more they want to see them go down in flames.  It’s fucking weird and psychotic.
---
A duped BE Fixer will cost you the same as a non-duped BE Fixer.
---
Fallout weapons arnt priced based possible duping.  
---
Fallout weapons are priced based on the effects, and how much people will pay.
---
Also, noone is going to annouce they have a duped weapon.  You either want the weapon, will pay the guy what he wants for it, or you wont get the weapon. 
---
As soon as you accuse someone of selling you duped weapons you will more than likely be blacklisted from whatever trade market you found it on.  Unless you can prove it, keep your mouth shut.
---
Who’s your first favorite? :)
---
It definitely either needs to be a lot more powerful or, have more Perks and some sort of armor that works with it for legendary effects, besides broken stuff.  It could be a really cool build but loses out on way too much.
---
There's always the harpers ferry bridge , and
---
It means you have an alcohol addiction. You need either take some addictol or eat a cooked radscorpion egg to rid the addiction
---
I think I've hit my grumpiness limit for the day, so I'll just say I'm genuinely happy you're happy with the holiday events.
---
K. 
---
Then don't bother posting trying to prove a point while offering no actual tangible proof. Otherwise it's all just rambling. 
---
Most people fuck up with bloodied because they keep on DR perks like blocker and barbarian and don't have on evasive. 
---
But if it isn't important enough for you to put in effort, certainly wouldn't expect it to be important enough for the game Dev to. 
---
Either way, bloodied is better so just use that instead and it's irrelevant.
---
Also, golf clubs contain plastic.
---
Need to do that. My friends doesnt play fallout 76 anymore so might be a chamce of doing a lore playthrough
---
Works either way; drawing or sheathing your weapon.
---
I think that it's all 1 camp placement
---
Yeah, it certainly happens.  Over the weekend I maxed out my 150 scrip on an alt in 20 minutes doing that event.  I’ll usually start the jukebox and defend it from the upper ledge.  If I don’t get a legendary by the time progress hits 75%, I just let it go and move on.  Sometimes there’s a green ghoul seemingly on almost every wave.  If that happens, I’ll definitely wait until as late as possible before turning the jukebox back on and finishing out.
---
You should consider a separate character because of the special stats on adventure determine the cards you use in Nuclear Winter. 
---
However, you do gain experience if you use your main character, plus you unlock special cosmetic clothing for use in all modes.
---
There are pros and cons. 
---
You can find a list of all the perk cards online and pre plan it if you like. But it'll take a long time to get all the cards.
---
Hmm, are we thinking of the same story?
---
&gt;!The one I'm referring to is where the boy is abducted at Wavy Willard park, ultimately escaped the guy that abducted him, and went to a vault to meet his family.!&lt;
---
You scrap regular ones you find or don't even bother yet because you're going to find another upgrade within 5 levels. Again, you're going about it the wrong way. You don't need modded low level armor, it's a waste of time unless you're trying to make some twink PvP build or something. If you already have a mod unlocked for it and the materials, go for it, but don't concentrate on that and definitely don't waste caps on buying plans until you're max level.
---
When you hit 50 and start finding decent max level legendary armor, you should have most of the mods unlocked just from scrapping armor along the way. That's when you start crafting and scrapping for the last few mods you haven't unlocked. That's when you can actually afford the plans and you have the perks to save materials.
---
It would be nice if when you use RB to bring up players on the server, it had their level next to their tag..
---
I was fine with the broken launch, the random bans, the glitches, and the Fallout 1st subscription.
---
But this? You’ve crossed the goddamn line Bethesda.
---
It would amazing if with each level of rewards you unlocked, you'd get a slightly better looking Christmas tree. Like
---
1st. Dead like this
---
2nd. More branches but kind of dead. Couple extra baubles
---
3rd. Full tree. No baubles
---
4th. Full tree, baubles
---
5th. Full tree, baubles, lights
---
5tg. Full tree, baubles, lights, star on top
---
I only use on queen
---
PC updates automatically if you leave Bethesda.net running in the background.
---
You can run a berserkers with low health and use adrenal reaction and nerd rage same as bloodied.  Problem is you become fragile as hell.  You can use broken legendary armour like unyielding, So you get the effect but don’t increase your resistance.  I have a level 85 berserkers.  The problem is it’s hard work to play on so i don’t bother
---
Ah ok...duh.  I didn’t realize a secondary effect could actually end up being the primary effect.  Thanks
---
Or to just re-evaluate it's life choices when it comes to using the internet to spread propaganda.
---
Bored of these people who don't play the game trashing the subreddit.
---
One of the wastelanders screenshots shows that floor being used by raider faction. I'm happy it's being used for something tho.
---
I seem to remember someone said the frog in a jar worked like this
---
My characters have goofy names.  It would be more fun to display as Dwayne Schrute or D’John Mustache to other players instead of my username.
---
yep, me too
---
Take an updoot just for the windows troubleshooter reference.
---
I have nuke perks like briefcase detector, lock picks, radiation resist, ghoulish and pharma pharma. I launch nukes and just hide. I can even hide in the storm for a few minutes if I need to. Aquavit/aquagirl is great for hiding in rivers until the end of the match.
---
Thanks for the feedback. However, I’m not going auto for my junkie. And, I think charisma and endurance are worthless stats IMO. I like how varied the builds can be in this game, it keeps things interesting and allows for multiple play throughs.
---
Pre-existing locations are tricky but definitely some of my favorite builds. [Here’s one I did a while back](https://imgur.com/gallery/p4PPrBP).
---
Beginning months?    
---
Yeah, I think I have FO76 a fair go for about 6 months. Maybe more. It was too much.
---
From my friends who continue to play, they are finally about ground out and done. I suppose it depends on why you play. 
---
Personally, I don't know how anyone still puts up with this shit show. I'd rather watch the Impeachment Inquiry.
---
That’d make sense as well, can’t wait to find out!
---
Oh no, I think 99% of the flak this game gets is entirely justified. I really enjoy playing, but holy shit does this game need work. So many bugs, inconsistent design, badly thought out systems, flat out broken gameplay mechanics... It's like *Destiny:Space Shuttle::Fallout 76:Buran*.
---
I don’t even bother with turrets.  They cost way too much budget and only shoot at enemies when it’s convenient.  I’d rather build an entire outdoor patio with the same budget a missile turret costs.
---
I’m hoping a camping overhaul is somewhere on the horizon.  Even simple things like putting a wire fence with a gate around your mutfruit tree is damn near impossible.  The pieces never want to snap together.
---
I’m a hardcore fallout fan and I finished 76 just because I felt that I should but I don’t completely understand how people can still play it
---
While I agree, there are more eloquent ways it could have been said
---
You support shitty buisness practice and unfinished development but you're right paying customers and their outrage! Not all of us like getting bent over and taken for our hard earned $
---
It hurts the gamin industry as a whole but keep supporting shitty buisness practices
---
I got to my camp the other day and my deathclaw was doing the same thing. I was on no meds or anything.
---
Agreed and I’m rather disappointed in the lack of deathclaws in general. NV they were terrifying 4 they were still pretty tough 76 they’re no more terrifying than a feral ghoul.
---
My mule is level 8 and she sells all my legendary overflows for cheap scrip in her vendors. Sometimes you have to take a gamble. 
---
On the other hand my main only sells 1 weapon. Non legendary, damaged crossbows for cheap so people can repair them for the tadpole badges.
---
If you think that's what this is, you haven't understood anything.
---
Andd
---
Nope! Just tpd to house.
---
Wait for it
---
Im almost done with mine i may post on imgur and do a link here.
---
Isn’t mutated wildlife part of what makes Fallout the game that it is?
---
Seeing a guy in 1999 playing a game with a two headed cow is what first caused me to stop and ask what he was playing in the first place.  Here I am 2 decades later.
---
Man.
---
Yea call of duty is the same trash it's always been I was hoping for a bf4 replacement
---
the truth is there are some people will that will never be happy no matter what Bethesda does, they have been doing well and if people want to chastise them for things they believe have been done poorly in the past, then its only right to acknowledge  the things they are doing correctly. me and my friends play fallout almost everyday and we enjoy every minute- so here it is. props to Bethesda, keep up the good work! and keep the content comming. #falloutisawesome
---
I don't really care. You called false a proposition which is unequivocally true, and I simply explained why
---
Probably the same fucks that work for 2k support. Been 3 months and I still can't play Borderlands 3 out fear of bricking my Xbox One X.
---
Something similar to monster mash at Watonga high school would be good. 
---
There is an event that was half put into the game already but it hasn't been activated. It's something about who is going to be the next president so you run around to the different polls and vote for yourself while PVP'ing other players because they can also vote for themselves and you want to thin the herd. 
---
I'm sure another reddit'er will know more about it and expand on more details about this event
---
Fallout 4 was good, but I myself and a fallout 3 man. That was where it started for me as a kid. ;P I wish they would acknowledge 1&amp;2 more.
---
You’ve made a lot of assumptions today. Good job.
---
Marsupial and speed demon would make this a breeze. Throw on a stealth boy and you’d be unstoppable.
---
We do have NPCs.  The only difference is that none of them are human.  It makes no difference to me if I get a quest from a human, ghoul, super mutant or robot.
---
I took the week off for the beta
---
From what the "In the Vault" says it seems to be during the Scorched Holiday Event or the 12th-26th.
---
*Sixteen times the detail!*
---
Berserker's build has been a lot of fun for me as I've recently built a new character to test it out, currently running a melee option but looking to switch into a rifle option and I got to admit it's been fun, the risk of dying stupid fast is constant and to me it's made the game more challenging as you're entire playstyle cant be just a simple rush in and kill everything mentality.
---
That last patch has my turrets going banannas as well. when my collectron steps out the turrets start shooting him. not all the time just every once in awhile. that or they just start shooting random walls and or each other. 
---
I would guess they work correctly 90% of the time.
---
&gt;Unfortunately, the fix one bug and either introduce or revert 3 other bugs is grating on me. Its pretty clear they have no automated regression testing to ensure nothing breaks.
---
Thats just bethesda.  They have never cared about fixing bugs before so actually having to so it is hard for them.
---
Yeah, keep the content cumming, directly inside shill's mouths.
---
With respect to builds....they aren’t absolute. At best a build is somewhat flexible based on play style, mood, weapon, situation, personal challenges ..... you can’t tell me there is an absolute right way to create a build. Thats not how I interpret the game. As for ‘putting in the effort’ ....guy....I have more than 1000 hours into the game. Thats effort.  I don’t have to do the math or make a video to know that the weapon that offers a buff when you have the least amount of damage resistance should be the most potent weapon in the game based on the assumed risk vs. reward principle. If you want to make a point to prove that your assumptions about my poor choices and inability to maximize a build are true.... go ahead. Have a nice day!
---
I've love to meet these brave survivors, and then shoot them for phat loot.
---
good for you :)
---
I'm not expecting much far as story , the main mission was god awful and who ever decided a tadpoles badge involved launching a nuke ...should have been fired.
---
I was a BF2 maniac. BF series will always have my heart.
---
Thats what I find too. Very on edge kind of play style. Super exciting.
---
Why have you bought 4 copies if it's this difficult?  
---
That said, I admire you and this post.
---
Is the ashheap really 30 to 45 ? I always assumed the toxic valley ash heap were like level 15-25 , my new charcter I started stayed in the forrest doing all side quest untill level 15 where i went to the ash heap and toxic valley and ash heap till level 25 did miner miracles than headed off to the the divide. Ive played like 3 charcters by now and never knew it was so high level lmao
---
If you have the stims try born survivor for the auto stimming, dodgy is also good and doesn’t increase your damage resistance, ricochet might be worth a try to.
---
DARY!
---
Fair point yep totally didn't consider that.
---
I bought them and then gave them to streamers to give away to their viewers
---
Is Berserker's the best playstyle, no of course not but damn is it fun, truthfully this build has been the most fun I've had since the game came out, melee Berserker's is even harder since you have to be up close which makes it even more on edge , now however I wish we had legendary hazmat suits lol.
---
I've really no use for single player quest content in 76. I want repeatable multiplayer systems of content, not single-consumption quests that add a few hours of voice overs every 4-6 months.
---
Hey, I just wanted to tell you your advice was a game changer, I scrapped the .556 rifle and made a hunting rifle chambered in 50 cal.  With a recon scope  and armor piercing mod.  Took a ranged stealth perk at my next level up, I started paying attention to advantageous sniping spots and jumped five levels in a few days by exploring all parts of the forest.  Now I’m level 33 and having a much easier time maintaining my gear.  I still struggle with harder areas but I don’t get the panicked insta-kill problems I did before.
---
I usually check to see if someone is at my camp before logging off. Some camps can have quite a long drop if the floor suddenly disappears...
---
It would be nice if the quest marker I'm following that just told me to go inside a building didn't then turn around and tell me to go back outside.
---
Dude!!! Awesome.
---
I was about to say that would give someone who had no mutations an EXTREME disadvantage.
---
Woah...
---
Thanks, I just like making people's day.
---
Yeah, they are absolutely worthless, pretty much like in almost every gaming company, besides Blizzard - their support is impeccable.
---
I'd start by looking thru event viewer for the crash event (assuming that's what happens to you), enable user mode dumps (Google it), collect couple crash dumps and send that all to them.
---
I had a berzerkers swing speed *1strength switchblade for a while...I died a lot😂
---
Unless, of course, I don’t spend extra money on the game. I don’t want to, I don’t have to, and I still have fun.
---
Yep.  I think they absolutely nailed it with story, atmosphere, and the world.  It was just the gameplay issues that sucked.
---
That's why I also check and log off immediately.
---
Lol I have one of those currently aswell not at the level to use it just yet , been running around with a lvl 5 SS Strength meat hook haha
---
How many scorsched parts are there? So i have a goal
---
Which is why at any elevated camps I always put PA on before visiting....
---
Super sledge with heating coil is the best in terms of raw damage output. get that with 40% extra swing damage and you can basically oneshot all but the toughest of enemies in the game.
---
Shotgun you should go with Combat shotgun. Shotguns in general are just kinda garbage though, so if you already have a good melee build then don't bother until bethesda buffs them.
---
Whenever someone logs out, their camp and everything in it logs out and vanishes.
---
No one's camp or anything in it persists after logout.
---
Hey, I just wanted to let you know I implemented your advice and started working on a stealth approach with a 50 cal sniper rifle I made.  I took the ranged stealth perk when I hit lvl 29 and the next thing I knew I was at lvl 33.  I’m waiting on starched genes lvl 2 to go marsupial but am stoked for the next lvl up!  Thanks again for taking the time to help me.  My fallout experience is a whole lot less frustrating now!  Hope you have a great day!
---
For Shotguns , if you like using vats, I suggest a Less AP Vats Crit Damage 50 percent shotgun, combat shotguns are great but with those gun prefixes and using the perk card four leaf clover you are pretty much crit shooting every other trigger pull.
---
Meat hooks ❤️
---
Well they got the "this game sucks right" the story is god awful ,bugs ,griefers  and so forth. ...the exploring big map is really the only thing that it's got going for it and building.
---
Wish I had thought of this a few weeks ago, afk'd in the atom shop and came back to no atoms. Turns out my cat had brought the cryptid enthusiast outfit and something else that I still cannot work out.
---
Good advice, thank you. I just really like using my shotgun on lower level enemies mostly anyways cause i liked the feel and sound of suppressed shotguns lol
---
Nice, thanks for the advice on VATS crits
---
Hmmm, need more irradiated spiky things at the bottom of the cliff, back to the drawing board!
---
Looks good to me! If this build works good for you as is you should be good to go. Just get your 5 addictions and a junkies heavy gun and you are good to go. I wouldn't try to shoehorn a rifle into the mix as you'll have to move a lot of points to perception and agility. Instead I'd keep this one strictly heavy guns / melee.
---
I'm already paranoid, what more do you want from me!
---
Quad double barrel. Most fun I had with shottys. Add on enforcer and your everyone's friend at Queen fights
---
Shotguns do a good job until things really start to get tanky. So for leveling and farming trash they aren't too bad, but against tough enemies they quickly just become worse melee weapons in terms of gameplay viability.
---
And I wish shotguns weren't so bad, because I first tried a shotgun build on my main. Sadly that quickly turned into a melee build when my buddy did 5x my damage with 1/5th the scrap investment.
---
https://gfycat.com/amp/grimblankburro-gif
---
Most succinct advise can also be the best
---
Those low level deathclaw can be taken on without any weapons!
---
&gt;I just want to find someone who knows the code of the game
---
You will never find this regardless of the game or company. No developer is going to be fielding customer service tickets ever under any circumstances. That's silly.
---
... good luck
---
This was a huge boon!  Thanks for the info, now I’m practically swimming in glue!
---
It's literally just a Led Zeppelin quote...
---
Arent there alot more mods that do more damage and have effects
---
I've logged in after been away for 2 - 3 weeks at times and found my character not starving or thirsty so i wouldn't imagine so.
---
The lights break unless you hook them up to a toggle switch so you can turn them off and on again!
---
Her name also had something to do with being a widow, and it said rip baby at the end of it all.
---
I never said developer. I don't expect a developer, I just want it to be like cars where if you are having a problem you take it to the mechanic to help you fix it. Did the mechanic make the car? No, but they know how it works and how to fix it.
---
System?
---
Unless your opponent's used the same strategy - then the fun is only beginning 🙂
---
Sorry, I was late with that. Ps4
---
Your radial menu advice was so clutch, as a monster hunter fanatic I don’t know why this didnt click for me before, I was using it only for weapons and potions, thanks again for taking the time to respond!
---
Are the wires hovering in empty space? If they were built on a floor piece, you can save them by storing it, if they were placed on the ground, you need to move your camp to save them...
---
See the issue with that statement is you think software is like a car. Unfortunately it doesn't work that way, anyone capable of fixing a software package is a developer.  
---
The only one capable of reading a crash dump is someone working on the game which ergo, is not going to be responding to support tickets.
---
I’ve been to her camp, and had the same feeling. It made me wonder if maybe they’d played the game together.
---
I believe it is due to the level of the suit itself.
---
Yeah start a mule for sure; at least for a weapons collection. I am level 191 and have been getting a little board. Its been a week on a week off lately and pretty much just getting scrip. I dont care at caps anymore, so really I'm just looking for good roles and storing them for future characters/build wealth.
---
I started a new character finally too which I'm slowly playing but I'm so invested in my first that I dont care much to play it.
---
True - but the analogy doesn't hold.
---
It's more like calling the manufactures call center - the staff there didnt make the car, are not mechanics and know only the basic stiff about the product.
---
The difference though is the manufacture would refer you to a mancanic if it was beyond them. Bethesda support do not seem to have anyone to escalate an issue to.
---
I know how to use C++ and I didn't invent it... I can look at someone else's C++ code and tell how to fix it even though I didn't write their code. You don't have to make something to know how it works.
---
My current main character started out as bloodied rifleman, then respecced to Junkies heavies and now respeccing back into Junkies rifles again (I have ALOT of junkies stuff). 
---
Heavies are very effective and easy to use. And you literally don't need anything besides one good 50cal and PA of you choice. Easy to gear, kills well, easy to maintain.
---
Rifles are more diverse and imho more fun. I'm still undecided if to go full on 9* auto or semi, or double dip into both with 1* of each damage perk. Lots of tools for different jobs: handmade is ok for anything, but not THAT spectacular and kinda boring. Fixer is cool if you like sneaking, I don't. Tesla is great for crowd control, but you want a Q25 one, other ones aren't remarkable. Plasma rifle with flamer is THE SHIT in close range - damage is insane. Legacy eplosive lasers are amazing long to mid range, but aren't easy to get - they don't drop anymore and are pretty high value tradewise. 
---
I still advise keeping a good heavy for SBQ. My loadout is JE laser (long), J25/15r plasma flamer (close), JE Gat Plasma (SBQ, or when I feel like seeing the world burn), I don't even use heavy perks for it - damage is obscene as is. This covers me in any possible combat situation, and it's more fun using different tools for different jobs.
---
Yeah sorry to say your going to seriously struggle playing stealth in 94
---
Im a stealth sniper build, however i swapped my perks over to use power armour and heavy guns
---
Yeah, I see your point. But I think the support should be more like when you send your car back to the manufacturer to get it repaired, as in the normal mechanics can't fix it. The mechanics in this case are other people who play the game like people on discord or reddit who try to help solve the problem
---
How much time and money do you expect bethesda to invest in fixing this bargain basement game for one person? Be realistic man you spent maybe $20 on the game, maybe $60 if you got scammed like me and many others who bought it during beta/release.
---
I don’t think I could start a new character, I love my OG too much🤪
---
Will start researching miles for sure! 
---
I’m the same with the nukes, actually helped a first timer with it today since I had some time and no real goals for the day haha
---
I don't think so buddy.  I cam confirm your food/ drink will keep it's condition while your logged off as well.
---
thanks!

 Check out the album  XTRMNTR.

No it was perfectly acceptable judgment. Everything that everyone heard about the game was essentially its appalling release, the constant lying and back peddling and overall lack of respect from Bethesda. The game was not worth 60 on release, and still isn’t worth that amount. They false advertised their ultimate addition. The atom shop prices are insane (18 for blue, comon) , I can keep going, and go for awhile. The game failed at first because it wasn’t finished, the game was brutally murdered by Bethesda mismanaging. The game has only relatively recently reached an acceptable state, but I’m positive that Bethesda will find a way to bring us all back with wastelanders, and then remind us why we hate them now. (Looking at you fallout 1st)
---
Anyone who goes to the trouble of learning enough programming to debug a video game is not going to go and take a support role dude.
---
Well it isn't just one person, it's a lot of people. And if we just keep accepting that we can't effect them then we won't. We keep letting the do this and it's not ok
---
Get into trading. That's the real endgame.
---
I’m always a bit scared to deal with couriers and what not, but maybe I’ll start!
---
I’ll give you fallout first that crashed and burned XD.
---
Check out the market76 Reddit sub and discord. If you wanna trade in 76 - that's the place to do it.
---
&gt; Bethesda have worked really hard on 76
---
Now I know you are trolling, what in the world gives you the impression bethesda worked hard on this game? It takes them like a month to release single patches with next to no fixes or changes and it has been that way since the game released
---
All I can do is really hope people aren't getting their hopes too high about wastelanders. I will put money on it not being close to what people are expecting. They have proved they over hype and massively under deliver on all accounts from the burrows to nuclear winter to the vault raids and wastelanders involves a lot more work than any of these.
---
I’m not trolling. I’m just speaking my mind lol, but I’m not trying to mock anyone else’s opinion.
---
I’m great at ignoring people too!  Feel free to add me if you need team perks or atom challenge.  Same name as on here on PS4
---
Well I recommended specific must-have damage mitigation cards, would cost you a 3 End and 4 Cha. Rifleman is cool too, I like full auto though. I did rifleman for a long time
---
It doesn't continually go down, but every time you log in, you lose a little of both. You won't really notice unless you're server hopping. And before you ask, there must be a floor where it stops, because I've never heard of anyone dying.
---
Thank you, adding you now 🤓
---
I'm surprised, it's only been a few hours in game and I've drank 10000 purified water a and eaten 5000 glowing meat steaks
---
I agree. I've never had it go down to the point of death. It seems like it goes down enough where it's no longer full from when you logged off. I just wasn't    too sure. Thanks for the reply!
---
The only time you need to throw, swing, or shoot any weapon in order to aggro an enemy is when you're in stealth. Otherwise, they will aggro on sight.  If it hears you while you're in stealth, it will focus on the location where the sound came from.  I just did some testing of my own and confirmed that [simply throwing frag mines and punching the air will aggro enemies.](https://youtu.be/QRJ_j4m-RTw)
---
What is the strangler heart armor?!
---
yummmmmm
---
How many does mods does it say you know?
---
1
---
Frog Legs by far has the most utility of any perk card in NW-it’s basically a mutation that was carried over from Adventure for some reason. Lots of people use it which then puts anybody who doesn’t use it at an instant disadvantage. So now a large number of players are using it. If you start playing NW, don’t be surprised to find players spamming the grenade launcher in tandem with frog legs. If you can aim well you’ll be able to hold your own-otherwise be prepared. Don’t get me wrong-frog Legs is a great perk, but it has unbalanced the game mechanic quite a bit.
---
Do you listen to music while playing?
---
My friend has done it. Im trying to get more people talking. I guess this group aint big enough for large group discussion unless it's something controversial. I do appreciate your input though!
---
Wait is the wastelanders update tomorrow?
---
More rewards I likely won't be able to get due to long wait times, small games and hackers (on PC), making more difficult to get decent XP per match, ultimately aggravating what would be an OK grind to me to not worth my sanity.
---
I like NW Bethesda, I just can't bring myself to play it with all these problems.

Yay! Charliebrown xmas tree

Unfortunately, you do in order to take them to court.
---
I just logged into a mule I haven't touched in like a month, and his food was not spoiled at all.
---
Pacified perhaps, but I have a tame one walking my camp.
---
you will be fighting humans, and nothing more is known how many
---
Don't forget to get your Santatron on Tuesday!
---
You see blood, not a corpse, therefore it’s obvious she survived. I don’t pay attention to lore in anyway, and even I know that.
---
Where is it exactly. I've never been able to get a definitive answer.
---
I use sneak at max level with escape artist. Covert operative will give you a damage boost on silenced weapons. Sleek mods on your leg armor so you can move faster. One chameleon piece. Sneak perks on armor.
---
"Todd loves him!"
---
It’s in the far northwest, near Tyler County dirt track.  It’s the only location you need to swim to.  The map icon is a pine tree.
---
Thanks very much.
---
your attempted insults are getting progressively worse, gotta up your game lol
---
Well for one you'll need escape artist and for two I wouldn't count on being able to be stealthy with revolvers.
---
They hate you because it's true
---
Xthegodkingx. Let's raids
---
I have it, it is God awful
---
Value is influenced by durability
---
Agreed 100%
---
thats what im saying, something other than just level is affecting durability
---
What shall we do first?
---
True, but developers are the only one who have access to a game's code like you're talking about. The mechanic analog is kinda flawed because the industries are apples and oranges.
---
There's no button that a frontline customer service dude can press or part to replace to fix it. If it's the game client or something else server-side, it takes detailed logs, developers do have to be engaged and lockdown exactly what is occurring, see how that effects other systems, does their "fix" even actually fix the thing without breaking something else, then it has to go through several interations and pipeline changes... it takes time. And that's before factoring in any other things going on in the development cycle that need attention. When you add in the janky engine this game runs on and it's a whole other barrel of monkeys to deal with.
---
I totally get being frustrated at not being able to play, don't get me wrong. But the customer service guy making like $9/hour isn't going to know much more beyond what's in their company's internal knowledge base, which might just be that FAQ or something. Shitting on him isn't going to help. If you have crash logs or something like that, you'd probably be better served by posting it on the Fallout 76 tech forum on the official Beth site
---
Tank Killer is good, Iron Clad will give you more suitability if stealth fails, Escape Artist is a must. I'd recommend [looking through the perk list](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout_76_perks) and see what strikes your fancy.
---
Puncturing is from scrapping, heating is a plan. But idk where you buy it haha
---
Could just be bad luck; this entire game is built on RNG, after all.
---
I haven’t found the plans, but Watoga can have mods to purchase, but not a static thing, I don’t think. Also, crafting and scrapping them.
---
Thanks anyway
---
I like tank killer, concentrated fire, covert operative, mister sandman(optional), sneak, escape artist, critical savy, better criticala and i swap back and fourth between grim reapers sprint or four leaf clover
---
I wish. No, just update 16.
---
I got the location pop up across the river at level 8 and noped the fuck out of there. Only to return a champion will to take on a "Deathclaw Island" only to be sorely disappointed.
---
Player vendoring is fun. I spend most of my day hunting for unusual and rare things to put in my vendors. I'm also grinding for rare plans and outfits by doing events, treasure maps and level 3 safes. 
---
If I'm super bored I'll pick a region and just walk it from top to bottom. It's a good way to find unmarked locations and loot.
---
Jesus christ this is beautiful. Almost makes me want to play the game again. What a lovely tribute.
---
Yup just use enforcer 3 and a level 1 shotgun to cripple the legs and itll sit there yelling
---
Honestly, this game sucks. I’ve poured 1000+ hours into it and there’s stuff that should’ve been fixed last year. If you think the game has no problems, look no further than the meta of the game, which relies on weapons that are bugged and shouldn’t exist in the first place. Not to mention the bugs, cap limit, etc. the list goes on and on. This game isn’t good, I hate when people say it is, because that shows Bethesda that they can do less and less and make more money.
---
I think he means pipe revolver
---
Oof, I got all excited, theb sad cause i have school
---
Honestly though, really good! Have you guys got any more?
---
Just make sure you are trading on market.76 without the .
---
The karma system is great for knowing who to trust. I have been trading for a almost a year now and have never been scammed.
---
I would also recommend a mule, or several. Iv had all 5 chars maxed on caps for awhile, and then drained all in 1 purches. They are also great for storing your high vaule trade pieces
---
My point is, neither of us knew when we first started the game. Isn't that the beauty of it! ;)
---
Happy Cake Day!
---
Its unlocked in my purchases, but i dont have anything at all no frame no paints zero, the 500 atoms went straight through though go figure
---
Oh nice.  Thanks!
---
So funny you said that because I recently got on a rare junk kick! I also have a fat stack of treasure maps to hunt down!
---
In retrospect, it was very lucky. My first successful run (first I initiated too) after probably 3-4 failed ones. Got the plan and fedora. Good times.
---
Aren’t all weapons and armor that way?
---
The purveyor
---
As an end-game player, you've got to get creative. What I like to see from other end game players is a good vendor shop with not so much dirt cheap prices, but very reasonable. Acquiring rare schematics and selling them for a little profit is extremely helpful.  Assisting other players is a big one. It comes in different forms and I see this a lot, whether it's helping a newbie, running vaults, or launching nukes. Speaking to the latter, it seems everyone is waiting on someone else to launch a nuke: most of the server shows up when it drops. so it's still an attractive event. 
---
Having a mule is handy, but it's just more stash management. I don't really see the point unless you're a major collector of elite/ultra rare items, but even then, if no one gets to see it/use it, what's the point? Being a community leader 'in the field' is what makes the game a great experience.

You are so right about this, glad you chimed in.  Thanks for the advice, this never would have occurred to me!

&gt;You have access to a development kit or code?

Everyone has access to [NukaCrypt Search](https://nukacrypt.com/search) which is what I used for that list, but I normally use xEdit when I'm at my PC. Feel free to check my post/comment history; I do random datamining and myth busting for 76 almost daily.
---
Like the gauntlets
---
Thank you!
---
Correct
---
Glad to be of help. It sucks that it sometimes takes ballistic fiber to repair armor that doesn't need it to be  built.
---
I've noticed this. Log out to the menu, then log back in and all should be well.
---
I have it. It is great.
---
Bloodied Mr. Handy buzz blade. Definitely.

Nah, bare hands. Full strength, endurance, whatever else a monk would have. Be bald and rock the tattered rags or something.
---
I come here every couple of weeks to see how stuff is going. Haven’t played since a few weeks after launch, because you know why. Because of this picture I’m reinstalling fallout 76.
---
I love this idea!! We need that!
---
It's subjective and depends on your standards.  If you compare it to ET for Atari it is pretty good, if you cmpare it to any 5/10 game made in the last decade it is horrible
---
Yeah, I loved the bull barrel look in FO4.
---
What Zachy said. Active trading adds a lot of fun to the game. Until you have pretty much everything you want. :-/. But getting there is a lot of fun
---
It's not ptw. The only thing that is kinda ptw is the unlimited junk stash, I can see how that is pay to win, but that's about it.
---
Paddle Ball, and Commie Whacker only.
---
Some mule advice:
---
Mules need to eat and drink even though they don’t move much. Don’t forget food and water for them. 
---
Pick a mule spot with a Stash and Vendors, like a train station. If you get the bug your first mule will soon be so over encumbered he/she will crawl to the Stash. Then you have a new item to grind for: L1 weight reduction armor! :-)
---
Yes, puncturing is from scrapping, so you'll likely need to learn the power fist plan to build &amp; scrap. Heating mod is easily found in the vendors in Watoga/Harper's Ferry.
---
Yeah haha. I've got everything I want, everything my buddy wanted, a lot of stuff some the people I raided with wanted, and then some haha. I'm trying to think of what else I could possibly want but have been drawing a blank haha. Might try to get my hands on a VFFR 50, or try to upgrade all my Bffr heavys to one's with Rw lol
---
If you play on pc and have one to spare, sure
---
Right. My list is down to four items. Just can’t find them. Wish I could help with yours!
---
That sounds amazing
---
Luck
---
luck-fallout-76-wiki-guide
---
"Luck is a measure of your general good fortune, and affects the recharge rate of Critical Hits as well as the condition and durability of items that you loot."
---
But here’s what confuses me: and I’m only asking out of curiosity, if you feel this way, why pour so much time into it? ( not attacking, just confused. )
---
Yeah. You end up getting so picky it's more of a pain than it's worth. You come off looking like a jerk lol
---
Call of duty isn't even that good tho. I hear that the new one is good, but that's coming from cod die hards.
---
My buddy and i switched to rust. Never looked back

Nope

Run a memory test program from a bootable USB stick to determine whether you have faulty RAM.

I watched it live stream. Didn't seem that great.
---
I'm on board. It gets really annoying sometimes and one more thing, bring back the interior of building maps. Found in fo4 in the pipboy.
---
It was nice for a bit but i think i'm ready for NPCs and factions and all the other goodies that are coming.
---
Ultracite laser or standard laser?

I'm going through a new playthrough using primarily a FSS boxing glove and martial artist 3, it's shockingly a lot of fun. Feel like Ali, can barely see my speedy fists moving.

Or, go with the Palmer, golf clothes and a Bloodied club.
---
Or, Travolta it up in Grease. Pompadour, switchblade, and greaser jacket. 
---
Or, Guy Fieri, spike that blonde hair, chef outfit, alternate rolling pins and flamers.

The possibilities are endless.

Gotta submit a support ticket, same thing happened to me, they fixed it in about 72 hours. It's a common issue with Xbox users, don't know why.
---
Standard never gives new attachments no matter how many I scrap
---
Oh. I haven't even watched it myself yet.
---
I said it many times because it's my favorite revolver from F4 but I'm sure Bethesda wants to release it in wastelanders as new content lol
---
What the hell, who put these onions here... why are they cut... who does this... evil onion cutting bots... thats who.
---
You are 100% wrong. 
---
There is an undeniable, mathematically proven "best build" based on every factor from more DR to most DPS. 
---
There are minor variations, but there's a right and a wrong if your goal is DPS. 
---
Having 1000 hours of playtime doesn't mean anything. It's just like someone who says they have 10 years of experience at a job but in reality they have 1 year of experience they've repeated for 9 subsequent years. 
---
This isn't up for debate, you are wrong if you think you can just play however you want and still should get the absolute best DPS no matter what weapon you use. That's just willfully ignorant and laughable that you can even pose that as something that is a reasonable and logical take away. 
---
Now I don't minmax, I really can't be bothered. I actually initially built for carry weight cause I'm an absolute fucking hoarder who enjoyed exploring and building more than PVP... But never once did I delude myself into thinking that I should still be able to do as much damage with my random weapons and armor and a carry build as someone who specifically took the time to carefully curate every perk at every level. Lol. That's just crazy man. 
---
They do the damage because they either put the time or the money in to get the build and gear that makes it possible. If you want that, you should have had plenty of time to figure out on your 4 characters over 1000 hrs.
---
 I sentence you to an eternity ON MONSTER ISLAND!!...Don't worry, it's just a name.

He said...it was just a name!
---
What he meant is that Monster Island is actually a peninsula

I know that story well.
---
I’m Aj-98 in game; psn aj ninetyeight

Lol it could be fun but dont expect to be doing all the damage
---
Warframe support is really good from my experience

I know, but hey, people have done fo 3 and 4 with only punching

I don’t know what that’s from, but it sounds hilarious.
---
Oh I didn’t know that. Thnx for the tip!!!
---
I enjoy the building aspect of 76 and 4. The story is better in the originals but they haven't held up like Mario has but I have played all of them.
---
Fallout 76 is the 7th game. But to answer your question I prefer it for the obvious reason that I can play with a friend. Aside from that I'd say fallout 4 is my favorite due to it feeling more complete and fine tuned.
---
You have to go to the dmv in the capitol and start up that quest line
---
It might be a tune, but as the OP stated the player had widow and rip baby in their name. Maybe the OP and their spouse liked LZ. Maybe they played the game together. Maybe the spouse loved fallout and OP wanted something to remember them by, so in a way they did.
---
They're all skins for existing weapons, or wall decorations for the posters.
---
Haha yeahhh but that was a lil different. This game really doesnt seem to favor this build in terms of damage. Thats why i said max out endurance so you could focus on being impervious to any and all enemies
---
What do you mean “original” two games? Fallout has had many titles over the years. Defining original as new Vegas and 3 is an insult to the earlier titles
---
It's bethesda, they'll find some way to fuck it up
---
My preference would be to eliminate all the JUNK from the legendary tables first, so getting something of value was not entirely a useless hope for the RNG unlucky.
---
Two more troubleshooters broadsiders today, and a ghoul slayers fatman ... yay RNG.
---
Oh... So instead just make every fight one hour long
---
Rust?

I meams thats huna happen regaurdless

I also got a suggestion for bloodied handy buzz blade

I’m pretty sure there is a Skelton outside of wavy Willards water park and he has it
---
OK, first you need to fill out a special request chit and run that up your chain.  Yes, this will probably involve an ass-chewing from a couple layers of NCO's but its got to be done.
---
Once the chit is signed off you can then take it to PSD and they'll set you up with a replacement.
---
You'll probably have to get NMCI in there somewhere to update your CAC credentials too.
---
Yeah I’ve hopped there at least 30 times still no luck :(
---
Funny you say that!  When I looked up what items they came from earlier today  I just grimaced: Military grade duct tape, militarily ammo bags, and.....?  Items that sometimes contain them.  Thanks a lot lol.
---
We don't know anything beyond 'human NPC's'.  
---
We don't know if there will even be dialogue or if it will be a standard MMO 'quest dispenser' type of thing where they just vomit exposition at you and then a quest marker pops up.
---
Nothing that BGS has put out can be taken at face value, unfortunately.  Pretty constantly they've oversold what they're putting out.  They don't really do 'manage expectations' very well.
---
Lol sounds fun, ive heard of a vamps bb being called a stimpack on a stick if you can find one.
---
It only takes one, baby.
---
I wish there was a way to change my character's name. I know no one else can see it, but I want NOTHING more then to just be able to change it.
---
I got the heating coil plan from queen of the hunt today.

You'd think a place called 'green land' wouldn't be covered in ice nine months out of the year also.

Check the the Inside The Vault articles for more info. That's where all the known info is other than speculation everywhere else.

Absolutely breathtaking to see so much love. The feels are real when i read that.

That sonds great

Easy solution, refrigerated backpack mod.  Stuff lasts forever in it

Lol yep.
---
Fallout fallout2 fallout tactics fo brotherhood of steel fo3 fo new vegas fo shelter fo4. So not counting shelter because who the fuck does, you are completely correct. There was also van buren but it never came out.
---
For the quest or just one to fix?
---
Why do ppl like you even come on this sub?
---
https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Ansel_Abrahms
---
Platform? I know it’s probably already been asked
---
Well I’m trying to get the camera to do a world quest to get a world challenge badge for a different quest
---
Really.....?
---
Your not crying, im crying.
---
I hear ya on that but I hope they just release it sometime earlier Q1 2020 and gradually add human NPC's and factions as they go. I believe there plan is to make Wastelanders the springboard for all future updates that will include human NPC's(that is a really good thing!)
---
Well my luck must be really bad because out of 100+ laser rifles, I’ve only gotten 1 attachment that being the sniper barrel.
---
I say the same thing every time that challenge pops up. I know it's a small island...but 2, maybe 3 deathclaws couldn't hurt.  
---
Also I think the same thing about the "Wendigo Cave"......should be called "Mirelurk Cave feat. a Wendigo".
---
It's the turrets taking up your budget.
---
Ah, u need the camera from the dead tourist for all if those pics.  U get off him (a few random places he can be).....Tyler fairgounds and moth man museum (just outside)....I had to Google all of the spots.
---
I read somewhere that he only spawns at the first spawn location you’ve visited, is that true?
---
What does it say for some reason the quality is poopy
---
Your attempted insults are getting progressively worse. :D Gotta pick up your game.
---
The tourist location was recently made available via the craftable terminal at your camp.
---
Set it up or find someone with it (its thin and blue). It will lost the location of the tourist on your current server.
---
Make sure you get that bobble head and sometimes a magazine spawns in the nest along with an egg or two. I was pissed you couldn’t camp on it
---
You can put a suppressor on a pipe revolver.  👍
---
How long is forever exactly? I do take a few weeks before I craft drugs and disease cures all the while I come across stuff I use and that for some reason disappears when I'm actually trying to look for it.
---
I didnt like the changes from 3/NV to 4 and although 76 is more like 4 imo it's become my favorite and most played. With dialog trees coming back it may become my favorite by far.
---
The other games were better imo but I've got more hours in this one than any of the others. I play solo but really enjoy being online and leveling.
---
Wish I could up vote twice
---
Is it the “suspicious person”?
---
I don't know about that.  For me, he was at moth man museum and that was the first 3rd place I checked.  But my big account found him at Tyler fairgrounds first try.  Who knows, lol.
---
Some jerks just stalk others watch non public events waiting for it.  If i ever do any event i drop my junk off so I dont have to worry about my loot.
---
Or someone came through the area and snagged thinking it was abandoned.  Either way that sucks hope you didnt have lots.
---
I didn’t say anything about the absolute goal and believe me or not I know exactly how to maximize a dps bloodied build. That’s about the easiest build there is. I actually don’t care if you belIeve me or not though because why would I care what an assuming, insulting, passive aggressive,  pretentious .....nevermind. Go away, you have nothing of value or interest to add to the conversation.
---
Trying to remember, but doesn't the Friendly Fire perk work with that configuration?
---
The backpack plans are awesome dude
---
I don't need to live there to take them to court. That's the jurisdiction.
---
/r/TheSimpsons
---
I also wasted a lot of time BECAUSE I really wanted to love this game but I couldn't, things like the bug on the vault raids happened and I lost all my armor and legendaries weapons, a subscription service divided the community even more, cheating  ok NW and unfair bans for the community supporters...
---
It's just too much bad things I can't say anything good anymore
---
Fallout 76 has great environmental storytelling. It plays to its strengths good I would say. Also people forget that one of the best stories in FNV is good through terminals, Randall Clark in the Honest Hearts DLC
---
And a place called "ice land" wouldn't be mostly devoid of ice.
---
Right? Honestly! In all truth I thought 4 was when Bethesda slacked. From the bad stupid “so and so didn’t like that” stuff and the overall being forced to be good, and don’t get me started on the dialog. Lack of Gore like fallout 1-3 had too. In 76, it feels like it’s slowly going back to how fallout’s 1-3 were, and I’m sure Wastelanders will bring even more of that vibe back!
---
Yeah the text itself.. if I remember correctly :)
---
Whatever, shill.
---
Ah yes, someone disagree'd with you they must be a shill. Laughable.
---
You might want to ask over at r/military
---
Yes on your personal computer
---
Fallout 1 and 2 are entirely different types of games than F76 so I don't see how you can possibly compare them besides being in the same universe
---
I agree shills are laughable, yeah. But what can you do bro, it is what it is.
---
I play a bit of 76, mainly just wandering around and making bullets, so if that's something that sounds appealing you can add me. 
---
psn is basnhs
---
That’s the one. It’ll give you the coordinates. Go there, get the quest and the broken camera. Go to your camp and craft one. You don’t repair it, you craft a new one using the broken one. I point this out cause I was quite confused my first time.
---
Ok it gave me the quest but no marker should I server hop?
---
F-ing dope
---
I can play with friends. That’s the only reason I play at all. I started because my GF and I could play together. We made friends. Then our kids got in on it. Being able to play as a family and with friends is awesome. So much so that we now have multiple xboxes.
---
Do you have very low intelligence? I don’t know for sure but I heard that affects it
---
I have 6
---
I hope that they are in a good place now...😔
---
I always played through FNV on Very Hard, Hardcore and no fast travel so I'm used to not fast travelling. I do it because I can appreciate the map more and for the realism
---
I'll upload a nighttime version later this week to really show the place off. Might have a few minor tweaks between now and then depending on what plans I find / atomic shop.
---
Yeah, that's definitely breaking too quickly. They should address that.
---
Random thought: it would be kinda funny if you could get a gun that's a lemon. Really strong overall, but has one bizarre malfunction that drives you crazy, like randomly just dropping a clip, or shooting like 10 degrees off until you perform percussive maintenance, or breaking more quickly, or overheating from sustained fire, or other annoyances like that.
---
First time I went there I thought it was a little overrated...
---
Then a scorchbeast decided to crash the party.
---
Shotguns are the only guns that I use, and I use the hell out of VATS...Got a pretty nice explosive combat shotty, got an explosive faster reload pump, And my favorite is my medics double barrel. If I didn’t have the medics double barrel, I probably would’ve given up on shotguns a long time ago...And I do keep a melee weapon on me, sometimes it’s a sword sometimes it’s a pitchfork. I’ve never really used any of the unarmed melee weapons. Anyway, be safe
---
They share some elements. The feeling of "me and the Wasteland: I can go anywhere" is great in the first two games, and fallout 4 gave me the same itch. 
---
But they are very different games. Different genre, in fact.
---
They've shown off the dialogue system in a trailer and further expanded on it in interviews.
---
No problem. I have a junkies explosive 3* gatling gun if you're into big guns and have a pile of caps.
---
Are you saying they put the tricentenial stuff in the atomic shop?
---
I remember I found a model on a desk.....I gave up looking for them to be honest cause I kept scrapping them, lol.  They do look cool so good luck and stay filthy!
---
In my camp I glitches a tub into a radshower so you have to hop into the tub to get clean.  Plus its steamy.
---
It will reappear every 30min
---
That’s a good idea. I know radshowers can get rid of mutations. Is that true if you have those perks that prevent you from losing mutations to Radaway?
---
Yes. I would love to see base building and workshop building mean something
---
Given how much they hyped the Burrows and Vault Raids and then underdelivered, I am not expecting much. This team has showed that their writing skills don't go beyond fetch quests, so I am not expecting any good story writing from them.
---
West tek IMO. At least they'll drop max level trash.
---
There is a phantom storage bug.  I've had to move my camp and scrap blueprints a few times to get the budget back.
---
Sadly, it feels like Bethesda support is not there for the actually people who dedicate time to this game. Even minor issues are ignored until millions of players start to have the same issue. The support might take the time to acknowledge your problem but they have no real incentive to help you.
---
No the ghiul in goodnieghbour who runs the store next to the assaultron
---
I use that so I don't scrap my guns, lol.  Never thought about it for my models.  Thanks!
---
Uh... We probably shouldn't tell them about us being honorary Enclave members either. I know they probably don't care, I don't think Maxson would have told them, but it's still for the best.
---
Nothing you say can undo what you've done sorry bro. Looking up past posts, it just screams desperation. You keep using Todd's name people gonna think you got a fetish on him :) anyways, keep it coming you are really making our night :) could make a meme outta you at this point
---
Great shot!
---
Just to remind you: three ranks of Fireproof will prevent any and all sonic damage from the Scorchbeasts ;)
---
&lt;3
---
Ther3 currently isnt one for junk
---
Yeah and the way i see it we've given them permission to do so.
---
Does demo expert increase damage to explosive rounds? I thought demo expert was only for explosives like grenades/missiles and such.
---
Statement of charges hooah! You are in violation of AR670-1. Lol
---
It’s all bad dude. This game was a huge flop and now bethesda is trying to squeeze its player base for everything they have and destroy the fragments of respect they had. 
---
I expect this game to be dead by mid 2021 at the latest
---
Where is that at?
---
Honestly the best part of the new CoD's subreddit is seeing everyone complain about, "buggy release, broken game, microtransactions galore, and no content" ... for a game that actually functions pretty well with a good amount of additional content, much of it free. 
---
And I'm just sat here laughing knowing none of them sat through Fallout 76 release loool. If only they knew the pain we know. Like, they're complaining about a $15 battle pass that gives you dozens of weapon skins and 100 tiers of content to unlock. While we're out here getting priced up at $18 for one single power armor skin lmao
---
True, i understand that, but dnt they appear on ur workbench to craft like the paint jobs, and shouldnt i have the photomode frame aswell cos i have none of it
---
And the lights.
---
&gt;.  Fallout 4 has hundreds of times more content
---
 
---
No it doesn't. And unlike you, I have actual data to support my opinion.
---
Fallout 4
---
Main Story : 26½ Hours
---
Main + Extras : 79 Hours
---
Completionist :  151 Hours

Fallout 76

Main Story :  33½ Hours

Completionist :  197 Hours

[https://howlongtobeat.com](https://howlongtobeat.com/)
---
Heating mod (not plan) is often at watoga station.
---
Are you saying the time to complete something is equivalent to the amount of content?  That isn't even close to reality, the only reason 76 takes so long is because they made leveling incredibly slow compared to fallout 4 because that is the entire game.  There is a reason you didn't compare quests, or voiced dialog, or npcs
---
I have 5 in intel, and am at 41/42 mods learned.  It's gotta be a visual bug.
---
The Watoga train station vendor sells all three sets of the armor piece plans.
---
What? 420MonkeyButt blows the immersive nature of the game?
---
This game isn't anywhere near a flop. Sorry to break it to you.
---
Oh, i dont remeber i just fored up mine and had the stuff. The easiet place to chack is the armor workbench, for the bobblehead helmet.
---
I suspect that two versions of a single item was not an intended design.
---
Worked it out lol ty
---
Ye na its definatly a technical issue
---
Can you explain a bit about projectile types and how they interact with the explosive effect?
---
Thanks for that! I’m level 102 and just now experimenting with serums.
---
Idk, the world building wasn’t the BEST in this game but it was still enough to keep me interested, I’m hoping the writing for the next stage is gonna be at least on par if not better
---
How would you figure this game isn’t a failure? It’s fun for like a week tops and then you realize there is nothing to do in it. 
---
The people who still support this game are a loud but incredibly small community.
---
Nuka Cola Plant is the starting point 
---
Each quest links 4-5 locations with previously “unanswered” questions (a card with no logical purpose, a locked door with no key, an area you couldn’t enter, a terminal with a strange code, strange notes on bodies, etc.)
---
In order to solve the quest, a player would need to thoroughly explore the map, remember these “unanswered questions”, and link them into the quest line.
---
:) I am a very thorough explorer... but there no way I would find all clues without Google-help
---
There is usually a radroach inside a locked closet in the same building as Treadly at Dolly Sods.
---
I agree Deathclaws in Fallout 76 are pathetic.
---
You can literally kill them with one swipe of a bloody meat Hook.
---
They go down quicker than Monica Lewinsky.
---
Check the meat bags overat Wade Airport for BF glands and BB Probiscus'
---
Good tips.  I ended up taking longer to do this one cause my force of habit was scrapping at every bench I saw, and I ended up destroying the parts I needed, like three times over!   LOL.
---
Oh really? I don’t have much of a lockpick so I might not be able to pick it lol
---
As i said i have found the nuka cola paint but not the quantum
---
Yeah that’s super annoying, although Stingwing barbs don’t get scrapped for some reason
---
I don’t recall what skill level you need, but it’s definitely less than 3.
---
That is just like your opinion man.
---
For real. Looks like a fun spot to build on.
---
Yes...  there are 2 quests originating at Nuka Cola plant.
---
I wish I knew people to play with. It would be fun to knock the dust off that disc.
---
We honestly have no context, it’s impossible to tell. Where does it say fallout 1 and 2?
---
Did you find the red or the blue-violet ?
---
I'm tempted to "apply" purely because of the way you play, I'm the same. But I imagine their will be a huge influx of others, ah well, Add me: Arcfox777
---
The bullets can either have a travel time or be instant hits with no delay. In this game, all bullets except a few are "hitscan" which means instant hits with no delay.
---
The guns without hitscan are the  crossbow, Gamma gun, plasma guns, and railway rifle. There is an actual projectile that travels through the air. The game handles these weapons differently and there are lots of little bugs and quirks. For example any weapon with explosive will be hitscan even if it wasn't originally. Normal railway rifles fire an actual railway spike but explosive ones dont
---
Introverts becoming Outroverts all thanks to Fallout 76.
---
Love it.
---
There in just about every Tool Box in White spring.
---
Stealth is one of the things in this game that doesnt have much data to help with the answers. All we really know is that the sneak card and escape artist both help with sneaking. Agility helps. Lighter armour helps. Suppressed weapons are a must. If you melee you'll get detected.
---
To answer your numbered questions tho,
---
1) yes, chameleon alone wont work
---
2) if you mean moving around near them, chameleon wont help at all, the other stuff will
---
3) crouching stops vats working against you until you get hit a few times. Players can still hear you and see you, you wont just be invisible because your sneak is high or something. Stealth boys and chameleon armour are both good for hiding from players. When I pvp I always have on a chameleon piece but I take it off for pve as the extra 3 agility from unyielding is better for NPCs detecting me
---
Xbox my friend
---
I know man, the waste is a terrible place
---
It's got it's fair share of bugs, but the community in itself is fantastic for the most part
---
Guess you could say there was a Whole Lotta Love that went into this
---
I haven't been on much lately, but once the update drops tomorrow I'm coming back. I'm glad this brought you back. There's more in the community out there in the wastes that will make you smile, laugh, or sad
---
Would you consider Fallout 76 a hit game then, considering it was the lowest selling Fallout game of all time, and also the one of the lowest selling games of 2018?
---
Thanks, that was very helpful.
---
If you have marsupial you can just jump over the door.
---
They quoted the song to commemorate their dead partner, you walnut
---
What's your justification for suing in that jurisdiction? Zenimax is based in California and you live elsewhere. Why wouldn't they almost certainly be granted a motion to change jurisdiction and, subsequently, a dismissal of your suit?
---
Ah okay cool, I do so that’s helpful
---
I get some good drops from the Legendary Scorch Beast that Spawns regularly  across the Road from Jack at the Pumpkin House.Also there is a Legendary Sheepsquatch that Spawns regular just a bit further up the Road near Sons of Dane Compound,and the occasional Legendary Super Mutant comes walking by..
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
I find it the best part of the Map for drops for higher level Gamers.
---
Lower levels i would stay away tbh.
---
I’d like that too, I’m a big rp person and I much rather them see “Tristan Ford” than my user name that no one likes to say or spell lol.
---
Fuck no it's not a hit.  And it's not one of lowest selling of 18.... it was top 5 for two months. Double check that info. 
---
It's not a hit. But it is successful. Not AS successful as Bethesda wanted. But it's no failure. If it failed it wouldnt be in the news. Hear anything about Anthem lately?? 
---
I would also consider total revenue over units sold, it's probably most profitable Fallout. Or will he soon. But those number arent public. 
---
Just accept the fact this game isn't disappearing. And accept the fact that the players don't give a shit about the clickbait articles about the game. It's fun as hell with loads of content and so many layers of gameplay I can't match on a console.
---
Lol still not working?
---
That's what my guess was honestly
---
I'm getting some weird new bug about not having discovered locations I've discovered, when I try to fast-travel. Like when I try to FT to my own camp I am greeted with a "You can't fast travel to undiscovered locations" msg.
---
Regarding the stable FT-bug: I seem to have a lot more luck when I hit Enter instead of mouse-clicking.
---
That’s a helluva picture. Blow it up a hundred times and put it in the next Godzilla flick.
---
Forever traveling the wastes
---
Keep my mouth shut? Don’t a be a cunt. I decide what something is worth to me and I wanted to know what I was getting and what I should pay for it. That’s my choice, and is why I made this post. If you don’t have anything positive to add to the discussion then it’s none of your business and you can fuck off.
---
I think most players stop looking for the tourist &amp; camera once they find him.  But that's an old joke.
---
After you find the tourist.
---
There is also a static radroach spawn at the building out back behind Dolly sods.
---
Nothing would remain unaffected by mutations after a nuclear War.
---
Although someone once told me Cockroaches would thrive after a nuclear exchange,no idea if this is true or not.
---
Shelf life for radiation is hundreds, of thousands, of years.
---
I mean, against a group of enemies or in pvp, nothing comes close to my BE laser rifle with the splitter mod. It's the coolest gun ever.
---
Full auto, shotgun, lights enemies on fire, shoots lasers, the lasers explode (explosive version you actually dont see any lasers), and if you zoom in it goes from shotgun to sniper mode somehow. Fuckin awesome weapon. 
---
Single target dps isnt anywhere close to a sneak commando(cant suppress laser or plasma) or power armour heavy gun but unless your trying to solo the queen you shouldnt worry about min maxing stuff like that
---
Yeah anything you need I'm an obsessive camp builder.  I like finding ways to make new things.  I'm my current camp,in the mire, I have water access, an aluminun deposit, and stranger bloom spawns.  I used a greenhouse dome for a roof, looks nice and saved on budget.
---
For a very basic reason:  I’m going to stop spending atoms if I can’t fit my stuff in my camp.
---
For fallout in general
---
That's some strong shilling.
---
First of all  Fallout 76 was the *30th* highest selling game in Nov 2018, and has fallen since then.
---
Also, how do you know it's the most profitable game, given, as you yourself said, the numbers aren't public?
---
Fallout 76 gets in the news because of controversy. Not because it does anything good. Anthem does not because Anthem does not get a new controversy added each month. Anthem has had a few mideocre content additions since launch. That's all.
---
Fallout 76 is not going away because part of the player base, very apologetically, continues to financially support it by buying the microtransactions and subscriptions, for reasons no one knows.
---
As for layers of gameplay, I dunno, I have played every Fallout game to death and many, many other games and I fail to see what Fallout 76 does better than any of them.
---
Probably not lol
---
Only Fallout 76.
---
If you can't get an explosive one don't bother
---
Stingwings-  Bleeding Kate's Grindhouse, guaranteed 3 spawn unless someone already killed them.
---
Bloatflies-  New River Gorge Resort, like a dozen spawn unless someone recently was there and took them out.
---
Ticks-  Moonshiner's Shack, same deal.
---
Bloodbugs- I can't remember the name of the place but wherever the quest tells you to go, way up in the mire they are guaranteed to spawn.  Or try Aaronholdt Homestead, it's either bugs or ghouls down in the fields.  
---
Radroach- Dolly Sods, same building, jump the locked door.  Aaronholdt in the biggest house if you go there anyway.  Carson Family Bunker is a good suggestion too; any of the bunkers work.
---
I've been doing the daily scout stuff since they fixed it and have gotten close to 100 Possum badges(2 characters).  Scored both the plasma grenade and plasma mine plan as well as a couple of rare outfits with them.  The quests are kind of stupid, but absolutely worth it on the trade scene.
---
Apologies.
---
I was wondering why you were struggling to find one.I come across them literally everywhere.
---
Ironically it only started happening after i did the Quest :-).
---
Jesus fucking Christ with these posts. If you don’t like the game and have issues with it, don’t fucking play it? What good does it do to any of you who come on here and complain about it day after day aside from jerking each other off? I fucking love the game, and so do many others. Go play fucking Banjo Kazooie or something and get off the internet.
---
I wouldn't count on it, it wasn't mentioned in their Christmas plan and they've got stuff lined up till January. Also we just had one like a few weeks ago. But you never know, I tend to just save up to the 1k cap then spend 150 every day so I'm always ready for a sale
---
I will play whatever I want. Who are you to tell me? I paid for the game and have every right to play and complain about it. If you don't like these posts don't read/comment on them. This sub was not built to exclusively priase the game.
---
I was also super triggered. :D
---
Yeah, stupid that they don't just count as silenced. Don't see why a laser would make a noise, it'd be like turning on a flashlight (I would think anyway)
---
The issue is the perception of many enemies are broken right now and essentially act as an infinite value.
---
Who in their right mind would like 76 over any of the previous titles?
---
I’ve seen something like this on Xbox months ago
---
All my friends stopped playing a long time ago lol
---
I once spent a shit load of Caps  buying Power Fists up at Whitespring Shopping Mall.
---
Got back to Camp and scrapped them all.
---
Thought i would get a Puncturing Mod.
---
Never happened :-(
---
I understand it making some noise but the fact that is has recoil really grinds my gears. Light has no mass so there is nothing there to give you recoil. All you would feel is the barrel spinning if it's the automatic version
---
The best reward from that is the S'mores recipe and they are useless cause you can't sell them and they have like 7 ingredients to make
---
I don't understand why so many people leave all there quest markers on. There is no reason to have any but the one your working on.
---
This guy gets it
---
Has great synergy with campfire tales, the bug ending has it all
---
Based on previous experiences it will more shallow than a puddle
---
Many thanks kind sir! Can’t tell you how many times I’ve read these dates and still confuse myself but your calendar is very clear and concise.
---
That location also isn't far from Spruce Knob, where the new faction, The Foundation, are setup in an underground cave. Possible they found her?
---
Same here.  Like if Bethesda wants us to keep buying atomic shop stuff, then give us the room in our CAMP's to place it lol
---
It wasn’t built as a support group to bitch and complain about everything either.
---
Shotguns aren't that good tbh 
---
For melee meat hook is easily the best in terms of damage output
---
30th highest?   Not bad. Probably, what, a thousand other games that would LOVE that ranking. But go ahead and call it one of worst selling.
---
And how do I know it's most profitable?  I dont. That's why I said "probably"...
---
It gets in the news because "controversy".  The players don't really care about the opinions of others. They argue and debate amongst themselves about the MTXs.  And it's in the news because theres a lot of players doing it.  You'll find lots of 'journalists' quoting Reddit chatter, picking out the toxic ones like it represents whole community. This happens every game, not just FO.
---
And I'm a shill. Mmkay. Only played game once in last 3 months.  Actually pretty against current sub and MTXs in place.  Thanks for playing *I'm gonna create a useless argument on Reddit cause I like being on the hate bandwagon!*
---
Lates.
---
(&gt;.&gt;) Fallout 4 PS4. I had a melee build that 1-hit legendary deathclaws from full health. This was vanilla, before mods were allowed. Now I'm on PC and have to actively try to make deathclaws harder for the pure thrill of it so I can rival the challenge of deathclaw hunting with a varmint rifle on New Vegas. Spoiler Alert: End Game sees me melting deathclaws like butter... *still...* *sigh* Very Hard on FO4 becomes too easy after a while...
---
So free speech stands and I am allowed to say those, then?
---
It does affect weapon damage. You can equip and unequip it and see the range change.
---
If I had a nickel for every time this question was asked...
---
Lmao
---
Oh no it deserves every ounce of hate it gets
---
I'm also looking for anyone to help or to team up with psn ghoulish69
---
Usually the modders are the ones that fix their games for them
---
It was 30th highest for the month of release, because it's a part of a very beloved franchise from a famous dev. Not a new indie game IP from a new dev, so naturally it sells more. The same reason every other established IP gets more sales upon release. So it's not too much a credit, it's a discredit that it's actually so low.
---
What the actual fuck did I just read? I need to go find the bleach
---
I didn’t say anything even remotely close to anything along the lines of keep your opinions to yourself, don’t complain or don’t talk about it. I asked why and suggested things better to pass the time than to come here and complain.
---
Hope and desperation, went through the same thing with destiny 1. And hell I've already spent the money on the game might as well play
---
Then I'll do whatever I want. Your opinion about what I should do is irrelevant. You literally said "stop complaining and play Banjo..." etc. So like I said, you have no right to curtail my free speech.
---
I refuse to believe you want that more than a bacon cheeseburger.
---
Lol honestly I felt that pain, but with Wolfenstein: YoungBlood...that game was a fucking disappointment but that’s a conversation for another time XD
---
No. It deserves every ounce of hate it gets. That said, it still has the potential for enjoy-ability.
---
When it released i gave its a 4.5 out of ten. Accounting for all the good and all the bad gameplay and otherwise i give it a 6.5 out of ten. Its fun but still a trainwreck. I play it because i already bought it and it scratches my mmo itch from time to time.
---
As always i end with the following.
---
They lied about why junk weight was made do restrictive and then sold it back to us. If i wasn't waiting for wastelanders or the occasional fun even i wouldn't even be on this sub anymore and i had several front page posts since release and about 250 levels between characters. 
---
Its a bad game that has all the assets to make it great hidden behind paywalls instead of quests and bugs/ stability issues that would never be accepted by any other game.
---
God just looking at that game from the sidelines made me want to throw up
---
What were you wearing?
---
Try to use a +5 mentats and scorch brain food when you scrap those rifles. higher intel might help
---
The world would be a damn boring place if all people were equal, don't you think?
---
Yes, BJ was let down. Lol hopefully that isn’t a prelude to the final wolfenstein, cuz that was a good series up until Youngblood..
---
I hated this for 1 simple gameplay reason. You knew the outcome of every quest you have ever done involving people. They. Are. Dead.
---
Makes a lot of the quests boring and self defeating.
---
Nope.
---
CONGRATULATIONS! YOU'RE THE 1,000,001TH PERSON TO ASK! PAPA TODD WILL BE AT YOUR HOUSE TO PERSONALLY TURN IT INTO A CAMP!!!
---
Lore or not I hope they bring  Wanamingos ( Aliens with tentacles from Fallout 1 / 2 )
---
Usually I just find camps with nazi slogans and the n word lol
---
Who said we prefer 76 to any of the other games? Just because you're currently playing a certain game doesn't mean you prefer it over all others.
---
^This is how it should always be done^
---
"For those of you"
---
Sure for 1000 atoms
---
Junkies
---
People still play nuclear winter?
---
The pattern I found with my bugged weightless pieces was that they weighed over a pound. I can't remember whether (un)modding them to lower the weight made them work with chameleon again. I just trashed 'em.
---
Agreed
---
Damn...RIP
---
So y’all are saying that somewhere on the map is an undiscovered spot named Totally Harmless Island that’s absolutely crawling with Deathclaws?
---
I’m going to have nightmares about tiny deathclaws tonight.
---
It's going to be an epic s#$% show, if everything else about 76 thus far is any indication. And, again using the past as a guide, there will be a lot of people here saying it's actually the greatest thing ever, and we're all just too stupid to realize it.
---
https://discord.gg/bDge823
---
There has to be some challenge to the game
---
Yeah, I remember this too.
---
I found the church, but then the quest-markers disappeared. I thought it was some kind of public event that timed out.
---
There was a similar event at the train depot between Flatwoods and Morgantown where you are supposed to find Responder stashes.
---
Since the search radius is pretty wide and the location has multiple levels, plus I didn't really know what I had to look out for this took me a while too.
---
But I found all of them at the end...
---
https://youtu.be/cW15zguAiZg
---
Looks like the tunnel near the coal deposit near charleston landfill
---
Well iceland isn't really made of ice '-'
---
I can always sneak right next to enemies and they won’t see me. I literally only have sneak at 2 and the running sneak peek. I don’t know if that’s all it is but I’ll double check
---
You're getting way ahead of yourself. A suit, as I said before, is a last resort.
---
When it is done.
---
Maybe I'll store mine and go kill like ten beasts, but this conversations the first I've heard of this. 
---
And go back and read your last sentence. That is my point entirely on that score. A lot of people _cannot play the game enough to be in the right place at the right time_.
---
Patch 11 deleting my 2 best finished power armor sets.
---
Believe they are taking the servers down around 10am? So in a couple hours
---
Neat idea but trying to stay wanted in the wasteland is already a very difficult thing to do
---
10 am ET, which is around 8 hours and 10 minutes from now.
---
It just works. jk I have never played Fallout 1 and 2
---
I mean, it's called "Deathclaw Island" not "Deathclaws Island."
---
I even "WTH, Deathclaw Islans? Not gonna happen" at level 50. So much dissapoint.
---
Overseer on the rag
---
Welcome.
---
Still pretty new to the game trying to figure things out. It seems sometimes it's those little details that make a big difference once you know them...
---
This is the Way.
---
Some people just don't understand the evasion that games provide.
---
We’re you trying to get some good mutations or are you just refusing to use radaway?
---
Holy crap dude thats an awesome theory ! This could explain a lot !
---
Lol I have yet to see many of them
---
Oh, I'm a bloodied build. I live off of duilted radaway and stimpacks. ;) It boosts my damage output
---
The servers will go down 10am ET, they will be down until around 2pm because they will find a problem with the patch and have to roll out a quick hotfix before bringing the servers back up. The servers will be back online before 1pm but will be in dev mode so they can test the hotfix.
---
Its not *Deathclaws* Island.
---
Just the one.
---
His name also happens to be Deathclaw. And if I remember correctly, he used to be a raider.
---
Shouldn't be that hard. Time both reload animations. Factor in your dps numbers in a span of say 5min. Deduct the amount of reloads each weapon did to the 5 min.
---
Probably a hacker tbh
---
Yes and no. Some players use the low bounties as traps to lure on players.
---
This would in a funny way add incentive to becoming wanted for pve reasons. The higher you go the more strong enemies you cam farm at home or elsewhere creating unique 3 way battles.
---
That said bounties arent really.a major thing anymore. You almost never see them
---
I'd rather leave the bounty hunting to human players, and just expand how you can receive bounties by letting NPCs put them on your head for various crimes.
---
I am the Npc ( says in Arnold Schwarzeneggers voice)
---
Even if mutation have positives the negatives are still worse than withdrawals as I said. Also, as it stands not the "Mutants" prefix is scrip no matter the roll on it because it cant compete with the other effects like bloodied, junkies, 2 shot, furious, or executioners all of which scale to between 40 and 50%.
---
Unfortunately, Totally Harmless Island sunk under the weight of all the Deathclaws.
---
Oh God was the pioneer scouts quest was God damn stupid and annoying
---
Or just oneshot them
---
Yes! I want to shoot them and their skin peels back to expose metal.
---
I mean yeah that's what I do but not everyone wants to run low health
---
That would be neat too. Or add a new type of bounty just from npcs.
---
What if they can take any form and slide under any door way
---
I hate to break it to you but the main quest has more steps in 76 as well as more lines of voice and more text via terminals and notes. And I'd take 76's public events over radiant quests from fallout 4 any day.
---
I made a full pistol build with legacy level 3stars and its severely underwhelming. Needs major buffs.
---
Ghouls in their sleepy form?
---
Hate it when that happens one they are fast and two they never God damn DIE
---
That's it - big difference.
---
None with that toon🙂
---
Haha damn I didn’t realise the patches get so broken. Thanks!
---
Sent a ticket for mine, they want a gamertag proof or something like that, it's been two weeks and still havent gotten it fixed, waiting on an agent still
---
If the item is still up for sale in the shop, it will be marked as owned. Scroll all the way through. An "Owned" tab would be nice, though.
---
Yes, it was u/theblobfishman. Quality stuff. I was certainly impressed lol
---
I believe the record is either 27 or 28  I have never seen the images though so I’m not 100 percent  sure I know myself(who u probably spectated ) and one other person have gotten 26 kills in a match (I trust him to have gotten 26 kills he is a really good player easily top 10 in the game)
---
Yes
---
Thank you
---
) great
---
- so now you have a quest
---
Yes - if something is near enough to wiring ( without being physically connected ) can still power up.
---
Yes. The follow the Overseer's trail quest doesn't end when you find all of the holotapes, because her story isn't over. You will see her again.
---
A player with a half decent build will easily wipe out a small army of assaultrons and gutsies.  A few raiders or BoS squad wouldn’t stand a chance.
---
I feel like the Legion hit squads in NV were always incredibly annoying.  They always showed up at inconvenient times and served no real purpose.  Just a nuisance.
---
I guess a wanted player could be annoyed into logging out after endless waves of BoS, but I can already see the potential to exploit the bounty hunters for tons of steel and other scrap off the corpse piles.  If anything, it would be more reward than punishment.
---
Ever been to Wendigo Cave?
---
PM sent
---
It would be so fucking amazing that the 6th item is the non-exploded nuke in the backyard.
---
Looks like your cat IS a cryptid enthusiast.
---
This is the way.
---
When does it start this weekend?
---
Who is the overseer?
---
Do you want to stay pure? Your loss. Muties will rule the world.
---
I'm lvl 435, with 175 unspent lvls, will be just another day.
---
Use weight reduction when you’re not fighting.  Or ditch the other 9 guns.  If you have a bloody 50 and LMG, what do you need the other ones for?  I use a b/ffr 50 and ammo is plenty easy to make.  The durability is good too, at least with 3 ranks of gunsmith.  It sounds like you’re carrying a bunch of extra baggage around when you don’t need to.
---
Follow the train tracks south past Charleston Junkyard.
---
It was the site of my few first Beta Camp
---
You’re probably thinking of [this note](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Letter_to_my_love)
---
I like to hunt for lore and I’ve never found anything with led zeplin lyrics. This is definitely a player’s personal note to a lost loved one.
---
Thursday Dec. 12
---
Nuclear winter to get the glowing skeleton
---
Levelling alts.
---
Mutants is better than Assassins for Weapons
---
Almost everyone is Mutated and works against everything and has the same damage bonus as Assassins
---
I have mixed armour, all unyielding. Now 2 pieces are harder to detect and I havent tested it since i got the second piece. All ultralight shadowed.
---
The issue might be burrowing enemies spawning in. I'm not sure. Everywhere else in the game I stay hidden though at all times except for when a legendary spawns at uranium fever
---
I specifically dislike the fact that there is daily challenge to level up on deathclaw island but unless you have less experience left that killing 1 deathclaw gives you have to hop server...
---
20.5 ranks in Nuclear Winter. One win gets me 1/5 th of the rank and as I play solo, it is rare and hard to win.
---
Yep, the supervisors put me into danger immediately.  It must be an event feature, because the other miners pop out of the ground the same way and don’t break stealth.  I don’t even bother to sneak that event anymore.  Just run and swing, or use an explosive smg if I’m playing on a public server.
---
Primal Cuts was bullshit because of that too.  Instadanger wtf.
---
Capture the nuclear football. Has to be like nuclear winter. Or you might have only one person on the map playing.
---
I use an AP, +10 damage while aiming, and reduced VATS cost legendary. It's built entirely for range and damage short of the sniper barrel as the mag size is too small.
---
I run gunsmith 5 as well.
---
I like it. A lot. Decent mag, fires pretty fast for a semi-auto, accurate, excellent range, and I think I have it doing a bit over 90 damage per shot while ADSing.
---
Plus I have one of the receivers that adds the fire DoT and, an excellent combination with that, are Tenderizer and Suppressor because every time that DoT ticks it applies both. 
---
I also roll T-45d as my every-day armor of which I've spent more caps than I'm willing to admit on mod plans.
---
Keeping it repaired isn't an issue at all. I've never had problems with that. I farm Lucky Hole regularly and have a metric shit ton of crystal.
---
The biggest issue for me is copper and crafting fusion cells. Even with max ammosmith and super duper I need to consistently farm copper and copper ore. Like, first thing every play session is farming copper.
---
I love that feature as it lets me know when to pull out my tesla so I dont instagib the legendary and so I always get a hit in haha
---
It's called "bad expositioning" in story-writing where the detective just happens to overhear the criminal sleep talking in his confession or finding a hand written note of his plans. It was there in Fallout 4 too, such as in the school with the pink food, where the principal was murdering the kid. At least there they tried to explain it by giving the guy a line "Is that a recorder?" Like fuck, if a murderer knew his victim was recording, why would he not destroy the tape?
---
I have 8 missile turrets. Two of them hate the rest of my camp after they all killed a small swarm of Liberators. So yeah, it can totally happen to missile turrets as well.
---
And I sincerely hope today's patch will fix this, but I am prepared to be disappointed.
---
I actually would like to know who on my friends lists actually think I cheat, I know of of a few people like Mack and murdess think I cheat but I don’t use a mouse or keyboard, I was going to post a picture but I can t just post a picture on this particular subreddit
---
Awesome might be time to work on my 2nd character
---
Mainly NW because there's fuckall to do in Adventure. My stash is full, and I run ny daily cap limit in an hour.
---
Well if we ever play this should be fun
---
I've had it happen with a handmade, i'm not sure if it's a specific gun bug, but more of a coincidence...hope they look into this, haven't had it happen enough to say for sure
---
I didn't see a 6th item either, was thinking it was either pipboy or gun skin
---
All the people in Appalachia have to flush the toilet 10 times 15 times! Why cant you just flush the toilet once like the rest of the wasteland?
---
At 35 I thought I was prob one of the older people here. No mans sky also has a lot of older players and a very nice ingame community, as well as a bad launch.
---
“Fuck. Sheepsquatch. Should we fight it or go farm Mr. Fuzzy tokens?”
---
Wish there were more robot npcs with human personalities like the raider one on the top of the world. Just so the game doesnt feel as boring
---
I work at gamestop and even my fellow workers don't like 76 😂
---
You had a nice flamer i bought this morning ... maybe you have sth nice else?
---
If said hunters do not drop anything whatsoever and have absolutely no chance to spawn as legendary sure, otherwise people will find a way to exploit them for drops or whatever else. 
---
Having a bounty should Always only be a punishment any way you look at it. You should only "lose" in the end be it ressources like ammo or the Bounty itself by being killed.
---

Their response to me was something like, if we don't hear anything more from you in 24 (or 48 not sure) hours we'll consider this problem solved. No trouble shooting, no solutions nothing. A couple of days later I made this Reddit account, just to thank one of you beautiful people that found your own solution.
---
Can any one help me with need to Revive an ally my Psn cyber-Dragon18 on ps4
---
Melee when im solo, heavy guns in a group.
---
Wolverine!  Raider waster under armor, no actual armor, and mole miner gauntlet.  Or maybe there’s an unstoppables costume you could use?
---
No one has said you cheat. They say you use a keyboard and mouse. They ask if that's allowed, how you would even get a keyboard and mouse to work on an Xbox, etc. I'm not going to reveal the names of the people who are legitimately questioning something in confidence. I'd only suggest maybe avoid claiming credit under the auspices of cheating. As for why people are asking about you, the keyboard/mouse, quick-scope/hip fire, and 1-shot/1-kill so frequently lately, I couldn't tell you. It does keep coming up, almost daily now.
---
I get accusations of using a keyboard and mouse a lot as well. The last guy who accused me backed off after I explained to him that he was standing still and fully exposed, trying to get a better angle to thirst my rando. No special magic required to hit a sitting duck. I also have dozens of gameplay videos available on my profile. Playing from a recliner sort of necessitates a controller, which is why my gaming PC is on a desk on the other room.
---
A lot of people don't like 76. Good thing that does effect me &amp; the many others that love the game. If a game if fun to play &amp; you enjoy it then that's all that matters. 76 does both those things for me. 😊
---
Sounds fun, just joined discord. Btw you live in wolves ? I'm in sedgley.
---
Also, not everyone wants to make the game so easy for themselves.
---
But what about that snow flake paint for metal armor? I'm just looking forward to more casual lobbies so I can try out my melee build lol
---
Nice one. I'm just down the road in Bilston but lived in Sedgley as a kid. Went to queen Vic primary 😁
---
I would make an "evil" character just for this.
---
Uh, you do know that BattleCry studios are now Bethesda Austin, the people who did Fallout 76?
---
Wasn't the pacifist toggle removed from adventure mode when they removed survival?
---
Eh, I can one shot a 91 glowing from stealth with a non-bloodied rifleman build (instigating primed HR) with glowsight and bloody mess, but only if I get the first shot. Otherwise it's a bit more challenge.
---
Going to finish leveling an alternate character to 50 and then just hunting the holiday scorched

I don't doubt you. I've told you before that I don't mind being killed by you 😂. I do mind being killed by people who I know for certain are exploiting. I've made these people aware that I'm always recording my gameplay, and suggested they save their exploits for someone else.
---
Yes thats generally how it works when a lot of users have an issue but if its just one, problems likely on their end.
---
I suppose a powerful laser might make a fairly loud noise, or at least a buzz or crackle.  If the beam is capable of causing severe harm to the human body, it’s certainly going to have enough energy to boil water.  Depending how hot, the atmosphere might expand explosively and produce a significant amount of noise.  
---
In total agreement on recoil.  It makes no sense.  Unless....
---
it could be a gyroscopic mechanism inside the weapon to give some sort of tactile feeling associated with pressing the trigger.  I could see how a weapon that might not produce any sound or physical sensation when discharged could be dangerous to the operator or their team mates.  Even if artificial, false recoil would be a minimal bump and not disturb your sight picture like it does in game.
---
A laser gun would probably be really strange to shoot.  There’s no need to adjust for windage and elevation, as gravity and air currents would have no effect on the beam.  Auto or sustained fire might be difficult with a bunch of superheated air creating a mirage effect.  I wonder how much of a factor distance would be in beam degradation.  Dusty environments might also be dangerous if the particles are flammable.  You’d need one hell of a battery pack to power the thing, too.

Many A True Nerd.  The guy who did the video.

I will take credit for my success because I have put way to much time to be good with my sniper riffle, I have spent 170+ levels working on solely sniper rifles ( this is my second character) and I got to the point in which I can 1v1 people with a sniper vs automatics, than I got to the point where I can take out entire teams with the scoped lever, and have now reached the point in which I have got one of the highest kill games using a sniper rifle for 25/26 kills.  I worked too hard in this game to get where am I right now  and it pisses the fuck out of me for people just to around say I’m cheating. I will take credit for my victory because it makes me proud as fuck that I got 26 kills in a game.
---
Fuck, no.  Wanted players are a precious resource, I don't want them wasted on NPCs.
---
No.
---
try NAR yard SW of Watoga, i had luck there yesterday ...
---
&gt; They always showed up at inconvenient times and served no real purpose.
---
Loot delivery service.
---
A lever action is really solid. Somebody gifted me a TSE lever that I used from level 45 until 90 when I got a better handmade. The lever hits harder but the handmade fires faster. I'm sure you'll still have moments of frustration, especially with ammo quantities, but you're headed for smooth sailing. I'm definitely not some one shot superhero at level 128, but by level 65, there wasn't anything I thought I could take on in the game. Feel free to just ask if you need any more advice, but I'm sure you'll do just fine on your own.
---
It isn't the Deathclaw's fault, people keep killing it &amp; nicking off with it's eggs. Ask any hippy at DEFRA, that behaviour is not conducive to the Deathclaw population expanding
---
I kinda hope Knight Moreno made it.  That dude needs someone to talk to.  He was sounding pretty bummed by the time he got near Glassed Cavern.
---
I know, but we the costumers should be worth their time. Even more so seeing that we took a chance on a game that everybody told us not to. well cest La vie.
---
I find mine at that medical disposal site, in the mire, kinda near the power plant
---
Just tbag until escape artist decides to proc and you're back in stealth
---
Checked there several times, since I had found Sheepsquatch there previously.
---
I just checked again and you're right!  I must have been looking for it in settings before actually loading in to a world, its not present in the menu you can access from the title screen.  Should have been obvious to me, I guess.
---
There isn't a single game company in the world that would waste a devs time 1 on 1 fixing a problem that is more than likely on the users end
---
My luck was lots of Super Mutants and Scortched, no Sheepsquatch.
---
They're there to protect the Wendigo.
---
I have a feeling you might have some mutations of your own.  I’m guessing an extra chromosome, at least.
---
Stop mithering, all of you! Bethesda let you fast travel
---
- It's just that
---
- It will be at a time of Bethesdas choosing
---
- And not necessarily to the place you want/need to go to
---
You should be proud. I don't know where this keyboard and mouse thing started, only that it keeps coming up.
---
I keep running into those tanks bastards everywhere. The other suggestions are solid, but I've also had luck just north of abbie's bunker in the mire, just beyond the area where the wendigos lurk in the trees. Hop up on the truck suspended by vines and you're golden.
---
Highway 65 near an old blownout shack and a junk pile. Spawn right behind me house
---
I had it happen before when i primed my handmade.then it autofixed. Now it's happening with the AAE gatling plasma.
---
I'm starting to think it has to do with atoms skins.  Totally annoying nontheless
---
There are a bunch of world spawns in the Mire. Try there.
---
Never ever try to do those... unless is a fixed spawn I wont even try... whenever events are requiered to to a challange those specific events never pop up
---
Mainly when I want to do it there are not enough high level people on the server and I can't be bothered to server hop.
---
Can I buy fast travel tokens in the atom shop?
---
Dont use them, they suck, also, can you drop your unwanted fusion cells on the floor?
---
Oh yeah the Christmas stuff I’m also grinding for. I thought only the Halloween challenges were being released during double xp weekend and that the Christmas challenges were next week after it’s ended?
---
It would be awesome.
---
No, after you finish the bucket list.
---
Atomic shop.
---
No.  Gods no.  The last thing we need is a bunch of trolling SS-wannabe's running around.  The hell with that!
---
Awe. You complete me.
---
I think that nails it down pretty tight. 
---
So, find a tourist, complete the bucket list and you'll find more broken prosnap deluxe than you will have ever needed in your life, which coincidentally is what you're looking for in the first place.
---
Idk I'll just be running around with my trusty pole hook strung out on fury clubbin dudes over the head all over flatwoods, and I can't wait
---
May I also have a PM, good sir (or madam)?
---
Sometimes a 3 star spawns behind that bbq place. Like over near the son of fluffy. They usually end up fighting if it spawns. Its weird tho i can never find its nest.
---
They are working on it as we type.
---
If you mean how to find those, i think you'll have a better luck buying the plan, honestly i think it's quite a meh weapon the handmade can perfom better in any situation
---
I usually walk the hwy in the Mire. Also check all 3 event locations as they do sometimes spawn there even with no event. Other two place I know are the Medical supply place &amp; lastly if you fast travel to the Garly Swallows in the northern part of the More then run north of there towards the top edge of the map you'll find a shack that either has scorched or Super Mutants &amp; many times they are fighting a Sheepsquatch. That's where I got mine yesterday.
---
I'm not way ahead of myself, but, apparently, I'm way ahead of you. 🙄 I don't know *anybody* who doesn't have more respect for someone who admits it when they make a mistake than for someone who
---
tries to hand-wave the problem back to the person who pointed it out.
---
P
---
I've taken to buying large amounts of ammo to deal with max caps, like thousands of rounds. I also do events in the mire for the sheer craziness that can ensue. Tasker with picking 5 flowers, I ended up fighting two scorchbeasts and a sheepsquatch. I will also just leave legendaries in suitcases sometimes rather than deal with inventory management. Every week or so I'll drop half my stims as I always seem to have 150 of them when a third of that would be more than enough. I also regularly make a ton of marine tactical helmets to lower my stash, sell them, by tons more ammo.
---
And give it a 20% boost like the fixer vs the combat rifle.
---
A lot of people hate the game because of what bethesda do. I tell some one I play F76, then they go on about the canvas bags, rum bottles, going back on only pay for cosmetics promise and so on. Then I have to remind them F76 is not bethesda. Yes unfortunately bethesda seem to be turning into ea, but that doesn't mean I can't like F76. The motor company screwed me, now I shouldn't drive my car anymore?
---
The extras have been useful in the past for "mod a camera" challenges, but I haven't seen a "mod a camera" challenge in months...
---
Found the nazi
---
Decides to proc? The perk description implies that crouching again hides you instantly. I figured it was just broken. What really happens?
---
Go on YouTube today and see all the random stuff  recorded. Why is anything here immersion breaking? Sometimes people record things that they think are an important conversation. Sometimes someone does something to blackmail someone else. Sometimes someone just does it by accident. I think you’re overthinking this
---
While we're at it throw in the colt 45
---
Ah...Tourette... It is incredible how a barrage of insulting words can shoot down even a vertiptere :)
---
That has nothing to do with the era this game takes place in it would make no sense at all.
---
man those deathclaw pics in your gallery. that look of intelligence in the pick up animation in fallout 4 was amazing. I would like to see it work in 76. chilling vicious, the look says it has won already and knows it.
---
I was there for the daily and noticed a low level player had followed me over to get a hit on the claw before i took it down.
---
I'll be 50 in a few months and most of my non-gaming co-workers totally understand my desire to escape the real world through fo76; they just do it by watching tv dramas. Nobody understands the one co-worker who speed runs 16 bit games (I don't either).
---
If im not mistaken the weapon skins only apply to the 10mm Pistol and the uhhhm aussault rifle?  Not the other Guns. If you have a 10mm go to weapon workbench and modifiy it. If there is no option to, there is sth wrong and i'd contact support.
---
It seem happen so much during fight or immediately after a loading.
---
Nice!
---
I have removed the best legendaries from my vending machine because i have hit the caps limit of 30k. I only put one at a time now when my account has room. I think this limit is too low !
---
True, I guess the designers did their best with the limits ("just holotapes and notes, guys!") they got handed from upstairs to tell their little story lines as best as possible. Most are pretty creative, still. Then again, the quests where you follow a trail of tapes with various branches built in do get a little silly towards the end.
---
the only thing you need to say is 'i am female' and done, your buds are there
---
Yep. There's tons wrong with how Bethesda has handled the game, customer support and monetisation. But people take this and at least as much made up crap to further push the anti-Bethesda narrative. No matter what bad did Bethesda do, they don't deserve to get lied about. What's funny is that when the "journalists" started spreading misinformation about Cyberpunk, the same people flipped out and screamed bloody murder...  
---
There are giant double standards when it comes to gamers. Once a company becomes unpopular, anything goes. Anything negative gets accepted and spread out, no matter if it's actually true. And when it gets finally disproven, people don't care and keep using it as ammo against Bethesda. On the other side, noone can say anything wrong about the holy CDPR. Once even a tiny bit negative info surfaces, people lose their shit and scream about "rotten journalism", even if the news is actually true.  
---
So far I have learned that gamers in general are herd animals. We think that we are sooo vigilant, objective and moral, but all we usually do is to get played by media coverage that bolsters our own mass opinions. Negative news about unpopular companies (Bethesda, Blizzard, EA, Activision...)? Neat, we knew those guys are bad, right? Articles bootlicking CDPR and GGG and similar holy companies? Great! Or look at the reviews for hyped games - again the journalists feed us the reviews we want to hear. RDR2 hyped beyond reason? Let's slap 10/10 on it despite glaring flaws. Or on the other side of the spectrum - when people expect the game to fail, then the scores are made to reflect that. Like 76, it's not great but not nowhere the lows it was getting. Hell, I consider both 76 and Outer Worlds around 6/10, but the hype and dis-hype coused completely different scores.  
---
Basically, nowadays gamers judging something is no longer about the actual product. It's about the narrative they chose to follow. Too many people are petty and hypocritical and won't admit they were wrong... I expect that if Wastelanders become a success, the coverage will be zero or that some negative bits will be cherry-picked to keep the narrative flowing...
---
shotguns? u mean shitguns
---
Last time I seen a wanted player with more than 5 caps bounty was in June.
---
Came here to say exactly that.
---
 **Bethesda. If you haven't added npcs fot Wastelanders , Do it now.**
---
Interesting, I agree that Mutants gives more dmg but in terms of demand Assassin's (surprisingly) still seems more popular even once Survival Mode had gone....
---
I’m tryna run a rifle build, is bloody mess and Tank Killer max rank essential?
---
Nice to see others appreciate your friendliness too, Sdb.
---
Good work!
---
I'd say yes, getting reliable staggers is great for when you do lose stealth and the extra 15% damage is massive
---
That's why it's top of the bottom part of the table - where would you move it?
---
Ooooo, what platform? I wanna check it out
---
Is this the same bug that clears my favourite wheel and then moves them about as I try to ad them back?
---
A very old bug I doubt will get fixed permanently, they did fix it them it came back.
---
Have fun dude! 👍
---
Hmm I’m not sure. I used to have something like that happen but nowadays the only time weapons get removed is if I have two of the same gun, like right now I have a BE and BFFR handmade and the BE keeps getting removed from my wheel.
---
We're a group of players that hang out on discord while playing and usually when someone finds a 3\* legendary we let everyone tag before killing it. It's become a habit and we let others tag too. Everybody wins.
---
As long as people keep supporting CDPR and their rampart employee abuse, I see no problem in supporting a game where the only issue are the monetisation practices...
---
There's no point in arguing with fanatics... and many people hate this game with religious fanaticism and don't care about facts or context...
---
Yes, I'm gonna write everything I know here on reddit ;)
---
Its like the bible verse at the beginning of 3
---
This makes half of the apparel that are currently in the game
---
Seig HEIL
---
Nice one dude thank you!
---
And 2 zig zags
---
You shouldn’t be fighting the queen at level 37... just sayin
---
Not really, you can remove it at the end and keep a floating building, but I'm sure you can't remove the stairs
---
Free states uniform looks like a GI uniform somehow, if you want to have axis uniforms you can go and f yourself.
---
No. You cant just remove it without using other methods.
---
* Technically the game was broken. Now it is better. Some people might still find it broken enough to complain. I don't blame them.
---
* the game on itself (content, lore, graphics) is good IMHO. There will always be people that don't like this type of game. 
---
* HOWEVER this is all overshadowed by the news it has been getting. Poor management decisions and broken promises is what angers the players that still play and love the game. This seeps into the perception of the general public and in most cases the different reasons to judge this game just get thrown in one pile. If the dev team completely fixes the game but management continues to make bad decisions and milk their players, the technical improvements won't reach the general public as much. 
---
I really think most of the bad reputation is due to management.
---
Baby thats all i neeed
---
The point of this era is the history of WV and the upcoming of the factions.  Plus the communist threat is China.  It would make no sense to add such uniforms and I rather see BOS and other factions have outfits added.
---
So...is Greenland really green?
---
It depends on what you aim to do with your build, I'm switching from 2 handed melee build to ranged sneak build rn. Only problem I had switching was collecting the rifleman perks. Took a while to switch. Didn't need 2 handed melee perks anymore and was able to take those points and put them in perception. I currently only have 2 charisma, 3 endurance, 6 luck (starched genes and class freak), 15 agility l, 7 intelligence, 9 perception, rest in strength..

Your buddy is crying out for help if he’s always hard up for crystal.  Send him to rehab.  
---
That said, I’m sure your buddy is using a legacy.  Like others have said, if it isn’t a legacy, you’re better off with basically ballistic weapons.
---
Make a new character and blast Britney Spears through my mic. Or follow around a newb reading them 1984, we'll see.
---
Fly Swatter drops loot? I’ve done that dozens of times hoping for responders fireman outfit quest reward and have never seen loot drop from the vertibird. Maybe I’m finishing it too fast, I can usually take out the bird in 3-4 shots.
---
 It was getting torn to pieces before anyone had played it.  That speaks volumes about what it was up against.
---
&gt;Turret repairs are eating through my circuitry at an alarming speed
---
The Bog is a brutal place to camp.
---
I ran into one at the medical supply place on Sunday.  It was fighting super mutants and a glowing deathclaw.  
---
I sat stealthed and took shots at it to knock it down until it regenerated then let the fight go.  Popped every mob with my lightest weapon just for the tag and waited to see who would win.  
---
Sheepy won.
---
Title of my sex tape
---
Wait...
---
Fix nothing, break everything.
---
Yeah already done
---
F in the chat.
---
That's bot an hidden mod, just player's LCK affecting the durability, which directly affects capq value, it works this way for everything.
---
BUT there's an "hidden mod", it's a paint that was datamined but it's not yet unlocked. It's the same for sentrybot helmet for exemple, there's a camo paint for Robot armor set, that will be available for sentry helmet too. But it's not yet unlocked.
---
You will only hear people saying the letter F in voice chat.
---
The worst part is that they are so hell-bent on $, they're never going to allow genuine modding. Ironically, fo76 could have become bigger than Wolfenstein Enemy Territory, and then Bethesda would have been kings of the gaming world. Todd is crying every night, because of the "mistake" of giving us a functional Creation Kit for the past games, which is the only reason fo4 and Skyrim are still popular to this day. It's so greedy &amp; stupid it makes me puke.
---
They knew they had to lie, or I would never have bought the game.
---
They will be adding a communist package soon it was leaked in data minning.  The outfit looks neat too.  Im not trying to give you a hard time either just being historical with the timeliness and factions is all.  I love history and am very big into the ww1,2 era histories.  If it fit in then for sure thatd be neat but it doesnt.
---
Live dislike if you support cheating in f76 :)
---
If I was on xbox, I'd ask for her tag so I could stop by and drop off some gifts out of respect...
---
I for one am waiting with bated breath for the Communist China bundle.  I always wanted to roleplay as a sleeper agent that actually made it into the Vault, and now is wondering what is left to do, now that the bombs have dropped...
---
I ran into one by the downed Vertibird. Not on map but FT to Gnarled shallows and head N, keep the river to your right.
---
Dude. It's not 2077 anymore. Stop being a bigot. 
---
#GhoulLivesMatter
---
I thought only 1 drops
---
It drops one yes however anyone can get the keycard.
---
How ‘bout they just make a Mysterious Avenger NPC pop up at random somewhere to one-shot you?
---
Yeah. My instigating black powder one-shots them, and I just sit there like: that's it? Where's the fight?
---
You should charge for that info bro
---
Exactly what I do. I'm always disappointed at the lack of a battle.
---
Dude learn to spell
---
Do you know if they need to tag it?
---
* leveling my 3rd alt to level 50 
---
* leveling my 2nd alt to have some points to play with
---
* First alt is finished
---
* leveling my main to a multiple of 50 (for the legendary perk system)
---
I don’t believe they have too. I told someone about it they came to me and gave me a heart. I assume they got it. Never got a message saying otherwise !!
---
The easiest way to get a bounty is go to someones camp and lockpick something. Super easy to get a bounty.
---
It's pay to win because hording junk is one of the main parts of the game and they said we couldn't have more storage because the servers would crash just to make people pay for not just extra storage but unlimited storage and a new fast travel location. It's definitely pay to win. I stopped playing months ago I guess u got ur Bethesda blinders on
---
As someone who's studied the development of the English language and it's modern use: plz don't hate on other people's dialects and methods of expression like this
---
I always do that if there is a Legendary &amp; other players are there
---
Amazing work!  Thank you both for putting yourselves in such dangerous situations!  I can hear you yelling at the scorchbeast (or whatever creature you're trying to get in the shot) "No, look at HER!  Not me!  Look at her!" for some of the sessions.  lol
---
Just because the game was so horrible stores were giving it away doesn't make it free2play. They originally charged 80 bucks for this garbage they should not treat the game like it's free2play and offer subscription service honestly these are f2p tactics
---
I'm not crying..someones just cutting scorchbeast onions
---
Back in Beta the island would spawn 4-5 at a time, hoping they bring this back
---
Was it pc or xbox, cause I wanna leave this person a gift
---
He's a billionaire deathclaw, so owns the whole place
---
happens about 2 out of every 10 times for me as well sometimes. I often get around it by going to social tab and fast traveling to a friend.
---
My expectation is no bug fixes and simply the push of the holiday content.  Which personally I'm fine with, none of the bugs have been anything that have been game breaking or even overly burdensome for me.  I just want to shoot scorched elves in the face.
---
Do the event on your private server.
---
Agreed. I like to try the different weapons in low to medium level areas.
---
Usually get caught up in using a rolling pin or commie wacker.
---
amazing idea
---
If you’re over near the gorge bridge, there’s usually bloodbugs on the bridge itself.
---
Ok I thought it was funny.
---
What's actually coming with this update? Isn't it just some NW changes?
---
&gt; as well as more lines of voice
---
In what dimension?
---
&gt;and more text via terminals and notes.
---
Yeah, lots of terminals and notes.  Very engaging stuff /s
---
&gt;This is the kind of hyperbole that makes me unable to take you seriously. 
---
It isn't hyperbole, the map is very large and very lacking in content.  It isn't even just an opinion, it is a fact.
---
Relax, have some Nukashine )
---
I do not believe so, A lot of high levels are passed because who's gonna stop them, a level 5 and his level 7 friend
---
Can I buy the handmade 😊
---
I don't think they would have any way of knowing how much damage you did to the SBQ, so it's unlikely that's the reason. Are you a Fallout 1st subscriber by any chance?
---
Mmm...now I know what to propose in my vending machines ! thank you :)
---
Looks like someone has money.
---
My commando carries an instigating faster fire vats gamma laser rifle. It works as well as a 38 modded fixer, but you can't silence it, so you lose some damage multipliers and stealth, but it is nice for a change and a BoS roleplay.
---
Good weapon overall. Tesla rifles give better use to that type of ammo. 
---
With gunsmith 5, they don't break as often as people say. I fix them using improved repair kits, which the SBQ drops often.
---
Yup. He’s definitely whaling with his tenner a month 🙄
---
Yeah. Cause you suck
---
I just had a bizarre scene pop into my head. Just wandering through the wilderness to find a sad character standing next to their base, but the front door is spazzing out and glitching. All you can hear is them repeatedly muttering "F...F...F..." to themselves.
---
Yeah maybe they didn’t know. I am a fo1st subscriber but that’s pretty lame to grief someone who’s supporting the game
---
hmm base at north east near the NW vault? maybe they thought u were pvp player and invited it ...
---
pretty improbable that you did something that warranted the attention of the nuker.
---
it was probably just the location of camp
---
Hey, but... remember it is a game... have fun.
---
If you are on PS4 I can help you with some materials. And if you have First scrap boxes, you should be fine. 
---
Raiders gotta raid.
---
I use lasers a lot at work. I'm a carpenter and use them to make strait or level lines. 
---
Even the very low power ones I use make a slight humming noise. I imagine one that can actually do damage would be much louder 
---
Still less then a 50 cal rifle though I bet.
---
Nah I’m at the aaronholt homestead. They literally dropped the Nuke right on my base
---
Watch out for Sheriff Simms coming after that finger of yours.
---
yeah it's not like you get a warning and 3 minuts to leave or log off
---
there's no problem here
---
As any Star Wars fan knows, lasers are so noisy that you can even hear them in the void of space :)
---
I agree but unfortunately that is probably the reason you were targeted. From what I've heard it has happened to a number of subscribers.
---
I guess I’m shit outta luck if I’m broke
---
Lot of new stuff in the Atom Shop including a free Santatron collecting bot. Bunch of in game fixes. Holiday event starts Thursday as well as double XP weekend &amp; free trial. If you read Inside The Vault they'll go into better detail. But yes also some good changes to NW including the return of the Forrest map
---
Free Range is constantly available. I solo the event yesterday and got the kill. You dont even need to worry about the Brahmin: you can fail the mission and get your atoms.
---
The event you are talking is called 'One Violent Night' and next time you participate in it don't play an instrument and just turn on the jukebox for a bit and then turn it off, as that's enough to trigger a wave of ghouls to come in and attack the jukebox.
---
As for the second part.. well.. I feel your pain. It happened to me as well and not much you can do about it sadly. Try the jukebox instead of playing an instrument on your own like i suggested, you should have a small window of opportunity to tag before others bag them.
---
Good luck!
---
PS: The 'Uranium Fever' is another good event you should attend to.
---
I was eating food and didn’t have hands on the controller to check where the nuke was, bad timing I guess
---
i totally expect several santa-scorched sliding on the ground as our beloved ghouls do so regularly.
---
flat santa!
---
You can't drop or sell the one for the quest.
---
How much RAM does your machine have?
---
How much does 76 use when you open it up?
---
I killed the deathclaw on the island while I was naked to level up yesterday. 
---
Naked.
---
Hahaha! Pretty much, yeah. XD Thanks again. We're happy people enjoy the result of our madness.
---
If this was Watoga last night at the train station, it was me and I did get a keycard and the rest of the usual loot. Someone did it for me and I hearted them. Thanks!
---
Is there a hole in the middle where you can go from tunnel to tunnel in the inside?
---
I wasn’t that annoyed, just surprised. It was kinda funny tbh. Thanks for the offer but I should be alright!
---
Like your ammo idea, I think I’m going to get into this😊
---
So is Path of Exile's
---
The overseer of vault 76.
---
The game tried to charge my wife 29 caps to fast travel to her camp 3 times before it reverted back to normal
---
Imma start doing Uranium Fever more often
---
Am i the only one who can't read it? I'm on mobile and nothing i've tried makes it legible.
---
Are you on a console?
---
You could always just hook it up on the hotel TV and use their wifi
---
Yes I am. And thats true haha.
---
They can elevate the ticket to a dev. I've had it happen in PoE.
---
well take it as a lesson, next time you get the message of a launched nuke, you'll be paying attention ;)
---
I was mostly joking. Take your vacation time to spend with the people who you are there to holiday with
---
And apparently you do too, considering you still bother to read this sub after quitting months ago. Go find a better way to spend your time instead of wasting mine.
---
Pls add Fisto to the spa in the Whitespring.
---
No. There is an open area in which you can build around the concrete walls with a combination of foundation and walls. This is a collage of photos.
---
For sure man haha, I’ll risk getting the controller dirty to save my base next time
---
You are your worst enemy :D
---
Really! I just thought it up one day lol.
---
When the event goes that way just jump on the instruments and end it early I dont even see it as rude to do so, if the other players wont let others get a single chance to farm the event then dont give them the chance to farm it either. It's not the right solution but at the end of it all most folks like that are out for themselves and dont care that you didn't get a tag on the legendaries so why should you care about cutting their farming time short.
---
I predict the second the patch goes live, there will be 5 posts about how it completely broke the game, that everything Bethesda does is the worst thing to ever happen to video games, and that the posters will of course be uninstalling the game after playing since 6 months before beta.
---
Can you elaborate a little more?
---
One word: Molotov.
---
No, not the Mexican music band, the other kind.
---
The flames 'linger' tagging enemies as they run by, are cheap to craft and they don't go 'boom' clipping corpses through collisions.
---
Useful to power level too.
---
Guns n roses I think it's the best babe, then acdc, pink Floyd and then led Zeppelin. Amazing
---
I bet they sneak in some Wastelanders lore piece or some little Easter egg.
---
Among many other reasons, some of which are impolite, another possibility is coincidental - 
---
  For people chasing violet flux, the Toxic Valley is a great source with a different critter set to fight.
---
You can see on the map where the train tracks actually cross the road. It found a video on youtube and I had to find it myself. It's literally just NWW of the land fill
---
I must admit it was scary for me my first time since I was very under leveled and the location name popped up after the deathclaw. So underwhelming now, but scared the pants off me the first time though.
---
its not common but heres a list of possible triggers to the toxic element of the player base I can think of. 
---
fallout first flag?
---
raider flag? 
---
gay pride flag?
---
really expensive vendor?
---
really good weapons sold cheaply and undercutting the expensive vendors?
---
a vendor that shows 24 weapons but when people fast travel there they arent legendaries?( a personal pet peeve of mine that makes my nuke finger twitchy. i resist because at least nuking the queen will get me one legendary. 
---
locked water purifiers?
---
did you claim someones workshop?
---
Not for super sledge. The standard sledge has tons of mods, but even the best ones there are worse than super-sledge with coil.
---
All rise has a unique mod on it that you can't put on other super sledges, that one is technically the best but the effects of All Rise aren't super good ( 10hp and 90% reduced weight or something like that )
---
A half-full glass.
---
I'd settle 4 just having the marker be in the right place on my compass
---
Poor game design and testing discipline.
---
For events like this and uranium fever, I carry a 10mm smg.  Great for hip fire short range tagging.
---
It is always at the Whitsprings train station for me.
---
Send in Enclave vertibirds with collared deathclaws after them!
---
OHH. No sadly not. There is a spot where there is a hole in the wall, but it is rather small and you can even place anything in it.. I tried to put a pumpkin in it. You pick one of the paths basically. Lol wither ways goes to the camp. One side has a scarecrow on the wall(right) and the other the murican flag. The both connect together at the en at the entrance as you can see in the photos.
---
I just checked...but nothing.
---
The mirelurk kings make that a bastard
---
I have looked at that spot a couple times now trying to figure out how the structure would/could look like. You did a great job!
---
It's not that one.. I pretty sure some of the lines come from a note.. i definitely found a note the other day that had some of the lines from this text she's showing
---
Me too! And thank you. I can send the link of the youtube video I got the idea from if youd like. His seems to be WAYYYY bigger. I know he was on pc, but I have no idea if their camp radius is larger or not.
---
14,000 overseer exp
---
so just play enough NW and you will get it
---
A couple months ago, I shot one down @ WS station.  AS it fell from the sky, another player ran over from blackwater.  He got to it before I did and cleaned it out.  
---
I got nothing.
---
2 weeks ago, I shot one down, and both of us got a card (and the other loot).  
---
The difference is in scenario 1, I was not teamed with the other player.
---
In scenario 2, we were teamed.
---
Subjectively, there's multiple cards for people on teams, but if solo, there's only one card.
---
Ah ok thanks how much XP do you get per level?! Or how much XP does it require to level up?
---
those values im not sure of, im sure one of the dataminers has the info posted somewhere though
---
20-25 depending on the mag. Sadly there’s no drum mag for it.
---
Ah, well do you know if it takes more and more every time you level up?
---
I saw one in the Divide (at a distance) a couple days ago.
---
You can’t get it anymore can you? I thought it was time limited...
---
I’ve found it at Pleasant Valley Station as recently as 25 minutes ago. I see it there daily.
---
Wow! The OP deleted their account, I wonder why?
---
So don't have them drop loot
---
they are bringing them back from the 11th -16th? i think. it definitely starts on the 11th.  the reason they are bringing it back is because the challenges shut down "early" as a miscommunication
---
So do you have to get 14k during the event or just reach 14k?
---
that part i do know, it does go up a little every level you earn
---
Furious then would be good for the SBQ?
---
Ah ok thanks pal!!
---
  Beyond the price of the game itself and the PS+ subscription, I didn't need to lay out real money for anything in order to launch a nuke and kill the queen.
---
Think you just hit a big. I normally play with a group that’s two teams. If any one of us shoots it down we can all get a card. But I’ve also had it be empty once when I was the only one around and shot one down. Just random glitches I guess.
---
This would be spectacular to have NPC's putting out a bounty on PC's.
---
In reality, PC's are quite the terror.
---
I saw something similar a couple of months ago...
---

&gt;a vendor that shows 24 weapons but when people fast travel there they arent legendaries?( a personal pet peeve of mine that makes my nuke finger twitchy. i resist because at least nuking the queen will get me one legendary.
---
I agree that can be annoying, but I wouldn't blame the player unless they were ridiculously priced. Certainly wouldn't waste a nuke run over it. Ideally the devs should make legendaries a separate category in the vendor item list so we can see if it's worth the trip in the first place.
---
i think they said that your exp is saved from the last go around, so you should just have to reach the 14k mark from where your exp was sitting when the event stopped. so if you had 7k "event exp" at shutdown you should start there
---
 assuming nothing goes wrong with it
---
You may be correct, now that I've moved to the dark side with 1st sub I sometimes just don't bother with loot bags if I die and I often drop stuff.
---
Thanks for that, makes me feel better 👍
---
They mentioned a couple things they’re hoping they can get out this month as far as fixes. The 250 bug is a big one and I expect it’ll drop today.
---
You can scrap your pip boy
---
How Juicehead scrapped his Pipboy, before they made it unscrapable ofcause.
---
Just have to go a bit slower
---
Please assume the position.
---
Even if it had a drum mag it would probably be like 30-35 bullets.. \*glares at handmade rifle\*
---
did the nuke plant 3 times, well actually 4 since the first time was a failure as I was trying to figure out where these things to fix were and then had 5 minutes left to start the reactor and I got lost going back to control room.
---
But got the large, fusion and windmill generator.
---
Found one level 10 hazmat suit, seems like the place had been recently raided every time I went through it nothing much to collect.
---
It happens a lot when trading which is when I want it to work the most. Just let me throw up a heart to show appreciation.
---
Same. How are people supposed to just intrinsically *know* that the guitar on the wall is for walloping them if they can't see it's assassin's?
---
Creekside in the bog seems to be a good spot. I’ve only tried a handful of times but have yet to not get one when I FT there.
---
oh! oh! i saw it at harpers ferry! helped a new friend get it :)
---
I just checked in Harp and Valley, they both don't have it. Maybe i am bugged?
---
If you got that bloodied handmade off the queen (you didn't say either way) then you did enough damage. Maybe they just wanted all the flux up there since there's many different kinds. In any event, I'm sure I pissed off certain players during the event when I was new to it, but it's not like they hand you an instruction sheet when you first start doing them. I've stood on the fence, on top of the bunker, and took shots at her when everyone else was just waiting for her to land. These are all things that can annoy certain players, although I've seen multiple others doing the same things with no adverse affect to her landing (the endless stagger in flight and strangler PA stuff can be a bit annoying though).
---
Yeah, it's a Zeppelin tune-- the player even added 'LZ' after the lyrics-- but it's pretty obviously built as part of an actual memorial.
---
I think in a 60 second time span, they do about the same damage. (R3 Lock and load is essential for the LMG.) If you have Quick Hands triggering then LMG can outdps the .50cal. Otherwise the .50cal deal about 5-10% more damage in the same time period.
---
this might seem silly, but are you sure you didn’t already know it and maybe it’s showing up under (known)?
---
&gt;on Xbox
---
the extent you would need to go through to hack on an xbox is ridiculous.  i seriously doubt anyone would go through that hassle to do so on nuclear winter of all games.
---
When I first started playing, yea, I think so.
---
For example, Camden was always L32 and higher ghouls, Lewisburg was always L48+ mutants and L40 wendigos.  Now, not so much (although I did run across a L50 SB there once)
---
Several patched ago when scaling was tweaked, it stepped down a bit.  
---
I still cite it as 30+ because it is convenient/adjacent to the start point for Miner Miracles, which is L25+ quest, and a good portion of what you need can be had in the heap.   The occasional aggro'ed SB and the event in blair trainyeard where you have to take out the Sentrybot.  Couple nights ago that event was also joined by 2x reular SBs and one Legendary SB.
---
Not quite low level stuff
---
Yep i checked and i am sure i don'y know it...
---
I’m going to add you
---
Don't forget it will be the same people who are leaving the game after each and every patch! And who complain about things that do not even exist in-game!
---
Checkout the discord's.  It'd be cool if there was a LFG-introvert sub-group on all of then :)
---
You are swamped with invites, but i'm much the same.  I've yet to play 94, just because I don't team up all that often.
---
I'm guessing some NW fixes before the free to play weekend.
---
How about a popeil pocket fisherman ?
---
With a name like yours I believe it lol.  What will you do now that the bombs have dropped?  Reek havoic on your enemies?  Make peace?
---
It would make dealing with those griefers that have 300+ cap bounties easier to manage. Some higher level griefers like to go on killing sprees in the regular servers and it kills the mood sometimes.
---
Well, for me that was never her last holo, since one of them doesn't become available until after you experience a nuke, which usually (at least in the beginning) didn't happen until far, far after that location and the new holo was recently recorded. So I always assumed she survived that encounter.
---
The WHAT
---
To avoid this I tag my most dearer stuff as favorite (key C on PC)
---
I have tagged my underarmor for instance or my prototype antirad suit.
---
This way you get a second confirmation box if scrap it by mistake.
---
Btw, it is not needed on legendary stuff as it is not scrappable.
---
You can scrap yor hat regardless if you scrap junk or not. just be careful what's highlighted and go slower.
---
(Can't respond to your other comment for some reason, so I will do so here)
---
Why do you keep referring to yourself in plural? Or is it you and your imaginary friend? That's cute!
---
Cost an arm and a leg to bring it back? 
---
Dude, the cost to travel from vault 76 to Aaronholt is just a few caps man. Hardly an arm and a leg.
---
the oldest player I know of is in his upper 70's, and I have you by almost 20... :)
---
Bethesda employees
---
&gt; I returned to my base at the top left of the map 
---
Nukes can't be dropped there. So, cool story bro - but anyone who knows the game and is paying attention knows you're lying.
---
"As seen on bug free games...."
---
I love your site officer. I also love waffles. Win/win?
---
Yup i am sure... what should i do?
---
I went through your other work and it's just so nice!  Bravo!
---
Why would I make it up? I didn’t think you could launch it there either but it happened
---
Can I interest you in a gallon of gas. 
---
Or do I need to say a gallon of petrol?
---
I used to 100s of materials to bring it back, not sure what you mean
---
Idk what any of you are talking about I did an event yesterday and was getting attacked by nothing but lvl 90 deathclaws i got attacked by like 6 in a 3 min period
---
hoping for more than just an event. I want to see a glimpse of Wastelanders...
---
which is a make or break major update, and they can give us a small taste.
---
I don't have 1st but this sub loves that solution.
---
It wouldn't be a practice targeting low level players - at least not that I'm aware.
---
I've nuked quite a few bases now - anytime a group of greifers have rolled over one of my workshops I've bided my time and watched them on the map until they reveal their base location - then i have marked it and headed off to a nuke launch site.
---
A few times i got lucky and they would not log off for whatever reason.
---
After the nuke hit - i would stand in their base with my thump up and wait for them.
---
I recall from when it came out that you can’t no, just regular laser rifles etc only.
---
Because reasons.
---
Only Dominator ones I presume ?
---
Yea this has happened to both me &amp; a teammate as well. Both Fallout 1st members &amp; we both got our bases nuked. We would have left the server but we were both doing Scorched Earth at the time.
---
Bloodied &gt; Junkie's &gt; Furious &gt; Zealot's &gt; Anti-Armor is how I would rank them, if you're only looking at damage output. Furious is the highest of those that doesn't require you to be low health or have multiple chem dependencies, so yeah. :-)
---
See edit.  I goofed up - forgot that there is a corridor that can be nuked north of the safe zone, anywhere north of Deathclaw Island &amp; Tyler Counter dirt track really.
---
&gt; Maybe they just wanted all the flux up there since there's many different kinds
---
Yeah, I've seen that area nuked before.  Lots of plants.
---
One for each person that has been on that server and hasn't finished the guest. Lot of people don't do that quest do their quest copies are just there. Not a bug, just how the game handles quest items. The BETA was just like that. Ever seen like 15 people huddle around one container to get their quest item?
---
Not at all I personally would love that happening to me too..  Launching nukes is one of my favorite events so I NEED keycards. Thanks for letting others know.
---
The scrap item will destroy whatever your cursor is over when you hit the scrap button, no matter what is highlighted.  It's been that way forever and I've only seen it mentioned a couple times, so I'm sure they're not even aware of the issue.
---
DON'T EAT FOOD.
---
To be honest now with nuclear winter and private servers what’s the point of bounties?
---
Yes, this was my favorite pistol to use!
---
You know they'll fire you up.
---
I’ve found this too, when you select your item to sell the confirmation box pops up. But if you move your cursor off that you can not select but highlight another item in your inventory.
---
Try it with things of different quantities to see it easily
---
Having done that if you then hit confirm it’ll sell the item highlighted.
---
No you're not. That's the solution for people with too much money.
---
For smart people, the solution is to use a Tesla rifle.
---
You forgot about people “genuinely curious” why people are still playing.
---
Specific questions for dates, times, and duration of an item returning to the atom shop, perhaps one that was vaulted last week.
---
Questions about the state of the game, up to and including people that went on a trip for a week and just got back.
---
Oh who am I kidding, that’s just “the usual” now!
---
Idk how many inchquarterpounds is it during full moon?
---
She is in a room locked with a terminal, right before the room where you find Maria Chavez.
---
The only bounty I've ever gotten was as a low level player, picking up a Government Supply Drop, it didn't show as red, but after grabbing the first item, I got a bounty and noticed it actually said 'steal' not 'take'. 10 cap bounty, hid out in the morgantown nukashine den until I realised it was futile and fast travelled to charlestown station and waited for someone to kill me so I could see the map again. (somehow I missed morgantown station for ages, I know it's right out from the airport, but I never went out that exit and usually took the monorail as a low level to the morgantown red rocket)
---
I always double check those drops if I see them now.
---
The quest is a lot easier if you do it in the right sequence. Made it single in 30 minutes around level 20 (and without any mutation).
---
Begin with the cooling towers, once you have completed one of the tower the repair points light up in the second tower.
---
Then proceed directly from the cooling station to the main plant through the corridor and look for the security room.
---
Hack the terminal and remove the critical state, that opens up all doors and the decontamination tunnel.
---
And remember where the security room is. The control room can be reached directly from the security room.
---
If you get lost, just Fast Travel outside, now that the security doors are open you can reenter the plant from the main entrance and then all rooms location are listed on information pannels.
---
Lever is my go to single shot gun.
---
The handmade just goes better as an auto. My go to group killer. With all aligned mods and a reflex site, I get about a full clip from vats. If you use vats, aligned mods all the way.
---
console players are at a disadvantage to PC for free aim kills.
---
Hahaha!  I have to stop reading this shit while drinking coffee.....excuse me, I have a mess to clean up.
---
My nemesis. That poison damage really fucks me up as a Bloodied Power Armour build. Unless you stim immediately you're toast. Warm buttery toast
---
Once you get to the savage divide, the train station bots sell all the brick/warehouse/etc plans. There's no reason why you wouldn't be seeing it.
---
With the slow fire rate of the lever action, I'd have to opt for the handmade as the better allrounder if we can only have one weapon. If you get an instigating one, it'll still one-shot most mobs from stealth, keeping ammo use down, and the higher fire rate will help immensely against those mobs that it can't one-shot.
---
Your legs are numb.
---
Eh .. hate to get into the politics of the game because I feel like that's all people talk about nowadays, but a lot of people don't see being subscribed to the game as supporting it. 
---
Many people view subscribing as having the opposite effect.
---
Qbahahahabahahabahabababhahahah. 
---
You're a funny fucker.
---
Yea, works great, I walked half way across the Ash Heap yesterday doing that, hidden the entire time.
---
I just want to be able to destroy mainframe cores with my grenade launcher again! It’s the most satisfying part of a silo run and I miss it.
---
thx for he tip...never used a reflex sight.
---
Yeah, have them drop 3 pre-war cash like all dead BoS paladins always do
---
I have no idea, I believe I've even gotten it as a reward for doing the defending workshops.  I don't know why it's not showing up for you, that doesn't make sense from a bug stand point of how it would even work, not saying it's not bugged, just trying to think of what would even be the trigger to recreate it.
---
Sadly i wouldn’t know the gt just that its on xbox, it was a long time ago, perhaps op might know.
---
I love your sentiment. Very cool to see someone  ot into the game respectively g those that are.
---
May I kindly ask out of curiosity why you hang out on a sub, and comment, for a game you 'fucking hate with a passion?'
---
Seems masochistic
---
Could be easily fixed by making the container instanced!
---
It's too hard to get a high bounty now. Back in the day you could use a minigun to level a camp and be left with a 2k cap bounty. That was too rough of people so now you have to pick water purifiers at people's camps but guess what, if you pick one lock you can no longer see where peoples camps are. I haven't seen more than a 50 cap bounty this whole year basically
---
I don't think I've even seen a wanted player in months.
---
I just changed 10 different servers and they harper ferry/whitesprings station bots sells ALL same patterns.... but no brick ones.
---
Bug has been around for awhile off and on
---
Yeah those 5 cap bounties from level 5 players that picked the wrong lock really add up /s
---
Try experimenting with armor, I carry 5-6 sets all the time (along with the reduced armour weight perk,) a full set of troubleshooters makes the silo run a lot less challenging and a set of mutant slayers will make a runthrough of westek a lot easier. I run a bloodied build and use a lot of chems and rarely get into a tough spot.
---
That's definitely a rarity. I have never seen a bounty higher than 100c in a combined 500 levels of playing this game
---
This is real reason for changing world events and the 1 per a time limit with wait times inbetween
---
That's depressing. Glad she game game to have an outlet.
---
I've been playing since the beginning, so I'm always willing to help out too with whatever! My psn is viperxr22
---
Bloodied build deathclaw 😐 ghoul 😱 lol I'm more concerned about the ghouls dealing rad damage.
---
Eh. We had two lower level players on an SBQ last night that seemed to screw up the fight by staying SE of the Prime Fissure when all other players were fighting at or near V9. The Queen wouldn't land for more than a few seconds. It turned into a fail. The two players ignored all attempts to get them to move their location. Now, THOSE two might have gotten nuked afterwards....
---
Sieg HEIL
---
But they added Longfellow's outfit
---
As a mostly commando rifle build I have a primed auto B25 FFR and a primed auto BE handmade and quad auto FFR combat rifle.  I have several other rifles as well (Tesla, Railway, Radium) that have auto and FFR. 
---
Against players, I always lean on the FFR weapons over explosive weapons.  My standard weapon is an AAE auto handmade because it’s versatile and can be used against a number of enemies.  Against the SBQ, I bust out the B25 FFR primed handmade.
---
Private world, claim workshops, sorting last few points to perk cards on my characters commando build
---
Oh, that's why you couldn't find it. Plan spawns in vendors (or at least some of them) are based on your character level, and you are too low right now
---
Anyway, I have it in my inventory. Feel free to come and take it :) My IGN is eggrfegegr
---
I think the barn set might require buying some of the lower level ones first or possibly it is level locked. My low level alt lives at whitespring train station and when they check the vendor they only have 2 lower level plans there, maybe barn and warehouse. Don't know for sure what it takes to get brick in the list but my main absolutely has that option there all the time.
---
I do the 50 Cal because i use it also.
---
I have 20,000 rounds of 5.56 for my explosive hunting Rifle.
---
I dont really use it because i have to repair it every 5 minutes.Even with weapon Artisan Perk.
---
I wont let it go either though. Occasionally useful for blitzing enemies
---
Me too! Will add you 👍
---
I completely agree, Deathclaw island should have at least 4 legendary Deathclaws to contend with, nothing says I love you, like having your ass torn apart by a group of legendary Deathclaws. Lol. 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best.
---
How much do you charge for cells? 
---
I usually do 1 per and they sell fast but 2 per will sit for much longer
---
Christmas decorations for my camp. If not, I’ll have nothing to live for and be very sad
---
This instancing technology too advance for Bethesda hence why we lag like hell during vault raids lol.
---
Every time i max i buy 1 mutation. Then vender hop to low lvl people and buy ammo to help out the little guys!
---
My two favorite weapons are the Bloodied Gamma Gun (auto) and Quad  Explosive Harpoon gun.  I don’t use either of them very often but they are fun against certain players.
---
The whole severs have chugged horribly since they added containers that access the stash, then even worse when the Vault raids were released!
---
I want Whiteclaw Island.
---
I will give confirmation if its level related!
---
They couldn't code that of their lives depended on it.
---
Lots of reasons to nuke areas besides the SBQ &amp; White Springs, mainly Flux &amp; Stabilization materials.
---
They may have been nuking you intentionally because of 1st, I've heard of people griefing 1st members, so I use the 1st Icon &amp; wear the Ranger Armor outfit, but it doesn't seem to be working for me much, damn shame, as I enjoy a bit of PvP now &amp; then.
---
I did have a couple of players try to gank me this morning, I wish I had been recording, it was a real comedy show;
---
* level 32 player invites me to team, I look around and see a level 56 hiding nearby, so I accept, then pop a Stealthboy.
---
* Level 32 immediately shoots level 56, 56 returns fire, 32 leaves Team, and joins 56, (they are on area chat, talking through there plan, lol)
---
* I was on my level 200+ well equipped Bloodied build, so I toast them both, and they seek revenge, so I toast them again, at this point one is telling the other not to revenge because I'm cheating, it was hilarious, both were using energy weapons &amp; I'm wearing Heavy Leather Armor with an ER of 829.
---
* I would have nuked their bases, but had to leave for work.
---
I understand, when going too quick, items from Apparel occasional appear (My Sentry Bot Helm frequently does) because bugs. BUT going slower means you're more likley to spot it and avoid it when it does.
---
You know you can go to the bunker and use the computer which marks the cargo bot on your map?
---
Agreed.  I hope you have a fantastic day!
---
I've only ever had a bounty once, was picking a lock in a workshop that someone was in the process of claiming.
---
Fast travelled to Vault 76 and stood nude on top of the door until someone came along and killed me, never thought that being killed by another player could be a wholesome and friendly experience.
---
Only thing i know of is, mod the vault suit to give it defense
---
Its not dead it's a Charlie Brown
---
You should get the ground zero achievement
---
You are welcome :) Do you need any other construction set?
---
I think you get plans for vault tek jumpsuit from overseer cache and can craft at armor workbench?
---
Nope i have them thanks :)
---
That's true! The Halloween rewards return from the 11th to the 16th and your XP from the previous challenge carries over into this challenge. After that, the Holiday rewards are out from the 17th to January 6th.
---
you always can wear power armor stand  between them and enemy. if they have explosive the better. you know...

Maybe your camp prevented another players from spawning so he nuked it, done that myself a couple times.
---
Not a bad method 🤔
---
You are misstaken. Stop quoting the “instance dungeon” Wikipedia. 
---
I am just relaying what they already told us. NPC dialogue will be instanced. I apologize you are not familiar with the broader terminology.
---
Haha thanks
---
I wish they'd just give us fixed bathroom items.
---
I have 3 playabale toons. When i max one of them i try to look for any plans i still dont have(including PA plans). This gives me room to breath on caps.  With my main thou i have all the plans available of the game so i go look for player vendors and buy anything to help them. Stashing caps on mule dont seem to be so efective cause evebtually you will cap on it too so you keep "useleess" currency and this is not good for any economy system.
---
This is just my opiniom thou. Cheers.
---
I miss the 'idea' of Survival. I miss what I hoped Survival could have been. I do not miss the repetitive pointless ambush tea-baggery that was too often gameplay on a Survival server.
---
The amm/scrap approach is solid (Especially if you are FO1st with a scrapbox) but I am working on a collection of my primary weapon for each character. This one will have rifles, that one will have pistols, etc. Not necessarily to use but to have for future patches that might make unusual things more viable/valuable and of course legacy weapons are always a good investment
---
Serum Recipes. They’re worth 200-400 for most people but 440c to the vendors. You can max out your daily cap limit pretty quickly that way. And you only need one recipe to make that work.
---
source?
---
This does nothing positive for the English language and just makes the user look immature and ignorant. Highly doubt any linguistics would condone this behavior
---
Yus.  There is no downside to having sneak maxed out.  I personally would max out sneak at level 3 if the game would let me, I think it's that valuable.  Do not forget to pick up escape artist too, it really makes the sneak perk shine.
---
Lever for farming since it is so ammo efficient. Handmade for tougher fights.

That's the one you can wear over armor?
---
Hello man. I can join you. We run vaults in a daily basis. Also one person of our team can join too. Are you looking to clear the cycles once on expert or looking for daily clears as well?
---
I use nothing but semi auto rifles with a sneak build. I used a tse lever for a long time, and it was great, although as you noted, the tear and repair is pretty bad compared to an explosive handmade. I gave it up though as it was just killing me in crowd control situations. It was too slow and would break really quickly if the mobs were up in my face. It was really great at range though, and I was sad to give it up. I gifted it after I got a legendary fixer from the purveyor, because it also uses .45. Not the best prefix (Executioner's) but more versatile and the sneak/speed buffs are excellent.
---
in about 12mins
---
Yes!!! I have a 22 weapon display at my camp with little letters on each one. That could save me a ton of budget!!
---
Both.
---
Lever for sniping, handmade for multiole mobs, or when I get tired of sneaking.
---
I think at 10am est and then about 15 mins later they usually tweet the patch notes.
---
not sure about farm spots, but you can craft shitloads with super duper
---
hit collision course for an easy 100+ cloth/run then server hop Tanagra town for the acid (cave crickets)
---
Releasing that damn Commie bundle hopefully
---
Plans.
---
Once you have every plan, the game becomes a shopping sim as you go from camp to camp looking for anything interesting to buy.
---
No, pvp is absolute trash in this game.
---
Not irrelevant. Just adds layers. Maybe players from wastelanders could get double the bounty for killing raiders and vice versa to add something for players
---
How long have you played?
---
you on pc? If so I can hook you up!
---
Most true response.
---
Thanks! I'm gonna have to look into that! :D
---
I'm cool with that. Some exploits are fun
---
Sugar grove
---
Yes please! With mini nukes strapped to their claws!
---
Only 70's kids get this.
---
I've never understood why they don't just use the hunter/hunted mechanic for vault raid matchmaking. People that have their own teams could go in on their own, but if people wanted to find a group, they could just turn on the radio station, when four people joined, it would start.
---
Lol i see what you did there.
---
Thank your fot your service.
---
kill super mutants.
---
I think cloth and acid makes gunpowder
---
I always thought they were great. I would want them to be a totally new unit. Raider hunter killer or wastelander assassins with unique skills weapons and stats
---
Search for the post "Where to farm: All the things" on this subreddit for a great guide. Otherwise: Abandoned Bog Town. The largest building on the main Street. Go to the top, fall down the elevator shaft and turn around and see the most glorious sight of about 10 typewriters and a few globes. Check all the desks/cabinets because "loose screws" are found inside those with a pretty high chance. Then head over to the police station/elect chair for a fan, 2 straight jackets and 3 handcuffs.
---
I'm not sure about this specific scenario, but there is definitely a bug with the weapon wheel. If you have two weapons that are same model, but different legendary prefix, your weapon wheel will occasionally favorite both weapons. This issue amplifies if you have more. So there's a likely hood you wont draw the correct weapon in this case. 
---
Also, I experience an issue with quick swapping as well. Every now and then, if I quick swap to my "last used" weapon, it's not always my last used. I swear it just chooses a random gun in my inventory. This doesn't always happen, but it's happened on several occasions.
---
I've sent a bug report about both issues, no response. Also made a Reddit post not too long ago, again, no response. 
---
Hope they get fixed eventually. Also on PS4.
---
You mean with Fisto?
---
if you have a handmade with less vats legendary, you can make it consume zero ap per shot. auto receiver, aligned and Swift mods. BOOM vats your ass off and keep your ap
---
u/KEEPERZ
---
Oh fuck that would be so much fun
---
nah i’m on ps4, thanks tho
---
i’ll check it out, thanks
---
and reflex.
---
That's an interesting idea. Staged photos are pretty easy, but action shots can be challenging. Especially when in a fight. Good luck!
---
alright thanks, i’ll definitely try it out!
---
Powerful auto modded combat rifle basically the fixer and same ammo as lever, powerful auto modded handmade. Explosive trait is so much fun!
---
Lever is fun lone wandering but not something to use in a cranberry bog event.
---
Perk cards, armor, underarmor, beers, yada yada yada are key to success.
---
Too often i see overpriced unmodded bloodied, anti armor, junkies, rifles for sale in players vending machines. Craft and scrap the weapons need to learn the mods, simple. These weapons are too weak without the mods and that is why new players are unable to do the damage needed to win an event.
---
Search reddit or youtube for fallout 76 commando build.
---
That would be a great idea because there are a lot of ponds and lakes in game. All we'd need is fish lol
---
u/oKEEPERZo
---
&gt;Not a bug
---
Yes it is. Your reasoning is probably right, but it's totally reasonable that they should be able to hide those belonging to other players. The fact that *no* other quest items do this is what clearly gives away that it's a bug.
---
Sorry, I misunderstood and thought you meant the transport back to base was expensive to bring home your loot. My bad, English is not my first language.
---
The actual event rewards have a chance to give you the enclave themed items, as well as rare outfits, so if you ignore the fact that the game didn't make you actually grab it from the pod... I mean, no one else is around to give you the rewards, it had to come from the pod right?
---
Im sorry :-/
---
I haven't reached the limit yet.   
---
I also have no interest in being a cap-ionaire.
---
I could see an outfit utilizing war surplus uniform items, but I agree.
---
In the Mire, yes.   
---
Free Range can spawn at three different locations and it varies on difficulty depending on which one it is.  
---
The forest one is the easiest, the Savage Divide one is "medium" difficulty and the most common one (At least in my experience), the one that spawns in the Mire is the most difficult and has two Sheepsquatches at the end.
---
Because, it’s fallout with friends, I have friends. I’ve burned out 3 times and come back all 3 of those times, just because of those friends.
---
250 DRWA. Finally!!
---
Overall there were a lot more fixes than I was expecting!! Hopefully everything works as expected.  
---
Pretty pumped for the Xmas events!!
---
So no fix for turrets attacking our own camps? That's just gonna be a bug that is going to last into the new year? Are you fing serious?
---
It's not usual but it can happen - I've had this at least once. Not grumbling to get 2 legendaries but 1 sheepsquatch at a time is what I'd rather fight!
---
Honestly when I started, i thought that the function of the flare gun was to call for help from others. (Might be from playing division dark zone) they definitely need to add something for match making/world chat function
---
Whoa the foundation? Who are they? I missed something.
---
Glad you're happy about this, and we hope our changes will help Challenges feel a bit better going forward. Some specific ones that I know we are removing are "Take a Picture of Grahm in a Workshop" and "Take a picture of someone in a Nuke Zone while naked", and others like that. 
---
I want to just double down on the note that these changes won't be reflected until 2020, so if you continue to run into Challenges after that which are too hard to complete or are confusing, please let us know!
---
Because Todd wanted them
---
Is that all?
---
Levelling my 1h pa user.  Still kicking mysekf for deleting my 2h user :( alas whiskey and evil ex wife made me emotional that evening.
---
I dont still have the text in front of me but I think I read the Halloween NW rewards are coming back for a bit, and then right after Christmas well get some holiday NW rewards...? Really... lol
---
Can I just add that they could please add some fun outfits to the normal game and not just the atomic shop? 
---
With wastelanders coming there could easily be a rare clothes vendor in one of the settlements that could occasionally spawn some unique outfits maybe even sell them for like 10k as a cap sink.
---
I got jumped and didnt know what was happening, when i realised what was going on, my heart stopped beating. I have been gone for quite a while and last time i’ve been on, there was only the imposter so yeah...
---
Does any of the atom challenges changes make them reward less atoms?
---
Cool
---
If it doesn’t make them $$ it’s not a priority.
---
&gt;Jet Packs: No longer activate automatically when performing a normal jump. To activate a Jet Pack, players must release the jump button and then press it again.
---
I'm assuming that this fix alone does not completely remove the "sudden complete AP drain" bug with the jet packs.
---
You can tell the dev folks hardly play the game themselves
---
I hope the bomb is part of the rewards. Now THATS a lawn ornament.
---
Thanks for all that! 
---
I would say the smoke machine thing is probably for stability. That's a lot of particles to render.
---
Other than the grind of getting all the badges super easy.
---
You CAN just back out of the menu though, like you could in Fallout 4 I'm sure.
---
Or understand anything about firearms and weapons in general.  Or weight.
---
The X-01 targeting hud fixed, excellent, been waiting for that one.
---
And the 250DR bug gone? Permission to shout bravo at an annoyingly loud volume? BRAVO! Time to unpack that FE assault rifle I've been sitting on.
---
yup . 1st shot, they all turn round and look directly at me like i'm jumping up and down, waving a flag or a red rag. Then escape artist can be funny, they rush up, within feet, and can't see me. ?????? (not always).
---
oh ..... get covert operative as well
---
I know their is a chance, I just think area or faction events should always give something from that faction, even if it's a mod box. I think factions should give us specific kinds of rewards.
---
Responders: should give us meds and building materials
---
Free-states: weapon and base plans
---
Raiders: Drugs and weapons
---
BOS: Energy weapons and heavy guns.
---
Enclave: Enclave themed weapons
---
etc.
---
I understand that their is a need for a rarity factor but if they want to give us stuff I wish it made a little more sense thematically, or at least explain why dog food was sent to space and deemed important enough to put 1 can in a drop pod.
---
Yea utter clueless. We have to DESTROY a long scope in order to put a reflex sight on our gun lmao you can’t make this schit up
---
Hey, give him a break. There's only one guy working on the game atm. I think he's doing a good job so far.
---
The commando perks still don't have their flavor text XB1
---
Anything new for today other than bugs/fixes?
---
Wait, what? How long have you been playing the game? Cause I got that trophy within the first few months of playing. I got all of them back in may. The ones that were tough for me were the magazine and modding weapons (cause I don’t have time for that)
---
Thanks for the update!
---
I know this is a small fix but I'd be forever grateful if you guys could fix the beam focuser on the ultracite Gatling laser making the projectiles red!
---
Wow... this is actually amazing!
---
In that case go to abandoned bogtown and head to the roof with the elevator access. Fall down the elevator shaft and go wild on all the type writes and globes in that building!
---
Good stuff. Free robot, fun and light festival, it's cool.
---
That said....
---
&gt;  However, before you can begin earning progress toward any given Challenge, you must first complete the Challenges preceding it in order.
---
FFS, they're really making sure that the process is getting more annoying one festival after the next.
---
Not only we'll have to wait for all rewards to be made available one day at the time, but we'll also be unable to level them up all at once once they're accessible... Which means if the last reward is anything like Halloween (15k exp) we're talking about something exponentially long.
---
+250 DR while Reloading Fixed!!🙌
---
The Mysterious Stranger should just randomly come merc their ass.
---
Don't worry , owning more bots will be available with only $15 a month
---
I’ll be upfront in saying I was expecting more for the year-end patch but this is a nice list of new stuff to do and a solid fix list. Thanks, team, for all your work this year. Have a great holiday and I look forward to what’s coming next year and the year after. &lt;3
---
250 DRWR is fixed.........it’s beautiful
---
"In response to community feedback, we have revisited many of our existing Challenges in order to make them more player-friendly and remove others that had too many requirements."
---
Don't challenges reward Atoms? So removing them makes Atoms even harder to get? I doubt they will look at the amount of Atoms they will remove and add them to other challenges or new ones?
---
Chuck on Chemist perk card (I) and Super Duper (L), go to chemist workbench, create gunpowder (under ammo).
---
+250 Reload DR fixed 🙌
---
if its guaranteed 2 3 stars i will always go there.  Didn't know that
---
\^ This
---
Assaultrons' asses so tight you can ricochet a .45 off it
---
 New events for NW and a free item in the atomic shop! I believe you can find the whole list if you scroll down a little on this reddit page. Someone posted the patch notes!
---
The album doesn't do justice to the song. Find a live version on YouTube and you will be blown away. It's an epic song live.
---
I’ll pay you caps to add me and my friends, and routinely join up on us, take pics and message out to group. (Maybe 5-10 pics over the course of a week or so?)
---
I don't see it in the Patch Note but what about fixing Spin-up Heavy gun bug Bethesda has told to fix in Inside the Vault Postponed?
---
My friend played for an hour and decided the game was trash. Parrots random nonsense from Youtubers about why the game is trash. Fucking idiot
---
They were talking about super difficult daily challenges are being removed- not the static challenges that are always there.
---
What kind of build are you running? If you're running a bloodied commando build the magazine size is more than enough to take down groups of enemies, along with having Speed Demon for the increased reload speed. Never have tried Junkies but I'm sure they can put out enough damage to take down groups in a single mag. Otherwise, yea it might be a bit small if you're running a full health build other than Junkies.
---
Cool thanks!
---
Some cool updates there, but I don't like the idea of Santa Scorched. It makes literally zero sense.
---
Awesome!!  Ty so much for posting saves me time later!!!  😃😃
---
If it had more it would be Deathclaws Island maybe..... Deathclaw kinda means 1 my dude
---
If I'm not wrong they're just 1 star.
---
Okay :D

Now kiss

---
We need to stress the Spin-Up Bug constantly now to get it fixed apparently.  Same like everyone that complained about 250DR.
---
mole rats, why a mole rat should have gunpowder is behond me , but they frquently do. and you can always eat them.
---
If you did a combo rifle/pistol pipe build, like the OP's asking about, you'd kill a lot of things.
---
You’re so welcome!! I always try to let people know so they don’t get stuck waiting when the game is back online!!
---
Lol I just read the title then posted virtually the exact same thing you said...
---
Gages outfit was in the atomic shop, that was probably their only exception.
---
From a recent comment I made:
---
&gt;The scrap item option will destroy whatever your cursor is over when you hit the scrap button, no matter what is highlighted. It's been that way forever and I've only seen it mentioned a couple times, so I'm sure they're not even aware of the issue.
---
That’s awesome, but I don’t really use big guns - just my gatling gun, which i use on rare occasions. Thank you for the offer though, much appreciated :D
---
The issue with heavy guns failing to fire sometimes while spinning up was a fix we wanted to move out of our Wastelanders update and into Update 16, but we determined it could not be done safely. Rather than potentially create a new issue there, we kept it where it is. We're still planning to address this one in Wastelanders.
---
Add some perk re-balancing as well.  I would love to see a bunch of these various cards reworked or combined to make them a lot more useful.  Things like lead belly, through hiker, etc.  Make these combined to have them actually be worth taking in a build.  Right now all people generally use are the damage increasing ones.
---
I always got screws from Mama Murphy.

I am figuring that there will be a LOT of gift boxes with TP and fertilizer in them
---
True, but Nerd Rage needs to be below 20% for it to work. Bloodied Handmades are awesome too! :D
---
We are aware of reports about the issue where Turrets may attack the owner's other C.A.M.P. objects and we are investigating. Unfortunately, we were unable to get a fix in time for this patch but we plan to address it in a future update.

This is a great article on stealth in Fallout 76 based on datamines.

---
Those are the originals, by definition of the word "original", it isn't outlandish to presume they meant 1 and 2. Mentioning 3 and NV seemed out of nowhere so I was just curious, sometimes people edit their posts and whatnot
---
Try pvp then man more off a challenge!!
---
Pvp is good for you
---
mind you, the last part after the box has dropped, usually spawns at least 1 legendary.
---
I always thought you had to wait until maintenance was over.
---
Is this unlockable outside NW?
---
Ok...
---
Then why not call them Dailies and Weeklies? Why use the big umbrella term 'challenges'? :p
---
&gt;Artillery Piece: Smoke Grenades can now be looted correctly from the container attached to the Artillery Piece.
---
Finnaly, can't wait to use this thing again and drop my own presents on the scorched!
---
Do the presents have Christmas decoration plans or anything like that? I’m really hoping for/ looking forward to decorating my camp for the holiday season!
---
Ya, nerd rage and serendipity both, but I find that serendipity almost always triggers the first time you dip below 20%, so it makes a great "oh shit" perk, and it procs pretty reliably after that too. Bloodied handmades are indeed awesome, I wouldn't trade mine for anything.
---
I like the random mix of crap. Last time I did it I got some kind of Enclaved-themed gauss rifle and the plan for the serrated switchblade. Fun stuff!
---
Still waiting on PC version here. No download progress bar yet.
---
Came to say this.  Combine it with Gun Fu and lollerskate your way to victory.
---
I barely played Survival at all, but I've gotta be on about 18 or 19 out of the 20. I've got a combined level of about 500 on three characters. I have also never played NW
---
5.796 GB on PS4
---
Are you on console? You can usually download the updates and once maintenance is over you’re ready to play.
---
Haha, true, that Handmade you have is sure worth something too, definitely super rare! Thanks :)
---
Well considering it will be up for three weeks, it's not that much of a grind. E.g. I got 2k xp today with 3 matches. Which is less than 2 hours of playing the mode.
---
Oh I get it, and I agree that the actual containers leave a lot to be desired. It's nothing like it was in Fallout 4 where safes and other locked containers actually had decent equipment.
---
I posted one recently and got a reply from a person from Bethesda, then saw Inside the Vault talking about getting it fixed... Well, I hope they just have forgotten to put it in the patch note or still working hard on the fix, if not we need to keep on requesting as you say. Can't wait to get online and see if there is any change.

So no Strangler PA fix?

You still have yet to fix the God Mode glitch. Fantastic job! 😑
---
Hopefully it’ll pop up soon! I’m on Xbox so

It's a small island.

Happening on PS4. Please and thank you!
---
You're welcome, and apparently! I knew it was rare, but some people would give anything to get it. I have a combat rifle with the same effects too, and a 10mm SMG. Actually I have a whole mule character full of god rolls.
---
Actually, now that I reread it, the next bullet point in that section does say that they have ALSO looked at daily and weeklies. 
---
You are totally right. 
---
I wonder which ones will get cut. Some of them may be pretty long term numbers, but I can't think of anything that is all that high on the difficulty scale.
---
( ͡ʘ ͜ʖ ͡ʘ)
---
It'll be cool playing the game since launch, finally getting some human NPCs. 
---
I put fallout 4 in the other day and wasn't in to it like I am with 76 so I'm excited for it.
---
Works as intended.
---
That would be great for me, I have 60 of them in my vendor.
---
Not that people are that stupid or anything...... But the holiday scorched event looks like it skips sat the 14th lol
---
Add the deliver pistol
---
Looking to run all 3 difficulties as I need the steel. We are already friends so I guess I hit you up next time I see you on. I'm psn ResinYeti
---
Too many things in this game don't make any sense and I doubt that'll change any time soon.
---
Afraid not - they just confirmed that’s delayed until Wastelanders.  I’m excited to see if the 250DR is fully fixed as the notes say - just got a 250DR 50 cal yesterday.
---
Sure thing.
---
thanks, i’ll look out for them
---
alright i’ll give it a shot, thanks
---
Good call. A lot of people won't even start playing the game until the 25th. 
---
Also, why does bum ass Nuclear Winter get an extended event? FOH with that wack ass BR shit already. Chasing trends ass mother fuckers
---
Good call!
---
Might want to pull them and sit on them for a few months
---
I swear I seen a camp like this on PS4. I always check out people's places. I mean I'm sure most enjoy when others check out the thier camps.
---
Grape Mentats? Can't hear you over my 5 Unyielding armor pieces.
---
Yes, Unyielding completely breaks SPECIALization of your character.
---
Neither does paying no one to fast travel. It's a video game my dude.
---
You may have gotten it from an overseer cache because another player put the plan in one, I do that sometimes.
---
I have to complete challanges to complete the NW challenges? What?!
---
I quit trading for that reason. It’s just not worth the hassle.
---
Good, then i dont have to bother with it.
---
It could be interesting ... Maybe Beth got some nice recipes ;)
---
"Unlock Festive Cosmetics with Six New Christmas Challenges
---
One new challenge will appear each day until all six are available. However, before you can begin earning progress toward any given Challenge, you must first complete the Challenges preceding it in order."
---
Umm nope that is not a fun way to offer progressively more difficult limited time challenges. You really need to offer all challenges at the beginning to get us excited for them and let all progress advance each one at the same time. This one per day trickle and resetting progress is obnoxious.
---
I have a bloodied faster fire rate and a bloodied explosive. The explosive is fun but not very practical. I hardly touch the FFR one - it's a bit underwhelming.
---
I think the explosive is decent as (with the beam splitter) it is absurdly powerful but if running commando it's almost always easier to run a silenced ballistic rifle.
---
id use my vats crit on them botches
---
That sure looks like an post apocaliptic house!
---
Source control is too hard huh
---
Accidentally, instead of jumping? Count me in!
---
Cool update! Looking forward to seeing the festivities. 
---
Especially interested in the challenges rework! The mention of aligning them more to the core game experience sounds really good. Some of them currently have been too far out for me to engage with.
---
Hopefully we can hear more closer to the time?
---
Um no? It’s already fixed... just in the wastelanders branch.
---
&gt;Dying while under the effects of 'Well Rested' or 'Well Tuned' causes that effect to disappear
---
This seems to make sense to me. You died. I would loose sleep or be out of joint if I died and came back to life.
---
I play these games for the lore and world building really, but stuff just happens in this game with no explanation at all. The guy that voiced Robert House in New Vegas passed away yesterday, so I spent a while on the wiki reading Houses story. It was fantastic, well thought out and in depth. Compared to that level of depth 76 is hollow. Is it really that much to ask that the main bad guys don't inexplicably dress like Santa for no real reason?
---
bon appetite
---
I would burn down villages just for this
---
There's usually 2, they may or may not be legendary. As they said, typically if it is it's a 1 star.
---
“Iguana” is already human meat haha
---
Humbug!
---
Great. The one thing I wanted. To simply use my spin up guns again isn't here... Guess I'm never going to be able to shoot normally again. Its only been broke since patch 10. It should have never been mentioned in the ITV if it was a sure fix..
---
I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti
---
If your build includes weight redux perks as a standard you should really try to manage weight / hoarding better.

Perk loadouts will help.
---
&gt; Well considering it will be up for three weeks, it's not that much of a grind. 
---
I don't know, I always have mixed feelings when games throw that kind of objectives during holidays. The VTU reward system was the perfect middle ground: 7k exp, nothing more, done in a day and a half at most.
---
Whether or not we have all the time in the world doesn't change that Halloween still asked me for roughly 30 (at least) NW matches in total, which is more than what I can usually endure.
---
I know... but I can dream XD
---
A settlement needs help!
---
I tried it for a month but then again no one seems to want to mess up my spa. If anyone on PS4 needs a place to chill look a little east of the Capitol Building and you should see my camp there.  Couriers, Raiders, all are welcome but please note that starting fights will get your membership revoked and my spa is very exclusive.  Also if you hate on my Pioneer Scout skirt and sack hood with straps combo you get one strike on your membership account.
---
Ohhh! 
---
You should check out the book "How to serve man", could be a service handbook for robots, could be a cookbook.
---
Malfunctioning Santa bots would be cool. Fungal zombies dressing up as santa for no reason just seems odd.
---
Damn dude I got one at just 135 and I just play use to play on weekend all day but after I got all the trophies I barely play any more. It’s just to pass time or if I want to make extra caps for a legendary I find in another vendor
---
Mini gun not firing at first had been fixed? Did I read that right? WOOHOO
---
Yeah! I am still confused whenever I pull a minigun out of a wall safe XD but at least you knew a lvl 3 would give you something worthwhile!
---
Ideal if it does, if not i guess ill log another case, to be told that there is nothing that can be done because either, “We don’t have the tools” or a polite tuff but just live with it and the devs will fix it. And no compensation for your lost items... then it’s closed as a duplicate...
---
Buying, modding, reselling
---
If im at 10k caps then i don't put more than 20k caps worth of items in my vending machine.
---
I buy reasonably priced legendary's from player vendors, mod them then resell them in my vending machine. Craft, scrap the weapons/armor to learn the mods.
---
i had my fireman outfit go missing....
---
Yeah I don't mind mixed I just wish it felt more of a faction / area mix. Like a combat knife / combat knife serrated plan would make sense to me for Free-States, BOS, and Enclave. They could tighten the pools and still maintain a random feel.
---
How many do you need? I can probably sort you out
---
This is one of the little things that could really do a lot for this game, a bunch of cool features like this, I love it.
---
Now THIS is an update. Keep it real.
---
YES! I would love some nice, cool supervillan style clothes.
---
True, mine is more about the way they present the contents. I mean the first time we ever see one of these it has an orbital scan and orbital strike beacon, things that are exclusively enclave and seem like a plausible thing to have available for operatives. Something that would be worth the risk of exposure an orbital drop would incur. 
---
Like getting a way to call in a missile strike from space makes sense to blow your cover over, a can of dog food though.....
---
Handmades are way better
---
Actually that would be a really good way to go about it. It'd give you a target for what to farm specifically if you want certain items. Like "Hey, I want to go get a .50 Cal, I need to run some BOS events." Or, "I need to get some rifles, maybe I should run some Raider stuff."
---
I missed the VTU challenge so I have no input there. However I joined the grind for Halloween rewards. And I had a blast, learned the mode better than when it was launched, came up with strategy and in 10 hours I was halfway there (7k xp). 
---
The only thing that triggers me is the one day - one challenge.
---
I want to take them all at once if that is possible, but I guess they do that, so players can return in the mode each day and have full(er) lobbies.
---
Or server wide chat....
---
...whaaaat?
---
Exactly, no one knows that the plasma gatling I have in display is an explosive one.
---
Bone apple teeth*
---
Yeah man.  Like Disney princesses or whatever.
---
Good job. It's nice that the game keeps getting fixed and I'm also glad that the devs have learned from the summer PA "fix" fiasco and don't implement the fixes hastily (as seen by one of the dev comments). That being said, I'm most excited for the Challenge update comming on 1/1/2020. It would be really nice if the challenges were more closely tied to daily quests and I really hope that the amount of challenges that require hopping all around the map (like the photo challenges) gets reduced.
---
🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️
---
I played through the campaign at a friend's house and was actually pretty impressed with it.  I may or may not have shot that woman and her baby though...
---

yeah, Iguana foods in 76 may be more breaking but in i think FO2 it is pretty much determined to be human flesh.
---
Ok: I took a fouble-honours major in English lit and cultural studies with a minor in linguistics in university, trained to be a high-school English teacher, worked as a mentor and taught instructional techniques/presentation skills/effective speaking lessons for 11 years. 
---
Your comment is not only ignorant of how the English language evolves but is actively discriminating against the group's that use dialects of English that you don't approve of. Your method of shame is only useful in making you feel satisfaction in your position over that of others. You may see people as immature and ignorant if they don't use the language you use in a way that you approve, but if you're just attacking without giving any meaningful advice you seem like a cyberbully who's afraid of linguistic change
---
I don't use any of those perks and I really don't think many do.  My point is to make the use of some of these cards a little more realistic.
---
„Corpses: Enemy corpses no longer sometimes disappear shortly after death.“
---
Praise the Overseer!
---
You will find coal, a lot of coal!
---
A lot.
---
The Christmas update!!
---
Agreed.
---
I know, i'm with you.
---
I have like 36 caps between 5 characters right now.
---
Fuck.
---
Wow! That's pretty neat also
---
Wasn't the Antagonizer a villain for Hubris comics? Or was she from a different comic?
---
exactly that
---
It's the way these things work - usually only a problem on consoles (which you didn't mention, so I'll assume you're on PC, not that it matters much).
---
You have the game files, and you need space for the update patch.  Then you need space for the copies of the files being updated (so you'll have 2 copies of your main game file and whatever other files are updated).  That's so that if something should fail partway though, you don't lose everything and have to start over.
---
It's been that way for ages, nothing new here.
---
Right??? Or a missile launcher and 15 missiles, with a stack of cash, drugs, armor, and bottle caps (cause pre war people knew to start saving bottlecaps)
---
Enemy corpses no longer sometimes disappear after death.....Thank You....Thank You...Thank You!
---
So many legendary enemies I’ve watched disappear before I could loot the legendary.  The worst was when you’d get close enough to pick the item up so you could see its Prefix and gear type....only to watch it disappear before grabbing it.
---
That's weird, have you gone to imgur as well? It's still clear on my side too
---
Ps4
---
I buy and try legendary weapons for fun.
---
No problem. The brood mothers have a chance to spawn as enemy waves at workshops such as Charleston Landfill, Hemlock Holes, Grafton Steel.
---
Can you clarify the NW participant-number-based starting fire? Will the smaller circle be shown in the initial character placement map, or will I just start the round on fire if I choose a starting position in the edge? Or is it just that the first time the circle closes, it will be smaller and I may have farther to run? Assuming the last one, which is fine, just want to be sure.
---
Also, any word on the hacking situation? Still reporting the really obvious hackers every day, and it seems to be the same types of hacks each time. Also, some of the shittier people in NW have been saying they want to use the free weekend to make alt accounts, cheat, and ruin NW for all the new folks who might be trying out the game for the first time. Any way to get ahead of this?
---
Thanks for all that y'all do!
---
&gt; I didn't want a Mule
---
With the help of a familiar/friend, you can pass upto 120K caps to alt vault-characters in your own account. Just saying...
---
Yes ps.
---
Outfits: Glasses can now be worn while the Turkey Mascot head is equipped.
---
YES!
---
I don't want to say synths but... Synths.
---
I don't think so. You can do one food, one drink, one chem, one magazine, one bobblehead. The exception used to be things that buffed melee damage (I think that's actually still a thing).
---
I suspect it is related to the Wastelanders delay.  I think they may want to tie the new Update and the release on steam together to generate interest.
---
You shouldn’t eat human livers.
---
Gonna kill a bunch of scorcheds.
---
Thankyou, I appreciate this thread, it warms my soul! 🤗
---
https://mommysdesignfarm.com/products/shit-happens-roll-with-it
---
Oh Wow
---
It gets an extended event because of the Halloween event coming back.
---
that’s the appeal tho
---
I think you can still stack Rad-x and Rad-x diluted, being a mutant I abstain from Rad-X so have not tested in a long time.
---
Potentially.
---
At the same time, challenges like "Take a Picture of Grahm in a Workshop" have no skillful way of completing them and shouldn't exist.
---
The Brothel-Hood of Steel!
---
You bought it with real money off ebay?
---
The Deliverer Would Be a Cool Weapon skin For the 10mm
---
Just a head's up on this, this was done from patch 15. They could have changed in patch 16. Soon as the download is done, we'll work on updating the list. Also, a lot of the plans have player level requirements to drop also. We will be putting those in the file as well.
---
You paid real money for it? I'm glad it doesn't work then
---
I'm only lvl48 I play this event all the time it's really fun. I have played with alot of ppl on this event and usually they were cordial but I experienced this as well. Take some power armor frames and drop them in a way as to make a bottle neck or slow the enemy's into the back door beside the stage and just use something cheap to spray and spray them from the roof then let them kill them off inside
---
If you've been paying attention you would know it's gonna be released with wastelanders which wastelanders is delayed until somewhere around march.
---
I have done it dozens of times and maybe had 1 in 10 spawn 2.
---
The amount of people on here that aren’t happy that the patch didn’t solve every bug in the game is ridiculous.   I get it’s been awhile but they’ll get to it eventually, just be happy they’ve got their shit together and are start to fix stuff at a faster pace.
---
It says "owned" at the bottom of each item that you own. So just scroll through the whole list of items.
---
They may have some damage Resistance which lowers the number. I have a explosive harpoon that says 990 damage per shot but it doesn’t do that.
---
Like 2 Bucks From a Friend
---
Neat!
---
Oh I thought was an intentional thing by the dude that messed the robots up as a way of throwing people off. Never even thought it was a bug.
---
Thx
---
You can stack melee buffs still
---
The one in the Mire? I always get 2 out of it. So do most other people.
---
i need around 40 i’m i’m not mistaken, but you don’t have to lol
---
Exactly.  There’s actually a more modern shelf I wish we could add items to.  It’s more modern looking, white and very curved edges.  It does have glass but it’s so clear you hardly notice it.  I wish I could add items to it.  Heck even the long ‘Grocery Store’ looking shelves would be cool!
---
They were nerfed a long time ago because you could get insane damage on TSE weapons but you also have screwed yourself out a deal by paying actual money for a weapon. It don’t take long to go around people’s camps to see what if they have anything good for sale.
---
We'll see how it turns out later today once players datamine the stuff. 
---
It appears that NW will have most of the cosmetic rewards this time around, haven't seen anything mentioned in Adventure about outfits or hats or whatever. Bummer.
---
It's not likely to release on Steam until or shortly after Wastelanders, and Wastelanders was delayed to Q1 2020.
---
Thx It Was Really Cheap Ill Just Sell it For Caps
---
It's under Maintenance
---
You should include your account name, so Bethesda can have a closer look at this, they might be able to fix it ;)
---
So which is it, did you buy it for $2 from a friend or for $50 off ebay?
---
Ah that's cool, i can sort you out. Psn is mcpoyle82, send me a request and once the update is over I'll come drop them to you.
---
Is this just the daily/weekly challenges or also the long-term ones? For example some of the discover locations in XXX region won't trigger even if you have the locations on your map. It would be nice if these could be addressed.
---
Same....to many people abuse godmode in  Adventure mode. Everyone "i didn't know i was in godmode" lmao that's why you went from getting your a** handed to you. To now one shotting me. Common....
---
Plus i only use a handmade so wtf. 
---
Its sad when they need 4 v 1 then sb and in the end still need godmode.
---
Haha they're pretty aggressive! I didn't get many spawns while building, but basically every time I would log in the camp would be under siege, usually by the muties. And actually, the first time I came across the place while exploring there was a war going on between four mutants and like six feral ghouls. :O
---
Thankfully all of my builds are for show and not function, so in the end repairing battle damages isn't a problem.
---
good post, upvoted for visibility
---
 Yep, just my luck I guess.
---
They also said Wastelanders was going to be realeased this year, soooo...
---
I'm assuming they will release it on Steam when Wastelanders comes out or shortly after that. It's the smartest option if you ask me. Steam players can be a huge boost to the existing Fallout 76's playerbase
---
I feel the same.  I have about a dozen PA’s.  It’s a pain when I hope out of my main long enough for it to recall....then I have to place usually 4-7 PA’s before I finally find the one I need to hope back into.
---
This is a good list.
---
Meats back on the menu boiz!
---
cool, i think i’ll only be on about 4’or 5 hours from now tho, ive got classes
---
Seems about the only thing you're missing is a sweet skin or two anyways.
---
Look at all the people who pay money for skins and pay money for subscriptions salty someone paid money for a gun. Lol
---
I've never seen it only spawn one... that's odd.
---
Well there will be some in Atom shop I guess. At least last year's christmas stuff can be easily added there.
---
Delightfully devilish
---
It isn't ridiculous when some of these bugs hugely affect gameplay and have been in for 6+ months at this point.
---
yes, max out sneak now and then when you’re build is solid you can bring it back down to 2 or even 1.
---
also, Escape Artist is fun and “feels” real.
---
What exactly are you "winning"? 
---
Does my stash somehow allow me to defeat you in any way?
---
Yep that's fine, I'll be on until about 6hrs time so whenever's good with you
---
Wish the events started today.
---
&gt; **apparently** is fixed
---
Remember the machine gun sound effect...believe it when you see it.
---
Well, to an extent. They don't count as points for using additional perks (I wish they did)
---
It may seem silly but it means they can charge double in the atom shop if they ever add the ultracite variants
---
lol 🤣😂👌
---
That’s true, I guess I’m just hopeful because it’s been around for so long
---
Rule 34 incoming.
---
I think you read that wrong
---
THIS IS GRAFTON’S MAYOR
---
Good idea. Just like in Fo3 and NV depending on your actions.
---
Have they even acknowledged it as a problem?
---
Does artillery auto fire or only when a grenade is thrown?
---
Was the multiple spawns a later addition?  I don't tend to mess with it unless someone else has started the even, I hate tending to those stupid cows.  In the last few weeks I have only run it once and did get 2.
---
using xbow since launch
---
Sometimes, at least double, but it depends on how the file structure was designed and what's being updated.
---
I haven't looked too closely, but most programs have one big file (usually the executable), and a ton of smaller bits and pieces.  If you're updating the big file, the system will download the patch, make a copy of the big file, update it, then remove the old file and replace it with the new patched one.  So, 2 copies of the big file + the patch all at once.  That can add up fast.
---
The alternative is download the patch, and apply it directly to the file, and pray that nothing goes wrong.  If it does, the game file is corrupt and you get to start from scratch, downloading everything.  So it's a bit of a safety feature.
---
You could potentially bypass that by removing the whole game and downloading it as a unit, but you'll still need space for the download and the game files.  And that's a royal pain.
---
If you had the ability (and I don't know PS enough to comment), you could make sure any download and cache/swap files are on the HDD so that the smaller drive isn't storing all the parts while that's going on, but I have no idea if that's even an option on PS.
---
Only when a Grenade is thrown.
---
I think this belongs here but I can’t log in. It says I don’t have the proper entitlements or something like that
---
This dev team either doesn't understand or gives zero shits about lore and immersion.
---
i purchase better weapons for robbery purposes.
---
I’ve got a handful of now-god rolls now that that’s been fixed :)
---
Biggest problem I face in this game... Whitespring ghouls are NOTORIOUS for disappearing.
---
? i was always able to throw artillery grenades and after 10 sec the place would rain fire
---
Yaaaasssssssss
---
They admitted it.

It should go until January 6th to celebrate Little Christmas/Epiphany (aka 3 Wise Men Day). Might as well go all in on the gift-giving.
---
And it will be F2P by the end of next year.
---
Thought so, thx
---
Please have a Sentry Bot named The Crushinator
---
I'm on xbox and happy to help out. I have tons of stims and way too much ammo. I'd love to get them out of my stash.
---
You mean like the insult bot and sweetwater and the scout leaders and Beckham and the warden and the mayor of grafton and chloe and Mr bandit and ms annie and modus and zax and the robot couple that argues in the ash heap that I cant remember their names and jes-2r and a few others I'm sure I forgot.  The game has a ton of unique robots is what I'm getting at lol
---
Many of the pegboard tool holders have either a box of screws or box of gears on the little shelf.
---
For some people the grenades were glitched so they couldn't grab them. Prepare for more Artillery.
---
I have a Quad FFR 250 DRWR that just became my new bestie!
---
Np
---
Your right, that doesn't make sense either and shouldn't be in the game. Especially when vertibirds exist and we can he using those for more immersive fast travel instead.
---
Lol neither do than fans it appears. I remember when Bethesda put a bit of effort in to the lore, world building and immersion.
---
I am with you on this 100% and the people downvoting you suck.
---
Because the gane is in maintainance mode right now.
---
If only they would add sight mods or explosive bolts - go a little Tomb Raider with it 😁
---
depends on application.
---
PvP- Handmade hands down
---
PvE- Instigation Lever can one-shot glowing ghouls, 2 shots for something like a Gulper or Deathclaw
---
In general, no. X-Cell is an exception to this, but most of the time, you can only have effects from a single consumable in each group. So you could have a food effect, an alcohol effect, a chem effect, a Nuka effect, a bobblehead effect, a magazine effect, and an X-Cell effect (Med-X gets lumped in with chems, does it not?) all going at once. But if you have Psychobuff active and you pop a Psychotats, the Psychobuff effects will wear off immediately and you'll only have the Psychotats boost.
---
Additionally, only a single Stimpak, a single Rad-Away, and a single Rad-X can be in effect at once. Radshield will stack with Rad-X or Rad-X Diluted.
---
All 3 locations can have two Sheepsquatches at the end, it highly depends on how many people attend the event.
---
Sugar Grove seems to be about the best. That's where I got all of mine when I was short and it worked well.
---
No, it was always the way that one was. It's the hardest one, so it got 2 spawns.
---
When is it coming out of maintenance? It’s not at 10:00? I’ve never been this on time to an update so I’m not familiar with what’s happening.
---
Boo hoo ppl pay money for stuff. Use some vagisil your pussy is stinking leaking salt
---
I'd rather they argued their case to be honest, but I'm used to the downvotes here if you offer any criticism.
---
i cant wait to jump in and use it, it was also my go-to bounty hunting weapon
---
Paid 5$ for 30 mins with your moms butthole
---
Will definently try this when I get home haha!
---
They won't know what hit them.
---
I haven't seen her *yet*
---
Yeah it was listed right next to your sisters virginity for 3$
---
I like the chainsaw too - especially when I have on the clown outfit.  But maxed at L20, it doesn't do enough damage fast enough.... so it was a short lived novelty weapon
---
oh dear
---
I thought of this too! One of my greatest joys of past Fallouts was to save the game, kill the NPCs, loot them, etc...basically be a bad ass MFer, then reload the save point and be a helpful hero. I guess I'll set my temperament to "selective." Wise crackin' or rude NPCs better watch their tone or I'll bust out some Butcher Pete.
---
Forceful stock has exactly the same vats cost but much higher durability. Also quick or swift mags are the best for VATS cost reduction. With the right mods you can get your handmade AP cost as low as 6-7 per shot:

 [https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/DLC04\_HandMadeGun](https://nukacrypt.com/database/weap/DLC04_HandMadeGun)
---
Handmade is good but gets kind of boring when everyone is using it. My rifleman character is carrying lever/pipe revolver/combat rifles/fixer, all .45ACP and good for all occasions.
---
They probably meant assault rifle.
---
Same thing happened to me I spent $100 on an instigating boxing glove and they sent me an actual boxing glove in the mail. I used it to punch myself in the junk for being such a fool.
---
It did zero damage in game, but works as intended irl
---
What level is it, where are you shooting the enemy, what other effects does it have?
---
Well that's proper pay to win
---
This is a troll right?
---
Oh look how clever you are! bet you wipe your own ass too huh?
---
I mean that human livers are just as bad as eating human brains. Stick to the other bits, those are fine to eat.
---
PC still bot available
---
Pretty sure she was, so that’d definitely be a cool option. We already got Mechanist, why not AntAgonizer
---
It’s so sad I’ve stopped using it entirely now - just use Excavator instead.  The Vault raids was the most disappointing update ever - and the only good thing from them ie. Strangler PA isn’t even usable.  What’s the point?!
---
PS4: Mine's just finished downloading and maintenance is still ongoing
---
I buy rare outfits and also look for fun weapons.
---
Maybe. Shouldn't break that fast unless it's a 2 shot though, assault rifles have a decent durability bar.
---
I picked up a BFFR +250 gat plasma from a player vendor just last week, thinking I could use it for trade. Now with this fixed I might have to start using it.
---
It's not an option indeed. All you can do is select where you want to download the whole pack. 
---
Tell me if this could work pls. Move the game to external hdd,download patch,move it back to ssd. Would this work?
---
I’m getting that eerie feeling you are speaking from personal experience...
---
rofl
---
This is amazing information and I'm glad I stumbled across someone talking about it last week. But now I kind of want to switch my mag back to something else to use at least a little AP so I don't start to rely on unlimited vats as a crutch too much.
---
If it's like fallout 4.....and you're not locked into convo......just walk away pop some tats and go and talk again no?
---
From your lips to Bethesda's ears...
---
Best guns and armor are on eBay, thats why all you find is garbage at in game vendors, this stuff is too good to sell for mere Caps and chances of finding gear like that yourself is too time consuming for some.
---
First aid and born survivor are useless for bloodied builds
---
Two day ago I scripted a Gatling Gun with this. :(
---
To calculate VATS AP cost for each of your guns use these links:

---
Just choose different mods and note the difference in AP cost.
---
That was never said. Wrong
---
i just hope the improvement of performance can be noticed on ps4 (non-pro)
---
If I was a heavy gun user, this definitely would change things... Pity I scripped that Bloodied Missile Launcher with DRWR!
---
thank you!
---
give your new camp a name
---
I have an auto Vampire Railway Rifle with FFR that’s been sitting in my stash for months I might have to take it out for a spin now.
---
I use the lever but only to silently kill enemies. Handmade is for when I need damage per second. But mostly I use a harpoon gun to just tank out all normal enemies.
---
Im saying it, therefore it has been said. Wrong
---
I mean look how many fishies he caught
---
caps I can rationalize by Modus saying he would pay us in whatever passed for currency, that being said they shouldn't be in pre-war supply drops. Event rewards after the splash screen sure! In the a supply drop... nope.
---
It would really help the grind, I know they said the were reworking event rewards and to be fair I have seen some, but in truth I think an overhaul is more in order.
---
Well yeah. All the game content is directed towards them. Mutations, Bloody, Nerd Rage, all the +3 stat armor... 
---
.
---
In the name of balance, you need to give options to the other people that can compete.
---
It's very annoying. I've had to delete games to get 76 to update and knowing I can install the games again after the update is done with no issues infuriates me lol
---
I can just loads of people hauling out random weapons that have been gathering dust for months.. Should be interesting.
---
Last week I did find a quad pump action shotgun with aiming damage and 250 dr.. 🤔
---
My thoughts exactly. I've never encountered a game that shut down it's holiday event before New Year's Day. But that's the kind of half-assed thinking we've come to expect from Bethesda these days.
---
there's a giant dildo wit bethesda's logo on it when you buy you can watch your character take it from both ends like you do for beth IRL
---
I agree.  With a bloodied build a drink of water might fully heal you so no point in any more healing than a normal stimpack.
---
Drop those and max out class freak at least.
---
Ty so much for your reply and for all your hard work making FO76 better! Wastelanders sounds to be a great one!
---
ur my friend already, we can go together
---
I'll see what I can do
---
Unyeilding would be way to op
---
I have everything I need, tbh I don't even know why I play anymore
---
Bone apple *tea*
---
... I'm actually okay with this.
---
Thank you!!!
---
You and me both
---
Breach and clear event is bugged. None of the containers have Ore in them.
---
use the ripper
---
RIP
---
Drop born survivor and first aid....this frees up 4 points.  You could put those into class freak and gun fu as better options.
---
Coming back to life doesn't even make sense
---
I love you.
---
Patience, Iago. Patience.

That house has a Event spawn point at it and the non-exploded Nuke is one of the events so i dont think that is it.
---
Same, even very much needed criticism
---
I heard Jafars voice right there.
---
The only item that anyone of us can say is added to the atomic shop today for now is the Santatron that is free for everyone until December 31 as mentioned in the patch notes for update 16. Someone will post what is in the atomic shop once server maintenance is over with.
---
I don't know, usually moving an application isn't as simple as copying the files over (since there are reference links to other files in the code usually).  Simply copying the files to a new location may break the game.
---
You can try it, but you might end up having to start over.  You wouldn't lose your characters, but you'd probably have to re-download everything if it didn't work.
---
If you can download the patch to the HDD, that would help a little (assuming you can apply the patch from there, which seems like it should work), but you will still be dependent on the file system as to where the temporary files end up.
---
If there's a good solution to this, I'm hoping someone else will chime in and give you a hand.  I'm working mostly off speculation here (though somewhat educated speculation).
---
And still no fix for turrets blowing up your camp or each other.
---
Wastelanders pushed to q3 2020 so we could design a whole new Christmas-themed enemy just to keep make this guy happy
---
Some fans do. I do, other fans I hang around do. Just know you are not alone!
---
I’d recommend having two ranked up perk cards for gunsmith, one fully ranked one and one that’s two just to give a bit of weapon condition. Swap out nerd rage when I’m camp to work on guns, then the lower ranked one when out in the field. 
---
As noted first aid and born survivor are pointless when bloodied. Use the born survivor points to boost action boy/girl and move the other intelligence points to luck (take Vats/crits perks) or strength where blocker is a massively underrated bloodied perk (less damage from melee mobs). Also radicool in endurance is a really sweet perk. My bloodied commando has a bloodied power fiat as a backup and with radicool and unyielding armor canine shot most stuff without being remotely specked for strength. Other than that your build is fine and bloodied commandos are huge fun.
---
Yeah i messed up the white transparency on the square for the 14th, that unfortunately washed out the colors.
---
acid + cloth (+ chemistry lab)
---
There IS a trick you can do with that curved one...
---
If you line up weapon display cork boards with the shelves in it, then rug-glitch the cabinet into place, you can make it look like a display case. The cork of the displays does stick out from the sides tho, I covered it up with those cool pink plant boxes, but you can still kinda see the cork sticking out. Used to have two set up at camp to display my sword collection
---
You can also attach weapon displays to the grocery store looking ones, and place some smaller camp items like plushies on some of the shelves. I've seen that at camps before and it looks good
---
Or just leave it how it is abd let players do this. So much player agency has already been taken away, we need more not less.
---
Wishful thinking on my part honestly. There's a lot of world items I wish were craftable. Like the fortune teller machines
---
Buying in game stuff is with real money on ebay is kinda frowned upon around here.
---
You probably won't get the response you're looking for.
---
That's ironic, and hilarious considering Fallout is traditionally a single player game. To say they are selling out for trying to move back towards catering for..... you know..... the demographic that made them big......
---
Imagine the poor parent who unwraps their physical copy of the game on Christmas morning, hurriedly begins the installation process, wakes up early on 12/26 to see if the installation is done, goes back to bed because it’s not done, wakes up and sees it’s done, logs in, notices all the Holiday events are over. 
---
Ooooof
---
They already made a new Christmas themed enemy. It just makes no sense.
---
Yeah, no thanks. Too many bloodied builds being OP. I don't wanna lose what little caps I have, lol.
---
Adding an outfit to an existing model =/= making a new enemy
---
Stop breaking my immersion....
---
On a serious note this or a lfg system would be awesome!
---
If you ask me - go Commando instead.  Rifle builds are blah and lacking in power - I don’t enjoy playing the one rifle build I have much at all.
---
The handmade is lacking damage for rifle builds but the lever lacks DPS vs tanks...  you really need both.
---
You can only "stack" chems that have different bonuses. For example you can have one for extra strenght and one for extra perception but not 2 with the same effect. And in case they have multiple effect it still applies that rule and only the last one used would count.
---
Yeah, just checked it out! Great to know Beth hasn’t abandoned it. Let’s hope for the best for Wastelanders. Ty, bud
---
OK so someone just pointed out Quad wasn't affected but got plenty DRWR that aren't Quads so still 😁
---
Only if fisto is featured!
---
So now side quests have to be in a series?
---
So let’s see how many fingers you have:
---
1. Torn Veil quest line
---
2. Mayor for a Day
---
3. Board of Tourism
---
4. Lost Child
---
5. Tracking Unknowns
---
6. Wasted on Nukashine
---
7. West-Trek
---
8. Lying Lowe quest line
---
9. 6 additional cryptid investigations which are side quests to Lying Lowe
---
10. Overseer’s Personal Logs 
---
That leaves out anything that’s not repeatable or exploration or simply leads to a repeatable. 
---
Nor does it include Easter egg quests like the black site research site.
---
Thank you. You answered my question perfectly and gave an example. Thank you so much
---
I will hear all about this patch driving home rrom work to Juicehead.
---
You cant build an entire game around trying to keep people from exploiting it. You wont create anything.
---
There are so many more fun options that would be better than tp and spoiled meat... super mutant body parts, G.A.S. certificates, blank holotapes, rat poision, garden gnomes...
---
Ps4 they show up already in god mode. Lmao
---
my bloodied explosive handmade with DR  will be a lot more fun to use.
---
Exactly. It's the only game i have that does this. Probably because it's still coded as in 1969.
---
You can stack foods, and some chems. Not bobbleheads or magazines tho.
---
Same, always nice to have some more friends. I'll be on a bit for the holidays. 
---
Add me: MyLittleShadow
---
Good luck
---
 hitting someone
---
Yes, I agree. And the one where you have to kill huge enemies. I have killed the SBQ over 50 times, and it has never completed for me.
---
You had my vote at Rad-X arrows. I want a Rad-X syringer now too.
---
Idk being able to pull 30k out of my “bank” seems really handy
---
Glowing blood packs and rad shields will stack. Rad x probably.
---
I typed it just like Jonathan Freeman does.
---
To the garbage can in zenimax
---
and straight to the atom shop.
---
or just, you know, global text chat like every other multiplayer game has.
---
would be nice for deaf/mute people, too.
---
Is it max level?
---
Seriously fucking A
---
Imagine a mad scientist build with an outfit resembling Dr. Brainwash.
---
I've never seen two outside of the Mire and I've done Free Range quite a number of times but I suppose it could be.
---
Yeah I don't have any others that do it either. I really like this game but sometimes I feel like Bethesda doesn't want me playing
---
Sometimes is a bit of an understatement, I'd estimate it at about 1/4 for me.
---
You are correct.  Christmas NW stuff is next week.  This week is just the Halloween redux.
---
Since the beginning of the game people have been asking for the flare gun to do this.
---
Yeah man great, you are directly responsible for supporting a game and a company that fucks over gamers. Remember that when you get fucked over next time.
---
No weapon skins?
---
There are immersive ways to do this.
---
My suggestion was to make the new enemy a  santa bot, you know something that might actually exist in the fallout world.
---
Meh.  Thanks for posting it, though!
---
Thank u
---
Oh! You're right. I forgot, you can stack one food of each different bonus.
---
It would finally see use
---
😂🤣
---
*Reads first section of post*
---
Oh, a free camp item called the Santatron. Sounds cool! 
---
*keeps reading*
---
"Can't be active the same time as the Collectron"
---
And there's that classic BGS catch...
---
guess my 5k atoms are safe from being spent
---
I guess don't die and don't rush in. Lol
---
I’d finally want to be wanted for once, that would be so much fun
---
Isn't the perk system kinda arbitrary as it is though?
---
Meh
---
Survive my friend. Survive.
---
Yeah, my Quad Tesla with DRWR never lost capacity upon a reload, so I can confirm that.
---
Don't worry i'll try and maybe report just as information. Console are at keast versatile on this. You can move the whole game wherever you want(without save files).
---
play some NW, starting tomorrow
---
The first time I was about to max caps, started overbiding to make a set, then pursued mutation plans, I almost never buy anithing from vendor bot that i wouldnt find cheaper in the worl or player vendor, when I reached for the first time 100k, started buying good weapons even if i didnt like them, just to trade them later for something that i do want, I have now 4 diferent full matching sets, a few legacys, a mule full of weapons, other mule for only armor, and other for full aid/ammo/scrap.
---
Bloodied trade requests might look a bit different now!
---
you can stack multiple food with different effects.
---
Well this makes a lot of sense due to the Christmas event is next Tuesday. Which would have a shop update I assume.
---
Cait's Corset will be a release, it was shown recently as a possible atomic shop item!
---
Bushes, be the bush.
---
Here's another tip.  When Campfire Tales launches, make sure you join it.  if you get the ending with the 3 waves of bugs, you will get multiples of every insect part you need for the Stings and Things daily.    Store them away in your stash box and then take out as needed to make the daily Stings and Things a breeze.
---
Not only Hello Crossbow, but let me add Hello The Dragon.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8t1f6/atx_update_patch_16/ here it is.
---
Serious question... what are you spending caps on?? I have too many
---
People will buy backback mod plans for quite a bit of caps if that is up your alley.
---
Bloodied builds are at a disadvantage man with the damage cap and low health.  It's fun if you want a challenge and everyone dies no matter your build or skill.
---
Or maybe we'll get eaten by some Gourmand NPCs...
---
These are some of my points:
---
**- Tenderizer:** this perk card is bugged at the moment. Does nothing, so you are waisting 3 points for a useless perk card
---
**- First Aid:** Why did you choose this perk card? I mean, the point of a Bloodied build is running around with &lt;20% health 99% of the time. That's how you get the highest DPS and all the benefits from a Bloodied build (like Nerd Rage or Unyielding armor). A simple diluted stimpak restores 20% of your health. That extra 45% healing is useless for a Bloodied build
---
**- Born Survivor:** This is the same as First Aid. Your main goal with a Bloodied build is being at &lt;20% health. This perk is useless (again) for a Bloodied build
---
\- With all that being said, those are 7 points that you can use in other perk cards and get something more useful, like Bandolier level 2 (for me a must have) or Concentrated Fire level 3
---
\- If I can give one piece of advice, this is the build I would use: [https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f228f9&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2p02s01a04a30ar1an2a12ao0l71lt2la2ir2ic4c70sg2l10ek1&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=](https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=5f228f9&amp;d=pg2ph2pi2pp2p02s01a04a30ar1an2a12ao0l71lt2la2ir2ic4c70sg2l10ek1&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=)
---
I love Quad Tesla but the reload is sooo slow so good to see it put to good use.
---
Hell yes!
---
From one of the earliest datamines it showed every companion's outfit in the game's files, but it was the atomic shop datamine.
---
Oh, god, my negative charisma junkies build is going to have a really bad time... I can't wait!
---
Wow, that’s awesome, they are worth a lot! :D
---
Enclave eyepatch!...and we're prolly not gonna get it yet just like all the other datamined Enclave stuff in the past...sigh.
---
Is there going to be a list of these released, I'd hate to get thru all the Impossumable badges only to find out they were made easy mode...?
---
All good gear isn't in game any longer, it's being turned into real $$$ elsewhere. P2W exists, just because BGS can't get away with P2W doesn't mean others are not providing that service for players who want top shelf gear.
---
Plans, junk, weapons to use, cheap fusion cores, etc. Found a 1 hit wonder for 1.5K, bought it. 
---
The most caps I've had at one time is 9.5K. Dropped 5K for an X-01 jetpack plan
---
Ya. I occasionally give them to friends that have been looking for X weapon.
---
Someone did it before me, a link at the bottom
---
If you have ever have space for 1 I'd love to run the vault raids with experienced players one day
---
[https://i.imgur.com/3FViFjn.png](https://i.imgur.com/3FViFjn.png) I need that outfit right now!
---
Sorry, what's the bug?
---
Someone I met yesterday was in PA and got one shot by a bloodied handmade every time he initiated pvp...
---
Hahaha that's actually a funny/cool idea
---
Yeah, just a load of tacky shit.
---
I wouldn't respec my character, given i'm a rifle build. I would however try to to find the most over powered legendary variant of it I could get to use as a fun side-arm.
---
If only there was an auto aiming mechanic present in Fallout 76
---
After many tests it turns out that it is the calibrated shocks that are not working on any of my armors, ticket has been submitted. Just have to wait till next summer for a fix.
---
You'd think that if they could make eyepatches a thing, they could figure out sweatbands.
---
Won't be spending atoms on that crap
---
Handmade for commando, and for rifle BE gauss, I love the feeling of charging a powerfull shot to the max. 2k of gamage to queen whitout chems, only mutations and perks
---
It’s a good thing to share your fortune with others, they must appreciate that for sure! :D
---
Yeah that would be really cool to see the Syringer get some love, could be a really fun support weapon too!
---
Everyone realizes that this is just a really bad troll, right?
---
I LOVE YOU BETHESDAAAA!!!
---
Looks great! Thanks team :)
---
Not really. If I could chose perk cards based on unyeilding bonuses I would be able to chose 30+ perception, luck and agility cards, I'd have pretty much every card in those slots. Would be a bit op to me
---
The bug was that the 250 DRWR would cancel many legendary effects (although you could kind of get round it by crouching, it was a pain in the a**)
---
Doorways are magical and amongst a few other choice camp tricks they can float.  Swap to doorway, delete foundation, swap back to whatever wall type you want.
---
Unyielding would be infinitely OP and all special-influencing mutations and class freak would be ultramandatory
---
I mean, even having every card equipped at the same time, it still wouldn't make you OP I don't think. I think the whole limited perk system is tedious and cumbersome.
---
hide in a shrub like the rest of us :)
---
Got it a few times in the savage divide and twice in the forest so far. The mire one usually has the most attendees hands why you usually see two there.
---
I always do free range when it pops up, the plans can be sold quite fast.
---
Damage Reduction While Reloading
---
Caravan outfit is sick tbh, but that's it.
---
What version does this show up on PS4? :)
---
No they should do one with care paper and abit of carla thrown in mmmm yummy
---
He means the live shop, not the datamined stuff
---
Seems like a golden handmade in all that gold pack
---
It was part of the Halloween event, you will need to earn 14,000 overseers exp to unlock. Lucky for you, with this new patch they are returning the Halloween nuclear winter rewards with the “Nightmare before Christmas” event through nuclear-winter. It will be starting tomorrow and running through the 16th. I would play during the double exp event they are having during the 12-16th and you should tack up the overseer points quickly.
---
Tips- hide in bushes. I like to start on edge of fire line and work my way to the circle. Nobody at my back means I don’t have to worry about what’s behind me. You get a lot of EXP just for survival time. Also stealth AI kills help (keep that crossbow handy), player revives if your team mates go down, and of course, downing other players or killing them. But survival time definitely nets the most. Just think of it as a hide and seek, and don’t get sought. You’ll get your glowing skelly suit :)
---
As a new player, what on earth is DRWR and how does this affect the meta? I just hit 60 today and am just starting to figure out my build
---
Toy cars and trucks have screws. There are a few of these in a booth at the Tyler County Fairgrounds.  There is also a full Gettyup Buttercup that consistently spawns in one of the portable toilets (you’ll almost be facing these if you FT to this location)
---
Could they not give us some armor skins? I'm sure it's easier than making half of this stuff and people will actually buy it.
---
Ooh i can roleplay as a Mcpoyle brother with that eyeball eyepatch
---
It would make the game extremely easy. I already can breeze through everything(except for vault raids) and giving me an extra 15+ points per stat would make my build even stronger.
---
All meh beside that scavenger outfit.
---
Unless you are a rich indian tycoon(or teump),than you probably like all that gold stuff
---
We're fixing bugs with some of our existing permanent challenges, like Kill Huge Creatures, and others. We're also removing dailies and weeklies that were difficult or confusing, and replacing them with simpler ones.
---
We are not changing the amounts of Atoms that these challenges award. They are worth the same amount but should be easier to complete.
---
I think the wording on that section of the patch notes needs to be adjusted to be a little clearer. Sorry about that!
---
It does sort of imply that outside of the multicolored Christmas lights, there isn't anything new in the Atomic Shop for Christmas.  For better or worse.
---
Are you on PC?
---
What kind of power armor?
---
How many hp did he have?
---
The handmade could have been ffr sonit could look fast if he is not setup for pvp but unless a hack or cheat was used then he was not one shot.
---
Not saying that's not how it seems but server lag and other things play into it.
---
Max damage for pvp is 110 so unless he was almost dead then other factors would come into play
---
Hell yes! My favorite gun by far from f4. Would love to have a b2525 variant in 76
---
I was the same, but nw is so much fun! But yeah, adventure pvp is trash. You're either all in on it with loadout/perks/chems or you lose.
---
I would buy it.
---
Hard to tell if it isn’t the gold Raider one we already have.  Another gold one would likely not sell well at all.
---
Brahmins as companions ?????
---
I did that over the weekend! I thought it was weird that I saw so many but I didn't think anything of it. Nice to know I'm not losing my mind!
---
Same here. I just assumed it was the crazy guy trying to hide the right card.
---
Damage Resistance Whilst Reloading.. Can't say for the meta as not my area of expertise.
---
They do! My only condition is that if they ever get tired of it and don't want it any more I get it back.
---
"What is it, what do you smell?"
---
"... Manflesh"
---
Time spent playing is more valuable than kills, unless you're comfortable with PvP or ij taking down most of the players on the map. If NW's not your thing you can hide until you see the prompt "Final Combatants Remaining" - at that point you get a large Placement bonus in your exp. If you can make it into the top-ten by not being shot you can expect about 400 exp per round (800~ish during a double weekend?), and if you're killed innate initial skirmish you might get 50 to 100exp. It's good to spawn away from buildings or popular spawn points, the mountain in Morgantown or in the ravine in Floods are relatively peaceful in the first thirty seconds. Good luck with the grind!
---
Please, assume the position.
---
Yeah true, Has the update happened yet? (also at work currently)
---
I think anyone that is halfway decent at the game experiences the same thing lol. Once you hit a certain point and get the right weapons and armor, game is ez mode.
---
Releasing an improved version of the same thing already released months later is a bullshit tactic.
---
Good luck with that with a Bow
---
What’s the range again? The entire map?
---
Lol no. There are cosmetics that were datamined at launch and we haven't seen yet.
---
I'm updating remotely right now...half way there
---
It's not back online yet.
---
Also, I've been told this is not the complete ATX list.
---
&gt; I have a mess to clean up.
---
That’s just the effect Fisto has on people.
---
Gamma rays?
---
Not sure what PA bc it had the shadow liberty prime skin. He was at full health the whole time though, and the guy was shooting in one shot burts. He missed a lot of shots, but every time he hit, the guy died instantly.
---
And no, ps4
---
That's the bait. Look closely.
---
Pretty sure that's just Chally the Moo Moo placed in the background.
---
Radius of a blast zone.
---
Servers aren’t up yet and probably won’t be for quite a while unfortunately. I know there’s a free santatron, which apparently collects toys and candy. Seems similar to the junk collectron. I’d guess there probably some Christmas’s stuff like Santa hats or whatever.
---
For the second thing you listed: this seems to always happen if you remove weapons from your inventory. The game “forgets” which weapon was queued up for quick swap and pulls something at random (I haven’t seen any pattern for what it selects).
---
What was improved?
---
I know a few other miners that found a couple more outfits that haven't been shown by gears yet so I don't doubt it, he'll come across them I'm sure
---
They can't do that, cuz it will crash the servers
---
2 days ago, flying into the golf course, I checked the window as always. It was filled with Protectrons. It was the best moment of my entire Fallout career.
---
Why would you care? It’s not like you’re getting it for free if you already bought it so you’ll be buying another copy.
---
BE250 dragon is good. Before this patch you had to sneak whenever you reloaded but not anymore.
---
I'll have to experiment with this when I get back later. The thing about me is, all my armor pieces have WWR, so I almost never stash any weapons I'm not putting up for sale. Maybe you're right here though, I'll have to replicate this.
---
Sugar grove TO the national array TO the national research center TO the police station in the bog and the building across the street (enter through elevator on roof) Desk fans, typewriters, handcuffs.
---
It was never a part of the meta because it was broken for over a year and Bethesda refused to fix it. Now it might be useful on weapons like crossbows, dragons, black powder pistols/rifles etc.
---
Learn from Mr. Nesbitt of Harlow New Town in How Not To Be Seen (if you get the reference :) )
---
You've Been Insulted!
---
I wish I saw this months ago when I was doing the quest
---
They aren't going to give people a free trial of 1st.  Dunno why people keep asking. Everyone would just spend 4 days filling their scrap box full to bursting and one of the main incentives to buy 1st would be gone.
---
they are not the same item. Collect different kind of things
---
The first is a really old bug that has somehow never been fixed.  Its cause is exactly as you say - two of the same weapon type with different Legendary prefixes.  The only real solution is to pick the one you want and stash the other. 🤨
---
Yes in addition to replacing the difficult/confusing dailies and weeklies with simpler more direct Challenges, we're also working on bug fixes for others like Kill tough enemies, collect magazines, etc. 
---
If you find bugs with dailies, weeklies, or longer term challenges in the new year, please continue to report them to us and we'll investigate for fixes. Thank you!
---
Welcome to MTXs, and the answer is no. If you paid for that bundle when it was available and it is free now you won’t be reimbursed. That’s like asking for your subscription back from an MMORPG after it goes free to play.
---
Get rid of born survivor and first aid. Max class freak. Consider mister sandman/four leaf clover and maxing bandolier and travelling pharmacy.
---
I personally believe it should be a month long event.
---
I'm not sure of the logistics or how the servers would cope but December is a busy month, and 2 weeks may be insufficient for folks.
---
If they said "due to recent popularity of these events, we've decided to increase the length of the events by a week".
---
I think that would also be okay.
---
Thanks For Being Truthful
---
There are 2 spots I use when I need screws and need them fast.
---
Sugar Grove, and the second floor of the newspaper at Abandoned Bog Town.
---
Bog town is a quick easy farm.  Sugar Grove takes a bit longer as its a larger place, and tougher enemies.
---
The thing that gets me is that - okay, maybe there's a "proper" fix that is complicated - but in the interim, why not just ditch the cloud effect and, I don't know, use the green "poisoned" effect on the Queen instead?
---
Hide in bushes or get aquaboy/girl and hide under water. Survival time gives lots of xp.
---
I got 2 decent shots out of ten. 20% Return isn’t bad for a first time out. https://twitter.com/elmalvado/status/1204190205621735425
---
But they probably won't add That Gun.
---
But maybe they'll add the Deliverer.
---
Not sure about all of your acronyms but I thought as much!
---
It's not. I have the scabber gold and it's not just gold. There is a skull on the drum mag that this one doesn't have and other little details. This one is just plain gold like it was datamined ages ago.
---
I agree that another type of gold can only reach a very few people.
---
If you read CURRENT news and not news that are half a year old, you would know that its pushed into 2020 with the wastelanders update ...
---
What do you mean you've never heard of the Great Appalachian Santa Claus Convention?  It happens every year in Watoga.  Gotta get those shoppers in somehow! 😁
---
Thanks, Looking forward to this! Could you include where the enemies and presents will spawn as well?
---
Bobby pins you fools! No weight, you can buy them at every vender. They have an actual use and you can sell them at the venders. How has no one caught onto this???
---
Yeah
---
Yeah, that one is a must!
---
But sad ;(
---
Should add that hitting max cap means buying a serum recipe for me. I'm sitting on 9 right now. I sell them for a loss but it's been working great for me.
---
&gt; There appears to be a bug with the weapon wheel. If you have two weapons in your inventory that are same model, but different legendary prefix, your weapon wheel will occasionally favorite both weapons. This issue amplifies if you have more. So there's a likely hood you wont draw the correct weapon in this case.
---
There's a related bug as well; if you have two of the same type of legendary weapons on the wheel it will often "unfavorite" one of them when you log in. I have a Bloodied 50cal and a TSE 50cal, and half the time I log in the bloodied version gets dropped off the wheel.
---
One of the legendary effects "250 damage resistance while reloading" was broken. It didn't work and actually broke other legendary effects.
---
But now it seems they fixed it..... after a whole year.
---
Haven't played since Holloween. After that fiasco I decided I've had enough.
---
Now every time I read of bug fixes, I translate that to mean new bugs coming
---
I think your upload got messed up. Here's the whole shebang:  [https://imgur.com/a/2yDIFig](https://imgur.com/a/2yDIFig)
---
this, i would have already gotten the whole PA set...
---
I’d like that but it seems like something Bethesda is set against doing. With what I suggested, maybe with a flare gun like someone else suggested, it would be immersive.

Like a lot of people are saying, there are merits for having both (as I do).  My TSE Handmade is great for crowd control, but my TS - Limb Damage - 25%VATS Lever is great for tougher enemies (damaging an enemy’s leg so they only limp at you is an under-appreciated tactic).   Personally, if I didn’t have both those weapons, I’d probably be a completely different build.  Final note: I got lucky with the Purveyor, and have an Instigating Fixer as my third rifle; it’s great for 1-shot kills on low-level enemies, where I appreciate a much better fire rate &amp; ammo capacity compared to the Lever...

Only $98, for today only!

Add me too. I'm introverted as well but enjoy playing with others with or without a mic. I was gonna make a thread asking for some people to play with but you beat me to it. C0de-Alphic is my psn. If anyone else is looking for buds to play with your free to add me as well
---
&gt; and replacing them with simpler ones.
---
Can you guys try to put some actual creative thought into the new ones? Drinking a nuka cherry or 10 different types of alcohol doesn't add anything to the game experience. 
---
There's a lot of scope for challenges that make the game more enjoyable, particularly in regards to making players explore areas that they otherwise have no reason to visit. For us end game people, we get stuck in pretty repetitive gameplay loops with a select few locations we visit, so forcing us to re-explore other locations helps us break out of those loops and makes the game more interesting. And also, challenges that require server hopping, like "kill a cave cricket at a uncanny caverns" doesn't count. Please kill those challenges too.

You just barely survived an encounter with a nest of deathclaws... surprise, the Legion is here to finish you off. You want to fast travel somewhere to finish off a quest... guess who's there to greet you! Getting destroyed by some cazadores... you are wanted for crimes against the Legion.
---
Those goon squads were so annoying. If they had been a little less regular and would actually take you by surprise instead of just being a frustration when you're trying to get on with the game, it could have been fun.
---
I've had some bizarre turret issues too. CAMP and Workshop turrets will shoot the building or each other. If they were shooting an indestructible fixture like a workbench, it'd be too noisy to live around. Rebuilding them or storing them doesn't fix it either. 
---
Now if only I could get my walls to move without making the floor "inaccessible" I'd be all set.
---
Hey everyone, Gears had some issues with that album and is gonna fix it when he gets back from class, but not all the images uploaded. 
---
That said, I have some not so  "Ready to go" images from the texture files that we compiled this morning:  [https://imgur.com/a/qBr9QOs](https://imgur.com/a/qBr9QOs)
---
Anyone have any three star protest signs?
---
Is there really not that much atomic shop christmas stuff?
---
Anyone happen to know optimal combinartion of aids for melee damage? Thanks.
---
I too am a fellow introvert! I understand completely feel free to shoot me a request sometimes it's cool to have the company. I'm not a fan of being on mic unless I have to most times. PSN: JerseysGhost
---
Haha, I don’t use my mic but every once in a while I hear someone else and it startles the shit out of me.
---
I farm the queen daily, I wouldn't mind backing you up! PSN is my name just lmk you're the one that wanted to launch a nuke :D
---
How do you get handmades to 0 vats?
---
scRIP
---
Are legendary protest signs a thing? I have never seen one.
---
Sounds epic. Added you
---
I used to use an instigating weapon alot, and I noticed I didn't need to repair it as often either.
---
I kinda just assumed that since the first hit tended to 1-hit-ko most enemies.... I was simply using the weapon less often, so it broke less often.
---
Like to kill 100 mobs with instigating might take 100 hits, but would take 200 hits with any non-instsgating legendary (unless a very powerful legendary).
---
Yeah, I know the bug you're talking about actually. I feel that is interconnected with what's happening with the wheel overall in relation to same weapon models. So if they fix that, hopefully that fixes your described issue. 
---
 Please notice us, Bethesda!
---
See my update below. There's a bunch.
---
Your situational awareness is shit and you got what you deserve.
---
That Responders Excavator!
---
For how many years did people claim ESO would go f2p "anytime now"?
---
Yeah, that's a must buy for me too. That and the eye patch.
---
Haha i literally just commented the same thing elsewhere. 
---
Gonna get me a dressing gown and live off brahmin mik.
---
YOU WILL CALL HER.
---
I found a note in the game that says "I miss you, Dad", just an in-game note. It made me miss my own father :( It's the only note I carry around in the wasteland.
---
Is suspension-of-disbelief just dead these days?
---
I haven’t done 94 yet either. Added you 👍
---
What if my santatron finds an orphan collectron? I hope he cram it into my stash as well.
---
Confirmed dupe method
---
/u/Gearsthecool, feel free to update with this.
---
Quote me in a year
---
I can't feel my legs!!
---
RYAN! STAB SOMEBODY!
---
right?
---
Theres a dupe method now on youtube hopefully it get patched, where they crash a server on purpose to dupe
---
Creation engine is the bug
---
"...cold blooded murder... ***hot*** blooded murder..."
---
No it collects different items
---
Free Scav Station is awesome, gets everyone to stop complaining with a novelty item.
---
Nuka cola fridge door muthafuckaaaass
---
I don't believe it will start gathering gifts til the event starts Thursday.
---
nah, you have been seen killing fellow dwellers in pvp mode, nothing for you, regards, Todd :)
---
There's no way Special checks will be affected by buffs and if they are you can just exit out whenever.
---
You can actually get 500c for serums if you crank your charisma up a bit and/or pop some grape mentats.
---
You have my sword.
---
I never thought I'd get excited for a buttercup kiddie ride and mega sloth rug lol
---
Merry Christmas from Bethesda 🎁 (or if you're American Happy Holidays 😉)
---
Thanks man, I just need nuka cola everything in my life. That staircase, I need it.
---
It starts on the 12 and only the ones in Christmas attire will drop loot it seems.
---
Ugh, we're eating good tonight!
---
I agree.  I'm not here for Nuclear Winter.  You're not going to convert me to NW by offering cool rewards there.  I'm only going to play it begrudgingly.
---
The 7K needed to get the VTU rewards was fairly easy for anyone to achieve in a handful of matches.  I'm not going to grind for more than that.
---
yaredikno
---
I like Turtles.
---
It's not Bethesdas fault, this affects every game of this size on PS4
---
I love love love that new outfit
---
Supposed to be scorched dressed in Christmas attire and should hear sleigh bells. Starts Thursday. I assume it is just going to be the human scorched but I'd love to see some scorchbeast with elf and santa hats.
---
Haha....touché!  Easily that often.  I noticed it triggered more often if enemies died too far outside their initial spawn area.  When they’d die I could go back to their spawn area and find them standing upright, motionless and un-lootable.  I got to where I knew exactly where certain ghouls spawned in certain areas of whitespring.   Very problematic in whitespring where Robots tend to draw the attention of ghouls away from their spawn area.
---
I'm hoping that they'll put out a Firebreather pack too. This looks pretty awesome, though
---
I know right! I am so all over that. Also the Responder signs.
---
Just like the first guy said. And supposedly along with them being in Christmas attire they will have a distinct jingle bells sound accompanying them
---
Added!
---
The Dragon Mask would pair well with the Samurai armor set I bet.
---
Wha..what? It took you 3 full days to install the game? Do you play on a cellphone?
---
Done
---
Not sure that's a joke build.  Both of those weapons are very effective.  Think you want a syringer/commie whacker play through. A black powder only playthrough would be kinda cool too.
---
"...(they) need to rethink life"
---
"...losers..."
---
"...they have no idea..."
---
Do the world a favour and get off your high horse. You think you contemplate the rest of human beings from above but you are just glancing from below
---
Also, don't tell me what to complain about. I don't, but if I want I am going to. 
---
You are no one with that power over others. You might want to 'rethink' that.
---
Omg, that better be a working flushing toilet that I can sit on.
---
Why are brains bad to eat? Where can I find more recipes.... er, I mean information?
---
So the free one kind of nullifies the old one. You should be able to see why some people are upset. What the could do is have the free one give you junk and candy from the one collectron but that makes too much sense for them to do.
---
You're telling me you fought a deathclaw with your bare hands???
---
The upright and motionless mobs one, is the next big bug that needs fixing as a priority. IMO.
---
I really like the bunker pants with the responder shirt underneath...really cool
---
Some ppl dont have access to 100Mpbs internet. Remember Americas brodband infrastructure is shit.
---
Awesome!  I have been wanting the Responder signs for ages!!!!!
---
I guess the big question is, besides Morgantown Airport and Grafton - where are some other major spawn locations?
---
Reminds me of Patlabor.
---
For the two people who might remember that franchise.
---
Finally nukagirl cutouts! My piano lounge is complete!!!
---
You're welcome flower
---
Honestly man that shouldnt happen.  I can see 2 or 3 shots depending on HP, cards and armor but that's crazy.  I'm on pc so I dont know if there is cheats for PS4 but I'd guess its server lag on your end the missed shots probably hit you just didnt see it as a hit or something like that.
---
Any benefit for having more than one piece beyond the increase in flare production?
---
Might come yet - there were a few last year so id image they will resell again
---
You don’t even need BE/JE. 
---
I run a low health build and my AA lever action still one shots level 68 super mutants, which are the tankiest enemies I encounter most sessions.
---
It’s a fun way to use the lever action without ever needing to rely on VATS.
---
Love it! Classic GTA style justice 😄
---
If you already own the original , you can select between 2 kind of stuff to collect.  So you can still get junk with the new one active
---
I don't think I have any of those guns anymore. Damn.
---
It collects junk and candy, so its actually better than the paid one.
---
There is only one.
---
You rock man!
---
Yeah... actually even better the bar from the bar set has a sink built into it, just face it backwards and put a mirror over it
---
u/Lizlo1982
---
Tried removing ur other collectatron?
---
Sweet!
---
You cant have both collectrons, one at a time
---
Why would I not be allowed to have both? Makes no sense
---
That’s ridiculous.
---
It says in the patch notes that only one can be active at a time
---
Yeah I guess it wouldn’t be a true Bethesda update if they didn’t fuck something up. We’ll have to wait until they fix it, see you in 2020!
---
I’m on pc.  My camp is right between Whitespring Station and Blackwater Mine.
---
I haven’t read them yet, thanks. BUT WHY..
---
This what you were after: https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8trpf/atom_stop_update_december_10th_for_those_at_work/
---
Looks like some New Years attire in there.  The wastelander-esque outfits look great!
---
This is basically what survival mode was...
---
Ah thanks for this man! Is the damage worth bouncing a camp around?
---
There’s generally a good few outside fort defiance! Also the fairgrounds, wavy Willards, sometimes get them at Harper’s ferry! I’m sure there’s more
---
Dad? Is that you?
---
Players who also own a Scavenger Collectron Station can switch their Santatron to hunt for the items the Scavenger bot normally finds, and vice versa. However, only one type of Collectron Station can be built at any given time.
---
Taken from patch notes
---
can someone filter only items for NW Christmas challenges pls?
---
Yes and No yes for extra damage. No against high lvls
---
Woohoo!!! Coloured lights!
---
No more humming weapons! Love it!
---
It appears you're promoting a discord server or community. This is not allowed and your post has been removed.
---
Because "book of eli" said everyone that eats brains catches that super obscure parasite that gives you the shakes and tears down your nervous system
---
Scarcity is a factor of life my friend. Sometimes u can’t have ur cake and eat it too
---
I understand building a bathroom and roleplaying but what is the point? I have a super cozy home like camp,but never built a bathroom 'cause it would be a room that neither me or everyone else visiting would ever use.
---
I'd like to join the hype if you can explain it.
---
You can one hit a deathclaw with junkies weapon without low hp?
---
**BethesdaGameStudios, Valseek:**
---
*Can you confirm that the bug regarding crafting and the Scrap Box is on your list?*  *That is, crafting will give preference to junk in your Stash over materials in your Scrap Box when pulling materials.*  
---
For example, say I have 250 acid in my Scrap Box, no acid on my person, and three Stingwing Barbs in my Stash for future quests.  Crafting an item requiring acid will auto-scrapand consume the Stingwing Barbs first, even though there is plenty of acid in the Scrap box.  This is a separate issue from the scrap box/vendor bug mentioned in Patch 15.
---
Does it give rads and diseases?
---
I have a similar setup, 2600x and rtx 2060. Look around at the start and make sure you don't see anyone in strangler heart power armor.  If you do either pass on the event or expect the game to freeze. Normally the sbq gives me no performance issue but it's almost guaranteed if someone shows up in that armor and starts landing acid attacks on the queen.  If you see the acid particle effects start looking at the ground and try to get some distance away from the fight, if you can.  Most often the second I see it, I'm screwed.
---
Happened to me today. Locked up and I waited it out, by the time I saw the acid I was already doomed. Once the queen was dead everything unlocked and I was good.  Problem is I didn't even get enough time before it happened to get more than a few hits on her. Got zero rewards or loot from the event.
---
This is real. I watched soo many cave crickets disappear at tangra town and many of em legendaries! Or to have them fall through the map and have to wait for the meat pile to appear after some time. Hurrah for fixes that actually matter
---
Going to grab the "holiday" tree and the lights later. Might grab the vendor as it's not bad at 300 atoms. Finally something to spend my 1st atoms on this month...
---
Aligned mods but use forceful stock for durability. Forceful also gives the vats cost reduction
---
At least people finally have a piece to use in their kitchens and bathrooms
---
Ok
---
that map is showing places to farm flux that can't be nuked.
---
that said, look at that nice cluster of mix colors right on aaronholt farmstead.  it's a great place if you need all colors, especially cobalt and crimson.
---
there are also more plants there than that dot indicates.  it's pretty concentrated.
---
I posted the same thing as it finally occured to me as well.
---
You basically have to nove the game where you space for it+ double its size,update,then nove it back where you want
---
Why is the commie walker even a thing?
---
Big Bend Tunnel is filled with Scorched
---
No
---
Lol every comment here at 0 karma. Dude doesn’t like what he’s hearing
---
It must have 25% less V.A.T.S. as a legendary effect, an aligned barrel and grip, quick magazine, dot reflex sight and automatic barrel. All of those mods reduce V.A.T.S. cost and are additive with the legendary effect, bringing it to 0.
---
It's happened to me twice at scorched earth, but it's been fine for me recently (running a gtx 970). Not sure what causes the insane lag, but I did see one of the other peeps in Strangler Heart PA. Just one of those annoying things. I saw her get staggered in mid air once for a really long time, and after she just flew off the map. That's 3 instances out of a total of 20 or so, which is a bit much, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of rhyme or reason to it.
---
Not to mention he doesn’t even have bloody mess!
---
Gives rads 🤷‍♂️
---
What?
---
I just managed to scrape up 1280 Atoms this weekend, and now 1250 will be gone.
---
That's pretty much it, it's like the Sims....you have players that play for the whole get a job live a life part of it....and then players that spend their whole time just designing and building different houses and mansions
---
Here you have people that toss quick lil camps out barely grouping things together and people that will spend a few hours making sure the couch is angled juuuuuuust right
---
Ugh
---
Uh is that OUR pack Brahmin in the back of that one photo??
---
Actually stingwing barbs are not automatically scrapped for acid. Even when using scrap all or crafting an item w acid when u have none will keep the stingwing barb in ur stash and use acid from scrapbox
---
Now if its a bloatfly gland or bloodbug proboscis itll get automatically scrapped and I can understand that fustration all too well... I stock the stings n things stuff in my stash aswell for ease of access to farm badges (when the quest pops) and if I dont forget to transfer the stash stuff to my mule before crafting boom my hard earned bug parts become acid instantly 😭😭😭
---
Cool thank you for your response
---
It's about time there were some new lines.
---
Got bored with them.👍
---
Yes! That Caravan outfit is sick!
---
got private server too
---
*Hajime Sorayama has entered the chat.*
---
I got it in the bundle, did they ever have it separate? I know some folks that want it pretty bad
---
Thanks I was hoping it would start right away, but we will have to have a littlepatience 😉🎁🎅🌲☃️
---
i was hoping for some more mods, yeah...
---
Bring back the regulators!
---
I can't really tell from the image, but how long will the antler head wear be available? It's not just 2 days like last year is it?
---
look in your stash, i found them there
---
Does anyone know if the "wrapped trap loot bag" is actually a trap? And if so, what does it do? Explode when someone tries to get it?
---
More steel and lead to use 😉👍☃️🌲🎅🎁
---
Can't you just find those plans?
---
Furious in my opinion is better as you get the increasing damage effect, instigating is only good for the first hit. However fast firing weapons are much better for having the furious effect.
---
I have a level action with executioners effect which is quite good (imo)
---
Instigating for lever, furious for handmade. Instigating works best on slower big hit items, as it only applies to your first shot. Furious works better on rapid fire weapons and enemies that take a number of hits to kill.
---
I totally get it dude 
---
I'm actually so proud of us for not getting at each others throats like so many of these exchanges do haha. 
---
It's like a fiasco action, like staring at the aftermath of a car crash on the highway.
---
I'm in much the same boat, except I still like the game even though ots buggy and dumb and boring sometimes haha.
---
What about if you had tech data pre change in ur stash it continually spawns tech data in ur inventory that is usable to complete the quest? I have like 3k tech data I cant do that quest enough it keeps coming. Give it to my alts to do that quest and they still arnt disappearing
---
Kill anyone who gives you lip
---
Instigating is great for a stealth rifle build. Add covert pops and rifleman perks and you can one-shot lots of enemies.
---
6 days
---
I think there was a toilet in the datamine.
---
Well you are still in the wasteland 🤷‍♂️. But you can drink and collect from it.
---
I destroyed or sold dozens of awesome 250 DR weapons, including instigating lever action. No regrets: if you play regularly, you realise stash space is more precious than good weapons when you already have tons of good weapons.
---
Dont see anyone bringing this up in the top comments on this thread . So many other games have it gud.
---
wait you bought the item and it was only wearable for a short time?
---
So that being said,probably best too go Furious with the handmade,&amp; Instigating wit the Lever...since I often use my Lever as a “sniper’ish rifle”.
---
Also,any estimated price on something like those would be stellar.
---
I’ll make sure I pass your message along to everyone I see, just so they know not to expect to see you around
---
No idea, its possible they may use the same inventory? Maybe? Or just the fact they dont want two robotic npcs walking around camps
---
Great, more P2W by Bethesda, now people don't even need to LEAVE their houses to get water.
---
Me want 👍
---
Having the same issue! Not figured what’s causing it yet, 4 times I’ve had to un and re-equip!
---
No, I meant you only the had the chance to buy them for 48 hours last time they were available. lol
---
I mean we can't even transform purified water into boiled water so I don't think logic and coherence applies here lol.
---
Beside if we can have a machine converting toxic water into purified one, surely we can have a functional sink nearby?...
---
YUP! It’s reloading! Also resets stats!
---
This... I just got a ps4 pro cuz blackfriday but before I had the og ps4 (traded it in for a pro bundle w cod 😥) the game lagged alot and random freezes were a daily occurance. The original ps4 I believe doesnt have the ram capabilities to run this type of game without issues. 
---
Still love the game but it def made me upgrade my ps4. Its a smooth experience since I switched thou! Just had to fork some 180$ over to do so
---
Good, that's definitely enough to get 500 atoms through challenges.
---
Lets hope that these bugs are actually fixed, lol. Last time I tested if they fixed a bug, they hadn't. The glitch: Collectrons still linger after the owner leaves.
---
Its random too...sometimes im fine..idk why it isnt consistent
---
Actually Americas has better infrastructure than most other countries with only a few actually topping it speedwise. 
---
Countries like Canada and Australia have much worse infrastructure. 
---
Love how misinformed people are.
---
Yeah but it's already December 10th.. Most people like having their Christmas trees up at the very beginning of December. I'm sure they will add one later (fingers crossed) but I can't help but feel like they should have added them already.
---
That’s a cracking Idea I rarely get wanted but the odd times I do I’m waiting around for someone to kill me so this idea of NPC’s going for the wanted people is better than players doing it :p
---
If not fixed quickly, this is gonna be a major headache
---
Good job with paywalling all the Christmas deco.
---
Nothin says Christmas like nickel and diming the playerbase.
---
I bet it will work like the Gauss rifle. You can hold for full damage, or just fire. And it is vats friendly, try it. My instigating Gauss is fun in vats.
---
Facts.
---
Because of Prions
---
instigating is really good for solo farming as most enemies are not that bullet spongy.  Furious will be better for bigger enemies - but you will probably need enemies that  can take 3 or 4 shoots for furious to outperform instigating .
---
Another option  is AA -  good in any situation and especially nice for the lever , since that doesnt have an option for AA magazine.
---
Beth working hard is irrelevant.
---
Just blew 2000+ atom. Got the lights, tree, free santa, fountain, sink, winter vender, and signs.
---
Uh prions are a real thing that can come from eating brains, there are several confirmed types of prion diseases, Mad cow being one of them
---
I use them alot 😭😭 but thats cuz Im use to fonv and fo3 lool hoarded like a mofo in those games. Habits carried over. Now I have a alt account thats a lvl 56 packrat. Recently swapped those perks out on my main for a more pure dps build but the constant inventory management is like a part time job
---
Just as a head's up (as a I don't remember it mentioned in the write up and I'm not at home to check): the T-51b makes a neat "swishing" sound, like skis through snow.
---
NW is alright. There's better battle royales, but it's fine. It's functional.
---
I one hit most things with junkie. it's %50 increase and I'm full health. plus sneak, crits all day and a gun that uses no AP on full auto. not stupid high damage, but plenty for me. if it isn't I can kill a sheepsquatch with one clip from my railway before it can regen
---
Same here lol
---
Hey! Someone already answered. What's YOUR favorite prion disease?
---
There's a clean, non-broken version in the files.
---
I don’t think so, jokey smurf
---
Right?
---
I would play around with the graphics settings. If you notice it happens with certain weapon types at events or the strangler armor. I know a lot of people used to have issues when people used explosive energy weapons. I occasionally have frame rate drops but it's usually only with legacy weapons and acid armor at the queen. I had issues with it the other day but I still didn't crash even with two copies of the game running. There are a lot of aspects of the game that are very poorly optimized.
---
I also lost some dr along with the special legendary..fix the 250+ bug just to break unyielding..wtf lol
---
LOL-   :P 
---
DAMN MILLENNIALs
---
Or if you're like me just traipse around in WWR armour!
---
Oh, interesting. Thanks for clearing that up.
---
So its like the water pump? Neat.
---
I run BE and the damage is still the same I think, honestly, this game!
---
It says this to me when I want to replace/store/scrap the collectron while he's in the station or didn't exit it completely or I think even when he's too close to it. 
---
Tried it when he's further away from it?
---
i think its maby the  Light Bulb Letters Set, if you have that, they increased the Camp budget for these. 
---
Messed up my camp as well
---
false.
---
Wow, would you look at that. another data mine and no skins for the Combat Rifle, LMG, Gatling Gun, or Plasma weapons
---
If you’re typically solo, most enemies will have full health when you attack, and single shot rifles don’t fire fast enough to really take advantage of furious, so definitely instigating. 
---
If the handmade is automatic, then furious has a place for tankier enemies, but 99% of what’s on the map is gonna go down in 1-2 shots with instigating.
---
I buy 40mm grenades, good legendary items with reduced weight and plans. When I want to stop making money (around 15000) I store my junk and ammo vending machines.
---
UPDATE: This is happening to every daily quest for me so far.
---
Wait, seriously? So the Unyielding bonus just disappears when you reload? Is that what you're saying??
---
I meant my dr is getting wacky..if i fire a shot i lose 50 dr...but if i un equip armor and re equip it goes back to normal
---
Still no Nuka Cola fridge, but at least I can wash my hand now.
---
I also have the issue it’s completely takes away all special buffs.
---
This is a ps4 issue. You always need to have more space available where you actually need. It's so stupid.
---
Thank you :)
---
The signs and the Tank Statue look great, cant wait for those
---
I agree dude, I miss survival mode too. I loved being surrounded by violent maniacs! For once I understood why all the npcs in previous fallouts were so paranoid and distrustful of other people.
---
Nice collection!
---
*Canibalism intensifies*
---
It stopped but when i first loaded in it kept negating the unyielding when i reloaded or changed weapons..
---
Those lights are an integral part of my camp lol how else would people going to Camden park know I buy Mr. Fuzzy Tokens?!
---
Screw it. All robots.
---
I want to see an Eye-bot in a thong.
---
I dont know, I still got it. They may have placed it into the christmas emote bundle by mistake tho.
---
I can confirm, it is happening for me too.
---
Yeah, the highest level the Deathclaw island Deathclaw spawn are lv 16! They're pansies!
---
Handmade for walking the Wasteland and tagging enemies, lever for tough events and fights where you need the 1shot 1dead ratio.
---
The Kaiser has marked you for death.
---
Yep, PS4 uses here. Same occasional problem with quick change.
---
In the wasteland a sink can also function as a tub and a toilet, just not both at the same time.
---
time to get a huge ass tank statue for my camp
---
^this! 
---
So have so many varied weapons, plans, outfits, and mods, that are faction specific! Make the legendaries from that pool. 
---
Want a Raider or Leather farm Raider based events or areas. Want Combat armor and a minigun do BOS. Want an awesome handmade hit up Free States.
---
So many more interesting options to do loot pools and incentivize a reason to go to the different areas besides WS and SBQ.
---
I can finally use my LMGs
---
If you read through this would actually make more players want to be wanted. Doing just what you want.
---
I want the nuka-door

So, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this update seems to have broken Unyielding armor.  Every time I reload my gun, the SPECIAL boost I get from Unyielding resets itself.  If I re-equip my armor, I can get it back, but it breaks again the next time I reload.
---
Weapon in question is a Bloodied 10mm Pistol with 10% damage while aiming.
---
Every time you post it’s in regards to cannibalism.  Haha.  So weird.
---
LOL you didn’t kill stray cats as a kid, right?

Just watched episode 1. Legit good

Holy walls of text.

Unless it takes literally all day running through literally nothing then it is in fact hyperbole. And considering I have never spent literally all day running through nothing, you are full of hyperbolic shit.

Using your vacation time to leave work 2 hours early just to download an update, seems a little silly to me. Just download it when you get home. It's not like the game goes anywhere.
---
Not saying that liking FO76 is silly, just the whole wanting to get home early to download an update. Also I have my game set to auto-update, so it'll update while I'm at work and be ready when I get home anyway if I wanted to play.
---
The mechanist is one of them.
---
That sounds about right, instigating on the Lever is definitely the way to go.  I think I have both of these guns on a mule if you are on XB1.  Prices - that's subjective depending on who you ask, I have found prices vary quite dramatically from player to player.
---
So unequipping and reequipping fixes it? Sorry for all the questions, I'm not online to mess with it.
---
FINALLY. also, neat, nuka stuff!
---
I posted these same issues on the [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8rtbn/fallout\_76\_update\_16\_patch\_notes\_december\_10\_2019/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8rtbn/fallout_76_update_16_patch_notes_december_10_2019/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x) from today's update. Still no acknowledgement haha. Ugh.
---
smh
---
Ha I built my base right across the river at a low level.. then swam to the island got the location pop up and moved my base miles away
---
I mean, you're not wrong, but no need to be so harsh about it.
---
Hopefully not as I regularly rely on this when mining lead. I believe this glitch has looked like it was fixed after a patch once before but then reactivated on the next load in so maybe try that by switching servers.
---
Yeah..gotta unequip and re equip armor...breaks when you switch weapons too..wtf
---
I always love these kinds of posts - keep using the camera!
---
Merry Christmas, love Bethesda 🤣😂

Other sub
---
Alright, I'll search every server on PC and XBox and PS4 real quick.
---
Shit lol that was an accident. Thank you.
---
previously you had to be in your armor, exit game, enter game already in the armor to get the bug bonus
---
Oops i mean holiday lights, dont wanna offend someone lol
---
Gift giving!! 😍😍 I'm excited!! 
---
My brother is gonna do the free trial and if he likes it I'm buying him the game for Xmas.
---
Same.  How in the hell is this...  What more could they possibly...  
---
I'm flabbergasted.
---
Ah yes, that makes sense.  In their expedience to fix this long standing bug, they didn't regression test the most basic of functions.
---
About time, guess  I'm saving a vast amount of my atom points still XD
---
Hey! Anyone still looking? I'm only lvl 11 and am struggling figuring out the mechanics of this game. Ill be playing at about 5 pm central time today
---
 My user is patroni123 add me pleasee
---
PC lol. But yeah that's the surprise mechanic here.
---
Do they play them on the pip boy or radios in game?
---
oh okay, my bad
---
It took me 30 seconds to realize this loading in. They do not test anything at all.
---
Hahahahahahahahahaha and we expected them to fix the +250 DR bug.
---
Instead they extended that bug TO EVERYTHING lol.
---
I am on Xbox In fact,so maybe when I get home from work,if it lines up,I could reach out &amp; see what if anything we can make happen.
---
Thanks for the response as well.
---
Thank you for your reports of reloading affecting stat bonuses provided by Unyielding Armor. We are investigating this now, and we will let you know as soon as we have more information to share.

Pretty much, but in the form of a sink. Lol
---
Tyvm
---
Your right
---
  I couldn't remember exactly where on the map Aarenholt farm was located - thought it was farther east.
---
To be fair, there really isn't anything that runs counter to that view. The game is buggy, laggy, glitchy, there's server issues, hit detection issues, animation issues, issues completing quests, etc, etc. I could go on. 1st is trash. Some people like it and that's fine, but it's still an awful subscription. Atom Shop is supported too hard. No it's not P2W, but it does seem to be supported far more than, say, bug fixing.
---
Liking a game is different than the game being good. You can like a bad game, or dislike a good game. If you like 76, kudos. Have fun. But your enjoyment of the game doesn't change the things I mentioned.
---
And yes, before anyone tries to pull this shit, I do own and play 76. Not that it should matter. But yes, I play the game. I think it's terrible from a technical standpoint, but I do enjoy the core gameplay loop. I do not play often, because of the technical issues, but I stick around in the hopes that said technical issues will be fixed. I doubt it though, since the game's first year saw few significant fixes. Plus everyone spending money in the Atom Shop, why would Bethesda fix anything? You're already giving them your money while the game is still broken.
---
Bffr?
---
Yep and a brain has to be infected before you can catch it the movie made it seem like every time you eat a human brain you catch it....its obscure as fuuuck. You and I both could eat human brains the rest of our lives and be perfectly fine
---
Bloodied faster fire rate
---
Are these all up right now or just datamined?
---
How long did it take you to come up with that. Obviously you are a certified idiot. I may be glancing from down below, but I can afford $8.99 a month. I guess you can't. I stand up for the people who play a game that they like. People like you complain about a game that you are not forced to play. Talk about a high horse. You CAN complain and so you will. I guess you CAN also lube up your needle dick with battery acid to jerk off, so go do it. Then come back and we CAN talk about can and should.
---
Is... th-tha-that a Nuka-Cola Secret Door?!?!  I WANT IT!
---
Would you know what one is worth ?
---
Bethesda already replied in the other post about this so hopefully they fix it fast.
---
You're right, but prions are indestructible and simply have to come in contact with a body, that brain better be fresh my guy
---
It's a display bug. Should reappear after a while or after a server hop.
---
Sometimes that works. Sometimes you have no choice but to go with the other option, unless you have the aforementioned save file to reload.
---
Exactly bud! the charge up mechanic would perfectly translate into Bow gameplay, It's a projectile weapon like any of the others after all.
---
Do some research before you say something

What's the thing with the tank and the cables? Looks like a soldering iron.

Locked doors? Not a problem for this guy! *puts power armor through windows*
---
No. You enjoy it. But that doesn't make it great. You can like a bad game. Or dislike a good game. Fallout 76 is a bad game that you enjoy, which is perfectly fine. But it doesn't make the game good.
---
It's called Scorchbeast Specimen Jar.
---
Idk whst platform ur on but on xbox i cant get rid of my fusion cells had 2k in my vendor for 2 weeks before i sold any
---
For some odd reason they aren’t in the purveyor’s loot pool so there’s a lot less of them lately. I know they still drop from legendary enemies in the vaults, but not sure about normal legendary enemies in the wild. That’s why you don’t see them much anymore, along with them being very gimmicky.
---
Please! I will not only be in another state, but in the countryside where they don't have internet!! Please extend the event!
---
The map was created by pulling the plant locations directly from the map file, so yea, it shows the whole map including things that can't be nuked, but it's also a 1:1 representation of all the plants meaning that area is rather low density compared to many other spots.
---
What did they do to break it?
---
First time I encountered that I laughed so hard that I couldn't focus on killing it, so I died.
---
They also deleted one of the existing emotes from the atom store, maybe more but I’m not sure.
---
What’s wrong with unyielding though? I still have my weight bonuses but otherwise haven’t played much since patch.
---
I’m looking for one for my commando pve build. I’m sure people use them for pvp as well tho
---
I’d say Bffr is better for pve as you don’t get any benefit from the higher Dmg in pvp (110 Dmg cap in pvp)
---
If you reload it breaks armor effects.
---
Yeah man great
---
After reloading the bonus vanishes, have to reequip armor
---
You mean reload a gun? Or reload the game?
---
They didn't break it, just don't reload ;)
---
That sounds slightly inconvenient
---
Yeah, same here.  At work now, I'm on the East coast, my GT is the same as you see here, I'll be on around 7:30 - 8pm, send me a message later and I'm sure we can work something out.
---
I did this to start out because I had no viable cards at the time.
---
I've tried exiting armor, back into PA, changing servers, logging off and back on.
---
either im bugged, or it's gone.
---
I also seem to be losing the standard 100+ bonus occasionally for a few seconds, im getting the "you are encumbered" message, and i can see my weight-max going from 340 back up to 440, another great bug i guess
---
But isn't it the same dps per bullet?
---
plan on 100k plus.  A legacy trade, or a full set of unyeilding or vanguards.
---
Bethesda is now investigating this.
---
I paid about 3k caps for a one star instigating lever on PS4, worth every penny. With the exception of really tanky stuff like sheepsquatch and Sierra Bravos it took out almost everything I asked it to in one shot. Arguably one of the best if not best one star weapon in the game.
---
Gotcha, tx

Oh cool, thanks! Like the frog one then?

Why do the Holiday events end before the holidays do, they should last till  New Year's day.  Such a busy time of year my only time to play is the 27th to the 2nd.

Do some growing up before you lynch someone instead of informing them.
---
I don't know if this has changed, but the way it was when I was actively playing before, was that *ANY and ALL* artillery at camps in range will respond to an artillery flare.  This meant if you're lucky, or had friends/clanmates who all built artillery across a planned spread, you could count on fire support.
---
yup there at least twice as expencive now, sry for bad english
---
THE ASSAULT MARINE HELMET HOLY SHIT
---
At least CoD is a functional game. As in, it has less technical issues than 76. Which honestly is probably what he was referring to. When I talk to people that badmouth 76, they're almost always referring to the technical issues, not the gameplay.
---
Yea CoD is the same trash every year, but I'd rather play it than 76. Because on CoD I won't encounter enemies that take no damage, or quests that I can't finish, or get disconnected from the server for no reason, etc.
---
Currently have a offer of a ve and be lazer rifle just making sure I'm getting it's worth
---
That would be cool
---
Its mainly for pvp because pvp dmg is capped at 110
---
true, if you got some more people we can try to nuke  a fissure site

Doesn't seem so for me so I would imagine no.

Is it any faster collecting water than a hand pump? Asking for a friend :)

hope you are ready to deal with it until 2020 LOL

prolly what I'm doing when I get home lol
---
I love being melee when stuff like this happens
---
its the second place DPS weapon in game for commando right now, both PVP and PVE, and only edged out by the Fixer by a small margain.
---
Are you checking your inventory for rewards?
---
I vaguely recall this bug from a few months ago. Back then it was solely a display issue, the pop up would not show but the rewards would still be deposited.
---
If you live in a big city such as New Yrok City, NY. Or Los Angeles, CA of course the infrastructure is good. What I was referring to is the suburbs and the rural areas.
---
My choices for internet are dial up, satelite, or fixed mobile. Fixed Mobile is what was cost effective for me to go with. 15 Mbps down and 5 Mbps up. The community I live in has no brodband infrastructure whatsoever.
---
Well fallout 4 left a sour taste with alot of people me included i mean as minor as it sounds the first thing i noticed is my gun just disappeared when i put it away bothers me alot and they still had control over when to release this game they said yes when it had bugs from 3 still in it shows how much they care
---
Just needs some shiplap
---
Challenge accepted 😉
---
Good to know tyvm
---
Great list of fixes this time, and glad to see the vending machine crash fixed because that's the only crash I've been having lately. Just had it this morning actually.
---
It should definitely run at least until I take my lights down (usually June).
---
Losing the normal +100 seems to maybe be tied to the whole reloading bug..

Best. Update. EVER.
---
What, so the atom shop 🎄 doesn't go inside?
---
I would maybe look at vendors to buy ammo off of people who sell for 1 cap a piece or go to whitesprings and buy the different building plans (barn, brick, etc)
---
I'd try to buy a marine helmet plan, then you can make them (material wise they are pretty cheap to make), plus you'll get experience, then sell them to vendors every 20 hours to get your 1400 caps.  I really wouldn't worry about armor or guns until later on.  Pretty sure I used a level 10 2 shot hunting rifle on my first charecter until I was in the high 40s.
---
Easy way to have caps to buy ammo since everybody usually sells ammo 1:1.
---
i watched all 5 yesterday now i have to suffer before they release another, its chernobyl all over again
---
Riverside Manor as well
---
And chasing children NPCs with a chainsaw
---
This is fine so long as killing the NPC's increases the bounty and getting killed by them does NOT remove the bounty.  
---
There has been enough of an all out attack on everything PvP related in this game from launch.  Allowing NPC's to take the bounty removes one of the tiny remaining scraps of PvP in the game.  
---
Never mind that allowing npc's to clear the bounty would be gaming the system.
---
I use both prefixes on different weapons but I do seem to have a preference for Instigating. Here is my game play perspective:
---
Anything west, south-west, or north of the Savage Divide: **IE FR Single Action Revolver**. All creatures typically die in a bullet and it's badass. Rarely I'll pull out my QE Faster aim Lever Action.
---
Savage Divide, Whitespring, The Mire: **QE Faster aim Lever Action, AAE Handmade, IE Faster Reload Black Powder Rifle and QE VATS Fill Harpoon Gun**. The Black powdered rifle kills everything not a Sheepsquatch or Mirelurk Queen in one shot. The QE Lever can take out most creatures in a head shot. I am usually using my QE Lever. I use my AAE handmade in a pinch or my QE Harpoon for fun. I could swap out the rifleman tree and exclusively use my AAE Handmade for these regions but that's no fun.
---
Scorchbeast, SBQ and other bosses: **Furious/10% Damage while aiming/90% reduced weight Plasma Flamer and QE Tesla Rifle**. The furious flamer shines in taking out bosses. It has a high sustained DPS and melts everything not the SBQ. At SBQ, you have to take considerable risk at head shooting her the whole time but boy do you see her health drop without buffs. With buffs, you should be doing 70-80 dmg per cartridge.
---
Misc: Quad/Limb Damage/RW Broadsider, BSS Bowie Knife, IE VATS Cost Black Powder Pistol. I use these weapons on occasion to mix things up. 
---
Hope this helps.
---
That would be awesome.
---
And a cleaner toilet and tub.
---
Don't feel too bad, it's still a mediocre attribute on guns that don't have a super long reload or low mag capacity. It's great news for the BP guns though. It finally makes them a viable build.
---
The clean toilet and sink are nice, and I really like the fireplace.
---
already offended. reported. enjoy your ban.
---
Well they're pretty sought after. Especially if you have access to strangler power armor. So I'd say easy 40k and up
---
ahahaah yeah but unfortunately this happened three days ago
---
If you're on PS4 I sell every type of Shielded underarmor for 1k caps in my vendor. These last you basically forever and have no level requirement. Or wait until lvl 33 and pick up both starched genes perks and then spend that on cheap mutations
---
Either find a nice rifle to use later or some cheap stimpaks if you are running low. Hookers and blow is always a respectable option lol. What platform are you on? If you can find someone to make you a Brotherhood Recon rifle and throw on a Refined 50cal receiver those are great at low levels. I craft them for low levels off and on as you get a lot more ammo per crafting batch than 308.
---
 if your on xb1 i can help ya out with quests and stuff save the caps. May even have low level weps n armor.
---
Damnit foiled again
---
I’ll check that actually. I’m about to turn in another quest so I’ll let you know.
---
Make sure you swap your floors to solid if they are mesh as it takes up slightly more budget.  Also I found after I wallpaper the walls the camp budget goes up ever so slightly but its only really noticeable if you're super close to full or full.  Also remember for some dumbass reason items in your vending machines/atomic shop fridge/fermenter also count towards your build budget.  It's super slight but there.  Again, you'll only really notice this when your camp is full.
---
Yes, but it breaks again when you reload your weapon.
---
If you have melee as an option, you should use it instead of your guns.
---
I wear full unyielding and reloading isn’t breaking it, I tried both crouched and uncrouched. Maybe the bug is tied to a specific gun? I’m using a fixer.
---
I wish the rewards for this event, the government supply drops, and even treasure maps had a chance to drop a legendary or potentially a rare plan or outfit.
---
Upvoted!
---
It's like you halfway read my response.  I already touched on the fact that it's been awhile, the point is that they're working on it finally.  I understand its late.
---
Same thing is happening with Bolstering and chameleon and maybe all other effects too
---
The lever action gun, any indicator that it's a skin or a new weapon, like a lever action shotgun?
---
As some of those items i know aren't atomic shop, the santa-stuck-in-a-wall apppears in the CAMP menu only with a locked symbol, not atomic shop.  
---
But curious, that new PA and gun, ATX or not?
---
The disappearing corpses bug, hasnt been fixed as a Ghoul just varnished as I was about to loot it!
---
Early in game the first big purchases I always make are to buy certain plans. As a rifleman you’ll want to start building and scrapping handmade and lever action guns. Both weapons have a host of mods to unlock by scrapping, but also both weapons are very rare drops from enemies, so the fastest way to learn them is to make em and scrap them yourself. You’ll need three ranks of gunsmith and around 1700 caps- be sure to take some grape mentats and a mothman omelet before you buy. The lever plans can be bought in Grafton Station and the handmade from the Free States vendor in Whitesprings. You’ll need lots of springs and screws too, but before you know it you’ll have hardened receivers and suppressors for both- essential as a sneak rifleman!
---
I think the player icons have potential for this to actually work.  Different icons for different things.  Maybe allow us to type a small message on there that I can click on to read.
---
This would help when looking for groups, or even just selling legendary items in your vending.
---
They fixed it in the since that no one will touch the weapons with 250dr now lol. The good ol ask and you shall receive from Bugthesda.
---
Killing blow 50+times?

Sweet... with the sequined hat and jacket outfit I can *finally* RP as Columbia.

All kidding aside, the only thing that really got me excited here was the brick fireplace.  That will be a nice addition to Camp Wendigo.
---
that sucks! I use that regularly
---
That is one of the best early investments for sure.

It is good for everything, awesome for PVE and very useful in PVP with the firerate.
---
lol
---
With downloads only getting bigger. I can't blame people for that stuff taking longer. Hell the disc is just a download code basically and not all multiplayer games require 1mb connection consistently to have no lag.
---
Keep saving up
---
I'll grant you (some of) that.
---
Maybe I got lucky, maybe it's my playstyle, but many of the bugs either didn't have any affect on my character (weapon spin up?  I'm a melee build), or the affect has been minor (Hit registration, perhaps, but I still killed them), visuals (skating enemies are amusing), or the issue was taken care of in the next patch (cannot add a mod to a PA helmet).
---
Like you, there's more, but I hope you see my point as well as I see yours.
---
Comparatively, 76 is still much more stable than NV (which lockups, freezes, crashes, and getting stuck in the terrain drove me batty), but not as solid as 3 and 4.
---
Me too. I have a sweet instigating/33pct vats hit chance Crossbow that is really fun to use.  It would be fun if you could get different mods for the arrows.  
---

When are we getting the marine helmet?
---
Wasn't it 11th? I may have misread though.
---
I just switched from melee..smh lol
---
yeah there's like 5 posts about it already
---
You can work around it though. Stay hip-firing till you actually fire, then move to ADS or ADS before you spin up. I've not had a fail to fire if doing this.
---
Granted, shouldn't *HAVE* to do this, but it's a work around.
---
Yeah! Me too especially with the new or low level players when i gift them something...Now it is hard to communicate that i am gifting them something
---
They disappear when you reload your weapons.
---
need more camp budgettttttt!!!!!!

Same happened to me with Heart of the Enemy.  :(
---
Plus I have already had two hard crashes in less than an hour of play.  
---
:(
---
Guess this is a good time to level up my non bloodied toon.
---
You really, really fixed 250dr bug AND introduced a bug that cancels out armor effect when reloading? Do you people even QA?
---
Ah thank you I thought it would start today cause of the update. Guess il get off til then lol
---
Lol holy shit going by their track record this won't be fixed for 8 months too.
---

---
ok.. thanks?

Thanks man, thought it started today.
---
Did you think the lever action picture looked any different?  It just looked the same as the usual one to me.
---
ok
---
True
---
When are we getting the marine helmet on console?
---
nice contribution thank you?
---
halloween pt2 is the 11th, that may be where the confusion is
---
I'd be willing to bet the two are related.
---
I play on pc, i freeze every single time someone near me wearing strangler shoots a mob, it also happens with legacy weapons and every other weapon that has particles effects (like flames, but a lot less intensively compared to strangler's poison effect). I hope to find a solution
---
Not just reloading. After fast travel and using a scrap box break it too. Video of it disappearing

Had all my turrets attack one of my steel extractors at the Grafton Steel yard, right in the middle of a round of defending against Super Mutants.  I watched a SM walk up to one of the turrets and destroy it with a board, since it was so busy trying to waste the extractor.  Even the vertibot took shots at the extractor.  It was insane.
---
I love this 😆
---
Only took them an entire year
---
Does anyone know if the Santatron, or regular Collectron, has better rates based on where your C.A.M.P is located, or is it all the same
---
Good for pvp with the 110 dmg cap and dense/fire proof making explosive moot. Also great for Queen fights as she has a very high explosive resistance
---
Right!! Things like this seem small but it opens up new gameplay loops which are what this game really needs right now.
---
I see.
---
I've only had this happen on the one char I put a Collectron on
---
The Handmade plan might be an option for you ... I’m on my 3rd character and things really change when you can get starched Genes and add a few mutations .. Marsupial is first on my list especially as a sneak rifleman.. the roofs around whitesprings are my hunting ground!

I was hoping for people to actually say something but I forgot it's 2019 and anything more than a meme is too much for most people to digest.

Im glad im not the only one thats noticed this. Mine stops working altogether after a reload.

I think it's all armor effects, I even lose the +100 carry weight in my excavator PA when I reload
---
Man Bugthesda is embarrasing
---
Wow. There are bugs and fuckups and then there are these people.
---
will bring = future
---
If I meant the past DLC I would have used past tense there.
---
I'm also talking about the games as they are right now. I've played through every one of the older games and their DLC to the point I've done everything at least twice (probably 8+ playthroughs of each game except for 1 and 2 which I only played through once or twice). The older games have lost my interest except for modding.
---
76 had weak DLC the first year, but the random factors with the grind and player interactions have still kept it more interesting to me than replaying the older games for the 9th time and I still have hope the DLC quality will improve with wastelanders.
---
They definitely are.
---
nope :(
---
all the same, it basically runs a script that pulls random stuff out of thin air
---
Lord have mercy! Losing all my hype for Wastelanders. That update will probably break the entire game.
---
Exactly! I like having a nice looking camp and realize other really don't care much.  One of my friends absolutely loves the camp building and decorating and this will make her day!
---
So you just have bad taste in gaming. Not a problem.
---
It's funny because it's true
---
Ok, thanks
---
The devs are on vacation. No updates until next year!
---
  Ho, ho, ho ! Merry Christmas!!!
---
Update: I did not have enough atoms.
---
Makes you wonder why they don't release that in the shop.  There are definetly people who would buy that and the showers you find in the game.
---
Seems this patch broke a lot of things
---
Good point
---
Maybe they're upset about the re-skinned Mr. Fuzzy ride?  ::shrugs::
---
I laughed, then i realized you're probably right...
---
now im crying
---
I agree. In the vault, there is a perfectly functional (water animation works) shower that would be amazing in camps.
---
Had to be on your guard couldn't just skip around the wasteland in your undies lol. The good ol days.
---
They all do, even stuff the patch doesnt effect lol
---
In the beginning they laughed at the berserker build....but on this day, today, Tuesday, they laugh no more!
---
I dunno, the image feels bulkier to me, may just be the lighting. The barrel though is definitely different from any past skins for the Lever action, just doing a quick image search and compare shows that. (Dunno how to explain it, but the wood part of the barrel is definitely different, doesn't have a clean blend from metal to wood like how the lever action rifle does).  
---
I'll be bummed if its just a skin change tho! Here's me hoping for a whole load of new guns....
---
Alas, on Xbox.
---
look really close at aaronholt homestead.
---
it's an excellent spot.  think of how much crops are there.
---
Help. The line for this cigarettes is way too long.
---
Numbness will subside in several minutes
---
Same! I also like those Vendor signs, but I'll wait till they go on sale. There should be more Xmas/Winter stuff next week too!
---
Agreed. What's up with all this dopey kid shit. I don't want post apocalyptic home to look like Freddy Mercury's mansion.
---
Right on! I'm pretty casual but I usually run events or nuke zones, craft. I know a few good farming locations and like to help people with daily challenges. Double xp weekend coming soon!
---
The receiver looks a bit different, like it has some engravings on it
---
Same here, I’ve gotten two hard crashes, and one black screen to dashboard crash.
---
Same here. Lol. My QE harpoon gun is broken as well. Guess im playing a different toon until the first of the year.
---
Streamers I watch say that the community managers they talk to are aware of it and pushing for a fix.
---
I haven't checked but maybe look at your emote wheel.  Sometimes if you have multiple emotes in a category they become "un-equipped".  This happened with my salute emote a few weeks ago.
---
Same here. And also after I used my scrapbox.  I run únyielding bloodied melee, but I use a CR a hefty amount and I just can't play.   Guess it's back to camp decorati g u til this is fixed.
---
Yep.
---
Not just Unyielding too. Bolstering is broken I'm told.
---
This
---
How would this possibly make more people want to be wanted?
---
Yeah the only folks I've met that actually do them just moved to RDR2; everyone else just does SBQ runs. They sound difficult but, same as any mmo, if the rewards suck then no one cares.
---
&gt; Did pre-war Americans just love the taste of dog food?
---
Perhaps the dog food was dropped for Enclave operatives to distract guard dogs with?
---
Happens when you reload your weapon (the 250DR while reloading fix caused this). People is talking about it here in Reddit
---
Eh, I’d only get the gilded minigun paint and MAYBE the enclave eyepatch, they definitely need to add more enclave items instead of free states garbo
---
I have exactly the same problem.
---
Already checked but unfortunately it's not there
---
Bah humbug to you, all fun aside I think its a pretty decent week of stuff interesting to see others opinions
---
Vishnu would like a word with you...
---
Do they even do bug testing?... Or just throw updates out and see what happens
---
At this point, it's impossible to not make any joke about this...
---
That’s ridiculous lol I never knew that. Will be sure to try it if I find a good handmade with the less vats perk on it
---
They might be fixing everything they just fucjed up lol
---
Exactly.  You also can find the clean stainless steel toilets and the modern looking kitchen stainless sinks.  Maybe they need to have a bundle that includes all these pieces to remodel your kitchen and bathroom.  Sponsored by DIY network. Lol
---
Seriously though people really like things like this so it is weird they don't release this stuff.
---
Just primary effects. My WWR holds when I have my heavyweight set on.
---
Mutants effect is also bugged,
---
You are calling the people disappointed ridiculous when they have already been waiting up to a year for some of these bug fixes. Some of us have been waiting longer than that even (the fallout 4 bugs that carried over) for some.
---
They are not ridiculous, they have waited. What is ridiculous here is that someone who is claiming that all you have to do is be patient is ridiculing people who have lost theirs. Maybe apply some of that patience you are awarding Bethesda to the community too?
---
Damn. Sorry bud
---
Hi Bethesda I just logged on and got hit with a bug related to my unyielding armor. Was doing free range and after getting hit once my strength (among other special) dropped significantly. I unequipped and re-equipped my unyielding armor (5 pieces) and it reset to normal but after a few minutes it reverted again to being broken...
---
For example my carry weight changed from 400 to 340 which is 60 pts or 12 strength worth (I am at low health). Weird that it wasn’t 15 strength worth.
---
It has been one year. You already know the answer.
---
Yet this sub keeps licking their shit up. Criticize them once and they'll be upon you likr angry dogs, downvoting you to hell.
---
Well aren't you just a bright spark in a wet moist cave...
---
They broke a lot
---
It's seriously time to shut this game down.
---
\-insert krab meme about how nobody from bethesda will see this and that this will get removed for spam-
---
Unless its dealt with fast(hahahaha likely) its gonna ruin my fo76 christmas..make the scorched holiday event pretty much a no-go for me...bugthesda got me feeling like the grinch now...
---
Thanks!  May take you up on that - GT?
---
Halloween stuff didnt come out till the week before as well and people around here start putting their Halloween decorations up in September.
---
I agree with you though.  Christmas stuff should have been available the day after the Thanksgiving stuff was pulled.
---
Ya, that would be nice.  I wish we could change the receiver to shoot .44 cal and .38 ammo.  It would give more of a reason to collect some of that.  If nothing else you could use those rounds on low level trash mobs.
---
Things happen. Cause this has never happened to any other games before
---
Is this still occurring when you close and reopen the game?
---
They just fixed it today didn't they?
---
Hehe moist lol
---
I am on the XB1- Brotherhood Recon, you say?
---
True, but it happens just so often with bethesda
---
Rewards were received for the last quest, just didn’t pop up on screen. I believe XP is counting as well. So I guess it’s just not showing on screen.
---
Wrong fictional franchise
---
Did they? I'm still at work, did it go that bad?
---
Not really.. when I see others do it I figure that’s what they are going for, not they are oblivious and just stand or run in the nuke
---
I live in a city of 20k and I get 1Gbps down.
---
I never tried that, so i wouldnt know

Oh dear...

Just got mine 2 days ago. *yay*🙄

Yes lol

I HATE the word moist
---
Me too.
---
Try restarting your console. That happens on my Xbox sometimes on these patches and updates for me.
---
I would love to see something official. Streamers misreport stuff all the time in my experience. I do hope everyone is right in this case though.
---
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

haha .... yes....and no apparently
---
Same here.
---
Just saw the other thread about it. Jesus H Christ on a cracker. How does this even happen? They need to set up a control group in house and have them live test the patch before they release it.
---
Yeah it does. How can stuff break that the update wasnt about
---
I dont lol. Moist cake mmmmmmnn
---
Same.  I like a lot of the stuff this week.  The sink and the drinking fountain along with the tree and other festive stuff.  Some people are never happy.

How can u test literly everything. The update broke stuff it wasnt even about

It is funny, you just beat me to the draw. Lol.

Also I believe we came across each other the other day, on Xbox  platform, next time I will say hi. 
---
I wish you the best

🤢
---
 *"Anything that can kill a man, I sell. Except suicidal depression. That is unfortunately not packageable."*
---
same...gonna have to buy 1st just to get those atoms for this weeks stuff
---
Think about how many massive updates there have been. When I got the game last year for Christmas, I waited hours for the download, then had an update file as large as the base game.
---
The non Xmas items would have been decent a few weeks ago but the tank war hero statue doesn't exactly give out Xmas vibes lol
---
Is that a Gundam
---
Whenever you reload any gun it breaks the primary on your armor and you have to unequip then requip to fix.
---
Suspension of disbelief has its limits, usually informed by the genre and accepted tropes. Stepping outside of those has a tendency to break it.
---
It isn't dead, but it is being severely abused with this game by the devs.
---
What platform are you?
---
I ran home at lunch and snagged the santa bot.  When I placed it I didn't have the option to pick anything.  I don't own the collector bot though.  It said something along the lines of "gathering presents" idk.
---
Thanks for the correction
---
Chainsaws were actually fairly balanced when the over-repair bug was in the game and they were 200% repaired. I personally think they should benefit from heavy weapon perks as well.
---
I think it's just people's disdain for posts such as this one. For a long time nearly every other post was, "I'm leaving!" or "Goodbye Wasteland!" Posts. Eventually people began to get irritated by the majority of "Goodbye posts", and started replying with sarcasm and hate.
---
I'd just overlook it, no reason to take it personally and get riled up.
---
I am afraid to launch the game; what with the reports of reloading completely breaking any armor/PA effects. Now this thing with QE Harpoon, the best weapon in whole damn game...
---
If they had actually rolled this out in a test group first, a lot of this would have been easily caught. I support BGS all the time, I pay the sub, I've bought atoms. I defend their dumb decisions. This is just lack of give a fuck on their part though.
---
oh yeahhhh more nuka stuff!!!!
---
I like eating actual players instead of stimpaking them...
---
We didnt even get a free christmas tree
---
Ah, the great paradox that is Bethesda Game Studios.
---
I got mine out of the way during fasnacht...assholes.😂
---
Good advice!
---
Yup, same here :-(
---
You're arguing semantics at this point.  I called the number of people complaining ridiculous, not the people themselves.  Please dont twist my words to try and make a point.
---
Anyway, theres no game in existence that's free of bugs and the fact that bethesda is working on them is at least a sign of them trying.  How is constantly telling the developers that they suck at their jobs because a certain bug you hate still exists helping anything? It pays to be patient and I highly doubt you'd want someone constantly doing the same to you when you're trying to do your own job.  
---
In the end, the people working on this game are still human can only work on things that are allowed on whatever schedule is given to them.  So once again, be patient.
---
Sort this subreddit by "New."  All legendary armor effects are broken.
---
I know and I thought that was stupid too! Why just one week before? It should be at the beginning of the month for each holiday.
---
Yeah I had to delete another 20 GB of stuff... They need to work on this.
---
Ahahahahahahahahah
---
*breathing in*
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Jesus, how incompetent can you be, Bethesda Austin? Oh well, expecting a fix in 2021.
---
I doubt that. We dont know what happens behind the scenes, we cant just assume they dont care. It seems that way sometimes but i doubt its the case
---
Is it just cus of that affix or all reloading?
---
I went berserker 2 weeks ago. I love having no issues.
---
It seems to fix itself after taking off and putting your armor back on.  It’s fine after you do it the first time you load your character.
---
Yea. I think the armor effect things is hit and miss. I read vanguard gets broken on reload. I have a whole set and it seems to be doing fine when i reload, tried on 5 reloads. I have a bolstering and unyeilding set too, ill check those out.
---
This is also breaking stranger heart power armor set bonus, fyi.  I'd suspect it also breaks thorn and solar armor set bonuses as well but I don't have a set to test with.
---
Until you reload again..
---
Lol so they fixed the +250 damage resistance bug on weapons but now it affects armor???? Wow!
---
Oh definitely. I mean honestly, some guns are just missing standard mods from Fo4 like the Combat Rifles 308. Receiver, but imo, I'd love a plethora of new ammo to be added with the new guns, like .357 rounds, 20 gauge, 12 gauge, 22L, 12.7, 9mm,  rounds, different ammo to sort of make different guns "unique" in some sense, like how only the Gauss rifle (for now) accepts 2mm EC.
---
Happening to me as well.
---
As for what they've 'expanded on in interviews' - Howard and company has a strong history of stretching facts right into outright lying.  
---
FO3, for example, didn't ship with 200 endings.
---
&gt;Fallout fans can look forward to over 200 different endings with the upcoming Fallout 3, according to Executive Producer Todd Howard. 
---
https://www.engadget.com/2008/03/25/new-details-over-200-endings-for-fallout-3/
---
Doesnt matter if weapon has that affix...it will still break it..along with bolstering too..and chameleon
---
Best case scenario is that they leave it broken for a few days and then just hand out about 50 free Christmas present boxes to every player to make up for it.
---
Shoot people before they shoot you and keep your health points above 0.  
---
(wacky jokes aside, be careful of your surroundings, dont stand still unless you're hidden, be ready for combat at any time, loot stuff you can, make sure to use some perks, hacking/lockpick is useful if you have time for it. Power armour breaks really fast and is loud)
---
Finally, the Free States Armor Paints!
---
Who is selling wrapping paper?  Nobody at Whitesprings.
---
Yeah! I would love that!
---
That is one thing I like about the combat rifle.  I can switch the receiver to use that cheap and sometimes free .38.  
---
I figured using .38 on my instigating lever action would hardly be noticeable!
---
All reloading
---
It seems that the new patch in general has broken all armor effects after reloading a weapon.  Probably related to the 250 dr while reloading "fix" - somehow managed to break armor while fixing the guns, classic Bethesda I guess :P
---
Honestly, and I'm a huge fan and supporter, just check my history; they stopped giving a damn after that investment firm dumped a few hundred million into them. It's been all about speed and profit since then. It used to be 4 years between each title, and they were each such genre defining games. Now it's just a bunch of hot copy/paste garbage, and I know there's probably still some developers there that care about the quality of their releases, but the people in charge obviously don't have the same emotional investment.
---
Yeah definitely, but also look at the Barrel, it's a different shape to the ones the Lever action has currently, and the Lever action shotgun and rifle both look similar, in terms of past Fallout models, but always have minor differences that tell them apart.
---
Finally I feel that we may be working towards a better relationship between Bethesda,  and this brilliant community. 
---
I wish the team at Bethesda, and everyone else a very mutated Christmas, and a happy New year's. 
---
My New Year resolution, is not to be such an asshole, when the game starts pissing me off. Lol   
---
I apologize once again, for some of my outlandish comments over the last few months. 
---
Let make this relationship stronger for the New Year. 
---
Rip guess i aint gonna be playing then
---
I regularly nuke player bases (whatevs, blame Beth for taking our Survival mode away) and will tell you it's highly unlikely this happened to you due to your lack of contribution to the SBQ fight.
---
Reasons I've nuked someone's base: crappy shop, don't like his gamertag, bored, base was preventing me from placing my own, stole my workshop, no reason whatsoever. Last night I did it before I went to bed because there were a cluster of bases all together and I thought it would be funny. Was your base the exact center of the nuke? Sometimes I nuke random spots and someone's base happens to be there, but if I'm targeting someone's base specifically I make sure to center it right on their base.
---
If I think you're being crap at the SBQ I'll wait until the fight is over, thumbs down you, and try to PvP.
---
Agreed, it's a pretty shit legendary effect in any case.
---
NICE
---
Well, tipped over.  
---

What was the 250 drwr bug?
---
Been having chameleon problems. Standing staying invisible. Crouching staying Uninvisible. Running for 10-15 seconds with full invisibility. PS4 btw
---
Meat Jerky would be much more cost effective, I suppose perhaps, but then why just 1 can? It would be neat if they had notes or something for escape and evasion or maps in them... you know something like our current gear kits...
---
Me either...im the grinch to their scorched christmas event
---
I hope so:)
---
Remember they r just a cog in a bigger machine. Bethesdas parent company could be the mastermind behind this
---
I very rarely complain but ... FFS - Really? Do they have a crack smoking chimp doing the patches and a emotionally stunted simpleton play testing this game? OY! BETHESDA! Sort ya shit out and sack the interns you've got patching/play testing this game - FFS I paid for this bollocks - hey-ho :D
---
New with the patch?
---
I believe you needed it for some of the daily challenges but other than that idk if you need it
---
Game breaking new bug that was introduced with patch 16. Whenever you reload ANY gun the primary effects on your armor break and you have to take your armor off and on to fix after every single reload of any gun. u/Valseek
---
Brosious35
---
Has it been five minutes since the last person asked this?
---
Only you can answer if it's worth returning to for you.
---
Altho i suppose melee works but eh
---
So they can have npcs of increasing caliber hunting them down. Sometimes mid mission. If you get a high bounty and go to your own private world than you can enjoy the most wanted lifestyle.
---
Exactly.  It kinda works like that now in a way.  If you want the rare responder gear you do forest events, leather coats and traveling leather coats are mire events, etc.  They really should expand on this a whole lot more and and more faction themed stuff into the loot pools for rewards.
---
Bolstering effect does in fact break after a reload. So does unyeilding.
---
It's a great effect when it's on a sniper rifle or dragon...very useful for us far away sneaky types. It helps keep that build viable in Bloodied Commando Tesla land.
---
I’ve tried to get this achievement several times and I never get it- do you have to be directly in the center?
---
I dont agree but thats okay. I would want npcs to clear the bounty myself. Its more like a badge of badass
---
Within five seconds of thinking about it you've come up with a legitimately better and more fun implementation for Enclave event rewards than Bethesda's event designers. That should tell you something about where their priorities are.
---
I've always just used the regular camera for the challenges and it has worked.  Maybe I missed something though.
---
Wtf tube atom store is starting to really piss me off... Barely any weapon or armor skins... But hey you guys like wallpapers toilets and sinks right!?
---
Uhhh not sure, I don’t think so though!
---
I would like to see it as a legit, non atom store armour set that has a chance to charm rad ants
---
I'm looking forward to eating you
---
Someone said it's more of a green filter then night vision and not worth. Haven't seen it but I know what they are talking about. Lots of games use same method and it's ok at best.
---
Some of them have specifically said “with night vision lense” or whatever but I wouldn’t doubt it if it let you complete it with a normal lense
---
So is it reloading anything or just guns with the 250 that breaks it? Here I thought I'd be safe in my pa. But if it breaks my Stangler to that sucks haha
---
They'd better have not legendary armor then because all primary legendary armor effects are broken.  Vanguard, chameleon, bolstering
---
Your comment made me think that Covert Operation Manuals would be a good addition to the pods.  Not in every drop, of course, but at least a chance of getting one of the magazines
---
Permission granted!
---
Heh yeah, reminds me of how in the ol' Fallout 3 and New Vegas, all you had to do was to press key 2 to switch between ammo types, like hollow point to armour piercing to Incendiary to Explosive (if you had those bullets tho), but hell some guns just swapped 5.56 to .223 with no receiver change needed!
---
Most of the problems stem from the engine. The Creation Engine is phenomenal, there's no other game engine on the market that can achieve what it is capable of. On the other side of that, all those moving parts tend to clash and interact in some pretty buggy ways. There's been layers and layers of code just piled on, and when they go to fix one bug it causes three more. 
---
They need to go from the ground up; they could even use the same engine and just update it like they have been; it is just a mass of code after all. They keep trying to fix little pieces at a time, and I almost feel like the people working on these fixes haven't had a lot of experience with the engine. Even a full rebuild would still have bugs, but I think the end result would be better than what we have right now. There's just far too much focus on cranking stuff out as fast as possible, and quality is suffering for it.
---
I know everyone hates on Todd Howard, but the games were 5x better when he was able to actually work on them himself. Now that he's only supervising, the games just aren't what they used to be.
---
* Abandoned Bog Town (go to the roof of the largest building and jump down the elevator shaft, there's a room filled with typewriters and globes)
---
* National Isolated Radio Array (lots of desk fans, typewriters, and globes scattered around the building) 
---
* Whitespring Bunker (lots of desk fans on desks around the Military Wing)
---
* Sugar Grove (plenty of clipboards here for springs as well) 
---
* Charleston Capitol (several rooms full of typewriters, desk fans, and globes)
---
* Wendigoes always drop a few screws, and Super Mutants have a chance to drop 1-3 screws
---
Is it just a reload, or a reload of a gin with the 250 effect?
---
It's a perfect effect for a tesla rifle that takes a minute to reload but dang it is so broken!
---
Jesus, this game. I'll start the game and go try out QEH, it's my go-to weapon - usually good for +-100 shots with  Gunsmith 3.
---
Haha thanks I would happily compile region/faction reward tables for free... or you know when/if we get modable servers make a nice mod XD
---
Try to kill other players while also trying not to get killed yourself :)
---
&gt;• This includes fixes for untranslated, partially translated, and mistranslated text in game menus, item names and descriptions, notifications, Terminal entries, Holotapes, Quests, Objectives, Subtitles, and more. 
---
I bitched about translation errors for an entire year now, I hope that power armor UI is fixed.
---
Not in any case...maybe yours. It's quite effective in mine. I would be bummed if they removed it.
---
Interesting. Maybe they got rid of those challenges awhile back.  Seems like a lot of grinding just to get a few atoms. Lol
---
Looks like turrets can still go hostile. *sigh*
---
Its any gun in general. Reloading breaks just about everything now.... except guns with the 250drwr... 😂
---
It’s only 5 badges? That’s just a few camp Adams events
---
Zenimax, yes I'm aware. I miss Bethesda before all these changes. I didn't mind waiting years for the next title, because they were worth it and actually kept me entertained the entire time. It took me 3 months to do everything there was in 76 and get bored of it. Hell, Fallout 4 still gives me more pleasure, so does Skyrim. They need to roll back and start doing things the way they used to.
---
Have them use legendary weapons for high bounty/lvl people, but make them drop no loot
---
You are not wrong about the implementation of it...I live in crouched, so the bug wasn't affecting me as much, but they need to get their crap in order, bot just start eliminating crap they can't get working.
---
I worry for mental state of mind in this here Weddit ;)
---
Can you put lights on the tree?
---
Exactly! Hell any of the military branded magazines would make sense! You could even theme them for the areas. Have a mire or forest get forest scout. Have Watoga or other city get urban scout. Then couple those with K-9 or repair centered drops. Or you know give us a orbital strike and scan beacon once in awhile like they do for the mission...
---
My god. So much worse than I imagined.
---
Personally i like 76 more then 4
---
No kidding.  I suppose it will all be bundled too.....I kinda like it and kinda hate it at the same time.  I wish they sold the pieces individually more often and then gave a discount if you buy the bundle.  Sometimes they do that and other times not.
---
Nope, no faith at all. At this point i've lost most of the hype and i'm like "meh, whatever"
---
Appears to break every armor effect. Reloading, fast traveling, and using a scrapbox all break it. Better call for OT tonight, time for a hotfix.
---
I do a lot of sprinting......I have been a waiting so patiently to use my bloodied tesla on those invisible tesla pvp gangs.......
---
New content is a critical point. Almost all communauty has top tier armor&amp;weapons and no more challenge for months. 
---
Worst as they have removed survival you don't have pvp option anymore. 
---
I stopped play one month ago and I'll back only if new content is interesting even some bugs are still here. One year of SBQ is... Too much.
---
Yeah it's  called Adventure mode - JOKE!
---
What you going to buy? So far I got the 30% off gore loot bag, the Christmas lights and the santabot.
---
Yea... they really screwed up this patch. Everything is broken... people say it all the time, but this is literally unplayable at this point. None of my armor effects work. Some of my guns arent even working properly.
---
There's nowhere near enough info to answer your question mate.  If it's a 1 star AA rifle, it will do roughly 28% more damage than a non legendary rifle but that assumes over a certain amount of DR.    
---
AA only really impacts damage in specific scenarios.  You can read up about dr here:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage\_Resistance](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Damage_Resistance)

But without knowing if the gun has any other legendary effects, what build you are using, and anything else all I can speculate is that you bought a 1\* item (which imo paying real world $$ for is a mistake, you can easily find something vastly better by a large amount for caps on vendors or via trading subs) and it's working fine.
---
Same! Mind collected 3 piles of raw fertilizer so far ...
---
That explains why I’m dying more than usual, my unyielding armor ain’t working
---
Loll here come those downvotes
---
I think Chronic Wasting Disease is pretty interesting
---
Look around, someone will have them from 800-1200 caps.
---
Ya its just 5.  But usually running the 2 dailies and campfire tales I average about 1 badge every other day or so.  That's about a week to get 5 badges.  I have traded the backpack plans for some pretty cool stuff so I don't really want to waste them if I don't have to.
---
Sorry, did you read my post?
---
Exactly. Im glad im not the only one who knows how many shots i should get out of a repair. Lmao. I about shit my pants when my harpoon broke 20 rounds in.
---
Yeah. I have never had a problem with much in the game. But if any bug is game breaking this would be it haha. Hopefully they bring up a hotfix today.
---
Some, but not as reliant on it as a Bloodied build.
---
Wait until they hot-fix the latest Bethesda update that's fucked up legendary armor effects.
---
Weird. I will have to check it out when I get home.  I didn't think it was going to gather presents until Thursday though.
---
There is someone working on modding the entire world of 76 into Fallout 4. That’s the best you’ll ever get
---
Has the wrapped cap been fixed?? I’d like to be able to wear a gas mask along with it
---
Does this affect power armor, regular armor, or both?
---
Tree, sink, signs and lights.  
---
Muh CAMP needs thems stuffs.
---
Heck ya a sink
---
They are not guaranteed to be 3\*.  There's a chance but it feels like it's 1\* more often than not.  
---
Also, having 2 spawn is pretty uncommon.  Maybe one in 10 times, or less.  
---
Personally I think it's a worthwhile event just for the 1 enemy at the end if nothing else.  Mostly because it only takes about 5 minutes.
---
Ive never had a problem either. This just blew me away, i never thought id say those words. I feel dirty. Haha. I hope they hotfix this asap. I literally dont have a character to play at this point.
---
Same thing happening for me (PS4)
---
I'm pretty sure they're a drop with the Christmas scorched event
---
Who knows. If they open it to modders at some point it probably would be doable.
---
Wow you’ve been a really bad boy or girl this year!
---
That’s crazy!! Thank you! Four more days!!! :D
---
Lol, I hear you. Hopefully bugfix comes soon. Or not. Who knows anymore.
---
I wouldn’t mind buying a copy of that!
---
Ah ok, I wasn’t aware of an event so thanks for that!
---
Seriously?? Wow ok thanks for the note
---
Doesn't start until 12th so nobody knows at this point of time
---
Took me 30 minutes because I just couldn't believe what I seemed to be experiencing. It would be fascinating to know how their test regime operates.
---
I would also really love a washer and dryer! I always have that one extra room in my camp I never know what to do with.
---
It may matter that it's console specific. i don't think it's a FO76 thing. It's only Xbox or PS4.
---
I did at first, but some things just don't make sense. The loot tables are the biggest thing for me, almost every container you find is worthless other than the occasional plan. I want to go put scavenging and it to actually be productive, even at end game.
---
I am on Xbox
---
I am/was/is a Bethesda fanboy - got Fallout 1st and bought a lot of Atom Shop stuff in the time I've played FO:76 but this latest patch and it's now mandatory breaking of game features etc has finally broke my fan-boy back in some respects - sad really. I'll give it a day or two break and keep an eye on the situation - damn shame :(
---
Oh my god **oh my god** **OH MY GOD!!!** Ive wanted a sink for my camp for MONTHS! Now I can build a bathroom!! Time to spend 2 hours figuring out where I can fit a bathroom in my house
---
They said it will never be offline.
---
They are about as likely to release this as a new piece of clothing as a non atom shop item as I am to be crowned king of the universe.  But I do appreciate that people have continued enthusiasm about this game and keep asking for interesting updates.
---
If they cant fix it, they need to at least revert back to the previous patch. With a free trial coming up, not to mention the holiday event, this is just baaad anyway you look at it.
---
I’ve got a melee toon, guess that’s what I’m using till this gets fixed.
---
I'm one of those that argues some of what they sell is p2w.  But damn it if I didnt laugh at this comment!
---
Yeah, i think its the multiplayer that i love the most
---
PA glitches dont happen if you dont wear PA... Lol.
---
Adding this to the list because it fits in.
---
Yeah I did and tried to be a funny fucker - didn't work. Back to lurking for me :)
---
bulldozer is a automatic function it basically triggers to cause trees and other things to disappear but as of right now its only around 50-60% of objects - what I want is 100% of basic objects (trees bushes tall grass small to medium sized rocks) to be able to be toggled to get rid of them from build areas 
---
back at start of the game all trees rocks grass was just in your way and couldn't be poofed
---
Bruh looks like I’m spending my heart out cuz I need the festive cosmetics!
---
Bruh looks like I’m spending my heart out cuz I need the festive camp items!
---
Right. I was just picking a random bug part for the example, forgot the barbs were marked as quest items.  Fixed.
---
sneaky beth
---
Nooooooooo!
---
Please say it isn’t so!
---
Even then. It could have been a lot better. It definitely feels like an unfinished game most of the time.
---
Its been fixed in this patch?
---
i almost never take off my hazmat suit, probably smell like a dumpster fire
---
As if liberty prime wasn't annoying enough.
---
My harpoon is breaking within 15 shots with 200% durability and gunsmith on
---
it's too tall
---
Once the red zone appears in the map, run through it, right in the center there will be the symbol of the atom as if it were a "location". You need to wait your death there. You have no more than 2 and a half minutes to do this.
---
Optimizations were noted but no specific. Any noticable difference in overall performance from FPS to server latency?
---
Nothing's changed.  Just correcting the example in my previous post.
---
lol...you're ok
---
https://broadbandnow.com/report/2018-fcc-international-data-insights/

FCC Report Concludes US Internet Speeds Are ‘Among Worst in the Developed World’
---
Honestly you're better off farming Lucky Hole for Lead Ore with Excavator PA and then Steel stuff to make the ammo(not to mention you need acid n cloth too).
---
I will try it! Thanks
---
Ps4, why?
---
Word awesome thanks for response 👍👍 not been online since patch dropped so had to ask
---
I chuckle at the 1,000 cap nuclear key card. You should sell those for very few caps so people launch more.
---
Well, we all are playing a game that is universally ridiculed in mainstream gaming media and YT, often rightfully so. I'm still sticking with it due various reasons, but the devs sure like to test our patience...
---
I guess thats an option but I really can't stand the movement mechanics in 4.  It's actually terrible.  Don't hate me lol
---
Bethedsa already stated 76 will never be an offline game. 
---
Its an online multiplayer experience, and to make it offline would require Bethesda to release propriatary information regarding the host side infrastructure. 
---
This wont happen.
---
The closest you are going to get is a heavily modded Fallout 4.  Sorry I know you didnt want someone to say play Fallout 4, but you know what, the only way to get what you want is to play Fallout 4.
---
But i gotta kill the commies
---
Was curious if it was platform specific, I’m on pc and it occurs but my friend said it didn’t for him on ps4.
---
Thanks for verifying. This is by far the most broken patch released so far. They need to straighten this out asap.
---
Yes. More than one time. Usually it resolves with a little time and persistence.
---
There's probably more income potential for them in an offline version than the current version.
---
Dropped connection loot? That's a thing? Am I missing something? Everytime I dc I end up at a random location in another server with no loot from what I killed
---
This has some interesting information: https://i.imgur.com/CguOE8e.jpg
---
I was pretty optimistic but the patch today and the issues they introduced trying to fix the 250 damage resist has me concerned lol.   
---
Its like they have no supervisors or seniors checking work before releases happen. I'm not going to come on this subreddit all negative but I'm done defending them.
---
booooo!!   lol
---
It’s just a PITB and the opposite of what you’re taught to do in any shooter.  The 250DR bug had a workaround too.  Thing is - this wasn’t even broken from the start - it was a bug they created while the 250DR has been broken since day 1.
---
Just doesn’t make sense that this is harder to fix when they had it working correctly for a long time.  Feels a bit like a cop out for them to say they can’t safely do this without Wastelanders to be honest, but I don’t mind them taking the time to get it right.
---
I/valseek
---
I know what you mean. I love this game, and i just cant bring myself to stop. But theyre really pushing their luck anymore.
---
Rad-x, diseased and Stim makes more sense in a syringer, not a bow. I would suggest different broad head types that cause bleeding or maybe elemental damage considering the nature of FO76.
---
cheers pal :)
---
Oh cheers, was about to buy them until I saw this I just assumed we could hang them from walls
---
Seriously we just had a match with 32 people on a small map, almost unplayable everyone is at the same place and not even enough loot for all of them.
---
Why do I have a feeling modders would do a better job of it. If they can pull it off private servers would be lit.
---
Can you elaborate on why sharing proprietary information is a bad thing and what exactly that means??  curious....
---
Word.
---
thank god, im like the one person completely unaffected by this, no armor just hazmat, unless it also affects backpacks, does it affect backpacks?
---
have a good one!
---
Lol ! It just works😂😂
---
Most of your pvpers see anyone claim a workshop and they go attack. Would not claim any unless your ready for a fight.
---
SO....MANY.....SEQUINS!!! I AM GONNA BE FABULOUS!
---
The stoppables...
---
Yeah, I used to grab that Workshop a lot when playing on my boyfriend's private server. 
---
Tried to take it once on a public server. Was attacked within 10 minutes. 
---
It's funny, because no one seems to give a damn about it until it's claimed by someone else.
---
I dont remember it ever slowing the rate of decent but just increasing the height at which you can fall before taking damage.
---
I would strongly advise everyone to not give Bethesda any more money until they have some kind of team working on Fallout 76.
---
Yes it still occurs.
---
It's less useful than it could be. I used to carry a normal camera and one with a night vision lens and I ended up throwing away the night vision one due to disuse
---
I love FO76, it's basically the only game I have played for the last year.  I will continue to play it for the foreseeable future and look forward to Wastelanders.
---
However, after the debacle of Patch 16 I can no longer defend it to friends and co-workers.  Breaking Legendary armor is too in your face to pass off as something that could be missed or over looked.  I have no confidence what so ever at this point that Bethesda is play testing their patches internally.  Even the most cursory run through of mid to end game content should have noted this right off the bat.
---
Bloodied Unyielding Build is arguably the most popular end game setup today.   Broken.
---
Chameleon is the cool factor armor that requires a single key press to test... am I invisible?  Broken.
---
We need to be asking Bethesda one question at this point, a SIMPLE question:  
---
**How many Testers take part in your internal/contractor Test prior to Release?**
---
no need for more people to nuke, i can solo
---
Exactly. I get that people don't wanna work to get em but like seriously.... It's no get rich quick scheme with caps.
---
This, exactly.
---
That does nothing for the PC bounty Hunter. You are still taking them out of the equation.
---
that means they  have to tell you their secrets.
---
Companies dont share secrets.
---
Gonna make playing bloody builds a bit more challenging...
---
Thanks Bethesda!
---
Life problems dont happen if you're not alive. What's your point?
---
Would explain why my Handmade's durability was dropping like the dickens and maybe my armour too, that's very offputting
---
So as long as I just run as my bloodied melee , my unyielding shouldn't experience this? Cause I rely on my armor! lol
---
With all the hacking and duping going on with it being online only atm I would not ever expect to see an offline version of this game.  Sucks but whatchagunnado.
---
Happens with mu Hunter's tesla.
---
I’ve done the DMV quest twice in the last week and there were markers both times. I’m not saying I didn’t have another bug, but it’s not broken every time.
---
Anyone looking for PvP looks for claimed workshops first.
---
 Don't think you can. It's a large outdoor one. Not wasting 300 atoms for something that wouldn't suit my camp placement
---
question - does your gun happen to have the "250 dr while reloading" legendary effect?  
---
My theory is that now this effect works fine, but any gun without this will break armor legendary effects :P
---
They added new map?
---
NUKA-DOOR!
---
In my mind, I'm hoping that when Wastelanders launches it will be bug-free (due to that extended Bethesda polish time), has huge patch notes with a massive pile of fixes and optimizations, a ton of new content such as weapons, armours, base building items in addition to all the actual Wastelanders content.
---
I'm clearly delusional.
---
Happens to me every once in a great while.  I finished Cop a squatter the other day and 5 minutes later the scroll finally happened.  I heard the bummmm music as soon as it completed, but I had just gone into my pip-boy.  That may have delayed the rest of it.
---
Hopefully the patch just needs to bed in.
---
Its a joke not a dick. Next time dont take it so hard. Lol. 
---
With all the BS that goes on in this game, here i am still playing it. Youve gotta be able to laugh at the dumb shit with it or youre just going to become a very bitter person. And thats sad.
---
I love brewing, but I dont use it to profit.  Water purifiers are for profit.  
---
Brewing is for Nukashine.
---
So I see, thanks for the heads up
---
I would appreciate it👍🏿
---
Think it’s just unyielding armor. I don’t see my armor stats change during a reload but my special stats do.
---
Saddens me to agree...used to love this company...you either die the good guy..or live to see yourself become the microtransaction villian...
---
Keep praising them even more and downvote anyone who is critical. That'll fix everything.
---
That sucks, I'd encourage you to send in a support ticket.
---
u/valseek
---
I remember doing the dmv part from real world experience... Also it being extremely slow on the uptake after completeing a step. Took three times longer just waiting for the quest to update to the next step.
---
It would be such a good game.  Make it a sandbox.
---
Oh I just brew vintage nukashine, I never sell stuff as usually people aren't looking to buying them, however I could be wrong on this...all I know is that I put them into my punch bowl and usually mysteriously go missing.
---
No worries, they'll fix this after the Wastelanders update, i'm sure of it !
---
We couldnt with any other. So i assume we cant. Hlad i saved u atoms
---
Someone in the other post said it breaks all special effects.
---
We are the testers, we don't get payed... Shit some of us pay them
---
There’s one camp in the savage divide I sometimes get to that has the most ridiculous prices. Four vendors filled with meh three star legendaries, all of which are going for five figure prices. I remember the place every time cause it’s a nice looking camp with lots of Fasnatch decorations. I guess he only has to make the occasional sale to make it work?
---
I am standing at the forms I need on the desk in front of me now, and it's giving me a quest marker to go through a door some distance away
---
No sound. No delayed reward scroll. Was on for well over an hour after completing events.  Just new items in my inventory
---
Well I just saved 300 atoms..
---
Ill have to try. Im sure theyre getting bombarded with them at this point. The latest patch really broke almost everything.
---
I'm ok with it.  Just means my 'wholesale goods and emporium' will just keep raking it in.  
---
If you are in the Mire, swing by Crazy Coffee's.  With prices this low, I've got to be crazy!
---
starting the NW match in second phase with 32 players on flatwood with almost no loot is less fun then getting shot by aimbotters
---
As a player that played at launch I was going to come back for the xp. Considering this kind of stuff has been going on since I last played this isn't too motivating for me either.
---
i think they're releasing a smaller one soon, was in the datamine
---
I am so sorry :(
---
What exactly does it do?  Is it just like the night vision scopes on rifles?
---
I brew Nuka Darks pretty heavily, and Nukashine when I can. I run a Soda Saloon, so it all has to be soda related. I have Nuka Cherries for the non-alcoholics out there
---
I have only played through the game once, still on my only character and I have no plans on starting again.  I had issues with Rose months ago when I was trying to complete some of her quests.  She would ignore me at times or the markers wouldn't come up.  I had periods where I literally had no idea what I was supposed to do in order to get her quest line to move forward.
---
I can't speak for the in-world radio being turned off but I did have the issue sometimes where I couldn't hear what she was saying because the voice over was just really low.  And I don't mean the overall game voice volume was low, I mean HER voice was low.  I'm on Xbox One and from what I remember reading about her quest line, it's not platform specific.
---
 🐔
---
The circle just starts with a smaller size, they took the lazy route and chose to just use the first smaller circle so it is random and a lot of the time there isn't enough loot for all players
---
I drink real alcohol while playing and then make big ticket purchasing choices. Got me a Forest Asylum Uniform yesterday, probably overpaid, but it is so cute!
---
Thanks bethesda for breaking all of my favorite gear items.
---
I guess I will spend this weekend grinding experience to go back to a heavy PA build ... Oh wait, you broke PA too.
---
Maybe its time to try a build without any legendary effects at all.
---
I think they can work together, broad heads and bodkins are cool but I feel like that'd be a given and thus a bit boring, but yeah I do get where you're coming from.
---
Yes! We must fight the evil doers of this wasteland we call reddit! We will shed our blood and tears for our savior Todd Howard! In our days long past, they will sing songs of our heroic deeds! Ad Victorium!
---
Pretty much - it turns everything green
---
A furious explosive 10MM goes for 10k caps....what is the problem?  People that have that build and need that gun will pay that for it...Just because that specific gun is not worth 10k to you does not mean that it is not to someone else...I know you say you did not see the second effect but just stating if it was explosive.
---
Maybe when the first one got borked, it just left the rest hanging in line.
---
It's probably because the surviving intern tried to fix the +250 damage resistance when reloading.
---
Same here, Fallout 1st annual subscriber, bought lots of Atom stuff and ~~am~~ *was* a huge Bethesda fanboy. I even own a lot of stuff from the Bethesda Gear store, I just love the story/feel of the Fallout series, but at this rate, I'm highly tempted to just go back to Fallout 4 for a while.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
Exactly, no one seems to give a damn about other workshops either if you claim them (at least in my experience anyway) it only happens at that workshop
---
Lol. Ok. Thanks for the reply.
---
I sell mine for 50 caps a pop. 25 a pop if you buy stacks of em. Sometimes if people are wanting to drop nukes and have no key cards ill even just give them some for free so I can enjoy their nuke zone.
---
Wait what? Tell me exactly what happened?
---
Most popular workshop, Not sure why I hate it, to enclosed .. but yeah lots of trolls especially hit this one .. private server is your friend I think in this case ..
---
That's where this camp was. About south/Southwest of TTOTW
---
If you have access to a private world, that's the best place to claim a workshop.
---
Otherwise, set up the workshop with anti-NPC defenses protecting only the extractors you wish to use and their power sources. Lock the extractors, and only visit the workshop a couple of times per hour. When you do visit, stay crouched so that you don't show up on the map. If someone sees a player on the map at a workshop, they'll know it attack you. If they think you aren't there, they will be less likely to attack.
---
I take over workshops and use them to trick other PvPers to attack me. Since I do PvP solo rather than with a team, the few players who manage to kill me are still giving me more caps than I give them. A team of 4 will get 12-13 caps each time they kill me. I will get 50 caps each time I kill one of them. I usually get 4-12 kills for each death, so it's a great way to make caps.
---
Mid 2021 at the latest.
---
Oh I thought it started today. My bad but thanks!
---
Also OP there's a place on the map with over a hundred corn and razorgrain crops, over by the workshop farmstead in the forest
---
Encryptid was third of the four and it showed. It was really weird. I read and didn’t see anyone post about it and wanted to see if it was a me problem or an everyone problem.
---
So my buddies sent assassins armor with 200% durability broke after 3 seconds of taking the chainsaw to him. Also the armor legendary effects are broken after reloading any weapon. Can confirm on my vanguard
---
I've tried to remain positive since launch, I've taken breaks, but now at the end of the year, you would have thought they would have really given us something good as the last patch of the year.
---
I think that pretty much sums up their attitude towards the game atm.
---
Sounds reasonable
---
Christmas day and millions of users try to install 30-60 gig games the same morning.  Pity the pacific coasters who start last.
---
This is what I was looking for! I figured that the muscle was safe.
---
I never got it in a bundle, pretty sure it was available separately from the get go
---
It's the r/fo76 way!
---
It does both really, usually you slowly fall downwards with it which does indeed increase the height one can fall before hurting themselves, however that seems to have gone missing this patch.
---
Well it already is a sandbox and I personally think it's a good game 🤷‍♂️
---
And for what it's worth there were several vehicle mods for fo4 and they were mediocre at best.  Most were just awful.  Game engine just doesn't do vehicles properly.
---
I still think thats what it is. Lol. Hence the non fix.
---
if the only npc we ever had was rose i would be happy. rose is the only npc any game should ever have. need mod for fallout 4 to turn all the npcs into rose.
---
rose.
---
Grabbing popcorn
---
Ok Hannibal.
---
Grow up.
---
Honestly, you'd think they'd get *something* right at *some point*, just by random chance if nothing else.
---
Did this work for anyone?  I had thought about trying this some weeks back but haven't gotten around to it.
---
This could be a good way to put some scout armor mods out there, along with mods for Enclave weapons.  
---
Good post.
---
My harpoon gun is breaking about 75% faster now. 200% durability with 5 star gunsmith can’t even get
---
me 15 shots
---
It does both in my experience.
---
Are you on PS4? I know several players who would buy all of them from you. I think one of the players bought 85-100 recently just to have a pile to last a few weeks.
---
There is one final build, those who use it are never heard from again though...
---
I make and sell my vintage nukashine for 60 caps each. People with farms could probably sell for less because it's less hassle but it's good money for the grind you have to do. If you do BIVs quests maybe ballistic boc, and a few others would sell well. Other than that nukashine nukashine nukashine
---
Just frustrating that people keep getting kicked out of servers
---
Patch notes came out. They went full Grinch. Mea culpa
---
The only scenario I can get behind
---
I mean a fully open and custom sandbox....remove junk, paint walls, pave roads, demolish buildings...etc....a sandbox
---
If the 3rd effect is 25% less vats, that's a 12 to 15K gun.  I didn't get the post either.  Price didn't seem way out of line to me.
---
I want to be running around dropping presents in the Northern lights T51!
---
None. It's clear at this point that they're relying exclusively on automated testing tools. What's broken today took players all of, what, ten minutes to discover and diagnose? Any internal playtesting at all within the last week would have shown there was something horribly wrong with their most ballyhooed bugfix.
---
Yeah, I'm just relying mostly on Unarmed melee for now.
---
It's surprising how much I rely on the Unyielding effect though.  I mean, my alt uses Wood Armor, which weighs practically nothing.  I thought I kept her to a fairly minimal assortment of weapons, diligent about ammo, plans, and other sources of hidden weight.  And yet she's basically at 270 WT, which is my non-Unyielding limit.
---
So it's not limited to weapons then? Oh great.
---
Can you file a support ticket for me here?  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Good news: We've fixed the +250 resistance while reloading legendary effect!
---
Bad new: We reverted the last 15 patches to do it.
---
Phew. Thank you for just doing the missing images. I thought I was going to have to scroll through 214 images just to see what I missed.
---
Can you file a support ticket for me so we can look into this?  [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)
---
Yeah I'm confused and scared what happened?
---
You’re selling it for 60 caps in your vendor store? Do you find that people buy it?
---
Of course. Why should I have the right to complain about a product I paid for?
---
Ah, I'm on PC. Yeah, you get the plans for the recon rifle at the terminal outside Fort Defiance after you've done some of the Brotherhood quests. It's basically a hunting rifle with a suppressor, recon scope and some other mods already attached.
---
awhile back one of the community managers said some luv for the chainsaw is coming down the pipeline.
---
just no word as to when.
---
My camp is right by there! I’ve been running over daily :)
---
I agree!
---
I wrote a post saying the same thing
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e33kvu/project_paradise_needs_to_be_removed_from_timed/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
Also, I agree, it's a great game :)
---
Bethesda announces free trial to get new players. 
---
Also bethesda, breaks armor system for trial.
---
Guess im going to be playing my melee guy for a while. Been wanting to try out my 3star buzz blade.
---
And the NCR M16
---
This is the case for every workshop since they shut down the Survival mode servers, sadly. I've had to cut back on my power armor use since the power stations are essentially instant death now :(
---
Yeah my QE Harpoon wa as breaking like crazy today.
---
We're investigating these reports and will let you know as soon as we have more information on this.
---
This is really a necessary or they night as well remove it from the game. It's a shame too cause it's great content. Probably my favorite event but I dont di it anymore cause solo is basically 1 room at level 1.
---
So many small improvements they could make that would do so much for this game.
---
Reloading breaks every major prefix on armor, this includes excavators extra carry weight, and the stranglers Poison effect, and im fairly certain the vault armors ( solar and thorn ) are affected as well. Guns seem unaffected as far as i can tell. Only gun problem ive seen is the Durability of harpoon guns. With max gunsmith, they break in less then 20 shots.
---
Oh yeah. It's almost useless because of the black out effect,but that's the best part lol. What I do is put 10 in my drink container for people to take for free, and then sell the rest. It helps!
---
I'm finding all weapons seem to break much quicker
---
Is this reloading every gun or just 250?
---

---
 &gt; We're investigating these reports and will let you know as soon as we have more information on this.
---
Dual wield weapons like in Skyrim. Have like left hand ability/right hand ability.
---
the 250DR WR bug that has plagued us for like a year has now been filtered down to include legendary armor sets and PA sets as well (Strangler Heart, Liberty Prime).
---
When you reload guns now, all of your legendary effects stop working. 
---
There are numerous sources of proof on this subreddit  and videos showing it happening realtime.
---
I live in urban atlanta, GA.  my upload is 16.7 and my download is 66.8
---
Different strokes and all that, but I think this is one of the best datamines I've seen. Tons of cool shit and a lot with the scrappy wasteland aesthetic.
---
They should have added the multiplayer code onto FO4, which also has a lot of bugs that still haven't been fixed since launch, and released it as a free DLC to test the capabilities. That way they wouldn't have gotten review bombed as the game already had a successful launch and good reviews, and people would have been happy with some new content added to an old game. When they ironed out all the issues, they then could have started work on Fallout 76.
---
Just feels like a massively rushed game that shipped out not just 1 year too early, but possibly 2 years.
---
I have it and it's not worth it. The light levels in the game are never low enough to make it necessary. It's not needed for dailies either since you can use the zoom lens you get for finishing the tourist quest to mod a camera.
---
i had to have the nuke dome me to get it on xbox (landed right on me)
---
They *really* need to at least double the amount of pics allowed.
---
I started playing the first day of beta and had 50 pics before the third session. 
---
I would live to continue taking pics but I have so many that mean something to me that I don’t want to delete.
---
Imagine dual meat hooks??!!
---
Anyone who remotely thinks Wastelanders will roll out smoothly only has to look at this ass clownery. How do you break the armour system.
---
Every gun. So unless your running a melee character. Your SOL.
---
I’m on my third character, Started the the Enclave missions a few weekends ago. Every single time I would have to restart the game to get a quest marker too show me where to go and trigger the missions etc.
---
“Collect the invisible cargo drop is impossible”
---
Gave up in the end.
---
Prone sniper position.
---
They also said they'd never have utility items in the ATOM shop or a subscription service, yet here we are.
---
Great idea!  Upvoted
---
I hate waiting around for many of these events to happen.  This, like you said, needs a lot of coordination to run properly.
---
Thanks I will add you on Xbox what’s ur gamer tag
---
How did they break PA?
---
Because those of us who have been around for a while think you are just jumping on the bandwagon.
---
Your kind who wants bethedsa to shut down, they left about a month ago.  You should join them.
---
You have been a member of this reddit for 2 days, dont pretend like your a vet here, you arnt. 
---
Take your hate and go back to youtube.  We dont want you here, you are nothing but a troublemaker.
---
prone in general, why don't we already have prone??
---
Now we’re talking
---
Nope. Just PA.
---
Agree 100%. My holiday vacation doesn’t even begin until the week of so I’m not going to be able to take full advantage
---
Im also experiencing damage loss, on scorched enemys, especially on SBQ. I was shooting at her damaging for 130, reloading the weapon, the damage decreases to 86. Adrenaline wasnt active, just the usual buffs.
---
Do they only have fresh high school graduates working on this game or something?
---
So even if I dont have the 250DR WR on a weapon,when I reload itll break the armor effects?
---
I keep a few high priced weapons just so people won’t buy them. For some reason nobody will come to your store unless you have 5-10 weapons.
---
Thanks for the reply.  Do the "exposed" pictures have a green tint to them as well or do you only see the night vision effect looking through the view finder?
---
It uses the same instancing technology as vault 94 it’s gonna suck
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
Well, you'll be getting some of your wish, as there's a clean, repaired porcelain toilet and a clean porcelain sink in the latest ATOM Shop datamine.
---
I am a vet alright. You just don't know it. I have been here since day one. Deleted my old account for reasons. Made a lot of hot posts back in the day.
---
You think I made the reddit account from the day I started playing? Lol. I have had this game from day one.
---
Liberty/Shadow Prime voice mechanics go off all at once.
---
Strangler Heart loses its effects if you reload your weapon.
---
What are you guys talking about? Did they add a third map?
---
I don’t roleplay much.... but when I die and reincarnate into  my fallout Valhalla I’m gonna need working plumbing.
---
@ piggysmom
---
See you in the wasteland!
---
Glow sight honestly
---
The event doesn't start until Thursday
---
You're not a game developer are you...
---
i’ll check out the whitepring bunker again, and sugar grove and capitol too, thanks!
---
Does this apply to Vanguard aswell?
---
Online games just end.  They dont become singleplayer offline models. 
---
This has never happened in the history of an online only game.
---
Well, today they managed to break nearly all of the Legendary effects and revert the weapon durability buffs, all while trying to fix a single Legenday effect.
---
Make of that what you will...
---
Already have it
---
Nah even if you wont give in most people will and buy an extra $20 of atoms plus their monthly sub especially if they put one of those Xdays left tags on it
---
That would be awesome for my new pistol alt
---
studies already prove that loading a game from a disk is not only faster but more cost effective in materials than a download.  The benefits to download is the just in time, slipstreamed, bug fixes (looking at you Bethesda) and content additions.  Game companies literally have months extra to get it right before launch if they don't load from disk.
---
Yes there is, cheap plans, chems, &amp; ammo. I sell all sorts of things super cheap and players buy it up. 
---
I’ve been having a hard time keeping things in stock. 
---
Also, everything in life is location location location. Whitesprings and near Vault 76 are prime shop locations.
---
I've only ever noticed the slow drop when on a team and they have the mutation card
---
I'm pretty sure *we're* the play-testers, in Bethesda's eyes.
---
icicle lights?!
---
Welp, guess I'm done serving up Democracy.
---
I use whiskey + Mentats to make and sell Grape Mentats. Don't lose any money at all as I run across a lot of Mentats in my travels. When I have about 30 I make a bunch with chemist and super duper and throw them in my vending machine.
---
He has good points , i have been since release and im tired of people letting Todd fuck em in their asses. There is so many fanboys that blindly accept everything Bugthesda does. 
---
It will never get better as long people accept all the fuckups after almost every patch! Start downvoting....im used to that for speaking my mind
---
Wow. This instills faith in the quality of Wastelanders, doesn't it?
---
Thank you.
---
Im suspecting those reasons are as follows:
---
1: Your a dick, so got moderated to shit, and made alot of enemies.  At least I dont try to hide behind a new name.  
---
2: You dupe
---
3: you dupe
---
4: you exploit
---
5: you teach people how to do 2, 3 or 4
---
Go away douchebag.
---
I would add 1 point in rifleman, expert rifleman, and master rifleman.  That gives you 30 pct dmg boost as opposed to 3 ranks in any single one.  Then max out tank killer.
---
Later down the line you can select glow sight which actually works on melee attacks too.  This is handy in nuke zones at Whitesprings.  After the nuke you can just switch the rifleman perks back on.
---
I think it only gives you the choice if you have both the collectron and the santatron. I only have santa and i have checked several times now. No option on the terminal. Currently my santatron is getting junk like stuff. But i think on the 12th when the holiday event kicks off is when it will start grabbing presents and stuff. 
---
I think they dropped it with the update so people can make room for it in their camps because theyve been messing with the cost of items. So people may have to make some room for it.
---
Actually costume and mask is for leveling 5 times(I won't be doing this) but the mask one for events don't seem to at all register for the masks I wear.
---
It effects everything.  Prices, AP, health, weight, damage...this just sucks.
---
I think it only does that if you've bought the standard Collectron.
---
Damn. And here I was thinking about starting a new character. Maybe I'll stick with NFS Heat and Black Desert for a bit longer.
---
We are the alpha testers
---
I think that starts until the 12th
---
sell them for 50caps, they'll go quick quick
---
They said theyd never put it offline. They cant make a profit off it if it is. They did say they were gonna put a sub in.  And a tweet by an employee means nothing. The whole handling and lack of clarity for 76 was done on purpose. If they can make a profit off it, they will. This has been known for years and people are just now acting surprised by it.
---
Im gonna go check now.
---
Isn't the green thumb bundle in the atom shop?  I thought the fences were originally in there?
---
Seems like playing a Berserker's build isn't as bad now lol
---
Guess I’ll spend time this evening working on my neglected camp.   
---
Geesh. I’d be fired letting this shit go out.
---
Are you serious ? The map is scaled to the number of players now?
---
If that is the case , that really sucks.
---
Yep, QE does break after 4-5 reloads. It's as if every single flechette hit deducted a part from durability bar, that was previously counted per whole shot - so essentially 5 times faster degradation.
---
Also every reload does break Strangler's poison dmg. Just wow.
---
God yes, I’m glad this Responders PA suit doesn’t seem to be just a color scheme for an existing set with some logos slapped on it, it actually looks unique. Here’s hoping they do unique faction-themed PA sets for every faction. (i’d KILL for a Mothman Cult PA skin)
---
That's a good strat. I already have Glow Sights whoch I use in nuke zones. So tank killer it is, then.
---
Oh god I want that jacket.
---
I was a melee/sniper, but found the combo difficult when trying to take out things that fly, so I switched to melee/heavy weapons (bear arms and stabilized)
---
That said, I also have tank killer for the times I feel like sniping. (for example, when defending a workshop from outside the zone)  If you can afford the points, you can have both exp rifleman and tank killer.
---
Nope! I just checked.. I think they may have just came out at the same time?🤔
---
Unfortunately when a online game dies that's usually it. Good online games that keep a player base continue going on. Diablo2 is a good example of that, it's 20 years old and people still play it.
---
Oh thank god I only need to get 1001 xp this event
---
Man if i would do my job as bad as these fucking clowns my boss would eat me and fire me on the spot
---
I'd imagine they'll keep adding more content as it now gone to a game service with fallout first if not well that's a crappy move
---
I admit, it would be a "We give up, we're shutting down the servers before we loose more money, see if you can do anything with this" situation, but it could happen.
---
Just hop into a server with a friend and have him pick a lock I  your camp over and over
---
Thinking of coming back a bit, is NW just pick up and play? Never tried it
---
Yep, it was in the patch notes, if a bit unclearly. This clarifies it a bit. Most of my favorite places are on the edges of the circles, so this sucks.
---
&gt;Open a Holiday Gift it to see what the Scorched have given you, which may be anything from crafting components to aid items, or even rare plans.
---
How rare are we talking? Plasma grenade plans or?
---
I said it before that it’s gonna suck
---
And then you cancel. 😂
---
This will never happen because they'd love for you to buy more Atoms *on top of* the 1st Atoms.  As time goes on, they will inevitably skew the prices of bundles, outfits, and Power Armor to chew up 1,650 Atoms quickly.
---
Dang that sucks.  I initially was going to mention that you could have a friend that owns the fences build them for you but I don't think you can do that with atom shop stuff.
---
I’m thinking that Bethesda is experimenting on us like the vaults did with the occupants, not sure why they’d do it but come on, they can’t be that bad at programming that every single patch they put out creates new problems, I’ve played this game since the stress test and seen a lot of bugs and a lot problems they’ve created with patches and this is the only reason I can come up with for all of it, unless they truly are a bunch of idiots that don’t know what they’re doing, or letting trainees do the patches while the  real programmers work on new games. I don’t know anymore, I thought it would get better with time but it’s a struggle anymore.
---
Seems I chose a very bad day to re-install for a fresh playthrough...
---
Guess everyone likes to nuka the shine
---
just do it.
---
DO IT!!!
---
I made and used nukashine as an alternative to Fast Travel.  It usually got me near to where I wanted to end up :)
---
Yea why not be able to equip them with a qd lever when you craft them for like  an additional cost of a spring and some aluminum? I feel like that's kind of cool and more realistic.
---
Yeah I hate flying shit. I can fuck up Scorchbeasts when they land but as long as they are flying I do fuckall damage.
---
Yepp. Idk how they managed to screw this patch up so badly. You would think simple things like, reloading your weapon breaking just about everything, would be noticed when they do testing. Apparently i had too much faith in them.
---
No. OP just has no clue what they are saying.
---
I hope the fact it says Holiday "Kickoff" means more to come, and soon. There was sooooo much stuff in the data mine I was looking forward to.
---
Breaking it is half the problem.
---
The other half is that during those two hours of maintenance, no one thought to make sure a very, very basic game system still worked.
---
Both of these maps are fine. With tons of loot. You just caught a lobby that all picked the same location.
---
I wore a surgical mask and it registered so I know at least that one does.
---
This is horrible . 
---
Bethesda had completely lost it .
---
This was literally the only thing left to enjoy in this game (NW MODE) and now they just had to screw that up as well.
---
Who asked for this ?! worst idea ever !!!
---
Excavator extra weight bonus gone, the normal +100 vanishes once you reload
---
Tank killer is a very solid perk.  You might want to do 2 in tank killer and 1 in concentrated fire if you like using vats. 
---
I run a rifleman build and do the exact same thing with melee.  Lol. I have all my rifle perks maxed and then took 3 points in iron fist for my "up close and personal" combat.
---
Have you actually tested any of that or are you just posting it? For me neither fast travelling, nor using the scrapbox breaks anything. I tested and unyielding and bolstering fully break. Excavator breaks for a second then fixes itself. Mutants, vanguards, as well as several misc secondary effects don't break at all. 
---
Not sure if people are just making certain things up or if it is varying per consoles or players(?).
---
I work in IT. Some of our customers in central USA take literal hours to download GPS Map updates. Literal DSL speeds for companies moving hundreds of thousands of $ in product daily. It's ridiculous, but that's just reality in countries with this much land-mass.
---
1% chance.
---
I can confirm that
---
I like a lot of it as well, I was just hoping for a little more holiday stuff. I'm sure it will be coming within the next two weeks.
---
What a joke! This was meant to fix an armor prefix broken for a long time, not break them all.. We need to all be paid as beta testers! not be paying for a subscription service to this.
---
The jacket looks almost exactly like the winter jacket and jeans... how original...
---
It's not much of a Christmas tree without lights is it?
---
Iv played nw a lot and though the map are great.
---
Ah yes, another armour paint to add to the collection.
---
191210-002204
---
Beserker’s playthrough? Can’t break what isn’t there (taps forehead)
---
Their 2 for 1 sale on the dark and light wooden floor is a joke.. I already have the dark one but not the light one and the price was still 400 atoms
---
Because there’s no question. No one can convince you to play more. You made a long winded statement that you’ve done everything and that you’re bored and leaving. Ok? No one can add anything to that.  If I came up to you and said “Red cars are red” what exactly would you add to that? There’s no discussion here. You’re bored. Goodbye
---
Probably a low level or someone who has no actual idea about the game or how to build a character and what guns to use for that character.
---
Well this christmas event should be even more fun then right?
---
We did some testing on this and it appears to be a visual glitch.  After shooting into the chest before a reload and after a reload, the damage taken to the chest remained the same even though the DMR on the chest showed lower after the person reloaded his 250 DRWR weapon.
---
I know right? I really want the greenhouse dome but I’ve literally bought everything else individually in the bundle.
---
Well if the map places itself in a way that here are only 3 actual loot spots of course 10 of the 30 players will got to those, what else are you supposed to do? Spawn in the middle of nowhere and die because you only have a pipe gun and a wood armor?
---
Where do you get the Nika recipes from?
---
I am gonna grind those ... a lot!
---
This happens every patch or update. This sub gets filled with trolls that claim everything is broken. Instead of filling a ticket with Bethesda, they come on here to lie.
---
Presents, yes. Currently it was supposed to gather candies.
---
it is a waste of time and resources unless you can get to a private world.
---
What is missing?  Still updating. Now I’m scared to go in when done
---
So I guess some things which are labelled as "masks" don't count, good to know that.
---
Now if only most events weren't bugged.
---
Im sorry to have tell you: Yes you are my friend
---
Except berserker wouldn't work either most likely 😂😂
---
You have to own the collectron bot to be able to switch the santa bot over
---
But I wanted to do a GUN playthrough! With handguns! And armor! Both of those things are broken :(
---
My first character was a sort of berserker melee person, I felt like doing something different.
---
Dang, I totally forgot about the free weekend.  That makes this a five-alarm fire.
---
yup.  Took me what seemed like forever to take one down a L50 with a combat rifle.  pretty much useless once I started dealing with L65s and higher.  
---
Now vertibots, cargobots, and SBs when airborne all get AA LMG, resolute veteran, or troubleshooters gatling.  No problems :)
---
Yea, I like choices.  Weapon WR Armor plus bear arms (or PA + bear arms) makes them stupid light.
---
:D
---
Actually everything is broken. Reloading ANY weapon will break your armor effects.
---
Yes, can confirm + other folks at another thread. It's ridiculous.
---
Keep looking just in case though, for science
---
I love my Bloody Commando. I can shoot them right out of the sky!
---
I can confirm. Tried to build them at teammates camp and not able.
---
Its okay, you are welcome to join my soon to be Bash Bugthesda club 👌
---
Was chameleon functional for the individual doing the shooting?
---
I'm 100% convinced the departments at Bethesda do not communicate at all. Theres no way they even have QA testers as well.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
How many are in a stack?  And how do you accumulate "STACKS" of them?  I am just being a smart ass here but I am pretty sure that shooting down a cargobot is the only way to acquire one so how do you get "STACKS" of them?
---
Building camps is pretty much my favorite part. I have a kitchen, bathroom, living room, study, bedroom, garage and a small shop stand. I think it makes it a little more realistic, or as realistic as it can be.
---
Flatwoods map has tons of locations with tons of good loot. As does morgantown. Youre being obtuse.
---
im gonna get them all eventually, but that hat looks mighty fine
---
So, I've been playing since BETA, and I just hit level 50. I still haven't done the final quest, but otherwise I feel like I've done just about everything else in the game other than getting a backpack. To get to triple figure levels, are people just going around shooting shit up?
---
Just so that you are aware they added a "feature" that "smaller" lobbies below I guess 33 people start with an already restricted map.
---
I'd say quest markers are less reliable now than they've ever been in the past, which is pretty embarrassing.
---
The beserker legendary effect only works if you aren’t wearing armor is what I meant. But yeah, that’s pretty niche. I was mostly joking. Believe me we’re all hoping this is fixed soon.
---
I'm part of those who build great camps or at least i try my best. I have a splendid house with everything you need ,all decorated and blabla. But wasting a foundation and budget to make  and decorate a bathroom that is completely useless is not ok to me.
---
I got loads of nukashine don't drink it much unless from people's punch bowls but I do enjoy making it. I have a punch bowl in my camp it's only filled with beer honest 🙈
---
Not in smaller lobbies
---
Im playing it right now. Both maps are the same they have always been
---
They were literally JUST retired last week. I doubt they're going to bring them back that quick 😂
---
I built it on pretty flat ground so I can’t speak to that portion of it. But I would say it doesn’t take up a whole bunch more space than it looks. 
---
The only issue I have with it is that the walls are curved so sometimes when I try to put stuff inside it won’t fit, especially tall stuff. 
---
I no longer have it in my camp but loved it while it was there!
---
Yea or keep it as a pet! 😂
---
Only cool if they actually do something though. Like the shower removes rads. Sink can be used for getting water/drinks. Toilet could be used for uhhh.... drinks? Like in previous games...I wouldn't want to drink out of it but to each their own. Maybe the washer and dryer could spawn loose change or something.
---
im gonna assume it uses the same list as mischief night, since about half my masks didnt count.
---
This new patch is truly a gift that keeps on giving.
---
when you hear the automated alert ALWAYS check the map to see if YOU are the next nuke target.
---
and this might not happen again, cheers.
---
Just refund everything else and buy the bundle
---
**Science**
---
An instigating hunting rifle with +10% aim damage is the best you can get without bloody or junkies.  With a perforating mag and .50 or prime receiver, it will kill almost anything with a head shot.
---
An explosive 2nd effect will splash into nearby enemies, ruining the instigating double damage.
---
If I don’t want to be bloody on my rifleman for some reason, I use an instigating hunting rifle and AA/E handmade.  Anti armor isn’t the strongest effect, but it doesn’t have the two shot penalties and doesn’t require you to build up damage like Furious.  Furious is way better if you do commando, but rifleman isn’t really a volume play style.  I guess either option is good.  I prefer anti armor.  It’s much more effective vs high level enemies with lots of DR, like scorchbeasts, sheepsquatch, etc.
---
We didn't test that part - sorry.
---
Melee kicks
---
It is not a trap, it is just a skin that replaces the brown paper bag. That would have been interesting though!
---
Tell Bethesda
---
Only if your lobby is bigger than 32 people, I played 8 matches and all but one were exactly 32 people big and those are pre-restricted in size
---
Because, you know 5 minutes of testing would have found this but... Bethesda.
---
Im playing it right now. Everything is the same except now i get to vote where i want to be. Im literally playing it as we speak.
---
I put a point in each commandos and tank killer 3 for SBs
---
If you are talking about the NW halloween redo, then I think just about any costume counts.  Try the skull/skeleton found at freddys and the north lookout tower.
---
IIRC, the ones BSG provided in the chest during mischief night  were skeleton mask and tinfoil hat.
---
VERY likely, all I know is the skull mask(the non-hooded thing from atom shop) doesn't work nor did my plague mask.
---
Haven't played NW in a couple of months, but I'm curious for perspective on why this would be a bad thing. Wouldn't the matches just go quicker?
---
Literally playing it right now. Im really bad so im several games in. Everything is the same.
---
Biv, the drunk robot in Morgantown.
---
No, this is different.  In this case, the Event Completed screen isn't postponed until the next time that UI element is summoned - it actually never shows up, and apparently, neither do the rewards.
---
Camden Park dailies are definitely affected by this.
---
This is too relatable. Except I do this all the time and my friends hate me. Except I have no friends and it’s really just my body pillow.
---
Icicle lights! Lol I found them trying to find ways to decorate my camp bc I’m too broke to buy actual Christmas lights. They’re under the lights tab when editing your C.A.M.P.
---
Bullshit ! You cowards never respond to anything ! Fucking screwups!
---
I am wearing a mask and costume and am only getting credit for the “complete events” and not “level up”. Not sure what’s up
---
I like this idea
---
The buff alcohols are good, ballistic bak etc. I can never have enough tbh, I use that with psychotats when I need to do more damage.
---
Im having problems logging in. Says their hard at work getting the servers back online? Any ideas??
---
molly (my character) and a are always down to adventure with other vault dwellers, you can add "us" @ psn: dj\_midknight .
---
I know, just wanted to let my despair out. I hope it does get fixed as I really want to pew pew with some handguns.
---
I tested this on both my characters and I'm not getting this issue.  Try reloading into a new world?
---
no they are not I´m playing as well, if the lobby is saturated under \~33 people you start the map with the circle already in second stage so \~half the size and if 32 people spawn in such a small raduiy there is not enough loot, morgan town might be ok but flatwoods has like 2-3 loot spots and half the macth will spawn there
---
Does your XP reset each time you earn one of the prizes off the tier?  Some of this looks cool but I'm poor at NW and get tired of hiding in bushes. Lol
---
Hmm..it looks like he is getting the rewards (in inventory), just no screen, which is why I thought it was the same issue.
---
I was super confused by the “install the T-type fuse” part in the beginning of the game. It’s really confusing and that damn building is like a maze, not to mention the fuse box looks like an insignificant wall texture.
---
There is a handful of cool Christmas items being released for NW prizes. Looked like a wreath, presents, and a Charlie brown Xmas tree.
---
For the  next time this challenge pops up : There is a potential Sheepsquatchspawn behind the top of the world.  If you approach the red structure from the direction of the trainstation stay to the left of it. You willfind  a line of Ski-Lifts  leading down to an area  with a few 'tents' and crates. Sheepy spawns somewhat halfway between the top and the tents. I serverhop there a few times and BAM. challenge done.
---
Is it a visual glitch or actually affect stats?
---
If you think I'm lying here it is copied straight from the changelog:
---
&gt; We’ve updated Nuclear Winter so that the Storm will now automatically constrict the starting area to account for the number of players that begin a match .
---
&gt; When this occurs, the Storm will not deal increased damage at the start of the match, even though the playable area is smaller.
---
    This will help encourage combat from the beginning of a match and reduce time spent hunting for other Candidates. It will also make for a quicker match overall, so that you can requeue to find a better match.
---
    We made these changes so that players can spend more time on the battlefield, less time in the matchmaking queue, and get to the fun more quickly in cases where creating a full match may take longer than expected.
---
They definitely need PT servers
---
Flatwoods has tons of loot spots. The resort is good, the bridge is good, the obstical course is good. The camp is good. Helvetia and all surrounding areas are good. Flatwoods is good. Literally anywhere you go on that map has several good loot spots.
---
yup, it's a thing.
---
&gt;In addition to this set of fixes, we plan to address many more localization bugs with the **Wastelanders update next year.**  
---
Does this indicate that the next update this game receives will be the Wastelanders update?
---
I NEEEEEEED IT ALL!!!!!
---
They added an actual bathroom sink today; you should put that in your bathroom!
---
Considering the Free Weekend this weekend... that's the cherry of top.
---
Seriously! You really had to watch your back! Wasteland feels so flat now that I don't need to do that anymore.
---
Actually I got the Responder Fireman Uniform from an Enclave event in the Savage Divide.
---
I have an enclave plasma pistol with a flamer barrel on it
---
And i have been playing for like two days and i already came across so many legendaries, did the devs up their spawns?
---
Maybe it's a euphemism for "dog food"
---
Munitions was worth it last year when the game came out and the ammo production rate was like 3x faster than it is now. You can take the factors and set it up and then you come back 30 min later to 14 308. Rounds... not worth the random scorchbeast attacks IMO
---
That makes me kind of bummed tbh, NW is just not my cup of tea and that would be a long miserable grind for me. Maybe I can find a team to carry me haha
---
Says nothing about the loot. Thats what we are talking about. Both maps have tons of good spots for loot. Even if you start in a smaller circle. You need to find better places to loot is what im saying. The loot is everywhere. The loot isnt effected.
---
So how would that explain Excavator armor losing the additional carry weight buff, pushing people into the "overencumbered" state? That cannot be just visual.
---
But it's cumulative if you do the runs later. Eg. the 7000 XP for the 2nd last reward also counts towards the last reward, and so forth.
---
Finally a decent looking rug to go with all these nice flooring and wallpaper. Hate throwing a dirty ass rug down in an otherwise nice-looking room. Minigun paint is sweet. Is the holiday survival tent free for 1st?
---
PA should be fixed by then. Im sure i got an excavator set i can dust off somewhere. Lol.
---
Unfortunately yes
---
Sure be nice if you gave credit to u/SageAZ for using the link and information.
---
Is this true? I’m out.
---
Had hoped for the vault tec silent generator always next week least the atom shop music is nice to listen too
---
Goodbye. But I did ask a lot of questions actually so not sure you actually read it. But goodbye
---
There is a new post that shows the amount of xp needed to get the stuff. It looks like it might take 3 matches of hiding in the bushes to earn it which wouldn't be too bad. Lol
---
Done. 
---

---
I have two video captures from Xbox that I recorded and downloaded of it happening as well, but there was no option to send them my ticket. They show the exact problem with the lines repeating and it causing a significant amount of lag when around a number of enemies. Is there a way to send them in?
---
Are you?
---
Already got a new character rocking Sanctuary after saving Preston  and his gang :D
---
offline mode
---
Taking it off then putting it back on works for the carry weight. Doesn't help the overall issue tho
---
Unfortunately your Unyielding will stop buffing your stats when you reload it looks like.
---
Perk of a years sub, not monthly.
---
Nope, you have to finish the current one before you can work on the next exp, as stated in the patch note.
---
Ok so it’s automatic. Gotcha thanks.
---
Yes, it's been posted about several times, and responded to by BGS
---
Dang. Well the first 3 items are probably within my reach. Lol
---
God the potential of this game is huge and ideas like this really show how the little things can add up fast. I really hope watelanders is a big turning point for this game.
---
you don´t get the point, all those areas are NOT in the map if you get a lobby with 32 or less people
---
I don't remember anyone requesting this feature.
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Didn't know his reddit account. Now I do. Credited in the OP.
---
That might be doable haha
---
but I'm not leaving, I said I'm probably going to have to after checking out Wastelanders because there's nothing keeping me playing. I would love to have a reason to stick around, I like the game still, but I think it's more so the idea of the game in my head that I like more than the game itself, I'm being realistic. And I'm also looking for advice and tips, what do you all do in this game at a high level? What keeps you around?
---
There's a lot more to my post than "I'm leaving"... :\
---
Yep food spoils 5x faster now even with the good with salt perk equipped at lvl 3.  Sad to watch cranberries spoil just after picking them and fast traveling to cook with them.  Also I now get about 1200 rounds out of my handmade rifle before it breaks from 200% with lvl 5 gunsmith.  However 2 days ago I emptied over 2000 rounds our of it and it was barely down to half of the 200% repair.  On the upside now, my turrets mow also destroy themselves even faster now.
---
Yeah they changed it. It says in the patch notes. You have to earn them one at a time.
---
Same lol
---
Honestly, I just afk and mess around my switch while grinding out these events.
---
Old time christmas music might not be a bad thing to listen to. Any new music in general would be nice of course.
---
To be honest, we have potato internet. It really does take a day or two to install a game.
---
Fml
---
The wreath and tree look pretty cool. I will probably try it at least.  And this weekend is double experience so it should be too horrible.
---
Bit more than one of them will be. Thats my point. No matter where the circle goes, there are still tons of places to get good loot from. You just havent explored enough. Change your play style a bit. Be a bit more hesitant in the start. Use your 30 seconds of invis to your benefit.
---
I think you are witnessing their test regime right now
---
This has been going on for months now
---
A sink will fit in your kitchen or behind your bar if your one of the people building that...
---
But also theres people that want that a realistic house..bathrooms, living rooms, back decks on their house etc
---
Hope yall have a dang good team. Cant wait to get back to nw
---
You know you’ve hit rock bottom when even your body pillow turns on you. 😭
---
Berserkers is now the new bloodied. 2000 might be a little cheap!
---
To whack filthy commies
---
Can you send them to me? I can pass the along with the ticket
---
i would say, no.
---
since you are unsure. it frees system resources for those who are sure they want to play this game.
---
Not everyone has great internet, i know from experience
---
Find a nice thick hedge to hide in and cruise the trade subreddit is my go-to move. Lol.
---
Someone called me a "Bush Wookie". LOL
---
Zing!
---
  Unless the quest has changed from when I did it, it is possible that marker may not be wrong.
---
Try temp turning off all other quests except this one in the data tab.  If the marker remains, then there a couple things you still need to do.
---
Also, does the diamond on the door have text associated with it (some of my markers have the required task written next to the diamond)
---
It took them 6 months to add 1 song. Good luck
---
Then you might not want to look at the datamined survival tent skin which has a perfectly good christmas tree with lights in it.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/LQfw8j8.png](https://i.imgur.com/LQfw8j8.png)
---
I kind of liked the idea of having a general decorative tree, not necessarily an ostensibly Christmas one.  This tree doesn't seem to animate though, at least in the CAMP preview, so it looks a bit odd.
---
Well guess we are fucking not doing it then. Why do they think turning the game into a full time job is fun? Is this their idea of increasing playtime? By keeping us hostage?
---
Yeah sometimes I am losing only part of my stats, but it definitely happens.
---
I hear ya. That said, the first 20 or so levels are pretty meagre when it comes to legendary armor, so if you start now hopefully they’ve fixed it by the time you start scoring good armor. I’m gonna spend the time fixing up my camps I think.
---
All of them are broken- Bethesda is aware and has commented on the many posts.
---
Underrated comment and deserving of my upvote.
---
I love it! I’ve been doing it for about four months now. Set up my camp as a wasteland bar.
---
I sell everything you can craft at the brewing station for the sake of completeness and I noticed that what sells best is ballistic boc, holt voltage hefe, rum, nuka dark and nukashine. Coincidentally 4/5 of those drinks can only be crafted, not found.
---
Some advice I’ll give you is sell booze for the pleasure of it, not for the caps. Because in my experience players will not buy alcohol if you charge enough to make a profit, as they would (I’m assuming) rather just craft or buy these items elsewhere. Players are willing to pay for convenience, but not that much.
---
The only time you could get away with charging more is if one of the weekly challenges is “drink 10 different types of alcohol.” Because you’ll often have people just wanting to complete the challenges ASAP and don’t have the time or patience to craft said items themselves - assuming they’ve actually done Biv’s quests and have the recipes.
---
How much budget does it take up?  Same as the bungalow?
---
how about some “Bigggg Iron... Biggg Iron”!
---
I just tried testing this on two different characters. Both have a full set of Unyielding armor and both used a 50 Cal as the test. The first character was not affected while the second one was. Not sure why exactly it's discriminating against one character.
---
Also, in testing I found that crouching while reloading makes you safe. However, swapping weapons after reloading while still crouching will remove any primary armor effect.
---
you still don´t get the point... at max there are 2 or 3 of those good loot spots in the restricted start circle, and with 30 people in the match those places are crowded at start there is just no way to do any exploring since after those 30 seconds of invis you are straight in a gun fight
---
most of the time you don´t even get a chest in those 30 seconds... I killed so many people without a gun already and vice versa
---
So the +250 DR bug has been successfully extended to ALL weapons now. Fuck these devs.
---
I have exactly same. Not even need to reload, just melee build in use and stats are "minus".
---
This is exactly why we need beta branch, it's pretty clear that the developers don't test these patches before deploying to live. Probably just run some automated test that makes sure game doesn't crash at launch.
---
are you crazy? nobody wants that....... :)
---
Exactly lol
---
We know.
---
Think you might be right! ☺️
---
Where can you find the recipes for the drinks you mentioned that you like to brew?
---
I noticed this too..swapping is a breaks it too..
---
It is even worse than the 259dr bug
---
How so?
---
Will do.
---
Youre wrong though. There are what you "think" are only 2 or 3 good loot spots. Change the way you play a bit and youll start making very good use of sone blue box and melee weapons. 
---
Theres always time to explore.
---
I think it's one of the coolest Camp pieces they've made.  It takes up a decent amount of budget but there's still tons of space leftover to make a big Camp.  It's not hard to place but because of its size and shape, it can be difficult to work with. I think it depends on how creative of a builder you are.    It comes with a foundation-less version of the dome which I've been using as a second story on my builds, but because its round and we only have square floors, it can be challenging to make things work.  If you just want to simply place the foundation version on its own, then its great.  It's certainly a fun piece to work with if you enjoy building.
---
No, you're not... although I kind of like how generic it is.
---
LOL!
---
I’m just thinking about the old and simple classics like Jingle Bells
---
This is nuts! On the holiday season no less, and the rewards are lack luster and unChristmasy to say the least. What is with that jacket??
---
Some advice for all other workshops.   For the Ammo workshop, it's just not worth it.  Another post talks about farming lead ore which is much more efficient.
---
When you take a workshop, do it crouched, do the first defend event, set it up, build a stash next to the extractor, set the Welcome Mat down in grass or someplace hard to see it, but near the extractors .   As soon as the defend event is completed, leave...  
---
When you want to go back to pick things up, offload all junk to a stash and then crouch first before you fast travel.  You're marker doesn't show up on the map when crouched.  Grab everything quickly and dump it in your stash.  Then leave as quickly as possible.
---
Never go back for the defend events.  Only go back at a random times to take back the workshop from spawns and make sure to crouch before fast traveling.  PvP players will set up to take on players at defend events but tend to be too impatient to stick around for you to randomly show up at other times.
---
I’m not sure! I also don’t have the budget to test it for you🙈
---
My tummy has the rumbles, that only hands can satisfy.
---
It just wouldn't be the holidays if you didn't over indulge on unhealthy crap and hate yourself afterwards. Looking forward to unlocking all this shit and then instantly regretting all the time wasted on it. And now we can regret it 93% more than we did for the Halloween rewards. Thanks again.
---
I am regretting scriping someotherwise good beserkers weapons right about now.
---
You just gotta grind out Biv’s daily quests. At the end of each one you’ll get a random chance of obtaining another recipe, like tick blood tequila, lead champagne and the various beers.
---
F2P om ett år, det är taget. Återkommer!
---
 RemindMe! One Year
---
Lol..the things we deal with
---
So you don't have a cable service provider? Your TV choices are HD Antenna and Satellite?
---
The issue isn't infrastructure. The issue is ISPs charging rediculous prices. I swear, my cable connection is rated at 50 down 10 up, and I get 10/5, if that. It's not the conversion from megabits to bytes, either. For that shit connection I'm paying almost 70 bucks a month
---
Yep. So when I hear suggestions like this I think of kids telling me what would be cool in my game, then I laugh and go back to making something that works first.
---
Iirc, it's a moderate amount of space, but there is a hard limit of 4.
---
Please, it is almost 2020 lets us go prone ffs.
---
If you don't buy the collectron, you literally get coal delivered to your stocking all year. Marvelous
---
I heard Demolition lost the tag team titles.
---
Let's see if Bethesda can make something that works first.
---
But the vendor signs are dope!
---
Anyone else running around killing scorched just incase some gifts slipped through to today instead of tomorrow.. no, just me.. erm
---
Also it isnt always consistent with breaking my unyielding..i got away with reloading a pipe rifle standing...
---
Try it and find out.
---
You're better off crafting it yourself, the factory is just a PvP ground now
---
The current Atomic Shop music is so wonderfully cheesy... really don't see why they couldn't have loaded them into Appalachia Radio for a couple weeks.
---
Not to mention that they also reduced the size of the map (based on number of players, which for PC is usually about 20), which makes the games shorter, which gives less xp per game. :(
---
Well if nothing else it is fun taking bets on which turrets kill each other now.  Its at least something  different to do.  Oddly the rocket turrets seem to die the fastest.
---
Battling the devs is our end-game content
---
Good to know.
---
I haven't tried it too much as I've been staying on my PA character. Just did a few reloads with a couple different weapons for testing.
---
So let’s say you get 250xp per round, this is how many games you have to play per gift, starting with 750xp - 3 games, 1500xp -  6 games, 3500xp - 14 games, 7000xp - 28 games and finally 14000xp - 56 games.
---
GT: MD JohnZoidberg
---
I'll buy it.
---
Buy a repair kit from the atom shop
---
Crouch reload has always worked for the 250 bug... Unless you're saying other things are breaking primary effect now?
---
sorry you still don´t get the point.
---
let me tell you I had ~10 matches in flatwoods so far and have not seen the bridge or helvetia for example as it is ALWAYS in the restricted area 
---
my last few matches had half of Sutton station ~10 people spawned there
---
the Green County Lodge ~10 people spawned there
---
and half of gorge resort with another ~10 people spawning there
---
so wherever I spawn does not matter I can spawn in the country sure but loot? nah maybe a yellow box if I get lucky and then whoever survives hell in the good loot spots will rush me in full marine armor
---
trying to spawn myself in those areas is the best thing to do but I really need to get lucky to even find a blue box and somehow survive there... its just not fun
---
You probably don't play enough to know thats how lobbys are in the am and especially after an update it has been this way for a long time and both the maps are the same size
---
100Mbps...ah yes. 
---
I too recall when I was a peasant.
---
Just tested this and my armor effects are still breaking after reload.
---
Apparently reloading any gun now breaks the legendary effects on armor.
---
Sorry I already sold it.
---
It says "Kickoff" so this makes me assume more will be coming soon. (fingers crossed because there was a ton in the data mine that I want)
---
I know we get presents and a wreath via NW next week but what I want most of all is more lights, tinsel to place on the walls and maybe a few holiday related items, there is the snowman and PROPER fireplace coming too so there's those. 
---
I run a lodge with bar and would love to make it all homely.
---
Well, that sucks.
---
Did three queen runs.
---
The primes sure were chatty, annoying so.
---
But at least we all know they are booting up and online. Again. And again. And again...
---
"It gets people to play NW instead!" /s
---
The update broke legendary armor so wearing no armor is suddenly attractive!
---
Sounds like a blast!
---
Thats what im doing..lol
---
You mean no more +300 Carry Weight:
---
* 100 - Excavator Bonus
---
* 100 - Calibrated Shocks
---
* 100 - added if you log in when already being in the armor
---
That's just dumb.
---
What was so wrong with the VTU rewards?  If Bethesda thinks they'll convert a bunch of us into NW diehards by making the rewards less obtainable, they are delusional.
---
I spent all my time during the Halloween event just hiding in bushes. It made me reach top 10 numerous times (something I rarely achieve through normal play) but it's long, tedious and not fun.
---
This is the berserkers buff everyone wanted /s
---
Is the same excel/google link going to be used for updated information from Patch 16?
---
Lol!!
---
For PC, the "hard copy" is just a cardboard disk with a download code.
---
As I understand it, it resets each time, so its like 27k total
---
Does screaming "get it together" work irl?
---
*Barf*
---
I do get the point. Youre complaining about a condensed server and the lack of loot. Im telling you that you are wrong. There are several houses in those mentioned circle areas off the beaten paths that are full of boxes. 
---
You are just refusing to adapt. 
---
All the reasons they did what they did make sense. They make perfect sense. Your reasons however, do not. At all. I get its more congested. That was the point. I get the match goes faster, that was the point. But the fact remains. Gameplay is exactly the same. The loot is exactly the same. Youre just not having as good of a time finding it. Its there. Trust me. 
---
Adapt. Overcome. Or cry in the corner cuz you only found a combat knife and wont try to look elsewhere. 
---
I reccomend you start spawning in those weird places. Start seeing what you can find in those off the path houses. Take a couple days and go explore and adapt to a new playstyle.  Then get back to me.
---
What'd they say?
---
At least theres that lol
---
You stand up for no one, because you are full of hate.
---
'People like me', never met anyone like me.
---
About that needle... Medical help indeed is needed around here.
---
I see you aren't a person capable of a conversation. Maybe less gaming more fresh air?
---
Anyway bye. 
---
Can't say it was a pleasure
---
They might have a wild Karen as a mother
---
Someone at Bethesda seems to think that they'll win a bunch of converts to Nuclear Winter if they just force us to spend more time with it.
---
That person is an idiot.
---
The Responders suspenders, is it clear if that's under-armor or not? Because I love it.
---
Same 😅
---
It's a living tho
---
They have the ability to give us one. There's even a large one that's in f4 at diamond city center with all decorations and everything. Then there's the personal tree that fits into homes and you can see one at whitesprings gift shop at the bungalow houses.
---
:heart emojii:
---
Omfg right before double xp are you kidding me... So much for farming xp
---
Sinks! A nice looking toilet! With TP! A fireplace!
---
To tickle them more like.
---
I'm sure there will be another bundle next week.
---
hell yeah
---
That's possible!
---
Agreed. I am wondering if this change was meant to limit or discourage bush hiding a little bit.
---
I saw a nsfw drawing of her not too long ago on here ... not my proudest fap
---
underarmor yes
---
I was literally standing in front of the file i needed with only one quest active and it was trying to send me out a door on the other side of the building :)
---
^ this guy knows.  also, one thing I've started doing is scanning the map for workshops when I join.  if I see a lot of workshops claimed, that tells me things are probably pretty hot, and if the munitions factory isn't claimed yet, it probably will be soon.  
---
But ya, I've stopped building out all the resource harvesters as it makes you an even bigger target.  just build harvesters on the lead and maybe oil.  try to keep defences up and absolutely stay crouched.
---
Sounds like some awesome rewards
---
I had this happen, check the atomic shop to re equip it. At first it looked like it wasn't there either so I thought I lost it forever but the image for it is just a Vault Boy with his hands to his side so I didn't realize it the was the gift one till I hovered over it! Hope that helps
---
Too specific, imo.  "Legendary Gear Here" would be more flexible than "Legendary Weapons Here."  Little things like that.
---
😂😂
---
Surströmming to you too
---
Yes, I'm working on updating it now. Drop lists look the same. Didn't calculate odds the first time, but am adding them now along with the level requirements.
---
Same here. I have to use my cell data just to play and do downloads over my satellite internet.
---
 \[Cries in potato internet\]
---
Why would the voting system result in fewer players per server?
---
They really screwed the pooch.  Again.
---
Oh well, at least none of those new bugs are affecting my character!  You know why?  The update froze for me halfway through.  I had to restart the download, which apparently means redownloading the ENTIRE GAME.  And it's coming in slowly.
---
Gotta love it.
---
Imagine Bethesda making a reasonable decision on anything.
---
Yikes. I might be the owner of the wreath, and only the wreath. 😂
---
Then how do you explain literally every update stupid?
---
use your brain, my friends were laughing at it too lol, I read it out loud to them. not the smartest cookie if you can’t figure that out, are ya?
---
I am full of hate because I did the same thing that you claimed to be able to do. I said that people should stop playing the game if they don't like it. You jumped on my post and said your peace and true to the characteristics of people like you; you heard something 2 times that you did not like and complained. In all actuality by you telling me that I am full of hate you are engaging in projection. Since you are full of hate the only argument that you can manage to sum up is that I am full of hate. I love you brother.
---
I get that with a lot of quests. Sometimes turning the marker off and back on works. But it really shouldn't be an issue that newbies have to deal with. Or anyone for that matter. We're plagued by enough bugs as is! You'd think they would've fixed this crap a year ago 😑
---
I’m kinda glad the patch didn’t download in time, and I had to head out to catch my plane for business. Maybe BGS will have this hot-fixed by the time my business trip ends?
---
(Yeah and monkeys might fly out of my butt, too!)
---
Are you 11 years old? Your still talking to human beings on here, dont be a dick.
---
Come on guys. You were on a hot streak. Tighten up
---
Just join Queen fights. Haven't been under 20 of these things since they dropped. Prob fix 1 in 5 items the junk way.
---
What are you on about?  
---
The Atom Repair kits are inferior to the ones you earn through the Scorched Earth event.
---
Hey whatever floats your boat friend. All's fair in Goodneighbour.
---
Does it make sense to you that the responders would have the ability to manufacture some new suit of power armor?
---
I worry the tree is too big and bare. I’m probably going to server hope later to see if anyone has built it. I’m hoping they release a smaller decorated tree, like the one in fallout 4, maybe a plan that will drop with the scorched?
---
I imagine they will work just as scorched officers, reusing the same game code and logic with only the aesthetics and reward different.
---
Do wonder if already killed scorched will provide the drops just as officers do with nuke codes.
---
He's no Gilda Broscoe, but if you're looking for a good time, Biv is where it's at.
---
Yeah what did they say
---
I haven’t played nw since grinding out the skeleton costume. I just can’t....I play on pc.
---
Edgy...now do it again but this time be more civil about it.
---
No, it doesn't. I was also hoping for it to do :(
---
Maybe we should introduce some limited time rewards that will get everyone to play and love NW. Then everyone left NW after they earned the VTU stuff and didn't come back. 
---
Maybe we should make the Halloween stuff twice as hard to earn. Then everyone left NW after they earned the Halloween stuff and didn't come back. 
---
Maybe we should make the Christmas stuff twice as hard to earn... Hmm I wonder how this will end?
---
Starts Thursday.
---
Yeah. They are complaining because if a server has less players, itll start the game at the "second circle". 
---
So clump spawning happens because of it. Complaining about a lack of loot or that they are dying too fast. Honestly its a bunch of crap personally. Even with a smaller circle, there is so much loot spread all across both of those maps that its absurd. People just dont want to spawn off the beaten path anymore. They are lazy and refuse to adapt. Hence the clump spawns. 
---
Both of these maps are fine. All of the updates to NW work and they make sense. People just need something to bitch about because nobody can say "hey, a challenge' cool. Thanks guys."
---
From the 12th
---
I had this on Lucky Mucker today, nothing ever showed up, even after completing another quest. Glad the rewards still add...
---
This is honestly my first complaint ever. All the other bugs, are annoying at best. How the hell do you play with broken armor prefixes.
---
OH right re-equip my armor every damn time I reload. Whew crisis averted.
---
Artificial longevity of content not to mention the grind too, it's a very cheap tactic to keep people busy on ones game.
---
When is all this coming out?? I need some of those wallpapers, fire place, bathroom stuff, winter dress, stripped suit, new winter jacket and jeans texture, those plants
---
This isn't Fallout 4, you can't use a vore mod here... But it's coming, be patient 😏
---
Bingo.
---
Part of the patch today makes the playable area in NW smaller if the lobby isn’t full. The starting circle will be smaller.
---
I’m assuming OP is complaining that the smaller starting circle in these lobbies makes it difficult to find loot because everyone is dropping into the same locations.
---
And the free to play thing too...bunch of new people trying out game are gonna wonder where alot of high levels went...lol
---
crazy might be the nicest thing I've been called all day :)
---
Bummer :/ little bit of a shame, they look really nice atleast
---
well the extra weight carry from shocks and normal bonus, works, kinda...sometimes, unless ofc you just reloaded your weapon, lol
---
the 100 from login with the PA equipped is gone, maybe shitty wording from my post
---
Yeah bro. Your "friends". Seriously, just stop - you are embarrassing yourself at this point, my man. 👊😎
---
Thanks
---
Looks like absolutely nothing I would want. Hard pass
---
I checked my progress right before I started it and after nothing showed I checked again. Three more tokens so I know it added the part I cared about.
---
Thanks for confirming it wasn’t just me. I’m on XB1
---
I can now fire 1200 rounds from my bloody explosive handmade from 200% and gunsmith 5 before breaking it.  2 days ago i could empty out 4k and not break it.  My food spoils upon fast travel even with good with salt lvl 3 on.  Randomly when reloading, my backpack fails to work.  My camp turrets blow themselves up in 1 rocket today, last night it was 3 and they now sometimes blow up other parts of my camp.  I turn invisible randomly when standing still from the chameleon mutation even while wearing armor.  I have been kicked from my own private world randomly even though i know its not my internet.  I randomly cannot unequip armor without server hopping.  So atom shop items do not exist in the game anymore and cant be sawpped out.
---
Thats exactly what OP is complaining about. But it isnt hard to find loot. Loot is everywhere. Prolly the same people that think the scrap box is "gAmE bReAkInG".
---
How much of the event takes place during Double-XP though?
---
Basically they got sick of people hiding whom prolonged the matches so they thought it would be easier to do scaling this way(which is dumb considering player count rarely ever goes above 35 for each match), so now you actually have to play to get any XP.
---
While the idea in itself seemed welcomed, its execution was done poorly.
---
it's in the patch notes:
---
MATCHMAKING
---
We’ve updated Nuclear Winter so that the Storm will now automatically constrict the starting area to account for the number of players that begin a match .
---
When this occurs, the Storm will not deal increased damage at the start of the match, even though the playable area is smaller.
---
This will help encourage combat from the beginning of a match and reduce time spent hunting for other Candidates. It will also make for a quicker match overall, so that you can requeue to find a better match.
---
We made these changes so that players can spend more time on the battlefield, less time in the matchmaking queue, and get to the fun more quickly in cases where creating a full match may take longer than expected.
---
High Voltage Hefe- I make and sell dozens (100+) for 15c then wait for a PvP whale to come by and purchase it all at once.
---
Sneaking while reloading appears to cause it to work correctly, at least for me.
---
Git gud
---
This is game breaking. Hoping for an update ASAP. Unreal.
---
Im sorry if all your friends are imaginary, but most people in the real world have actual friends. I think i’m starting to see the problem here lol. im sorry we picked on you, if I knew your situation beforehand I would have been nicer.
---
The size of the starting map is determined on how many people are playing. It's to speed up the game and force more combat early on. This weekend during the event shouldnt have any problem getting a full map.
---
It most likely doesn't. I was wrong.  The player count is a bit low compared to how it was before the update, but I don't think there is a direct link between that and voting.
---
Just to be safe set/reset it after the event starts too.
---
Why do i get the feeling Bethesda switched all their developers over to Git, but never decided on any code structure or how to commit to anything other than Master branch?
---
We just tested damage on armor, nothing else.
---
??????  
---
another bug every time release something. they have zero-quality control....
---
That's fair. It's just for me, my standards are high, so I hold Bethesda accountable for more than the average person probably does. Even if I don't experience a bug for example, I can see that it affects others so I still call out Bethesda to fix it.
---
When speaking of NV, I never had issues running or playing that game. Which, like 76, is why I don't excuse the issues, even though I don't experience them. Although Bethesda did rush Obsidian to finish NV, so I can see why there'd be issues. 76 for me though  is one of the most technically broken games I've ever played. Ever.
---
Still wrong
---
For Halloween it was 14,000 xp total if you wait until all 6 rewards are available to earn. Otherwise yeah, I think it's 27,000 total.
---
I’m on PS4, so it’s cross platform commiseration, at least Bethesda is consistent about breaking stuff for all of us. Every time I get used to what does/doesn’t work, a new patch shows up...
---
(a) Explosive harpoon gun breaking after ~12 shots, so do the math on the raid.
---
(b) what about my message didn't convey sarcasm?
---
That's true, but it does make you wonder what we're actually seeing.  Have they said it's a bug?  Or is this a new, and terrible, normal?
---
yeah just played a few games and it sucks.
---
It's because he's painted red and had a beard and hat.
---
that and how to redeem it. You would at least think that they would put effort into it, but no its a plastic box with a piece of cardboard telling you how to install the launcher
---
great, sorry to harass you while you're doing Todd's work!
---
the usual
---
was trying not to do a spoiler...but then saw you had done the quest before - do you have &gt;!the governors stamp!&lt; on the form, and the&gt;! piece of mail!&lt;?  Unless changed, neither of which are in the building, so a marker on the door would be accurate.
---
Yep. I do enjoy it in small doses (burned myself out for last rewards). My last game I played, a guy was flying and shooting up the LOBBY!
---
I've never used glow sights. I'm never in nuke zones, the group I play with always drops nukes right, and 2 headshots from my j railway kills pretty much everything. but I'm a vats build, so there's that...
---
Do you have anything useful to say or?
---
Going F2P would be the best thing they could do in terms of profit, and im 100% sure its coming, whether you like it or not.
---
This thread is depressing, yikes! lol Hopefully Beth can hot fix this before the holidays.
---
From what he was saying he wasn't using mods to build this.
---
I have the light one from when it was on sale, but I didn't know the dark one even existed...
---
Just finished my 15th test of full sets of Unyielding and Life-Saving. I can confirm that revives and encumbrance are spared if my reloads are from a crouched stance. What effects are you using, so hopefully I can make an accurate edit to this post?
---
 Please read our wiki page on this subject

[https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning](https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/wiki/returning)
---
With what weapons should i be forced to combat others ,when 15 players spawn on top of each other in some random desolate area with no loot to begin with?
---
They hear us, they are looking into it now. 
---
Patch just dropped. Probably have the bug located by the end of today and a hot fix tomorrow or thursday morning. EST. Itll be fixed before the free weekend.
---
It works on pc for me.
---
Do you see less cheater? Was an epidemic when I stopped playing.
---
obviously not queen lurks or scorchbeasts. those take a clip worth of crit spikes
---
you only claim Munitions when you WANT to be attacked
---
Oh man, you must not be on xbox.  I sell them for 500 caps and give the plan away if you're just starting out.  You had some bad luck RNG.  I get the plan at about the same rate as the T-60 paint plans.  Enjoy your find, you earned it 😉
---
Yeah and the lights are also pulsing on them. Tho they said it in the patch notes that there would be christmas music in the atomic shop, and it's quiet for me. So maybe there should be some kind of music and it's just broken like most of the stuff after the patch :D
---
Probably next week, [it's datamined](https://i.imgur.com/FrrVUyr.jpg)
---
They said they hear us and they are looking into it. 
---
Probably a hot fix by thursday because free play is coming.
---
Anyone have in-game images of this outfit??
---
Being good is not the problem here. Read better
---
None of it. The double exp happens this weekend. The NW reward begins on the 17th afaik.
---
You cant, when you switch platforms, you have to start over.
---
Fo76 did not implement cross platform play, which would be the only way something like this would have been able to work.
---
Personally, i never lived long enough to see the OG cheaters. Lol.
---
Same here . 
---
R.I.P Nuclear Winter mode:(
---
11am on dec 12th and from their description it is inside the presents you get from the collection and the "holiday scorched"
---
Trust me i know the quest and which bit i was doing :)
---
I can’t read what it says the quality is too bad, what does it say?
---
That explains why my bolstering sentinel set didn't appear to be working 😅
---
lol so true
---
Floor decor as they are floor signs.
---
Does it fix when you log off the server?
---
Thank you for the information! I will be collecting a lot of atoms this weekend!
---
Today's update?
---
nobody besides everyone
---
I don't know. I guess just hope you pick up a unarmed bobblehead.
---
none of it, double xp ends the 16'th, xmas challenge starts the 17'th
---
Ok still wrong
---
 0.1% chance.
---
I thought so but I just was not sure since it is connected to a Beth account. Oh well, thanks for the answer :)
---
I got sick of fixing weapons so i picked up some unarmed perks and wherever i wake up from nukashine i down another and charge.  My left fost is made of iron, the other of steel.  I will be high on the shine as i show them how I feel.
---
that means they have lots of incentive to fix this sooner rather than later
---
LMFAO
---
You should probably report this to Customer Service as a Support Ticket, since Beth doesn't really read here much.
---
I don't care if I have to have a complete different character/install, I want game breaking op mods again.
---
Yeah but they had skill points, popping a grape mentats on 76 and that +5 Charisma the situation could go completely different, on past games unless you were close enough already you could use a chem or clothing to just get you there, even worse a full set of unyielding armor could turn a 1 Charisma build to pass all speech checks. It just makes sense on 76 to only factor base Specials for checks or make armor/chems have tiny buffs.
---
Yo you got a link
---
As someone who has spent a vast majority of their camp budget on collection and oddity displays, please please do this.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
A 1% chance every minute of the Stranger coming in? Would be funny.
---
cheers, saw too much in there but got it 
---
also thought it would be under 'vendor' at first...
---
Okay, I have one Christmas request for Bethesda. 
---
I  just bought the Christmas tree, and  lights. 
---
Why can't we decorate the tree? Or at the least please pre decorate the tree.
---
 I know I have been naughty this year Bethesda, but what's a Christmas Tree with out the decorations! 
---
I wish you, and everyone the best!
---
2 blinks for a yes
---
The gold sequin dress from the data mine? So the blue one is now the gold one?
---
People are embellishing the story without testing..sorry juicehead..cant wait to see your next vid sir
---
I think that where we are now is.... Everything is fine when you log in. Except weapons and armor break absurdly fast now for some reason. Like 3 seconds fast. Everything else works right up until you reload. 
---
Then the armor sets stop honoring their star benefits. And exacavator loses its +carry weight bonus. 
---
Excavator can currently be fixed by redeploying it every time you reload, but thats not a fix. Thats a hassle.
---
Wish I could sell ya some. I’m nearing 10k atoms
---
I try to keep the faith, but man...... it just keeps getting better and better. Hopefully Bobby Pins do not weight a pound each after patch 16..........🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
---
Yeah, lol
---
It feels like their coders are in a different country where ‘fix this’ also means ‘break that’.
---
Hmmm.  I wonder if the remaining responders return after a trip out west?  It would stand to reason, considering they were in contact with the BoS.  Not a great relationship, but after the scorched plague wiped out 90% of my friends, I’d probably want to stay close to loose allies that spend their time hoarding power armor and guns.
---
Man.... this is a fuck up LOL This is up there for the worst one ever, at least that I can recall. I'd only say the damage glitch, where damaging an enemy caused them to heal and be immortal was worse.
---
Well, I take that workshop every single day and I rarely get attacked.
---
Or get us outfits from those pin-calendars, (INSERT LENNY FACE HERE)
---
Its not just reloading breaking the armour effects I cant even put my weapon away without all my legendary effects dropping off my armour now and having to unselect and re-equip all the pieces kinda game breaking
---
That's such a weird thing to mess up. Oh Bethesda hahaha
---
Maybe you should run some perks like Luck of the Draw or Gunsmith 5 then.  Complaining about holes in your build as well as the in-game means to address those holes, while the Atom store offers a lesser version discounted bulk purchase that would also solve your problems seems like childish whining.
---
Lol, grow up.
---
You can still cancel
---
I have my own way of selling items, nothing extraordinary, just efficient in my mind. Machine 1: serums at 200 c.  Machines 2 and 3: uncommon to rare plans.  Machine 4: gear and outfits.  Machine 5: 25-50% off what didn’t sell the last two weeks.  Machine 6: Free stuff.
---
They'll all be *** and disappear when you kill them. 😂
---
Ok. Still wrong
---
No it's not just visual. I equipped full unyielding. Sold stimpak for 10 caps. Shot and reloaded my weapon. Stims were now selling for 7 caps. I'd lost charisma when I reloaded. Tested this multiple times now with same result every time.
---
Food build
---
so bye bye Nuclear winter :( 
---
they always finding a way to brake the game, this company have to be in guinness records for the creative ways of making things worse
---
Flechette mod? If so you're breaking the thing 7x as fast. Same with splitting a laser tho that's 4x. Add in explosive and you have got a powerful weapon that isn't really for day to day.
---
Also idk how you wade through the fiction to find the facts..congrats on doing this...i wouldnt have the wherewithal to do it
---
I would have to agree. I never see anyone do the event when it pops up. What a waste of an event. Guess I’ll stick to Tea Time and Feed the People since they show up constantly.
---
Like a fresh lung... it’s delicious like Mousse
---
And if the posts this afternoon are any indication, might be a fun time when I get home ... 
---
and I'll use the term fun very loosely today :)
---
====
---
NV was the first FO I played.  (PS3, btw) It would regularly crash on transition screens.
---
Too many explosions and such, (like at the endgame) also caused it to lock.  Got stuck in rocks a lot.  
---
The longer session I played, the harder it worked the system, which (I think) generated too much heat, leading to seizures.   Not strictly game fault, but it was the only game I played that blew up so spectacularly.
---
Frustrating, but as you pointed out earlier, was the storyline that kept me going.
---
I don't recall 3 crashing at all.
---
\*with some cranberry relish and a nice lead bellini
---
What is that between the candy cane gauntlet and the Santatron? A different kind of fridge?
---
It's highly unlikely at this point, because it's evident that fo76 was always designed to never give out the server files. They would have to do some serious editing before they could provide what they initially promised.
---
It's baffling, because fo76 could have had a longer lifespan than fo4, Skyrim, ESO, if we could have run our own customized lag-free plenty-of-ram servers without any "service" $ nonsense.
---
yeah, go read the 20 posts about it, several on the hot page
---
Crafted and sold a lot of Marine Tactical Helmets to get there!
---
Well they can definitely get rid of the ones that don't work at all, collect nuke codes from a scorched officer, 1st one to come to mind. Also server hoppy ones are dumb. Wording could be way better, YOU have to be standing (basically) in a fissure site when you kill a legendary, the legendary can be anywhere . ..
---
Umm... hate to break it to you, but there's been like four or five threads already on this, just on the front page.  Also at lease one 'workaround' PSA post on how to mitigate the issue.
---
Same for chameleon armor
---
NP.  I've seen my share of weird (or non-existent) markers :)
---
I'm not gonna complain, just because I only need to earn 1001 overseer xp to get everything I want lol thank god
---
Mechanist is a good guy and we already have his outfit.
---
As I said, got anything useful to add to the conversation?
---
Yes, they increased the model of all armor with the unyielding effect by 80%. It looks ridiculous.
---
Joking aside, Bethesda managed to break ALL legendary armor, standard and Power, with their "fix" for the +250 resistance while reloading legendary weapon effect.
---
Appreciate that Input honestly,
---
cause I couldn’t decide on Furious vs AA.
---
I don’t do automatic as it stands,3rd toon,
---
&amp; still haven’t really geared a build towards a commando’ish type “auto” build,nor delved Into the PA/Heavy Gun arena.
---
I don’t do Junkie nor bloodied,just because I don’t personally care for that kind of build.
---
I guess I’m one of those “food build/full health” type folk.
---
&amp; I realize I can do junkies build full health,but don’t care for the addiction points.
---
I’m gonna have to weigh it out I s’pose.
---
I think those are my realms/options though after reading that as a Lone Wanderer type 90% of the time.
---
I’ll have too consider AA.
---
You're either a shill or willfully myopic. I shouldn't have to run gunsmith because they nerfed weapon condition. That's how a mark talks, and why 'real utility' is a scam.
---
They may have just removed the furious fix again. They are really good at removing previous fixes with new updates.
---
Dude pls this is getting sad pls 😂😂
---
The Halloween NW items were 14,000 for all 6 items if you waited until all items were available to earn, otherwise if you earn these items each day, yes it's 27,000. Wait 6 days after the first reward is released.
---
It really is when you don't know how to play this game.
---
Have to agree here, wtf? Why do scorch dress up like santa? Why do I want to hunt Santas? Other then the sweet loot pool they are tied to....
---
I love doing the daily quest for Biveridge.  Knowing where to go to get all the custom ingredients and brewing them etc.  And honestly the amount of money I have made selling the recipes would be obscene if I didnt sell them cheap af lol
---
Unyielding bug :(
---
You'd agree that the level of weapon deterioration with this new patch goes too far though?
---
That's more than I get with ADSL - No VDSL sadly.
---
They're a lost cause at this point. Every patch comes with more issues yet more monetization. They dont care, its plainly obvious. 
---
I enjoy this game in spite of Bethesda, not because of them.
---
Gunsmith has almost always been a mandatory perk since December of last year though
---
So thats what happened with chameleon?  
---
Purple for the dark hues in the mire, gold to blend in to yellow and oranges the toxic valley, red to blend in in the forest dry grass.....
---
: )
---
I 100% agree there should be an option to change the price without removing the item
---
Chameleon brakes as soon as I fire...
---
Player base, after *every f@#$ing patch*: Man, Bethesda broke everything *again*?! Well, at least things can't get worse than this.
---
Bethesda: Hold my beer...
---
If everyone unhappy just didnt play untill they fixed it, it would mean a lot more to bgs than a load of upset reddit posts.. #justsayin
---
Haven't noticed a thing tbh. I keep one powerhouse weapon for boss fights but otherwise I mod for a mix of condition and power.
---
And they've made it more necessary in a patch containing a sale on repair kits. That says something to me, even if they did it accidentally
---
Honestly, it would explain a lot.
---
So basically.... nothing. Again. Got all excited, signed on... and yeah... same as before. Great. All of my stimpaks disappeared though, so i guess that's some fun.
---
You cannot wait for all rewards to be made available this time around. Even if you wait you *have* to finish the challenge you’re on before making any progress on the next one.
---
It was explained in the patch notes.
---
Sorry but I’m still not understanding, mentats boosts barter prices so why wouldn’t it affect speech checks? If you grinded for a Unyielding set or cooked up a shit ton of mentats why shouldn’t you benefit from it?
---
It only breaks primary armor effects for me, secondary and tertiary effects are not being affected.
---
No, OP is right, it's a new bug (among others), which severely speeds up degradation rate for certain weapons. More and more threads on it on reddit and beth forums being posted as we speak.
---
F@#$ing hell, I didn't think of that.
---
Same here, three failed today, no completion notification or rewards. Never happened before today.
---
Hang on let me stim you... &lt;chomp&gt; oops.
---
It's a new bug.
---
You're having to repair more often since the update or is this a complaint in general? How long have you used your explosive fletchette harpoon gun to notice?
---
How do we not have legendary Power Armor?!?! Still haven’t figured that out!
---
Maybe they need to keep the map large to start with and reduce the amount of time in between the storm drawing in?  That and give people at least a shitty pipe pistol with a few ammo rounds to start with.
---
You wanna tie it together, you need a nice rug
---
I don't know at this point I think it's one part time employee working on bug fixes.... developer(s) is pushing it
---
Just that you are wrong
---
And unyielding?
---
maybe there's some one inside the studio intentionally sabotage the updates and data.... lol
---
There was a clean toilet with a roll of TP on it in the data mine pics I saw earlier today. I hope it comes out soon!
---
We do! It's that shit you get from the raids and... it's broken right now along with all the other farcical stuff. EMERGENCY PROTOCOLS IS THE ONLY GOD NOW
---
I’m guessing a hotfix either tomorrow or Thursday.  With a free weekend designed to attract new players and a new holiday event, this bug should be a red alert priority.
---
Where’s the test server?  Even a 4 hour test open to premium members during midday Friday would have brought up the armor bug within the first five minutes.  They could get an early lead on a fix, give workaholic Fred some weekend overtime, and roll out the actual patch flawlessly for the general public.
---
Just got a map with 36 and it was the full map. Maybe they are playing with the numbers. First few were real fucking tight lol.
---
Emergency protocols is also pretty much magic BUT at least it's magic that can be crafted and you don't have to rely on the RNG or trading to get it.
---
He wanted to replace humanity with his army of robots. Not sure if that qualifies as a "good guy".
---
They’re a drop from the festive event. Two more days.
---
What legendary is there? Outside of strangler, and is that even legendary? I have never heard of PA ledgies
---
I was wondering why my prices to the vendor was so freaking low. Assault rifles usually sell for me for 28c give or take. Today they were like 14c or so. Didn’t check why just thought it was weird.
---
Dude, *NOTHING* about weapon degradation is **NEW**.  This has been common knowledge since Beta.  We all learned back then that if you run multi-shot mods on a weapon, have a faster fire-rate/auto, then you need to account for the fact that it's going to **break** very very quickly.  Luck of the Draw is three perk cards and works even better than Gunsmith 5 when working with multi-hit/shot weapons.  Your complaining is mostly stemming from ignorance.  There's nothing new here.
---
Ah ok
---
It's not that PA is legendary, it's that all the legendary armor in the game is broken right now, as soon as you reload your weapon.
---
And that's exactly what they want
---
there's a search bar you know...
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8vbah/icicle_light_plans/

Contact Support and tell them you havn't even logged in.   Sadly mate, your account may have been hacked and someone logged in to use it for dupes.   [https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10](https://help.bethesda.net/app/incident10)

Shouldn't have cheated bro
---
Oh I know. I’m just saying they need legendary PA, legendary outfits/clothing/etc as well
---
You may have been hacked, I would investigate it further.
---
I've been waiting on RNG to drop me some ultracite emergency protocol plans for almost a year now.
---
Yeah I'm not really sure, I havent played a match yet but I was okay with the change. I spend half the time running and never seeing people.
---
i hope they make these available in atom shop, for those who doesn't want to grind the NW, and who doesn't favor playing the NW like myself...
---
I’ve given up on F76 and returned to F4, F3 and FNV till Bethesda sorts their issues out.
---
I don't know if there is other places for information about him. But in fallout 3 the person who took his job saw him as a good guy who was protecting people.
---
How did they not notice this while fixing the 250DRWR bug? You literally have to reload to test the other bug
---
Sounds about right, having troubles keeping up with it all at work, but those are the main ones.  For now.
---
At least the camp stuff is only locked behind the 750 xp amounts
---
I have a general complaint about repair kits substituting for gunsmith and allowing people to cheat with their build, especially if they don't run SBQ or are too low level to run her. 
---
The specifics of the fletchette explosive, honestly I don't really use mine, are reports post patch. My OP was meant to be a sarcastic statement of Zenimax's avarice, but obviously that was unsuccessful
---
I was excited to have a friend try it out this weekend. Guess not. 
---
This is really frustrating. They are really making it hard to continue supporting them.
---
I had this over the weekend. I would load a character from another account of mine. It would fully load in, after about 30 seconds of running around, I would get the message: " You are not allowed in this session as you are not friends with the owner". HUH? How was it that I was able to load in then?
---
I got mine! Also, just put it on T-51 it's better anyway
---
coming soon hopefully, [latest datamine](https://i.imgur.com/Alnt9If.jpg)

R/monkeyflybutt
---
This  is true:    
---
"This seems like another example of Bethesda doing something that nobody asked for. "
---
Because most people of a similar sentiment have left by now.  In the end the “I’m quitting” posts still have merit as documenting your experience with the game, regardless of downvotes or contradictory comments.
---
This is bad. Can't wait for the snarky YouTube videos. DongYea is gotta be working on one that starts out with him saying "Bethesda, you did it again" or "Bethesda just keeps breaking things".
---
&gt;Guess what? There are people in top 5 countries with the same issues as you have. 
---
No there aren't. I get your point and yes, there are still disparities in quality when looking at rural areas, but you're not gonna go to Sweden and meet people still forced to use dial-up while millions of Americans still need to - nevermind the price-gouging. 
---
&gt;Let's also ignore the fact that countries above the US for the most part are considerably smaller and house considerably smaller populations.
---
Yes, let's ignore it, because it's completely irrelevant when you're just comparing infrastructure - unless you're taking it personally and turning it into some weird pissing match.
---
Actually, reload breaks *everything*. This is possibly the single worst "patch" I have ever seen.
---
Lmao I guess so
---
Pretty sure that's not how it works. Just wait until they're all out and it's 14,000 total.
---
They've made quite a few responses since the patch dropped, I suspect they're at least trying to keep up with things.
---
But yes, an actual ticket is the best thing to do.
---
law of averages right?
---
What happened? I don't get it.
---
Honestly, we'd be in much better shape if that was all that was broken.
---
The blue dress became gold? Bethesda throwing out 2015 memes as glitches now?
---
I was helping a buddy do this and the quest markers were way off. If he were to do it on his own, he would have never completed it. Same with the wolf and ghoul sample quest. He just quit trying it.
---
fucking horrible fix no one asked for or needed,  ruined NW and this is why less ppl are playing and on top of that they didnt even fix hackers, i heard a guy today say he was a hacker and blatently showed me how aiming his pitol in the air and shotting down 20 enemies  while aiming at the sky ffs
---
Legendary armor is broken right now
---
Again- you are talking about dailies and this time I was talking about the permanent ones like kill 1001 robots and such.
---
I only used it to drink out of, was faster than the pump though
---
A pre-war model of power armor made for firefighters or police seems plausible, but it's best to not worry too hard about the "lore-friendliness" of Atom Shop items.
---
Gotta love Bethesda. Try to fix one bug (without success) and break another 5 things in the process. Beautiful.
---
In attempting to fix 250drwr, they've apparently done something with weapon deterioration. I know about the perks,
---
That’s what I’m trying to do right now. I’m hunting/ shopping around for the plans for the rubber mat atm.
---
For the sink, uou cannot fast harvest, but its a lot faster than the ingame water pump. Idk about the fountain however.
---
Holy shit that’s beautiful
---
Are you guys seriously complaining about this...? There’s 20 of us on average in the PC lobbies and this change is a literal godsend. Who enjoys running around for 15 minutes without seeing another player in a BR.....
---
Last time I used a cheat was in the first Sims game. So don´t be sorry.
---
Yeah, I read the patch notes it's pretty vague though. The Halloween seasonal items were technically like that too, you couldn't earn one until you got the previous, but that was just normal progression. 
---
The patch notes could be interpreted either way really. I'm hoping it's the same as the Halloween event...if not then yeah, this is going to be a terrible grind.
---
It doesn’t nearly make enough ammo for it to be profitable. You make more in less time crafting it. Acid is your only downfall as you need it to smelt lead and craft gunpowder. Get a boat fly stringer to help with the acid.
---
Well, I worry about it and wish more people would too. These things are not just going to go away with Fallout 76.
---
I thought Emergency Protocols was broken during reloading right now too...
---
Welp,this whole jam session Is just absurd,from making a “bug fix” essentially,that apparently “breaks”armor/weapons &amp; other things I’ve read since being home,too what I was hopin too be an incredibly mundane grind in nuclear winter,like the last,Into apparently a full time job,cause of some sorta blockage setup.
---
I dunno man.
---
I guess I’ll just shutup &amp; go play my low lvl toon &amp; build my shitty camp,&amp; hoped they haven’t mucked up to much there as well.
---
Don't insult high school graduates like that.  It's just mean!
---
Because they reduced the size the lower players there are, and it's a dead mode sooo...
---
Bold of you to assume melee isn't king still
---
Is it dirty water or just radiated water?  Someone said it doesn't give diseases which is ok I guess.
---
Nothing confirmed yet but I'm betting the Christmas decoration plans will drop from the presents in the upcoming holiday event
---
&gt; Wouldn't the matches just go quicker? 
---
The problem is that the balance of the game depends on you being able to spend some time gathering loot prior to encountering other players.  Of course, you can drop right in the middle of the action and pray that you get a decent gun before the other guy does.  But that leaves a lot to chance rather than skill.
---
T-51 is for commoners, I want the world to know I wear only the PA that's most inconvenient to repair
---
Not until Wastelanders at least.  Supposed to be a cliffhanger.
---
That patch notes read in a way that suggests that they changed that.
---
Now take your thumb out of your mouth and/or ass and tell me why ;)
---
Yes!
---
&gt; The Halloween seasonal items were technically like that too, you couldn't earn one until you got the previous, but that was just normal progression.
---
Well, not really. If you waited for all challenges to be available, you had all of them at once displayed on your challenge tab and it became one big progression.
---
You had to wait for the next challenge to be available for you to *work specifically on it* but you were not locked out of it if you hadn't completed the previous ones.
---
Here they specifically said we had to complete each individual challenges one at the time *on top of* waiting for their release.
---
It does not, play a stealth rifleman and it’s still borked
---
Would be really nice to get a large furniture update. The whole "free DLC for life" thing doesn't matter if they just don't release any.
---
Didn't happen for Halloween, won't happen now :&lt;
---
As it should be. The communists under Mama Dolces were told to blend in with the locals at the end.
---
Hey, I have a Berserkers, FFR, 25% less vats Fixer that perfect for the new you 😜
---
I’d probably buy it. I’m constantly trying to get rid of caps. What’s 10k caps anyway. I can make that back in a day or two just farming and pvp.
---
Honestly, while I doubt it, I wouldn't be totally shocked at this point, either. This entire situation passed ludicrous about five updates ago.
---
Bugs are not intended. Kinda the point here. You seem like "one of those" who thinks Bethesda is out to get you.
---
Is Santa outfit back or not yet?
---
Horrible indeed . I am so mad with Bethesda right now . 
---
It was bad enough to deal with the aimbotter's everywhere , and now you don't even have where to hide since you spawn in the middle of nowhere surrounded by them .
---
All of the strategy goes down the toilet with this small map , no point of even trying anymore.
---
This is gonna be a long comment..
---
I have full Unyielding. My SPECIAL is:  37 21 4 18 22 31 26 at 19% HP. After reloads it becomes: 25 9 4 6 10 19 14
---
Effect effects are inconsistent. I have a hybrid build of Melee, Heavy Guns with Pistols as a secondary.
---
10mm (Bloodied, Vats Crit 50%, Perception) - Breaks
---
Gatling Gun (Bloodied, Explosive) - Breaks
---
Gatling Laser (Bloodied, Vats Crit 50%, Less Vats) - Breaks
---
Gatling Plasma (Bloodied, Faster Fire) - Breaks
---
Minigun (Bloodied, Explosive) - Breaks
---
LMG (Bloodied, 10% Damage while aiming, Faster reload) - Unaffected
---
Cryolator (Two Shot, Limb damage, Less Vats) - Unaffected
---
Flamer (Bloodied 10% damage while aiming, Faster movement while aiming) - Breaks
---
Major and Minor effects seem to be unaffected as I have 2 fall damage reduction pieces and RR and those stay the same.
---
Goodbye

I think he got lost near Wetherby Savings and Loan; I’ve never seen him in West Virginia.
---
It was probably just a gimmick from nuka world that stuck.
---
If I’m feeling particularly evil, I’ll kill someone, stim them, and then kill them again.
---
didnt they ban all the beta testers for exploiting bugs?
---
I’ll give you two purified waters and a Radtoad omelette for it! 
---
(Hi mods this is not a serious trade request please don’t cancel me)
---
You are correct, it’s working at random, but I also noticed that aiming down sights broke my legendary effects at least once.
---
I ain’t got a clue now.
---
Well, the Hubris comics and Silver Shroud radio shows says he was a villain who wanted to replace humanity with his robots, but yes, both the guy in F3 and the girl in F4 used the character's suit while acting as good guys, but they were like us, someone who just donned the suit and did their own thing. The original character itself is a super-villain.

"Here's all the stuff you were supposed to get for free. Also, the stuff you actually want to pay for? Forget it."
---
He wouldn't be wrong
---
They are. This bug is unintended but the broader idea of weapon deterioration is a deliberate method to monetise a game mechanic. That is how they're 'out to get' people.
---
Lol ok man.
---
cya bucko
---
Wow. Way to shart directly in the open mouths of potential new players! They should hire me as a dev. I couldn’t possibly know any less about it than anyone there.
---
I'm going to be doing the same thing. 
---
I actually picked up a 3\* zerkers lever last night after capping my Scrip. 
---
Was going to scrip it today,  Now I think ill use it.
---
Jesus Christ... What... I can't believe it. What kind of a circus are they running?
---
At least I have a reason to go Hooded Rags, now. 
---
What a bunch of irresponsible tuna heads they have to be... This is embarrassing.
---
Agreed. Everything should be able to be pieced.
---
Shooting down lots of cargo bots. Been playing since beta and most of my friends are always running nukes and also killing cargo bots alot. Also hitting US supply requsitions alot and shooting the bot down itll sometimes give you nuke keys. Idk man I just accumulate them haha, I dont always have them to. It takes awhile, but I horde. Also I buy em cheap from some other people that dont really care about nuke zones and just have em. If you go into FO76 with the intention of farming one thing and always looking for it youd be surprised. Ive seen some people who Fuzzy Token farm and they dont dupe and have hundreds of the things.
---
OMG can't you/others be happy Bethesda trying after getting f***Ed  by other peapole
---
no its fine, you’re just holding your phone wrong
---
Bethesda banned you for cheating. Are you saying they are lying!? Impossible!
---
I wasn't saying that the guy in fallout 3 was the original. I was just saying that when he discovered it he thought it was a good guy. Same with the kid. So i assumed it was a good guy. I had forgotten the radio show existed though. I guess it was a revamp?
---
People that love to freak out will freak out, it’s their one joy in life.
---
Yeah, i have tuesdays off, but my day has been spent running the three kiddos to all their after school stuff. So i spent the morning on NW not knowing any of this was even happening. And ive been trying to compile it all since then. Ive been on so many different threads now. Lol
---
That doesn't accomplish anything and it won't make player feel better at all.
---
Whats that
---
The tree is huge (2 stories).  Well, I guess that will save me a few caps.
---
Hurm... Good point you make
---
No pun intended
---
If you've been experiencing this for weeks, then it's like not a bug that's generally known about or even likely server-side.  It's probably a corrupted file or a mod conflict, if you're running mods.  I'd recommend doing a file-check and file-repair from the launcher, possibly a clean install.
---
Wonder Years was for panzies.
---
in the 80s it was all about A-Team, Fall Guy, Airwolf, Dukes of Hazzard and McGyver
---
Guess so since US average speeds are pretty decent compared to a lot of developed countries in actual test and practice.
---
Excavators is hardmodebraw
---
Their only disclaimer should be "look we have no odea how to fix things, nor are we very interested, here goes nothing."
---
Here in Argentina, the normal internet in the capital of the country takes 1 and a half days to download the entire game, so we have no escape from that wait. Imagine the pain it was when we had that bug on beta launch that deleted the entire game...
---
Usually things get fixed within a couple of days depending on how much it affects people playing
---
Got a zerkers explosive FR pump shotty for ya.
---
Ask and you shall receive https://m.imgur.com/a/P6eVV

If you don't talk about some Street Hawk, imma send you home.
---
Loved those shows!   But... I mean, Winnie Cooper though...  She was so cute.  Actually, the actress Danica McKellar is still pretty!
---
Dude. People have been waiting for literally years for some of these bugs. How patient should they be?
---
And what does it matter to you if many people have exceeded their patience threshold?
---
Something is wrong with Unyielding armor after the patch.
---
I have to continually unequip and equip my gear for the effects to take effect. Constantly changing  carry weight capacity.
---
Yes, video game manufacturers never try to make money off things in their games that used to be free
---
Interesting. I have 5+ Vintage Nukashine in my vendor for 25 caps that's been seeing there for a week without any interest.
---
I'd rather have the ring move faster, not be already a circle no. 3 or 4 :/
---
It’s not over yet...
---
Sorry. I should of specified I play on the PS4. So I dont use any mods, nor do i have access to the games files. Do you think the playstation's files could have been corrupted during a patch?
---
It is actually. If you were good gettimg that much xp would be easy. But your not, so your bitching about it.
---
JFC, *300* for just that sink? At these prices, the entire bathroom set is supposedly DLC unto itself.
---
The silver lining of these insane bugs is that we might actually have fun challenging ourselves to find new ways to play.
---
On this episode of naked and wasted.... Sounds like fun at least. Maybe some naked beserkers PvP fights are in order today.
---
Maybe. I just had 36 and was a full map as well.
---
Regression testing ftw
---
Just drop it at my feet and pat me on the head while I’m sobbing on my Mr. Fuzzy ride.
---
This conversation and the convos surrounding Megaton makes me think alot of us fallout fans must be on some government watch lists by now.
---
I’m gonna have to play like I live. 💪
---
Do ITV article about Wastelanders tomorrow please
---
Yep. So one problem I saw is picking a map we had 24 players. By the time it started we had 31 and still the tiny map.
---
Hey,  I'm a relatively noobish / intermediate and very casual player and I'm definitely down to play with you.
---
Psn is ilovepuppies
---
I'm usually on for a few hours away a time when I play,  add me
---
I did. I decided to make a thread as well
---
It's not like this is important or something
---
It works just fine, and one legendary effect is bugged, quit being dramatic and fearmongering.
---
Or they could implement a test server that gets the update a few days earlier. Literally just one single test server and 8 to 24 experienced players could easily find half the new bugs within 1 single day.
---
Fasnatchachachá work.
---
The bathroom fixtures are pretty standard/core items that should have been released as part of the game.
---
No. Only people with collectron can collect junk and scrap
---
They need to remove that, it's totally not realistic.
---
Gonna be awkward when we’re all hiding in the same bush.
---
Less than 1% of Americans use dialup and there are ones that willingly choose to. 
---
In some cases it cost tons of money to service an extremely rural customer. This is where the issue comes into play and long range cell networks will take over in the near future. The US has to fight battles many other countries don't have to worry about.
---
Can we please get a third radio station that plays the atomic shop waiting music?
---
They're coming out with test servers soon I think I remember reading
---
THATS WHAT SHE SAID
---
No worries, a little more visibility isn't a bad thing usually.
---
One legendary effect isn't working.  Private servers work just fine. Quit making shit up.
---
If you have the bulb letter lights from the atomic shop, they were reclassified as lights, which makes them take a lot more budget.
---
Are you using any of the light letters they just "fixed".  They now cost 500% more budget than they did yesterday.
---
Haha. That sounds like an awfully one sided deal considering im offering the post patch 16 meta weapon.
---
Where does the 1989 film "Little Monsters" fall into this canon?
---
Issa jokeee
---
I just picked up an unyielding cavalier’s combat armor piece yesterday too. *sob* BURRRRP.
---
Lit up letter budget increased quite a bit. They now take up considerably more budget.
---
This is the exact reason i begging them to delay it. I could already see it happening, "oh look the very first npc ive run into.... it fell through the map. Gues im not getting that quest dome in this server." *new server* ya rush over to a crowd around the npc you need to talk to but quickly relize everyone is makimg the angry emote because its just standing still and noone can interact with it. Lets hope they dont rush this one too
---
I've found it much more useful to price low and sell fast, undercut the market. I don't want it sitting in my stash taking up space. Particularly with scrap. I make a vast majority of my vendor money by selling bulk scrap that's below what others are selling for. 
---
I just figure out what I can get at the vendor for it with Hard Bargain, then price it a little higher. If it sells, great. I made a few more caps. If I need the space, I sell it to the vendor. Works well and I make bank.
---
Just so you know every single patch this comes up. Aside from unintended bug.. has never been true.
---
We are the beta testers
---
This happened to me once the Halloween event officially ended.  I put up a bunch of bats and skeletons.  After the event they all had to be removed for me to get budget back.  I think Halloween event items were not counting for your budget during the event, and it was changed/fixed after it ended.  (I was at max when hanging the bats and just thought they had almost no budget cost at the time).
---
I have a question. Is buying a lvl 50 2 start 10mm sub 30%+ on super mutants &amp; explosive damage for 3500 caps. Is it good?
---
The extra carry weight is a bug itself and not a feature
---
I’m hoping so too. They said there’ll be plans in the gifts as one reward
---
I got mine accidentally by logging in at white spring at just the right time.
---
Could have been hacked.
---
My thoughts exactly. That we never even got the base, non-functioning sink from FO4 and now they’re selling us one is bullshit. People seem to be lapping it up, though.
---
Yikes. I do have a billboard with light-up letters up front, plus some neon letters inside.
---
Agreed. Train stations too, for that matter.
---
Ok well thats good to hear, thanks for the quick response.
---
The prison where the Patrol Duty event spawns has weights out back.
---
Glad I could help.  The stealth + rifle archetype has been my go-to since Fo3.  That’s what I play on my main character.  I’m usually solo.  Bloody makes things so much easier and efficient, but I can respect alternative opinions.  An instigating hunting rifle will do bloody levels of damage, at least on the first shot with a clean play style.  The small flaws are when two enemy types are fighting each other, when explosions happen and other minor things that cause enemies to take tiny amounts of damage.  Even if they lose a couple HP, the instigating effect is ruined.
---
Prison Yard has a bunch of weights too, all guarded by low level super mutants.
---
Yeah, I'm hoping too
---
People trying to get more XP who are not very good at the whole fighting aspect. But that shouldn't disqualify their playstyle in the game.
---
I smell sarcasm. Also I didn´t say they are lying. They are only investigating the suspicious behavior of my long inactive account. Once they finish the investigation saying that I cheated. then I´ll say that they are liars.
---
Haha yeah you’re right. I’m being selfish. We asked for balance and new builds. They (accidentally?) gave us one. I need go put some ‘speck on these devs.
---
Thank you for the offer I will give you a respectful trade offer of...5 Hard Lemonades. Deal?
---
Assuming you get between 500 and 900 exp (average amount of most players) we're looking at 54 games *at least* during the Holiday season.
---
But thanks for your really mature and constructive insight.
---
They can collect normal junk. Check in the computer  attached to the SantaTron. The other comment is wrong.
---
Hey I got a question. Is buying a lvl 50 2 start 10mm sub 30%+ on super mutants &amp; explosive damage for 3500 caps. Is it good?
---
Shit I was rooting for you friend.
---
I swear their development cycle starts with the team getting high and following with the words "wouldn't it be cool if..."
---
okay this will be my final message to you as you don´t get the point if you don´t have the problem
---
I have not played on the flatwoods map that much so I might not know all those houses for example but thats because the matches are way too short in general and I can not live long enough to do anything.
---
why should I adapt? I played probably every skill set there is in NW but if I don´t get any kind of build going because I don´t get any chests at all it does not matter, I can not adapt in 2 min long matches where I don´t find more then 2-3 lootboxes IF I even find one.
---
Usually I became oversee in every \~10th match (if there was none of those aimbotters) so skill or compatibility to play the game is not missing, I can´t get a match going and tbf it is not fun for me to play like this so I will probably stop
---
yea they want the matches to be shorter and easier to find a new match but by that the matches gonna stay in small lobbies.
---
gameplay is not the same, usually it was long open matches, you start looting a lot and then sneak through the map blast some people whatever. Now you start in a small map with many people around and immediate fire fight. Early game is way harder. mid game does not exist and late game starts after 3 mins...
---
loot is not the same as the small lobbies ( I had 1 big lobby since the update).It start with just as many people as the big maps before but only on 50% the size so obviously less loot
---
I wish I could find a combat knife or anything, some matches I get nothing and I cant look elsewhere as there are 8 people around me shooting
---
&gt; Gameplay is exactly the same.   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; take a couple days and go explore and adapt to a new playstyle. 
---
you talk about adapt but say gameplay is the same you are really conflicting yourself
---
so yea I´m spawning in nothingness and trying to find my way around but like said its not anywhere near as fun as I had before and I really just might be stopping then and play something else
---
these small maps basically just benefit all the hackers where bethesda still refuses to put any kind of anti hack in
---
so even if you don´t see the problem it does not mean it does not exist, OP made this post for a reason and the people I´m playing with atm have the same problem I have, just because you are bad at the game and don´t see it means nothing
---
okay won 2 matches now but gotta say its still not nearly as fun as before and I only won because of sheer luck and cowardly cheese strats...
---
so yea whatever you say it is more of a problem then a solution and I have way less fun as its most of the time impossible to get a game going and consists of even more RNG other player spawns and BS
---
Good to hear it soldier!
---
Always
---
Let’s meet at Biv’s place and tell our life stories to each other. The Wastelands have been hard on us all.
---
or just have Preston follow you around and tell you about settlements, that'd stop people getting a bounty
---
Totally agree
---
Not necessarily, but looking at it it seems like it was clearly built off of the Excavator, so I could see them being able to modify the suit. Also if you want to get really technical about it Appalachia is heavily automated so I wouldnt be surprised if there was some unseen power armor production tech somewhere. And if you wanna get really REALLY into it, I also just dont particularly care because its fun.
---
My understanding is it stays, redeem before Dec 31st though or miss out!
---
By exploit do you mean having the standard 100 plus the shocks making it 200 or actually having 200 without shocks?
---
Woah. Somones feeling awfully generous. Id have settled for 2 regular lemonades. Looks like its my lucky day! :D
---
Me then: No way I'm spending $5 on that thing.
---
Me now: *WHY WON'T YOU COME BACK?*
---
It's not like they test anything before it is released, so they might as well release it so we can be the testers, like usual.
---
I just remember the patch notes when they nerfed White Knight, not to mention the multitude of secret nerfs, and lies regarding the atom shop, which has ultimately leading me to assume the worst unless confirmed otherwise.
---
I genuinely wish I couldn't have written the post and believed it
---
Do you think it would actually make a difference if they did spend longer to work on it?
---
 Emmett Mountain Disposal Site
---
Good point, sir!
---
If you have the acid and excavator pa just farm lucky holes lead ore easy 1.5k+ lead a time
---
It’s a date. Watch for the chick with the granny panties and a haunted look in her eye.
---
I *hope* it would... But realistically I know it wouldn't.
---
Actually it's one or the other, not both at the same time
---
That is a mess...you need to change/swap about 15-20 cards...Are you sticking with the rifleman build?
---
We're investigating these reports and will update you as soon as we have more information on this!
---
Oh, i knew there was more to your post, I was just trying to tell you why people probably keep acting peeved over it. 
---
I tend to keep playing because I love building tons of different camps, playing around with other people, exploring, seeing other people's camps and taking pictures. The building is a lot more enjoyable in 76, then compared to fallout 4. 
---
I started playing early last year, and I'm currently lvl 95 and have yet to do a lot of quests, especially the main quests. I found the game much more enjoyable if you just wanna chill and do random things.
---
200 without. If you wear the armor when you log out, then log back in. You get an extra 200 from the base armor set, and 300 if you have calibrated shocks
---
To be fair... Fixing your stuff with junk needed to nerfed. To each their own but junk is everywhere and without being in need it's just a set piece. It's just a game dude. Relax a little.
---
FYI that you can have 5 characters per account...your hoarding can reach even higher levels this way.
---
Can we get a picture for comparison?
---
So Leader of the Pack whenever it shows up for low level legendaries. I’d find someone who can make you a level 20 Fixer for 2-500 caps. It’s a great leveling weapon.
---
This has to be a joke of some kind from BGS. Fixing one thing and breaking three while doing it. Game can`t be put together this badly or patch QA this shitty without something beeing seriously wrong in the company.
---
If someone dripped me some rat poison, I would be thankful. That's free lead right there.
---
Yes.  Unyeilding = broken.  Chameleon = broken.  Deep pocketed = broken.  After you reload you have to re equip your armour.  Bit of a farce..
---
Evident there is minimal qa or testing...
---
Cool deal....I can get a keycard pretty easy since I can 2 shot the cargobot easily enough....was rough getting that little feisty bitch the first time though...LOL
---
Great question!
---
I think it’s obvious that the caves in the ash heap harken back to when Fred went under the bed with the howie Mandel and entered the monster world. 
---
In the film people had doubts about whether or not monsters were real just like nobody believed the cryptid hunters.
---
them's dirty words around these parts
---
It's like 3rd or 4th ring to start.
---
It's probably connected to all the other broken armor perks ,instead of a "fix" for this particular case.
---
Hey. I have a question. Is buying a lvl 50 2 start 10mm sub 30%+ on super mutants &amp; explosive damage for 3500 caps. Is it good?
---
Correct. But if you own collectron you can order either one to go after either collection of goodies.
---
Sometimes it's worth the freak out. Like several broken things weren't worth freaking out about (bobby pins) but this update recently broke several things whenever you reload your gun and players are right to be upset, they almost can't even play. Reloading happens a lot, thankfully I am an unarmed build
---
Yep.  It can happen in any event if you die around the same time the Event Complete dialog shows up.
---
The bug I refer to is like +200 Standard upon loading into world, drops to +100 after exiting and re-entering. Shocks negated the bug I believe.
---
It could be that the excavator armour has also been effected by the same reported armour attribute issues as unyielding maybe.
---
Clown shoes
---
yeah, I posted this 3 hours ago
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8u576/excavator_bonus_fixed/
---
Why does it matter if they reset to zero? The total XP needed could be the same, it’s just structured differently. We don’t know how much XP is needed for each tier.
---
Can we add to the crimbo list, fix all the stuff you just broke...
---
Wait what? I was just playing and I think all my Unyielding armor effects seemed to be working just fine. Does this affect Unyielding? Maybe I should log back in and check.
---
I have almost 20 keys since I thought I wasn't scrolling or collecting any. I like a well organized inventory, and this honestly pisses me off. At least let me get rid of duplicate keys in my inventory.
---
The fix now is to get a full weapon weight reduction armor set for a fast travel emergency jump kit. I run 5 pieces which knocks weapon weight down to 10% of their original weight so your stupidly heavy 22 pound handmade now only weighs 2 pounds. I carry all my weapons on me all the time now and stash everything else I can.
---
I use my WWR set to fast travel somewhere then hop into my power armor and just spend the whole time overencumbered at that location until it is time to travel again. Then I swap in solar powered perks if daytime and/or radicool if my rads are high and drop anything worthless until I make weight. Its not a sustainable long term strategy but it is where I am for now.
---
Done well Sir!
---
Yes we do. There’s several post about it already. 27,000 total. 14,000 for the final tier.
---
Happy cake day!
---
Not cats.
---
Yes, but he does stop giving you wrapped presents once the event is over, however he will continue to give out coal, toys and snacks
---
Oof
---
Oh right I've seen this happen with the strength bonus on the others, oof.
---
Yeah but you need friends to mule.. haha.
---
I agree. At locations like WS it is next to impossible to be able to drop the tent and drop off scrap. It would be nice to have it inside WS.
---
Whichever one Trump has.

This is the best way IMO as it has zero to do with other players. You can mine this location regardless of other players and server hop to repeat this.
---
For acid, the best spot is Tanagra Town crickets - you can also server hop to repeat this as well. If you are lucky, you can farm acid from campfire tales - just don’t complete the event, progress far enough that bloodbugs keep spawning until time runs out.
---
Where? I must have missed? Anyway the event is twice as long. Don’t really see any issue personally.
---
I don't know.  I could see how this could rub non-1st'ers the wrong way, and I don't really have a problem with the Scrapbox being a CAMP/TENT thing.  I consider it a deliberate limitation.
---
Best start trading for some WWR armor OP, that's what I did
---
Well my Santatron is collecting junk, and I do not own the Collectron.
---
Finding an active group of people can make the game a lot more enjoyable. I had a lot more fun when I used to have a group to run with.
---
 Apparently that's not worthy of including with a base-game purchase despite being fully available in the prior game.
---
So dirty
---
You need one friend who has Fallout 1st. You don’t need them to mule for you.
---
I think your projecting your issues to fans that havent spoken up about those issues. Ive seen 80 posts about PA breaking and 2 about having any issue in NW. 
---
When you say im contradicting in my quote, its because youve taken my quote out of context. That might be on me for lack of clarification on what i meant. It might not be. 
---
I might not be winning every 10 matches like you, but i can usually pull off one or two in a day of gaming. 
---
Im not not having these issues because i am bad. Im not having these issues because they are self manufactured. Ive had no issue finding loot. None. Small maps, big maps, neither. Like i said. You need to take sone time to explore the areas. That will be hard in NW because of the time constraint. 
---
Id reccomend still just brawling it out on little maps, but on big maps, use the extra time to explore the areas. Find some locations so you have options on the little maps. 
---
Its not a lack of loot that im seeing. Its a lack of map knowledge. And thats not on Bethesda.
---
 I largely think the changes for NW were good ones. I support them. Fully. I would have liked to have seen a third map as well, something in the cranberry bog or the ash heap would have been cool, but i understand how that isolates new players who havent gotten to leave the forrest yet.
---
Or the only option to respawn is at 76.
---
Well that’s a bug I guess. That’s not how it’s supposed to work. Santatron is only supposed to collect toys /candy/coal unless you have collectron.
---
Yeah where the hell is the Antagonizer, Dr. Brainwash, Commie-Kazi, Pterror-dactyls, or any of the weirdos from the Ux-Ron galaxy?
---
**They should be quest bosses!**
---
- Antagonizer - Known quantity - Human / Ghoul
---
- Dr Brainwash - Evil Robobrain?
---
- Commie-Kazi - Communist Sentient Deathclaw? Super Mutant with legions of suiciders?
---
- Pterror-dactyls - new scorchedbeast-esque boss
---
- Ux-Ron peeps - go wild!
---
Ok, ka-boomer.
---
Oh my gosh, I remember when that happened to me last week and it was so frustrating.
---
It’s twice as long, but with these tiny circles I’m afraid that I’ll survive half as long per match. 
---
Here’s the deal, I’m gonna try my best. But I really am not looking forward to 150 NW matches. That’s all I’m saying. Lol
---
At this rate Wastelanders will never see the light of day.
---
I had no idea it can happen in any event. In that case, this should be an important issue to be worked on.
---
Honestly I would love it if they put some kind of botstop like power armor autolathe into the world to excuse all these new designs.
---
It would chill me right the hell out.
---
That was my understanding too.
---
There's a bunch of weights at the top of the monorail elevator.
---
I believe more holiday decorations are coming very soon. The shop says "Holiday **Kickoff**" which makes me think there is more.
---
Ye i want to stay as sneaky sniper -ish build but just wanted more dmg on it ;P
---
Yeah I've got some, I've been seeing which has best stats but it's taking ages.
---
Yeah it’s kinda dumb how I have to put garbage looking toilets in my nice house
---
I would love permadeath personally.
---
The circle is only tiny if you have less people in. Placement is the largest XP. You’ll get more changes at the higher placement bonus as long as you finish in top 10.
---
Got to test it, unyielding breaks if I use my bloodied rifle and reload, but can be fixed by just re-equiping said armor.
---
It doesn't break as long as I just use my Unstoppable Monster Gauntlet.... So it's 100% melee for the time being lol.
---
Want to be camp buddies, angrysunbird? I have a nice camp you might like. I like to decorate as well.
---
Eh at at the very least we can add each other in game and hang out. I like to collect bobbleheads and magazines and such.
---
+ double xp weekend soon, so that wont be that hard :P
---
Hey I have a question. Is buying a lvl 50 2 start 10mm sub 30%+ on super mutants &amp; explosive damage for 3500 caps. Is it good?
---
It came out at Christmas last year. It's just a tinsel tree
---
I've had no weights in a specific location, logged out came back &amp; weights were there, isnt that a spawn independant of other players? Like You can get the very 24 hours?
---
If the XP remains the same, I'll welcome the faster games.
---
I believe it resets for you every 24 hours but if someone had looted the weights they aren’t there regardless.
---
Ah true story, good point there.
---
The clothes are pretty disappointing IMO.
---
I've never seen that before.  Christmas thing?
---
No doubt,&amp; also before I forget again...
---
HaPpY cAkE dAy!!
---
I’ve also always been a semi sneak riflemen type build,&amp; upon reading this,I realized I never really put ANY effort into “stealth” per say,across any of my 3 76 toons.
---
Maybe I should delve into that a bit.
---
Regardless appreciate the response...
---
Got me thinkin bout that,instead of how badly broken the game itself is.
---
It doesn’t usually effect me,so I’m gonna login &amp; play my newest toon wit no legendaries,&amp; just build &amp; setup my vendor,hopefully appropriately,Lol
---
Regardless of the stank on Beth’s end...
---
Appreciate cha,&amp; Stay Blessed,or Filthy...
---
Or a combination of both!!
---
One Love
---
Oh shit that bug is back?
---
Represent! haha awesome!
---
*Laughs in VanGuard Build*
---
So I guess im not playing much fallout tonight? Maybe some lucky hole mines with my bss combat knife? Cuz my chars r bloodied uny heavy n commando. Means Im screwed... Thanks bethesda was looking forward to testing my vffr 250drwr fixer and enjoying the new fixes after exam. Welp looks like its time to craft ammo for small armies
---
But they also said they are making it so you don’t have to wait for as many people for matches so shorter matches as well. I personally haven’t tried NW so I don’t know how bad/if it was before
---
Yup. Happens the last week any time I die
---
It makes it easier for moving stuff around. No longer need friends to hold my crap when I need to move it between characters.
---
Didn't see it in there but did you all fix the bug where turrets in your camp shoot each other after killing an enemy?
---
😂
---
No. 10mm Subguns are trash on high level enemies even with a prefix for a certain enemy type and 3500 is too much for a low level killer.
---
It tends to happen when you're over encumbered and die
---
Its alright. Depends more on your build. I wouldn’t have use for it since I don’t claim grafton steel very often or other places with super mutants
---
Oh the last week? Hurm... Haven't experienced it myself recently. That did happen a few patches ago but it was fixed for me. Was worried it was coming new patch. Got worried for second lol sorry for your troubles though OP
---
It's an absolute mess now, every other post is people listing the "fallout" from the patch.
---
Unyielding is broken after I reload the weapon, need to re-equip armor to work again. They've fix one bug and broke 2 oher things. Game is unplayable now.
---
Idk I wanted to share some of my favorite stories/moments about my experience with it too. Exploration and PVP were definitely the highlights, once you have nothing more to explore and they take away PVP its not much to do. I'm glad others are still enjoying it though. Hopefully they'll make some changes and add new high level areas in the future.
---
I just got mine the other day. Fast traveled to white spring and another player was there. We got naked and waved goodbye to each other as  we died. It was fun.
---
Ah, I am with my people now.
---
I'm not over encumbered often so idk why else it would happen. Doesn't happen EVERY time but 8 out of 10 it does
---
I'd imagine with games ending quicker, there will be less XP awarded for "Survival Time" and because of the long wait between matches means it'll take much longer to gain XP over all for challenges and levels.
---
You’re slowly changing my mind. But also, dude, I’m freaking terrible at NW. I was exaggerating at 150 but if I average 200 XP per match that’s 135 matches plus a few extra since any additional XP won’t carry over from tier to tier.
---
and a hug.....hmm....tempting....very tempting 🤔
---
yes this!. I notice that Mortal Kombat 11 does this with their premium character packs. it discounts the bundle for every item you own. So i would assume this would not be hard to do with the Atom Shop.
---
It sadly won’t happen I doubt,but I’m in yer boat.
---
I’d honestly rather outright buy em,then grind em Ina game I don’t care for nor really contribute too essentially.
---
But...
---
Gotta keep them fortnigters or w/e happy
---
Ty all, great info so far, I had JUST found out about the prison yard &amp; didn't even know about the monorail elevator location! Keep 'em coming!
---
Why Bethesda. Why
---
People were very happy with them not actually providing light and used purely for decor.
---
There are no large letter sets for writing.
---
Also sometimes my AP gets used even tho I'm not overemcumbered
---
It happens. It was a glitch for a while but lately it only happens to me when I'm over encumbered. I haven't died today yet so I don't know if they re broke it
---
Ugh, true. Especially crappy with the "reset to 0" method of gaining holiday rewards.
---
Was this before or after the time they said the game wasn't going to have a paid subscription and the time they said they couldn't increase the stash limit due to stability concerns and then allowed unlimited junk stash behind a paywall?  
---
Bethesda community managers will just tell you whatever it is they think you want to hear at any given time.
---
There's defo an issue. I had to use 2 150% repair kits on my VE harpoon earlier on one violent night
---
Hiding, in general, is a perfectly valid strategy in battle royale.
---
He dealt the fatal blow though, Bone worms!
---
I'm looking for it also
---
Do any of the high schools have gyms? I'll have to double check but one would think they should.
---
Yes he did. Lol. *tiny voice* victory is mine!
---
Thanks fun. I'm trying to find one w/ explosive damage but don't have much caps either. Do you mind if I keep asking you for opinion on more. I'm still fairly new to the game
---
Something is going on with CAMPS right now too. Removed a bunch of stuff to put down one damn connector and my budget isn't moving. 
---
I can say that it's definitely not impacting my life-saving or auto-stim armours; they're still working as intended.
---
Are you playing bloodied build?
---
Sounds like it's time to break out the melee weapons
---
Seriously, we better be able to kill them. Bethesda neutered any way to play as a raider
---
Appreciate the super useful reply, just a quick search and first few posts were from unrelated things over a week ago, apologies if posting this put you in such a miserable mood.
---
Got it for the first time a couple of days ago, and got it twice. Like you, I wasn't overencumbered - but the weight on the map said I was, as it didn't process my STR boosts from unyielding armor. And it forced me to spawn at Vault 76 because no other map locations displayed. It's as if that layer never loaded.
---
I refuse now point blank to believe Bethesda is actually PLAYING THEIR OWN GAME before launching these patches.
---
This will of course continue till people force a change.
---
Your power, your voice, and your money people.
---
Lol same. It’s still hysterical, but awfully inconvenient
---
This needs to be fixed asap...lol if they gonna leave it like this the game is dead.
---
My stats changes to every time I reload when wearing uny armor, have to re equip to get the right stats back, just tested it extensively /:
---
Does no one else have the different colored ones from last year?
---
*Laughs in melee build*
---
But seriously wtf is going on how does a company this big just not test anything
---
Thank you the Owl mask works. Guess I will be an Owlsquatch for a bit.
---
Me when I hear 76 has yet another buggy patch.
---
[https://youtu.be/TXK03FHVsHk](https://youtu.be/TXK03FHVsHk)
---
YES exactly. No other icons displayed on map
---
Why would you use a bloodied weapon with vanguard armor? You should run Junkies for dmg, or vamp for survivalibiltiy if youre planning on running full health
---
Alright, thanks
---
They might be trying to hot patch the PA bug that just happened. I havent seen anything about servers being down yet. 
---
I know immediately after the update the game kept telling me i lacked the permissions to log in, so i went to play some halo for a bit. Tried again like 10 mins later and it let me right in.
---
I consistently brew but only sell the few that people actually buy (nukashine, ballistic bock, etc) and only charge 10c. Definitely not getting rich. Mostly I try to keep the punch bowl in my basement bar (Nukes-R-Us) stocked with nukashine, however, lately it's been getting harder to find Quantum.
---
Amen, testing fixes must cost too much money or something.
---
Yeah skimpy variants for the win!!! ...Oh wait wrong conversation.... Carry on then...
---
The gag glasses don't work with anything.
---
Yeah exactly, I just noticed they had the greenhouse for sale again and I missed it first time around so that’s 1200 atoms on that lol.
---
Isnt bloodied the meta now? Thats why i wanted to change my build :P
---
Happened to me yesterday. But I figured out if I fast traveled after the event the rewards list would pop up when I got to where I traveled to
---
In honesty. I bet they did this because I saw in the datamine there'll be new large block letters. Everyone just used the bulb lights for letters so they've changed it so you'll need to buy the new. Wonder if I can get a refund
---
I think your unyielding effect breaks when you die.  I noticed this a lot in pvp.
---
If so there goes the last reason to use excavator power armor, now all my toons will just rock WR reduction since it was better already anyways. Nice work bethesda!
---
Oh sorry, I miss under stood. Thought you were moving from a bloodied to a van gaurd.
---
Yeah bloodied has the highest dmg and still has some damn good survivability
---
I have a protest sign in my camp vendors thats listed for like 20k caps. Its not because i want you to buy it. Its because i want you to see it and chuckle like i did when i saw it. And if you really wanna spend 20k caps on it, i guess ill just go get another one.
---
Agreed, it's a joke now only supported by players who seem to defy all logical sense by keeping paying them for a failing product.
---
It's not like they're that hard to make, but yeah.
---
I was planning on getting both rifleman and commando perks as I level.
---
Doing rifleman now as the hunting rifle is my highest powered gun.
---
I'm not worried to much about a ghoul swarm,  
---
 They are generally weak and I just switch to melee and start swinging
---
If you are a bloodied build and use radicool and or unyielding armor it doesn't give you the strength bonus when you are dead it's been a bug since like day 1. I believe it used to even trigger from the excavator 100 bonus but I am not sure on that one anymore.
---
Any ideas how to change it then ? :P
---
More like a shit blizzard.
---
I am beyond shook at this point. wtf.
---
Why?
---
They ignore them on ESO, the PTS will have threadnaughts detailing issues, which end up pushed live.  Zos just turns around with "shocked Pikachu face" and promise they'll fix it "soon".
---
Just like 76.
---
Matches go faster  for sure, you spend more time waiting to join then playing the F-ing mode
---
Every once in a while there is a second DeathClaw on the southern end of the island, I dont know what triggers it to spawn,  but Ive seen them down there several times
---
Yep.  But while it's a known bug, they've never given much of an ETA about a fix for it.  The best thing you can do is to take a Stimpack or relevant meds as the SBQ is close to dying.
---
TEST.
---
FUCKING TEST THINGS? BOIIIII HOW ARE YOU DEMAND WE TEST THINGS AND ENSURE PROPER FUNCTIONING ORDER.
---
Now buy your subscription and purchase some Atoms and make do like a good little consumer.
---
Yeah, it says "Holiday" Scorched Event, what is a "Holiday"..
---
I only ever did one silo run. For the mission. Its not my cup of tea personally. But that doesnt stop me from randomly getting them from cargobots. Sometimes i take them in trade for stuff for people not wanting to spend caps. Ive got a lot of them. Id say its close to STACKS at this point. Lol.
---
We can't eat the ones that are already in the game, I've tried plenty of times
---
You can do the drink/press collect very fast exploit.
---
Easier said then done when you’re bloodied and the game is lagging like crazy 😅 and then when it finally catches up, your character pops 13 stimpacks in a row 😅
---
They've picked up our trail
---
&gt;woman baby,
---
Hmmm. No.
---
&gt;woman, baby,
---
Uh. Mhmm.
---
Sure.  But you can go too far with it, where players will just give up and ignore your grind, and I suspect that's where NW has been since the Halloween event.
---
Is that the info someone should be charging money for? Freebies are nice, thanks!
---
The T-60 plans have a 1.4% drop chance, and the shielded plan has a 5% chance. That's about 3.5x higher
---
MERRY christmas to all
---
Goes to show how inept Bethesda can become when they don’t have mod authors to fix their shit
---
Ahahahahahahhhahhahahahahahahahaa
---
I thought they said they werent gonna do this unpleseant type of challenge again instead they make it even worse it seems
---
Hi, Bethesda, I am really glad you have fixed these  glitches, but I would like to know if you have fixed the fast travel air drop glitch? It happens to me and some of my friends quite a lot and is very bothersome. If you could fix this problem in your next patch we would really appreciate it. Thanks!
---
I never understood these guys. Even 4 digit prices. Its not like legendaries are hard to get. 
---
1 star= 200 caps
---
2 star=350 caps
---
3 star=500 caps
---
All day, every day. 
---
If its a really good 3 star, maybe 700 caps. Maybe.
---
Put in a support ticket and after a few days you “should” get your atoms.
---
Can’t guarantee but this is a persistent issue in game and people known to have complained have been known to get their atoms back! Good luck 😊
---
https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=1c1163e&amp;d=pd2pk2pp2pl2ir2am2la2l71lt2&amp;w=&amp;m=&amp;nw=&amp;n=
---
That is by no means a complete build, but has a few perks that I find extremely benifical to being bloodied (I run a bloodied pa heavy gunner, so don't know a ton about rifles)
---
Grammars for nerddds
---
Freaking idiots man how do you fuck up so many god damn times and refuse to make a test server
---
It's quite real, since I become overencumbered.
---
I thought you could only have 5?
---
No kidding.  I'm quite familiar with the delayed reaction of healing items in the SBQ battle. It seems like it's gotten a lot worse over time.
---
I just came on here to say Wonder Years &gt; Boy Meets World
---
If you play on PS4 I will look out for you and your Camera..... DarthSh3nn is my PSN! I will do a dance for you to take a picture of
---
It’ll never work again. You should just quit now.
---
Start the quest by going to a train station and reading the party poster
---
Anyone heard anything on other legendary effects breaking? 
---
I used to be able to drop warlords with 1 torso shot from stealth with my Instigating Lever Gun, and now they sporadically need multiple shots to go down?
---
Yall crazy. 
---
My machine prices on any legendary
---
1 star = 200 caps
---
2 star = 350 caps
---
3 star= 500 caps. 
---
If its really really good maybe 700 caps. Maybe. Yall act like legendaries are hard to come by. Ive probably picked up 3 furious 10mm in the last two weeks.
---
Edit: level 130
---
Level 70ish
---
Level 60is
---
Level 60sih
---
Level 15ish
---
So im def not new.
---
Must be why I've ended up with so many 😁
---
Can you elaborate on this and explain what it's based on? I was under the impression the rewards don't start until tomorrow for the Halloween stuff and next week for Christmas.
---
This is the 77/78 divide
---
Like talon companies mercs. Those guys were brutal. Add nothing but fat man rad rifle and gamma gun.
---
We could just have it auto nuke them instead.
---
whats the bug? I have just come back to the game recently so im not very up to date with bugs
---
Sure hope this one actually gets a hotfix. Games essentially unplayable.
---
I am in the same boat you are.  
---
I am looking at the silver lining here, and I am going to try out a zerker build tonight.
---
Because if my armor dont work, why wear it.
---
Shit. I'm not fast travelling anywhere for a while
---
He's just piggy backing trying to get xp, you don't remember being level 5?
---
Start Date - End Date: Still Working - No Time to play      
---
Day after End Date: One Week Holiday - No Event to play
---
Any train station?
---
Read the Frat poster at a train station.  You will start Biv's questline to get the shine on.
---
Believe so, it will be next to the SHEEPSQUATCH ATE MY BROTHER poster
---
My character is bloodied, but doesn't use armor or rads. My weird squishy build dodged a bullet.
---
I’m very new to the game, how do you get the santatron and what is he good for?
---
You on xbox by any chance?  I'd love to shop your wares 👍.
---
Why do you assume the fix and the bug are related?  
---
The make a lot of changes in updates. These are necessarily connected by anything other than ‘time of occurrence’.
---
Limit is 4, old glitch let you place more.
---
[Dropped Connection](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Dropped_Connection) is once of the Enclave events used to gain Promotional Commendations during the Officer on Deck questline.
---
It's not about unclaimed loot when your game disconnects.
---
Genius, ZAX stop looking, we found the one
---
I am. Byellets x717x. Not currently signed on. Usually on adventure mode weeknights from 8-10pm EST.
---
i still have it. I'm on PC btw.
---
Lol nice, thanks for the help
---
Hmmm. Kudos on the exploit. Dont ever stash em by mistake. Lol.
---
I like how everyone downvotes my posts on a simple question, like get a life...
---
They need to make the rewards based not on XP but on kills or games won. Too much incentive for AFK people with the current system. It'd be nice to have cosmetics that are rarely seen and if you do see it, you know the player has a certain amount of skill and not an AFK bot.
---
Probably Wastelanders item:  [https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Package\_for\_Madeleine\_de\_Silva](https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Package_for_Madeleine_de_Silva)
---
Same boat here, been waiting for the light to go on sale, already have the dark, would be great if it was discounted.
---
I've been holding off on getting the wood wallpaper forever in case either the package goes on sale, or it's sold individually.
---
Thanks, I'll be on at that time tonight and definitely look you up.  Good hunting to you!
---
Thanks, never! Lol. Plus I like my camp location.
---
PSN manofredearth - intermittent player, lvl 80, primarily building camps &amp; looting for cool display items, mostly micless, hoping to have a backpack one day or maybe explore that recent vault content...
---
It's serious this.
---
My search history for these games sure did it.
---
Happening to me as well.  Seems to be correlated to reloading my weapon.
---
On another note I really hope they add a bounty board to hunt npcs etc. as a repeatable quest type.
---
As in the board fills up every day and you pick what ones you want to do or do all.
---
Plus adding a similar one for solving cases for the sleuthing type players.
---
Lol. No, it’s been a while.
---
Not if u like to play carefully i usually hug the outside of the map myself i rarely kill people as a solo player it usually means my death
---
Yeah. I finally found one i like too. Hopefully i dont get a bad case of "stagnentosis". Lol.
---
Happy hunting to you as well. May your ghouls be legendary and your scorched never "T".
---
I filed a ticket. So hopefully it gets fixed
---
Never had a griefing issue myself except once or twice. 
---
Why isn’t your first move to just server hop?
---
I knew something was off when my minigun broke fast asf
---
Would be cool to actually get enclave stuff from enclave events whether it be fusion cores, plasma cores stealthboys plasma carts ect
---
Lol maybe?  Not my trick actually learned it watching Jug on YouTube 🤷‍♂️
---
I charge, and get, more for decent non-scrip stuff; tse, je, bffr, qe. But scrip should be charged accordingly. No one will ever pay top dollar for a stalkers rolling pin just cause it has three stars.
---
Ya, compared to the glowing skeleton costume, this is pretty bad.  
---
They should have done a candy cane melee weapon, and some kind of elf or santa outfit?
---
Guess they'd include the hidden massage therapist from Whitesprings
---
Indeed, I've come across someone using this trick with the Syringer.
---
Yeah I don’t understand why the tree is so damn massive lol
---
Shouldn’t be much explanation needed essentially...
---
But per usual the game is In...
---
What will call it...
---
“A State”
---
But just read the front page of reports from effects not working,too an unjust leveling system In NW,&amp; many other things.
---
From a sequin dress changing colors or something too that effect amongst other things.
---
Pretty Gnarly
---
Guess I’ll just leave my 2 pennies here
---
What does your title have to do with your post? 
---
Also, can you actually verify all of the claims you make? I've seen plenty of posts about the legendary problem but have seen nothing remotely substantial about private server, junk bot, and lighting problems.
---
Yeah, I wouldn't use that as a base for a sneaky sniper. You dont need any points in strength besides a few for blocker and you're going to need much more agility than the build in that link.
---
Same. I really want the greenhouse, but already own every other plant in the bundle. Can't justify spending 1200 atoms when I know just the greenhouse was 500.
---
Jug is amazing, watching him since his FO4 builds.
---
I just thought it was funny that there's all this PM/"charge for info" banter, then you're all down here whistling away. 😁
---
Very cool. You are a badass for sure.
---
U should have just quit the map, u seemed to have enough time since u checked ur stats
---
There's a feature in Borderlands 3 called the lost loot machine that works across all characters.  If you leave on the ground a blue or higher rarity weapon, you can go back up to Sanctuary and it will be there.
---
Makes it handy to transfer cash, indirectly, to your lower level characters.  You farm a boss on your max level characters, pick up legendaries, leave the rest, switch to the lower level on Sanctuary, empty that lost loot box, sell, and repeat. 
---
It is definitely something to be implemented here.
---
Which syringe type do they use?
---
Ill be crying and walking cant run without my unyeilding to many guns
---
How does the patch bring 'more monetization'?
---
It brings more items to buy, but items aren't game systems and generally don't break, so it's pretty obvious that yes on Tuesdays the shop updates.
---
can only hope they will bring the ones from the last year
---
Solution is to share their GT let others grief them back all day long.
---
Is there any str in that link? Not trying to be rude just didn't think I put any in it. And I was just trying to show some perks that I find very useful when running bloodied
---
As above, it's probably the karma syringe you get from Rose's quest.
---
All effects are broken on all armor on reload.
---
Yay, another thing for them to throw into the atom shop.
---
It's about the same budget as a flag, and you can only make 2 of them.
---
It takes time to undo your legendary effects on your armor.
---
Yeah! I was just using this as an example!
---
I'll say this again - we need a PTS (play test server) pronto/stat!
---
This is the ONLY way Bethesda will ever be able to discover what's broken with their patches/bugfixes.
---
Cometh the Trickster!
---
I guess it will show up on Thursday when the event starts.
---
I disagree with your assesment completely. 
---
Ive seen people complain about a lack of loot and spawn clumping as the biggest and really only issues. 
---
I feel both of those issues are self manufactured. And that one issue plays into the other. 
---
There isnt a lack of loot, there just isnt. Ive been playing all morning. What there is, is a lack of map knowledge on the part of the player. 
---
Its not Bethesdas fault that the player doesnt know the map. 
---
Its also not Bethesdas fault that the player chose the same location 10 other people did. As that plays into the player not knowing the map. 
---
Thats the players fault. 
---
The players complained about the speed of the game. Bethesda changed it. Players complained they couldnt pick a map or it didnt rotate enough. Now it does. They gave the player what the player asked for. 
---
Now its up to the player to learn and adapt. 
---
Personally ive been having more fun today losing than ive ever had playing NW and winning from any point until now.
---
Ah yeah my bad, had another tab open and was looking at a completely different build there without realizing. Apologies bud!
---
I won’t believe it til I see it haha. Could be next October for all we know!
---
It's because someone believes that we'd learn to love NW if only we spent more time with it.
---
Didn't happen before, not gonna happen now.
---
&gt;Why isn’t your first move to just server hop?
---
Good question; it's now at the point where if I server hop I'll just run into some other kid who's never got a report card that said "plays well with others".
---
The small limit is unfortunate.  Does it animate in the wind?
---
Well i would argue spawning in a diing in 30 secs is less fun i did have fun bush hiding people just ran past me all the time was entertaining to me
---
See, I could do that, but then I'm just adding to the net grief when really what I want is for there to be less grief overall.
---
That is what I am concerned about.  The smaller starting size isn't really needed, IMO.  The maps really aren't that huge to begin with.
---
Atomic shop, and just finds stuff
---
I think we just need to stop price gouging everything. 
---
My favorite part is the dude selling the rolling pin for 10k caps is the same dude saying "ThE aToM sToRe Is ToO eXpEnSiVe!!! StOp BeInG gReEdY bEtHeSdA."
---
Hope they don’t make you pay for it....
---
Wouldnt be surprised if it was doing that.
---
This!
---
So hard this!
---
Dear frickin lord... Bethesda is just breaking the game more and more. aren't they?
---
All i want is a simple christmas tree... Is that to much to ask
---
oh do you have one of those vendors that hide the damn vending machines. i am tempted to nuke this guys base right now. i wont because id rather get the legendaries but grr.
---
You can bloodied melee in PA just fine
---
Have you tried a new controller? That’s all I got, what a terrible bug indeed
---
Leaked news suggests Wastelanders will be declares for a late February or early March release, and may be pushed back again and eventually Early Accessed for Fallout 1st.
---
My theory is that now cuz there returning they wanna use it as a way to get u to play next time kinda like halloween rewards returned
---
Ehhh, I have it for 4 on pc. Pretty sure it would destroy 76.
---
It's snowing in real-life WV as we speak.  Bring it on!
---
(Although them adding this to the game will probably break something seemingly unrelated.  All chairs in your camp will now be upside down or something.)
---
I saw someone wearing a Santa suit about a week ago in a Scorched Earth Event. And I want one! lol
---
Just experienced this. Literally have to take your armor off and put it back on again.
---
How do you get the karma syringer? I e done the quest but lost the stronger upon completion I think. Haven’t been able to craft one.
---
Last one, for Halloween, once all missions unlocked, you got XP to count for all of them
---
If you didn’t wait, you had to gain the full bar every time. Early runners we **fucking punished** having to get 14,000 xp from zero to get the skele
---
Late comers would only need 14,000 total to unlock everything
---
Now, you can get xp on the next reward, until the first is done. So instead of taking 14,000xp(example) total
---
It will be closer to 30,000NW xp
---
(Assuming values are similar)
---
a server for pvp would help a lot. A survival mode of sorts.
---
Also I like how you doned your rads suit. Pretty clever tbh.
---
&gt;Some people's kids, right?
---
I know, right?! I'd be so disappointed if that were my kids. They're not of online gaming age yet, but you can bet that if I ever catch them griefing I'll make them apologize and donate their in-game stuff to Noobs In Need, which is a charity I'll start as soon as I get off my lazy ass.
---
Omg it’s So dope I got a Boxing Glove So Far
---
There are many good reasons to not want to server hop.
---
No, it doesn't seem to do anything. It's odd that it doesn't have decorations or anything. 🙁
---
Thanks for this, I’ll be trying out a number of combinations to see what, if anything, can be tracked. Then I’ll be dropping a load of what find into Bethesda’s bin... er, support system.
---
Beserkers got the buff it needed!
---
sadly 'shooting' while sneaking was triggering it for me. rip stealth commando until next patch =P
---
must be a silent agenda to push berserker melee builds into the meta haha
---
Minimal as in, none.
---
Yeah I wish they had that here!
---
Yeah why no stealthboys 3?!
---
Gigady gigady
---
Didn't know relationships with npcs were going to be a thing in this one.
---
I am tentatively excited with what they have shown so far!
---
I noticed my melee weapons doing less damage too. Could be that skme weapon legendary effects are affected as well.
---
I wouldnt give 3.5k to it... Its scrip weapon
---
I’m using a full set of unyielding armor.  My B FFR LMG doesn’t seem to affected by this but I’ve heard enough others having this issue so it’s definitely a bug.  I just wonder why my setup isn’t affected.
---
I'd love to see them somehow incorporate tamed attack animals into this like the bomb carrying suicide attack molerats that the mole miners use and maybe a deathclaw with an armored mini nuke strapped to it's chest.
---
That and power armor mini bosses.
---
Hell I'd get a bounty just to get attacked for fun.
---
Plasma gun is the most versatile, it can be a handgun, rifle, flamer, and shotgun. The enclave one looks so awesome to boot!
---
It's literally doing just that.
---
Why do they need passiin as long as the cash keeps rolling in? They know their money is assured through subs, whether they deliver or not. Of course sub par products are expected at this point.
---
uny was breaking when reloading while moving, or if shooting while sneaking and stationary.
---
using nothing but melee seemed fine. this was fully uny with a b/vhit/rw lever on a melee build. not unplayable for me with a melee char, but definitely stealth commando seems to be going to have to wait tonights gaming out. =)
---
fast traveling and scrapping did not seem to do anything for me.
---
Hmmm, yeees, maybe as a separate game mode you can select from the play screen alongside Adventure and Nuclear Winter. Could make a few tweaks such as taking away fast travel or the ability to see other players on the map, I think that could be a really intense experience for people who want to do PvP. Bethesda should get on that!
---
Me and friends ran into a Goat guy the other day that did this. Another friend got a silo stolen in the same manner.
---
You use unyealding? Or PA? Both give buffs to carry weight but are removed briefly when die.. thus the game thinks you're overencumberd for a second and prevents respawns.
---
Is this foreal on all armor or just unyielding, does this have anything to do with the 250 dr while reloading fix, and on a sent assn pow piece which affect gets canceled since all 3 effects can potentially be the "prefix"
---
I hadn't seen that, wouldn't surprise me
---
I know she isn’t bad but Is the starlet sniper part of the unstoppables?! If not what was she?!
---
I new I built another bloodied character for melee for a reason.
---
Keeping power armor handy maybe? Just split time in and out of your suit? It is how I usually play. Sometimes im PA, sometimes not. It re equips your regular armor on exit.
---
Just an idea, but I am not sure it helps.
---
I like the changes in NW. I have no issue finding loot because i know the maps. I have no issue with clump spawns for the same reason. 
---
I feel you on the armor glitch. Doesnt personally effect my no armor melee build, but that still sucks. 
---
On another note, Bethesda has already responded several times to other posters about this exact issue. They said they are working on it. 
---
I know thats a generic response with a lot of interpretation, but i think personally, that you can hang your hat knowing itll be fixed by thursday. Free play days are coming. So it will probably be hot patched wednesday sometime or thursday morning EST. 
---
I agree that they really need to Beta test the patches before they go live.
---
There's a couple in the fitness room at VTU
---
Oh my fucking hell.
---
It’s slow but after then pump and can be placed anywhere, it’s dirty water full of rads disease
---
They know what it is already
---
Great!
---
I am sorry that happened. I hope people who do this develop allergies to their favorite foods.
---
That would be a mild thjng to break. It'll probably cripple all your limbs every time you fire a weapon.
---
But if the map is scaled to the number of players then there should still be plenty of room to scout for gear. Unless of course Bethesda didn't scale it linearly and it equates to less room per player.
---
If it is like the Halloween event, you have to unlock each separately no matter when you start. If its the last day, you have to crunch all that XP to get the last reward. One at a time.
---
Oh dang I listed vault tec HQ &amp; it may have been VT university, or both? I'll double check when home &amp; edit appropriately!
---
Would be cool if tiered like if you complete the event within a good time you'd get maybe like 2 mk3s as the high reward along with a small chance of a scout mask or legendary scout piece along with a couple of other things, ide like to see more super stims as rewards too since you have to have someone else complete death blossoms to get it, it won't reward you them if you complete it lol
---
Fast travelled. Walked. Nada
---
Yeah you'd think so :P
---
I feel like this change wasn't needed.  The map really isn't that large to begin with
---
There hasn't been anything like that announced.
---
You broke just about everything good job
---
idk if it's "soon" but I did see that was mentioned by Bethesda recently
---
 Its not new. This has been happening since launch.
---
Its breaking Vanguard DR/ER bonuses as well, not just Unyielding.
---
Vanguards is broken too buddy. My thorn set is anyway. Tested about a dozen times now. Can also confirm my unyielding and bolstering sets break when reloading. So that's both my builds unplayable until this is resolved. Happy holidays!
---
Isn't there a flushing toilet in nuclear winter? 
---
Plus working showers
---
Nothing announced. Spend it then save back up again,
---
I’m aware. They fixed it though a few patches back. This update broke it again
---
For me, it was never fixed.
---
This also means this time - time is of the ducking essence because if you don’t do them like A S A P your gonna get F’D like everyone who tried to do the 14k marathon on the last day last time. 
---
During a busy holiday time (work is kinda stupid for me right now) this feels totally ignorant and intentionally punitive. 
---
In order to get the holiday rewards I essentially have to choose between this game, my family, friends, and work. 
---
I love this game but if that’s how it’s gonna be there’s more important things. 
---
I’m gonna also hold my wallet a lot fucking tighter if this is how they act in-kind.
---
They had that last year, they will probably bring them back. Probably.
---
hmm your comment makes me wonder why we dont call the "M" a "double N"
---
Lol couldnt find a VT hq for 76, edited post to reflect correct location
---
I'm saying two or three people with some skin in the game or care for the project could have identified this issue. I mean they didn't try reloading a weapon with unyielding armor? Arguably the most used armor in the game. Do they even play the game prior to releasing these fixes or do they just run some code that checks for faults?   
---
I'm looking past the short term (the next 8 months). If this games going to make it and I want it to there needs to be some major changes to how they are operating.
---
apparently yes, search bar works amazingly
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76/comments/e8ven7/rewards_arent_showing_when_questsevents_complete/
---
I don't know which you're saying. They don't stack. If you waited. It was only 14k total.
---
&gt; implying they tested it
---
“_Mole head or whatever the hell_”
---
Breaks every armor but only Unyielding confirmed lol what a joke
---
It was never a dead game. There’s a free weekend coming up so there’s going to be an influx of new players. There is a current bug with legendary armor and reloading that is pretty significant that Bethesda is aware of but not sure when a fix can be expected
---
\+250 dr fix is nice but patch have completely broke harpoon guns. I need to repair it every 5(!) shots. Seem the same about all heavy weapons. I feel, they loose durability neary 10 times faster.
---
communist!
---
So listen,   
---
I love the game and I want to say yes; but lets talk about it next week.
---
It will automatically use a healing salve if you have it
---
There is a bug/glitch whatever you wanna call it but if you're in Nuclear Winter when the challenges reset or if you go to Nuclear Winter before going into Adventure mode then any daily or weekly challenges you've done in the past will be marked as already completed.
---
Yeah. Honestly all it’d really take to justify it if you ask me is like a skin for the PA workbench that has like some auto-doc esque mechanical arms or whatever to show that there’s methods of automating it.
---
But those matches are going to be found and finished half as fast as well. Lobby depending of course. 
---
And if you know the flatwoods and morgantown maps well, even in the smaller ones, clump spawning and lack of loot arent an issue. 
---
Ive been playing all morning. I liked NW mechanically the way it was. I had some map issues. Like voting and multiple maps, but theyve addressed that for me personally. 
---
That being said. Ive actually had more fun playing today than ive had playing at anytime since launch. 
---
More fun losing and dying then ive ever had winning the old way. Even when i do wind up in a clump spawn or without a loot box, its still super fun in the panic you feel trying to run around. 
---
I get that this mode is going to kill the experience for try hards who only care about stats, but the truth for me is, its way more fun this way. 
---
And when you run into the inevitable aim bot player, the match will be over super quick so you can get the rewards for staying until the end of matches faster whenever its a daily. 
---
I think personally that its good turns all around in NW right now. Adventure mode.... Not so much. Lol.
---
Talk about asking the right question and the oh so wrong time
---
This is how they get rid of legacy weapons...
---
.. now just new weapons don't break xD
---
I’m always on a full server. Often times the world of full when joining a LFG post. I’ve never felt the player base was low.
---
My bad then, all that I’ve seen is the reload bug and just thought I’d try to share this one as well.
---
Here's the video,
---
 https://youtu.be/_pTPHBqBBgI
---
Can confirm 100%. Happened to me at least 12 times
---
Yes. If you have enjoyed other games you will enjoy this one. There’s an upcoming free weekend so it’s a good time to try it
---
The game has been pretty stale the last 6 months (no new content), but there are some events happening here and there, there's also a lot of events this month as well.  
---
To be fair if you enjoyed the game originally you will still enjoy it.  
---
Since you are on PC you should definitely check the mods: [HERE](https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout76/mods/?BH=2), they make the game 100000% more enjoyable.
---
Thanks for the update team&lt;3 y’all go enjoy your holidays now and try not think too much about our million requests till next year lol
---
OMG the dream. Please Bethesda.
---
But the issue here is it's possible to grief people and that needs to be fixed.
---
If the only viable response we have is "just leave the server" then the griefing crowd gets what they want, either killing people for fun or forcing everyone off the server so they get the server all to themselves (free private worlds!)
---
I got leaked pic as you can see I will be tomorrow
---
New patch today, buggy as hell from what it sounds like.
---
u/Ladydevann u/BethesdaGameStudios_ some clarification would be great, is the Santatron supposed to collect junk and scrap as a selectable option and if it is supposed to do that I hope people who haven't bought the original Collecttron aren't allowed to select those options on the Santatron.
---
It’s either your power armor or armor stack. 
---
When you die all buffs are removed and you have “no extra carry weight” - if your base item weight exceeds your carry weight without armor or power armor - back to the vault with you. 
---
Happens to me at least once a play session.
---
I’m sure the savage mountain ridge marking the northern branch of the Appalachian continental divide had nothing to do with it....
---
They just released patch 16 today, some bugs were fixed, thus creating a ton of new bugs
---
No is the hard answer.
---
Considering that the update already resulted in a major game-impeding glitch; no. Not unless you really love the game.
---
Huh. That would explain some Things
---
Oh sorry I must of missed that part.
---
Damn
---
Thank you so much for this comment. Between you and the previous commenter I am feeling cautiously optimistic about the NW changes!
---
So that's why someone shot me with a syringer yesterday.  I was wearing power armor, so fuck'em.  It just seemed kind of random to me.
---
I went in not knowing anything had changed. I was like "AAAHHH! WHATS GOING ON?!?!?!?" 
---
But it was terrifyingly fun. Lol.
---
Lol he’s kinda stuck but hopefully that’s the glitched part
---
you mean January, June is 7 months from now.
---
You're right. The build of the game is so big it's possibly a butterfly flapping its wings thing. I made an assumption given everything went on weapons at the same time that fix was implemented
---
No. Definitely the Ben and Fred Savage divide.
---
Yeah I guess they just expect everyone to use spotify or something of that nature.
---
I never cared for it though.
---
HA rookie
---
Bethesda has already responded saying they are working on it. 
---
Personally i think a hot patch is coming sometime between now and thursday morning EST. Most likely fixed before the free days start.
---
You really think subs will continue if things are more broken than ever ?
---
Give your head a wobble. I’m subbed on a month by month basis. Not a chance they can rely on subs alone.
---
This patch is incompetent. Border line unforgivable, it’s untested and unacceptable. 
---
There money is far from “assured”. Infact they will be scrambling in hope of sorting this mess before more bad PR hits the usual channels.
---
I play from a hotspot and it took me 30 minutes to download it lol. Hotspots are so underrated. I have unlimited plus so i dont run out of data so yea.
---
Yes. Free weekend Thursday. What do you have to lose?
---
It's amazing how a post apocalyptic survival game is being turned into this barbie dreamhouse bullshit
---
No i agree with u griefing sucks, just saying u could have saved ur junk by leaving the server knowing what was going on...they need to change thing for player who do not have fallout 1st...players will always find some type of exploit tho
---
Someone let me know after I already posted this! Thank you 👍🏼
---
Yes and no. The losing character or weapons is fixed, but they're still unfathomably laggy. It's essentially impossible to complete them in am adventure server given the time constraints
---
None of my weapons had any effect with this. Run junkies so I would of noticed a 50% drop.
---
Never know when those sales are coming, so I spend 200 a day. Enough for trade limit and some event scrip.
---
Thanks for letting me know
---
Lol, who knows right! Its funny but sad at the same time.
---
PVP, griefing and toxic players are literally why I pay for private servers. 
---
Workshops are a good example, yes they are PVP zones and can be contested but having someone come in just to kill me and not even take over the workshop is BS. 
---
Makes me wonder why they aren't in NW if they love PVP so much...or could it be that NW is to hard for them? 🤔
---
I like Nuclear Winter somewhat. 
---
I don’t like or appreciate being forced to spend *almost every day* in it and for exponentially increasing longer and longer periods during an already stressful / busy time of year. 
---
It’s not like they announced a hacker ban wave with this stupid change. 
---
It’s also their fault for not fixing the VTU rewards if their numbers show it skewed and that’s the reason for this. 
---
(They) Should know better. Should do better.
---
My aa handmade is at 75 damage where it normally sits around 120. It's like the commando special cards have been negated
---
Yeah I've been wanting those since I've noticed the lights in flatwoods. One of the vintage light up Santa heads would be a nice touch too
---
they usually announced when the sales are, thats why i was confused because i was telling some friend i was playing with about wanting to spend scrip already but was gonna save to the max and he told me to save because of the christmas discount for purveyor
---
That would be awesome! I mean they have it for Project Paradise so it is possible. I wonder how much of a headache that would be to retool loot pools on a tiered system like that (I imagine a big one, but it would still be awesome)
---
Maybe it is because standard armor was only meant for early game, anything above level 50 we should all be wearing full bling Power Armor.
---
I refuse to do that, I love my leather unyielding I just wish it wasn't such a tedious business monitoring it all the time.
---
I'd love a PvP server back, but the griefers unfortunately aren't here for PvP. They are here to grief. They get off on ruining other people's game play.
---
As much as I agree with all of your sentiments in this reply thread, things unfortunately aren't as rational as we'd like them to be, just as a griefer isn't coming from a rational place to begin with.
---
That was a well reasoned and articulate response. 
---
My Unyielding Armor regularly stops adding the +3 effect I have to remove everything, restart the game and re dress, sometimes just cycling the armor works without a reboot of the game.
---
Were supposed to be rebuilding Appalachia. If I wanna make my camp look nice, I’m entitled to do so
---
The Mechanist has been a villain in all 3 known incarnations (including the radio serial in FO4) 
---
Even the character that is supposedly the good side of the quest in Fallout 3 gives up the evil dude trophy when you kill him.
---
now this wasn't the worst patch since release... I stop play till they fix what they broke
---
Where are people getting this? It sounds the same as Halloween which didn't reset just didn't start until a few days. So just play after they're all released.
---
Your camp goes away after you log off, so it would be impossible
---
Must vary than, tested vanguards extensively and couldn't get it to break. Which console are you on (I'm on PC) and are you basing this off the number shown in your pip-boy? (mine weren't changing there)
---
Your camp doesn’t get damaged while offline, it goes to a safe place or something like that
---
Naw this was a huge fail. The game is already going downhill, watch how few people hang around for nuclear winter now. It’s a shame. I know me and the 3 guys I have played with since it came out are all stopping after this patch.  I almost wonder if they are trying to eliminate the few players that stay around, that way they don’t have to deal with it.  If they go back to a normal map size I’ll come back, but until then cya fallout.
---
I have experienced this to a few times and you will respawn after like 15-20m real time, strange as hell. You see and hear everything around you and the screen spins like when you are ideling to long, but you just lie there and suddenly wammo you respwn haha.
---
Upvoted, this is indeed annoying.
---
Well I'm glad you're not offended I'm not the same person as you.
---
I would guess comic character from when comics were mostly westerns. Probably predates the superhero Unstoppables.
---
Your camp is not static, it goes away when you log out.
---
Agree, take grafton and hemlock hole for steel and acid plus place camp on acid node...u will have all the ammo u need..i farm steel as well but that 40 per helps and i never see anyone take it.
---
Do I have to be empty of stimpak in my inventory? I always carry a few for reviving people in Vault raids
---
It resets this time. It’s not like the Halloween event.
---
Today it was bugged even if you joined Adv mode first.
---
Yea because we don’t have that much lore about her and she is never really mentioned in old fallout games
---
Mine always uses the salves first
---
When you log out, your camp logs out. 
---
The turrets wont do anything when you are logged out because they are also logged out.  
---
When you are not in game, your camp doest exist.
---
Exactly. Being aggressive is a legitimate strategy, but so is being evasive.    This  change makes evasiveness nearly impossible as a strategy.  A
---
And yet he turned into a villain that killed civilians in the crossfire of his amped up theatrics. 
---
Just like the Mechanist in FO4 didnt realize that she was in fact a villain.
---
They do usually announce it, but I wouldn't be surprised by a last minute weekend sale every now and then. I also don't like to spend it all at once because then I have legendaries cluttering my stash space all week while I scrip them off.
---
No kidding it's honestly so dissapointing that us as fans can come up with more sensible ideas for this shit and they just break shit and don't care lol
---
No we don't,  turn the christmas radio station on or get yourself Spotify.  I'm sure that Bethesda really wants to spend a bunch of money on song licensing for a single month of the year.
---
And buzzblade
---
Thanks for the reply's.  That makes sense.
---
I built in an out of the way place but still had scorched attack my building when I was on last night. I just want to make sure that the turrets were worth while or if I should have used the budget for something else.
---
Mine doesn't. I was doing a raid last night, and it automatically used diluted stimpak, and I had to manually use salves.
---
That sucks. Total buzz kill especially since Atoms are not easily obtained in large quantities &amp; most of the Atom shop stuff is already pricey.
---
Either you guys are masters of sarcasm, or your new to the game. Haha. I cant figure it out in all honesty. Either way i got a good laugh.
---
They certainly can't stop making the same mistakes over and over.  Who has the final approval when patches get released?  Maybe a change of personnel is needed - like now.
---

It's just common sense and established Reditiquette to check the recent/new posts to see if something has already been discussed.  Downvote me all you want, doesn't change the fact that topic was and is being in multiple threads.
---
Which one are you talking about?
---
Or when it respawns you inside the nuke zone outside of the event area and you die before you throw on some power armor and your junk gets lost.
---
Crap... Just reread it a few times myself. It sounds like it will reset, which is ridiculous.
---
It kinda is for some. Especially those who use that type of armour, which is a large amount of players.
---
I've gotten quite attached to my inert bomb collection.
---
“You can no longer gain xp on a proceeding tier, without having completed the preceding tier”
---
Maybe it prioritizes the diluted over the salves but I’m on Xbox as well and it’s always used salves before stimpacks for me without changing any settings.
---
1% chance every minute?! That’s like....60% an hour!
---
On armour. I've died 10 times and never been revived again by my armour.
---
The people left tend to be hard core and given the amount of time they still spend playing this game you are effectively insulting their religion, these are mostly not casual players and the “filthy casuals” are anything but.  They flatout have rules against expressing negativite opinions on their board.
---
Hmmm, I'm gonna throw my diluted in my stash and try it. Thank you
---
Leaked news is code for I just made this up. This fucking sub man.
---
All legendary armor effects are bugged after this patch.
---
All legendary armor effects on my one and only character are now broken and get removed after reloading my bloodied handmade.
---
I need to remove and replace all armor after every reload to reapply the effect.
---
It's the new meta!
---
A few at your camp to destroy the random scorched, dog, rat or mutie that wanders by is a standard practice in the wasteland. 
---
They wont help you when your not playing, but when you are out adventuring they will make sure your stuff stays safe.
---
It doesn’t do anything. It’s where the elevator let’s you out from the launch room after you send up a nuke
---
Exact scenario just happened to me 30 min ago. There went my BFFR Handmade drop..............
---
If ur on ps4, i will hook u up with weapons, armor, ammo and chem...mutations are worthless til u have starched genes and class freak. Let me know if ur on ps4, they are not legendary but they will help u survive to level up...wont be back on til friday tho
---
Even then he didn't mean to do it though
---
Inside the Port-A-Potty?  It's a elevator out of the Nuclear Silo nearby.
---
legendary effects on armor is bugged since patch 16 hit 4-5 hours ago
---
should be plenty of posts about this in HOT i think
---
I'm level 200+ and \*never\* experienced a single instance of griefing.
---
Looks like I'm doing bloody melee for a while then.
---
even this isnt accurate totally..
---
my folks live in LA in an established, expensive neighborhood and broadband is NOT available there.  Its dial up or some crappy off brand.
---
meanwhile I live in Idaho and happen to have gig fiber to my house.  It's so sporadic and random.  Telco's need to be regulated big time.
---
How many days and how much xp did you need last time? How many days and how much total xp do you need this time? Is just a different way to structure but same xp/day
---
Yikes, hope not, at least the limb damage had some potential, bashing really doesn't
---
Hey if the datamine is wrong or if they make a change I’ll be very happy. But as I read it now, yeah this sucks.
---
This is wholesome.  Thumbs up!
---
Hey do you know if there will be a fix for the reload bug where it gets rid of your armour legendarily effects?!?!
---
dude whats the point in picking flatwoords or morgantown the fing starting circle doesn't even include those towns. you picked morgan town then you should be able to spawn there.
---
I missed something as Im at work.  Whats wrong with the patch today...…? 
---
Not again.....Shut up self Bethesda see's the errors of their ways and has their people all over these issues...right...
---
They give you more time to do this event than the last one...
---
So any ideas?
---
Mentats for slightly better prices or to just give you the 1/2Cha to make a speech check isn't bad, a set of unyeilding armor would make you pass every special check in wastelanders, not just speech checks. Str to intimidate, Per to check a scene etc, Cha in dialogue, Int for examining, you get the idea. It would make having a build pointless as anyone with a few pieces or set could do any special check, then you'll also get people moaning that special checks didn't matter; something beth clearly stated they wanted to bring back. Getting a few pieces or a set is incredibly easy, it only has to be one star and you can just buy some trash pieces from a player vendor and make a set within a couple hours tops.
---
Ho ho hopefully...
---
Console pleb here. Playing on PS4 Pro. 
---
My Thorn set has 3 vanguard pieces. At full health I see 519 DR and 343 ER.  After reloading my DR is 414 and ER 238 in my pip boy.  Can send screenshots to show the different numbers in the pip boy if that helps?
---
It also collects fertilizer
---
Multiple counts of blatant manslaughter will still net you jail time. 
---
Especially when you don't give a shit and still think you are the hero. 
---
At least what's her name from Automatron has a ton of guilt when you tell her what she did.
---
That is really my main objection to it.   Nuka world is one of the rare facets of the game that launched in a stable, nearly bug-free state. It worked great as is.   I have a real problem with Bethesda fixing things that are not broken.
---
Pacifist mode was OFF on one of my characters. I never pvp. Now that i recall i think i rifle bashed a few people trying to share legendary supervisors during uranium fever.
---
Has Bethesda said anything official?no ? then no. Lol
---
Well i mean, ive been running a Berserker's build for over 2 months now. Its a lot of fun.
---
😁until they decide to go live and have a party.
---
Not quite, and only if it's cumulative.
---
He literally just told someone straight up with no insult, a far cry from lynching.
---
Are you really gonna make him have to put the /s on there?
---
You came out on top today then.  You dont have to experiment like the rest of us. 
---
I'm a bit jelly.
---
Yes please extend this event. So I can have some time to get all the event items please!!!!
---
The person in automatron i don't think was a villain either cause yes they sent them out but she literally had no idea it was happening and no one could tell her for obvious reasons.
---
Yeah iirc it never used to have a quest marker on the correct tape.
---
Bethesda I don't have much hair left. Could you kindly stop making me pull it out.
---
Fireproof 3 and dense chest won't save me
---
Shit I'm gonna start a team who cooks mentats in the first responders church and rename it the church of crystal methodist.
---
Most anything with "Mask" in the name.
---
Radroaches can survive a nuke. You cannot.  
---
I think we know who is really "adorable" here...
---
I have 2 that aren't affected as well.  For me its only the Legs and Chest piece.  The arms work as. intended
---
I'M HOPING that the delay in Wastelanders was a sign that they were putting in more time to fix the problems.   In other words, I hoped that Wastelanders would be a sort of "re-launch" of the game with everything players had wanted from the start: NPCS, smooth gameplay and stability.  But like you, I'm worried because I  think this is Bethesda's last shot at salvaging this game.
---
Lol especially since they already have it in game just not camp items yet
---
Is the calculation not .99^60?
---
I left my Christmas tree up all year one time and just decorated it for every season/holiday.
---
Yeah, you don't get good legendary loot til later you hit level 50 so the new bugs introduced today should be fixed by then.
---
hey, a challenge ... looks at player that killed me 5 sec in when i was in a building, he'd be shooting up in the air killing people. dude this game is so full of cheaters if i wanted to complain i'd be complaining about that. but having a smaller circle to start with makes no sence they just ignore key locations. the firestorm can be ignored and all movement perks are just useless. firing a nuke at 2 min into the game is already 80% off the map filled by the time they launch that stuff. that is not a challenge it's just stupid.
---
Lol. It still sucks. Its not common knowledge, but you can actaully wear armor. It just has to be broken, you still get the legendary effects. I use a complete bolstering sentinel set thats now useless, but was an effective failsafe when my cover was blown.
---
&gt;crack smoking chimp
---
Can I have one of those in my camp please! 🙈

---
My melee Berserker's build so much fun
---
She's the best of them but still would be serving life in prison on manslaughter charges pre-war. 
---
I never have killed her though. She meant well and is eager to set things strait once she knows. 
---
I replaced her once as The Mechanist as my main theme on my first and still longest FO4 playthrough.
---
They just introduced a game-breaking bug while trying to fix a minor bug, in the middle of the only content they have dropped for months.
---
Does that answer your question?
---
was it on the same server? each server has seeded rng for legendary drops
---
Wow! I have a Berserkers Explosive Handmade sitting in my stash, I'll go try it out LOL
---
Preach!
---
That sucks, thank you for letting me know
---
Yeah, lots of folks are entitled, you're right about that
---
I'll check this out, as I have the others. 
---
Your guides are fantastic 🥰
---
I never got the dlc but i would do the same honestly.
---
&gt;How many Testers take part in your internal/contractor Test prior to Release?
---
Oh man I have been asking this sine the B.E.T.A. when I decided to go with a heavy weapons build. Many heavy weapons were like shooting water pistols.   Heavy weapons later got a buff and my build works fine but the state that they launched in really had me wondering if anyone had play tested them at all.
---
I was hoping for it to be like the one on Vegas but nope.  Pathetic .  I was nervous the first time I decided to explore it.
---
Im sorry you feel thay way, but i agree with nothing you said. For reasons i have already stated.
---
Your absolutely right, I feel bad for suggesting it. Misplaced anger I suppose. I'd mention why it would just get removed.
---
I guess you've never heard of Australia then huh?
---
I’d make a new build but all my character slots are full and they won’t give us extra character slots .
---
I hope they give us real mod tools when we have actual private full size servers
---
Lol only the primary effects don't work. For example, my fully decked out handmade is still 2.28 pounds with my full set of weapon weight reduction!
---
Also, the armor still gives you DR haha
---
I'm using full set of unyielding weapon weight reduction and while the unyielding isn't working, the bloodied DPS is still massive. Just higher AP cost, slightly worse crits, less carry weight etc..
---
As long as it isn’t a radrat, the most unstoppable force in Appalachia.
---
Is that a new store like the purveyor was
---
It was cool. I felt like I needed to clean up what is a pretty cool superhero the name from the asshats that have already taken it on and soiled it.
---
Thats how you know we are old players. Lol. Quest markers? What are thoseeee?!?!?!?!
---
I grew premium beverages. Rad ant lager +50 carry weight. Hard lemonade AP regen. White Russians -25% limb damage. 
---
The rest of it I drink or stockpile for daily atoms. With party boy perk acholol is 3 times the liquid on your bar. Cheers.
---
I think what he's trying to say is you have to learn to work with what you've got. For example, it's easy for me to take on 3 players with a handmade and marine armor. Does that mean I'm doomed to die if I end up with wood armor and a machete? No. It just requires a different approach. Maybe I disengage and get better gear. Maybe I attack. Maybe I let them chase me while I lead them into a firefight with another team. The gear doesn't matter. Knowing what to do with what you have is important. Heck, the perk cards don't even matter. I recent ran a Level 0 account through a single match and got 6 kills and a win on the first attempt.
---
The maps thenselves are called flatwoods and morgantown.
---
They have a bunch of fanboys playing it and loving everything Bethesda feeds them and these people are the feedback source
---
Australia is just a myth, doesnt even exist google it
---
Then you are very lucky indeed! I hope your luck keeps up, because getting griefed is not very fun.
---
Only the prefix legendaries are affected.
---
Lol. That’s an excellent point.
---
I could show you the leaks, and the leaker was spot on about the introduction of repair kits, FO1st, Wastelanders being postponed etc so chances are he is correct again.
---
Yeah, we alternate between 2 different controllers. When one dies, we charge the other. I appreciate the reply though.
---
Nope, it's connected to Wastelanders.
---
Yes. He knows what he’s done.
---
dude i'm lvl 98 on nw i've played my fair bit of this gamemode. and i've talked alot with the people that join my team. they also don't like it. you'd be forced to spawn on sutton or on the edge of morgantown or edge of lodge. i already see 5/7 people running around searching for boxes of loot shooting invisiable doods that havn't spawned yet and that is just not the gamemode i want to play. it a fuckfest. while i like to play the sniper alot and this just makes me return to the explosion build i was running with don't get me wrong i've won multiple times but it's just not the gamemode i liked in the beginning of the game. the game just started and 3 min in and only 7 players alive feels dumb to me. and alot of people feel the same way.
---
Nothing actually changed with the Legendary Item Lists that the purveyor uses at all. It's just bad luck
---
Hoping that the mega wendigo, or whatever it’s called, will be what the current type could have been. Death laws....well, they still look scary I guess.
---
I did find the name quite interesting. Large "Undecorated" tree, as in possibly a decorated variant will be possible next week?
---
They have already made enormous profits to the extent that they can just shut it down the moment it stops turning over money.
---
Heres a comment about my build a made awhile back. Maybe itll help some people.
---
 I run a berserkers, its by far my favorite build. It adds a little danger back to the game. I run a stealth commando build. 
---
- I wear a full set of bolstering sentinel, wood armor ( ill explain why bolstering in a minute ). I break it all so i dont have any DR or ERr at full health. Wood armor is the best stealth armor in the game, besides the Thorn armor. When its shrouded, it literally weighs .45 pounds and gives you sneak bonuses. 
---
- On a side note, if you break all your armor, you cant take your armor off, otherwise youll have to rebreak it all. So you cant wear a radsuit to go into nuke zones. Wear power armor and keep an anti armor weapon around in your stash so you can stand a chance. Or you can get a lead lined backpack, radshield, and rad-x. 
---
- I also wear a Raider sheilded underlining. You can mitigate the DR/ER of it by getting addicted to med-x and wearing a high capacity backpack. This gives you a special boost without an armor increase.
---
- The reason i choose to run bolstering armor is because when you start taking damage, your literally 3 hits from death, depending on whats attacking you. This without your perk cards. Bolstering armor will help you tank damage, the lower your health goes, the tankier you get. It will allow you to take 3X-4X more hits before you die.
---
- While your taking damage, your Berserker's weapons will slowly become useless. So what do you do now? Switch to a vampires weapon, this will allow  to keep yourself alive longer as well as reduce the amount of stims you use. I keep 2 vampires weapons on me at all times. 1 is a laser rifle for ranged enemies, and a gatling plasma with a beamsplitter for those pesky melee attacks.
---
- As far as perk cards go, you basically want every card that can help you avoid damage. This is what my build looks like.
---
 https://nukesdragons.com/fallout76/perks?v=1&amp;s=3c345fe&amp;d=a72ar2an2pp2la2l71lg2lt2a12ib4eh2l32c72ao0a81sg2pg2ph2pi2&amp;w=&amp;m=1469cf3&amp;nw=&amp;n=Berserker%20commando
---
I run born Survivor to help tank damage as well, i keep a hefty number of Super Stims on me. These used together will keep you alive much longer.
---
- On a side not, my buddy runs a Berserker's as well. His is identical to mine except a few things. He uses bolstering cavalier armor, and also has moving target perk card equipped instead of born Survivor. When he starts taking damage, he runs out of sight to become hidden again. Once hidden, he uses stims to heal up.
---
- I also recommend keeping some phantom devices on you as well and hotkey them. Sometimes things get waaaay out of control and you need retreat. Phantom devices are awesome because they enrage the enemies around you, making them attack each other. This allows you to get away quickly and very efficiently.
---
I really hope this helps you out, id love to see some more Berserker's running around out there. Good luck!
---
... so its not out yet?
---
Yes.
---
Loser
---
Oh. No wonder it didn’t do anything
---
I can’t tell if you’re baiting or have actually had the experience is hoped for.
---
There's too much to explain. But basically it's part of pre-quest for Wastelanders.
---
Get the free trial and honestly you'll have a hard time enjoying the base game once you cross the early stages.
---
This is legit and not some kind of edit?
---
Thanks! 
---
Just trying to help other vault dwellers this holiday season with a little joy! 🎊🎊
---
Ok, thankyou
---
No lol my vendor is right at the front door of my base
---
That would be cool. I never got out there during beta.
---
Get the quest but never do it or turn it in.
---
It's called raiding, you got raided
---
Do you think they'll buy my used decontamination shower? I really need the caps.
---
Just cause you don't notice it doesn't mean it's not happening. Many people are giving confirmed reports. I have run the numbers as well for ny set and they are off.
---
And so if begins. Can someone check how vault 79 is doing?
---
I left this pile months ago.
---
Yes it's legit because of glitched server
---
Does it ever revert back? Like if we just all use melee will we be fine?
---
Glass half full kinda guy...nice!
---
I feel similarly about the govt supply drops.  Some of the gear in them makes sense.  A lot of it really doesn't....
---
On my way there now.
---
You already commented on something else of mine and ill say what ive said there... 
---
Im sorry you feel that way, but i 100 percent disagree with your assesment. 
---
Ive personally had more fun today in NW than ive ever had playing it before. And i liked it before too. 
---
To me it adds new panic. It adds new challenge. Are people going to exploit it? Sure. People suck. Shitty people isnt bethesdas fault. It is the fault of the shitty person. 
---
You say a lot of people are upset about it, in my experience so far today, i disagree. People have been having fun. Not everything is for everyone. But the game mode is far from ruined. 
---
Im sorry you dont like the update, but there isnt anything wrong with it other than you dont like it. 
---
It functions. It functions well, and its added not taken away from the game mode in my eyes.
---
I'd love to stick around for an exhaustive and illuminating discussion about the semantics for what exactly the dickless and lame actions of that little sadsack should be called, but alas, [my fucks runneth dry](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TXK03FHVsHk).
---
Yes. It's a good game, a lot better than it was. It has a lot of issues but is still very enjoyable. 
---
Hmu if you're on PC and I'll show you the ropes. 
---
The Brotherhood of Steel - Hellfire Chapter https://imgur.com/gallery/SbFabp1
---
I suspect that "the technology just isn't there yet"
---
One toon has all Unyielding sneak and all 5 pieces are affected.
---
Second toon has a chest and leg that both work fine. Raiders chest with rad resist and weapon weight reduction...... scout leg with perception and ammo weight reduction.
---
Only thing my working pieces have in common is weight reduction.
---
It’s possible, because holotapes from wastelanders have been added to the game (I found one in silva homestead)
---
Hmm... I don't know... seems legit to me...
---
So maybe only 250 DRWR weapons can be used now - what used to be trash is the only thing that works!
---
It;s not supposed to BE Fallout 4.5 or Fallout 5.  Everyone knew this when it launched with 76 in the name.
---
If your expectation was otherwise, that's unfortunate.  The change was Fallout 4's engine with multiplayer.  We all seemed to understand this.
---
Same content as at launch?  I suppose we disagree.
---
I kept dying like instantly and couldn't figure out why... It's like all my armor and perks dissapeared. I also can't visit anyone in a private world (no option to join or invite to team).
---
LOL
---
Oh this is really cool then! I didn't expect them to do this!
---
Your in a post apocalyptic wasteland, what u expect, u never watched mad Max ? Suck it up man and move on, your seriously gonna quit because someone griefed you for a few mins. Just look at them as the talon company from fallout 3 coming for you because you got such high karma, kinda exciting if you ask me.
---
People being rude in a video game? Welcome to the internet.
---
THEN HAVE I GOT THE BUG FOR YOU!!!!!!!! lol. All the legendary armor is fucked. Doubt anybody will be griefing anytime over the next two days.
---
Huh, interesting. Wonder if it was a mistake or if it’s a sign that Wastelanders is coming
---
Me neither. But then I don’t run a bloodied build so I don’t think I’m much of a target.
---
Oh well that's okay then
---
Location?
---
We said that, like, 9 months ago when we had the whole debacle with bulk junk scrapping.  Nothing seems to change.
---
They respawn after you pick up 180 items.
---
grind nuclear winter 😂
---
Keep on paying for your subs, 1sters!
---
All the more reason for a little more passion...
---
Maybe, I don't remember seeing one in the datamine stuff, but there were two other variants of the tank statue.  🤔
---
Absolutely right.
---
Hey, sheckshy.
---
Yeah true, don't know if they'd do another update before Christmas
---
It's exactly that.  These are the same type of people who would grief in Adventure mode when Survival mode was a thing.  They aren't interested in an actual fight.  They just want to make you mad and steal your junk.
---
no dude look this is how all my matches go.  
---
you spawn  
---
everybody picks a spawn location be it morgantown or flatwoods  
---
morgantown it is  
---
the circle is tiny  
---
you have an option   
---
\- of edge of morgantown goot loot 2 orange chest 3 if lucky. 5 yellow some blues  
---
\- grafton steel 5 orange 5 yellow and lots of blues  
---
\- ingram mansion 2 orange 4 yellow and not so much blues  
---
then you have the orange chest between dam and grafton steel  
---
at grafton 10 players spawn  
---
at ingram 7 players spawn  
---
and all the rest spawn ad morgantown  
---
i spawn at grafton with my team both teammates get killed only 1 person in my team after 1 min in the game.  
---
i kill all players in grafton with my friend with a grenade launcher they seem to be only shooting me with double barrles and pipe pistols sometimes the occasional sniper/lazer. but non of them have armor i took the marine armor and tossed out all the scout i could find.  
---
3 min later 7 players remain  
---
4 min in and the game is over.  
---
i killed them all and the SB hasn't spawned yet.  
---
in a normal match this gamemode lasted 10 min or more and was way more satisfying to win instead of killing a basicly 7  "naked player". it was also more satisfying to figure out spots to bunker down or find people unknowingly of your location and taking the first shot. now it's just who gets to the chest first.
---
Code has changed to get in...no longer "0000000"
---
To be fair, NW isn't "PvP", it's a specific battle royale mode of PvP.
---
Many PvPers dislike the genre: I'd prefer a team deathmatch or king of the hill any day of the week. But outside of PvP at workshops – which people seemingly give up voluntarily especially now that Scrapboxes allow you to hoard Junk that will last you months – there is little chance of a PvP encounter in this game without instigation.
---
The problem, then, is that often griefers are instigating because they know they have some advantage over their victim and will use it. This causes people to put on pacifist modes or avoid PvP entirely, ruining the chances at fair and fun PvP battles for other players.
---
PvP in adventure mode is not balanced by any means, and I was really hoping Wastelanders' November release would also bring along with it a PvE/PvP balance pass on the game. But without fighting actually difficult opponents (players) using the characters many people have built up over the course of their gameplay, there isn't really much to do in the endgame. There are only so many Queens and Encryptids you can do, only so much patience you have for running V94 after completing your strangler heart armor (which crashes your game to boot), only so many slightly-different cosmetic items you care to grind for during a seasonal event.
---
I was not responding to you , first time or again.  Thanx though.
---
Goddamn it now i'm gonna have to unequip and re equip my entire unyielding armor set after each server hop!
---
In NW, it defaults from Diluted/Expired first, Stimpack 2nd, Super/Extra 3rd. I would assume it goes from least effective to most effective in Adventure, too.
---
Honestly anybody with a good set of legendary armor isnt really using there power armor.
---
I just got eight shots out of a freshly 150% repaired explosive harpoon gun. Wtf?
---
even they release wastelanders next year, im now even more concerned, how can this happen, a very basic and big part of the game is not working?!
---
Are you on a team when it happens?
---
I'm going yo try this later I MEAN this is horrible 😭
---
Or firing your gun, or switching your weapons, or checking your stash.
---
Goid news, Everyone! You can respec to bloodied unyielding.
---
Your current build is very close to this players build https://www.reddit.com/r/fo76Guides/comments/c4px93/the_bloodied_stealth_commando_an_end_game_pve_sbq/
---
This time I was. All respawns were removed including team respawns
---
That's pretty crafty, but that was good thinking checking your stats. Unfortunately now this is out there and could spread as a tactic for all greifers.
---
Maybe we should be able to build joint camps in order to provide greater protection. I mean community building is a big part of surving post shtf no one can do it alone. The games meant to rebuild Appalachia but unless we come together to fight off the hordes as a community were just making ourselves targets. Travel in groups and build camps as close as possible to one another. I imagine camps built with neighbors close enough  they share a wall and anyone within this community or accepted as a guest wld be protected by turrets from griefers. Obviously a bunch of other cool shit but no one can play enough consistently to be a guard or even have a guard rotation but it sounds cool.
---
Nice ty for the psa
---
some one bought that wrapped loot bag?! for some odd reason, they do not have any real ingame pictures of it like the rest of items. is it better to see than the bloodied bag?
---
Thought I was going to Rick rolled 😭
---
Maybe people will stop blocking my camp with their tents now
---
But you did respond to me. So maybe lose the condensation?
---
Other than they are investigating it, no.
---
I would expect a hotfix tomorrow.  I can't see them leaving this unfixed with the free play weekend starting on Thursday.
---
&gt;Makes me wonder why they aren't in NW if they love PVP so much
---
Makes me wonder why they play the game at all, actually.  I mean, this game does not do PVP well. It never has. I don't know why any serious PVPer would even want to play this game as it doesn't really offer much. 
---
The resources gained from most workshops are so meager that they aren't even worth fighting over.  A prime example is the ammo factory.   It's the factory that seems to invite the most attacks/ PVP.  And yet what does it really produce? Ammo at an insanely slow rate, a junk extractor, and a lead extractor which also pump out resources way slower than you can get them just harvesting them in the wild.

I run no shotgun perks but my AAE FR DBS is 2 l33t
---
It appears the Responders PA skin will apply to Raider PA! I went to mod my Raider set, and it shows the skin in the menu. (and the preview changes the whole look of the armor pieces)
---
New River Gorge West (the room with raider PA) usually has 5 paint cans and 2+ containers of rat poison.  All good lead sources.
---
Trying zerker might be fun, but I dont have any weapon with that mod saved iirc :')
---
Probably cause Bethesda has acknowledged it. Yet one after another keep posting about it. People know.. Bethesda knows... But it won't stop the karma farmers from trying.
---
I completely understand what they are trying to say but on the new small matches you sometimes don´t get any equipment at all, and even if you get it makes no sense to do a rifle build or shotgun build or explosive build as you will most of the time not get your weapons of choice
---
I´m just saying that this is a different gameplay experience that I don´t see as fun and I have no way to decide if I want a normal match or a small map match
---
We are QA for Bethesda at this point
---
Reloading and swapping weapons negates all legendary armor effects.
---
A build like that is impossible to do without mods.
---
Thats a privacy option they told us about a couple weeks ago,  You now have to invite people to join you.
---
prevents people you may have randomly friended.teamed with months Ago from entering your server without your consent,
---
🤣

---
I hear under armor stats are also disappearing while reloading and the Strangler Heart set bonus doesn't get triggered while reloading too. Zealot seems to be broken too during reloading. Just my 2 cents.
---
gear does matter its the diffrence between getting one shot in the chest vs getting one shot in the head. it's a matter of dmg aswell gear is very important. a combat shotgun outperformce every other dude with a double barrle. a rocket launcher vs a wooden boy. even finding your first automatic rifle vs a dude with a grenade launcher 10 sec into the game. perk card do matter it's the diffrence between one shotting a person and 2 shotting them it's diffrence between throwin 1 vs 2 grenades its diffrence between getting places up high vs surviving a fall. it all adds up even yes the spawn location and where you spawn is key. and if yesterday nobody spawned next an orange chest and today every fucking dude and his mom is forced to spawn next to that orange chest its a diffrence.
---
That's a good point about padding the numbers for the free weekend, but I suspect there will legitimately be plenty of users in NW this weekend, rewards or not, simply because of that.
---
Unless they find a way to screw things up even more than they did today, which isn't impossible.
---
I honestly am questioning if they are going to add another tree with decorations. Or possibly a pack of decorations for the tree, which I hope is more the case.
---
Where is the shop? Can't find it.
---
By the the quest has been in the game for a while, according to the wiki.
---
I'm testing on all Unyielding pieces.
---
Sorry but Bethesda are prepping Charlie for Starfield.
---
But is the mayor still alive?!  Damned machine needs to go.
---
There appears to be a fair amount of new FreeStates stuff.. what are the chances that will be gratis for those of us who already bought a FreeStates pack?
---
Well said m8, personally I think the only way to PvP nowadays is to take unowned workshops and let the action come to you, which it does, it's the only respectable way to do it.
---
Is there going to be a 2XP Period over this holiday?
---
I tested a very specific known previously broken weapon that has 250DR reloading.  It kept its damage thru reloads so it appears now only 250DR works and reload breaks everything else.
---
The level of fail is just beyond any words.
---
Wait, they fixed that and then broke it again? LMAO
---
Its always been "who gets to the chest first" in congested areas. But just like we learned to adapt to that, youll learn to adapt to this. Because after like 6 solid hours of gaming this morning, even my small maps were like 10 min long matches. Maybe we are just getting different player bases? Everyone ive talked to in game loves it. All 17 of em that i talked to. Granted it just dropped, but i am not having any of the issues you are. Or maybe im just not as pissy about losing because im super stoned and its tons of fun. 
---
Im playing on xbox if that helps any.
---
Mine is a full Unyielding set.  Strange how some pieces are affected while others are not.
---
Lol yeah.  I just want everyone to enjoy fo76 as much as I do.  I think one of the main problems in this game is a lack of resources to learn about the game.  Building is a lot more fun when you can really maximize every single trick to create a great camp.
---
I think i have posted this before, there are many players who enjoy pvp and should utilize workshops, my suggestion is simple to post that u want to get two teams together one to take the workshop, build defenses and the other team to try and take the workshop, despite who wins or losses switch no matter the outcome so it is fair. That to me sounds like fun. I would even set ground rules that dont allow camps to be destroyed, etc....seems like a simple fix
---
Future atomic shop cosmetic.
---
They tried to fix this 250 resistance legendary effect and now like 10 other effects are broken... Not only weapon effect anymore, it extends to normal armor, underarmor stats and even the Strangler Heart set bonus :S
---
Hmm, maybe the wild Appalachia PA bundle... if it goes on sale.
---
Yeah been tucked away for some time, no leads so far. Hit a dead end at Camp McClintock
---
Idk anything about how to make mods but yeah, honestly so dumb that companies can get away with unfinished bugged games, should be illegal
---
For extra Atom, or included for those who already bought it?
---
Doesn't work, there is no option to send invite , and the option is supposed to be team only or friends list.
---
I've never seen them do something like this before. Weird
---
The "winter" metal armor paint is actually pretty cool looking.
---
This is literally the most embarrassing thing I've seen a studio allow to happen. The only way this can pass as OK is if someone sabotaged the update as they rage quit their job.
---
I don't know. Do you feel like playing?  We can't answer this for you.
---
Just gave me an excuse to break out the bloodied swing speed reduced weight death claw gauntlet
---
So I get that fo76 is dead now... it's bad. Time to delete.
